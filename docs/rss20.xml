	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Evolutionary Algorithm Enhanced Neural Architecture Search for Text-Independent Speaker Verification. (arXiv:2008.05695v1 [eess.AS])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;State-of-the-art speaker verification models are based on deep learning
techniques, which heavily depend on the handdesigned neural architectures from
experts or engineers. We borrow the idea of neural architecture search(NAS) for
the textindependent speaker verification task. As NAS can learn deep network
structures automatically, we introduce the NAS conception into the well-known
x-vector network. Furthermore, this paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm
enhanced neural architecture search method called Auto-Vector to automatically
discover promising networks for the speaker verification task. The experimental
results demonstrate our NAS-based model outperforms state-of-the-art speaker
verification models.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Neurodegenerative damage reduces firing coherence in a continuous attractor model of grid cells. (arXiv:2008.05591v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Grid cells in the dorsolateral band of the medial entorhinal cortex(dMEC)
display strikingly regular periodic firing patterns on a lattice of positions
in 2-D space. This helps animals to encode relative spatial location without
reference to external cues. The dMEC is damaged in the early stages of
Alzheimer's Disease, which affects navigation ability of a disease victim,
reducing the synaptic density of neurons in the network. Within an established
2-dimensional continuous attractor neural network model of grid cell activity,
we introduce damage parameterized by radius and by the strength of the synaptic
output for neurons in the damaged region. The proportionality of the grid field
flow on the dMEX to the velocity of the model organism is maintained, but when
we examine the coherence of the grid cell firing field in the form of the
Fourier transform (Bragg peaks) of the grid lattice, we find that a wide range
of damage radius and strength induces an incoherent structure with only a
single central peak, adjacent to narrow bands of striped (two additional
peaks), which abut an orthorhombic pattern (four additional peaks), that abuts
the undamaged hexagonal region (six additional peaks). Within the damaged
region, grid cells show no Bragg peaks, and outside the damaged region the
central Bragg peak strength is largely unaffected. There is a re-entrant region
of normal grid firing for very large damage area. We anticipate that the
modified grid cell behavior can be observed in non-invasive fMRI imaging of the
dMEC.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The machinery of the human brain -- analog, probabilistic, embodied -- can be
characterized computationally, but what machinery confers what computational
powers? Any such system can be abstractly cast in terms of two computational
components: a finite state machine carrying out computational steps, whether
via currents, chemistry, or mechanics; plus a set of allowable memory
operations, typically formulated in terms of an information store that can be
read from and written to, whether via synaptic change, state transition, or
recurrent activity. Probing these mechanisms for their information content, we
can capture the difference in computational power that various systems are
capable of. Most human cognitive abilities, from perception to action to
memory, are shared with other species; we seek to characterize those (few)
capabilities that are ubiquitously present among humans and absent from other
species. Three realms of formidable constraints -- a) measurable human
cognitive abilities, b) measurable allometric anatomic brain characteristics,
and c) measurable features of specific automata and formal grammars --
illustrate remarkably sharp restrictions on human abilities, unexpectedly
confining human cognition to a specific class of automata (&quot;nested stack&quot;),
which are markedly below Turing machines.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Comprehensive forecasting based analysis using stacked stateless and stateful Gated Recurrent Unit models. (arXiv:2008.05575v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Photovoltaic power is a renewable source of energy which is highly used in
industries. In economically struggling countries it can be a potential source
of electric energy as other non-renewable resources are already exhausting. Now
if installation of a photovoltaic cell in a region is done prior to research,
it may not provide the desired energy output required for running that region.
Hence forecasting is required which can elicit the output from a particular
region considering its geometrical coordinates, solar parameter like GHI and
weather parameters like temperature and wind speed etc. Our paper explores
forecasting of solar irradiance on four such regions, out of which three is in
West Bengal and one outside to depict with using stacked Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) models. We have checked that stateful stacked gated recurrent unit model
improves the prediction accuracy significantly.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep reinforcement learning is a promising approach to training a dialog
manager, but current methods struggle with the large state and action spaces of
multi-domain dialog systems. Building upon Deep Q-learning from Demonstrations
(DQfD), an algorithm that scores highly in difficult Atari games, we leverage
dialog data to guide the agent to successfully respond to a user's requests. We
make progressively fewer assumptions about the data needed, using labeled,
reduced-labeled, and even unlabeled data to train expert demonstrators. We
introduce Reinforced Fine-tune Learning, an extension to DQfD, enabling us to
overcome the domain gap between the datasets and the environment. Experiments
in a challenging multi-domain dialog system framework validate our approaches,
and get high success rates even when trained on out-of-domain data.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Deep k-NN Defense against Clean-label Data Poisoning Attacks. (arXiv:1909.13374v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13374</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13374</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Targeted clean-label data poisoning is a type of adversarial attack on
machine learning systems in which an adversary injects a few correctly-labeled,
minimally-perturbed samples into the training data, causing a model to
misclassify a particular test sample during inference. Although defenses have
been proposed for general poisoning attacks, no reliable defense for
clean-label attacks has been demonstrated, despite the attacks' effectiveness
and realistic applications. In this work, we propose a simple, yet
highly-effective Deep k-NN defense against both feature collision and convex
polytope clean-label attacks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We demonstrate that our
proposed strategy is able to detect over 99% of poisoned examples in both
attacks and remove them without compromising model performance. Additionally,
through ablation studies, we discover simple guidelines for selecting the value
of k as well as for implementing the Deep k-NN defense on real-world datasets
with class imbalance. Our proposed defense shows that current clean-label
poisoning attack strategies can be annulled, and serves as a strong yet
simple-to-implement baseline defense to test future clean-label poisoning
attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/neeharperi/DeepKNNDefense

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Mish: A Self Regularized Non-Monotonic Activation Function. (arXiv:1908.08681v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08681</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08681</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose $\textit{Mish}$, a novel self-regularized non-monotonic activation
function which can be mathematically defined as: $f(x)=x\tanh(softplus(x))$. As
activation functions play a crucial role in the performance and training
dynamics in neural networks, we validated experimentally on several well-known
benchmarks against the best combinations of architectures and activation
functions. We also observe that data augmentation techniques have a favorable
effect on benchmarks like ImageNet-1k and MS-COCO across multiple
architectures. For example, Mish outperformed Leaky ReLU on YOLOv4 with a
CSP-DarkNet-53 backbone on average precision ($AP_{50}^{val}$) by 2.1$\%$ in
MS-COCO object detection and ReLU on ResNet-50 on ImageNet-1k in Top-1 accuracy
by $\approx$1$\%$ while keeping all other network parameters and
hyperparameters constant. Furthermore, we explore the mathematical formulation
of Mish in relation with the Swish family of functions and propose an intuitive
understanding on how the first derivative behavior may be acting as a
regularizer helping the optimization of deep neural networks. Code is publicly
available at https://github.com/digantamisra98/Mish.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Run-Time Efficient RNN Compression for Inference on Edge Devices. (arXiv:1906.04886v4 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04886</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04886</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recurrent neural networks can be large and compute-intensive, yet many
applications that benefit from RNNs run on small devices with very limited
compute and storage capabilities while still having run-time constraints. As a
result, there is a need for compression techniques that can achieve significant
compression without negatively impacting inference run-time and task accuracy.
This paper explores a new compressed RNN cell implementation called Hybrid
Matrix Decomposition (HMD) that achieves this dual objective. This scheme
divides the weight matrix into two parts - an unconstrained upper half and a
lower half composed of rank-1 blocks. This results in output features where the
upper sub-vector has &quot;richer&quot; features while the lower-sub vector has
&quot;constrained features&quot;. HMD can compress RNNs by a factor of 2-4x while having
a faster run-time than pruning (Zhu &amp;amp;Gupta, 2017) and retaining more model
accuracy than matrix factorization (Grachev et al., 2017). We evaluate this
technique on 5 benchmarks spanning 3 different applications, illustrating its
generality in the domain of edge computing.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Research Models and Gene Augmentation Therapy for CRB1 Retinal Dystrophies</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) are inherited degenerative retinal dystrophies with vision loss that ultimately lead to blindness. Several genes have been shown to be involved in early onset retinal dystrophies, including CRB1 and RPE65. Gene therapy recently became available for young RP patients with variations in the RPE65 gene. Current research programs test adeno-associated viral gene augmentation or editing therapy vectors on various disease models mimicking the disease in patients. These include several animal and emerging human-derived models, such as human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived retinal organoids or hiPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and human donor retinal explants. Variations in the CRB1 gene are a major cause for early onset autosomal recessive RP with patients suffering from visual impairment before their adolescence and for LCA with newborns experiencing severe visual impairment within the first months of life. These patients cannot benefit yet from an available gene therapy treatment. In this review, we will discuss the recent advances, advantages and disadvantages of different CRB1 human and animal retinal degeneration models. In addition, we will describe novel therapeutic tools that have been developed, which could potentially be used for retinal gene augmentation therapy for RP patients with variations in the CRB1 gene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Tyro3 Contributes to Retinal Ganglion Cell Function, Survival and Dendritic Density in the Mouse Retina</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00840</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00840</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the only output neurons of the vertebrate retina, integrating signals from other retinal neurons and transmitting information to the visual centers of the brain. The death of RGCs is a common outcome in many optic neuropathies, such as glaucoma, demyelinating optic neuritis and ischemic optic neuropathy, resulting in visual defects and blindness. There are currently no therapies in clinical use which can prevent RGC death in optic neuropathies; therefore, the identification of new targets for supporting RGC survival is crucial in the development of novel treatments for eye diseases. In this study we identify that the receptor tyrosine kinase, Tyro3, is critical for normal neuronal function in the adult mouse retina. The loss of Tyro3 results in a reduction in photoreceptor and RGC function as measured using electroretinography. The reduction in RGC function was associated with a thinner retinal nerve fiber layer and fewer RGCs. In the central retina, independent of the loss of RGCs, Tyro3 deficiency resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of RGC dendrites in the inner plexiform layer. Our results show that Tyro3 has a novel, previously unidentified role in retinal function, RGC survival and RGC morphology. The Tyro3 pathway could therefore provide an alternative, targetable pathway for RGC protective therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Deep Brain Stimulation Effects on Gait Pattern in Advanced Parkinson’s Disease Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00814</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Gait disturbance accompanies many neurodegenerative diseases; it is characteristic for Parkinson’s disease (PD). Treatment of advanced PD often includes deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus. Regarding gait, previous studies have reported non-significant or conflicting results, possibly related to methodological limitations.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;The objective of this prospective study was to assess the effects of DBS on biomechanical parameters of gait in patients with PD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one patients with advanced PD participated in this prospective study. Gait was examined in all patients using the Zebris FDM-T pressure-sensitive treadmill (Isny, Germany) before DBS implantation and after surgery immediately, further immediately after the start of neurostimulation, and 3 months after neurostimulator activation. We assessed spontaneous gait on a moving treadmill at different speeds. Step length, stance phase of both lower limbs, double-stance phase, and cadence were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In this study, step length increased, allowing the cadence to decrease. Double-stance phase duration, that is, the most sensitive parameter of gait quality and unsteadiness, was reduced, in gait at a speed of 4.5 km/h and in the narrow-based gaits at 1 km/h (tandem gait), which demonstrates improvement.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study suggests positive effects of DBS treatment on gait in PD patients. Improvement was observed in several biomechanical parameters of gait.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor 1 Specifically Labels Seizure-Induced Hippocampal Reactive Neural Stem Cells and Regulates Their Division</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00811</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A population of neural stem cells (NSCs) dwelling in the dentate gyrus (DG) is able to generate neurons throughout adult life in the hippocampus of most mammals. These NSCs generate also astrocytes naturally and are capable of generating oligodendrocytes after gene manipulation. It has been more recently shown that adult hippocampal NSCs after epileptic seizures as well as subventricular zone NSCs after stroke can give rise to reactive astrocytes (RAs). In the hippocampus, the induction of seizures triggers the conversion of NSCs into reactive NSCs (React-NSCs) characterized by a drastic morphological transformation, abnormal migration, and massive activation or entry into the cell cycle to generate more React-NSCs that ultimately differentiate into RAs. In the search for tools to investigate the properties of React-NSCs, we have explored the LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;–green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic line of mice in which hippocampal NSCs are specifically labeled due to the expression of lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). We first addressed the validity of the transgene expression as true marker of LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; expression and then demonstrated how, after seizures, LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-GFP labeled exclusively React-NSCs for several weeks. Then React-NSCs lost LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-GFP expression as neurons of the granule cell layer started to express it. Finally, we used knockout for LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; transgenic mice to show that LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; plays a functional role in the activation of React-NSCs. Thus, we confirmed that LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-GFP expression is a valid tool to study both NSCs and React-NSCs and that the LPA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; pathway could be a target in the intent to preserve NSCs after seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Coordination Dynamics: A Foundation for Understanding Social Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00317</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00317</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans’ interactions with each other or with socially competent machines exhibit lawful coordination patterns at multiple levels of description. According to Coordination Dynamics, such laws specify the flow of coordination states produced by functional synergies of elements (e.g., cells, body parts, brain areas, people…) that are temporarily organized as single, coherent units. These coordinative structures or synergies may be mathematically characterized as informationally coupled self-organizing dynamical systems (Coordination Dynamics). In this paper, we start from a simple foundation, an elemental model system for social interactions, whose behavior has been captured in the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model. We follow a tried and tested scientific method that tightly interweaves experimental neurobehavioral studies and mathematical models. We use this method to further develop a body of empirical research that advances the theory toward more generalized forms. In concordance with this interdisciplinary spirit, the present paper is written both as an overview of relevant advances and as an introduction to its mathematical underpinnings. We demonstrate HKB’s evolution in the context of social coordination along several directions, with its applicability growing to increasingly complex scenarios. In particular, we show that accommodating for symmetry breaking in intrinsic dynamics and coupling, multiscale generalization and adaptation are principal evolutions. We conclude that a general framework for social coordination dynamics is on the horizon, in which models support experiments with hypothesis generation and mechanistic insights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Development of Print-Speech Integration in the Brain of Beginning Readers With Varying Reading Skills</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00289</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning print-speech sound correspondences is a crucial step at the beginning of reading acquisition and often impaired in children with developmental dyslexia. Despite increasing insight into audiovisual language processing, it remains largely unclear how integration of print and speech develops at the neural level during initial learning in the first years of schooling. To investigate this development, 32 healthy, German-speaking children at varying risk for developmental dyslexia (17 typical readers and 15 poor readers) participated in a longitudinal study including behavioral and fMRI measurements in first (T1) and second (T2) grade. We used an implicit audiovisual (AV) non-word target detection task aimed at characterizing differential activation to congruent (AVc) and incongruent (AVi) audiovisual non-word pairs. While children’s brain activation did not differ between AVc and AVi pairs in first grade, an incongruency effect (AVi &amp;gt; AVc) emerged in bilateral inferior temporal and superior frontal gyri in second grade. Of note, pseudoword reading performance improvements with time were associated with the development of the congruency effect (AVc &amp;gt; AVi) in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) from first to second grade. Finally, functional connectivity analyses indicated divergent development and reading expertise dependent coupling from the left occipito-temporal and superior temporal cortex to regions of the default mode (precuneus) and fronto-temporal language networks. Our results suggest that audiovisual integration areas as well as their functional coupling to other language areas and areas of the default mode network show a different development in poor vs. typical readers at varying familial risk for dyslexia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;To examine whether osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with a change in adjusted hippocampal volumes (HpVR: hippocampal/intracranial volume × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) over time among cognitively normal older people.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of OA with HpVR among individuals with normal cognition (NC) from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. At baseline, a total of 372 individuals with NC were included.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In the cross-sectional analyses of baseline data, we did not find a significant relationship between OA and HpVR among individuals with NC. However, in the longitudinal analyses, OA was significantly associated with change in HpVR over time among individuals with NC. Specifically, compared with individuals without OA, those with OA showed a faster decline in HpVR over time when controlling for other potential confounders, including age, educational attainment, gender, and APOE4 genotype.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;OA status was significantly associated with a change in HpVR over time among individuals with NC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>The cerebral cortex and cerebellum both play important roles in sensorimotor processing, however, precise connections between these major brain structures remain elusive. Using anterograde mono-trans-synaptic tracing, we elucidate cerebrocerebellar pathways originating from primary motor, sensory, and association cortex. We confirm a highly organized topography of corticopontine projections in mice; however, we found no corticopontine projections originating from primary auditory cortex and detail several potential extra-pontine cerebrocerebellar pathways. The cerebellar hemispheres were the major target of resulting disynaptic mossy fiber terminals, but we also found at least sparse cerebrocerebellar projections to every lobule of the cerebellum. Notably, projections originating from association cortex resulted in less laterality than primary sensory/motor cortices. Within molecularly defined cerebellar modules we found spatial overlap of mossy fiber terminals, originating from functionally distinct cortical areas, within crus I, paraflocculus, and vermal regions IV/V and VI - highlighting these regions as potential hubs for multimodal cortical influence.</description>

	<title>eLife: ALKBH7 mediates necrosis via rewiring of glyoxal metabolism</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58573</link>
	<description>Alkb homolog 7 (ALKBH7) is a mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate dioxygenase required for DNA alkylation induced necrosis, but its function and substrates remain unclear. Herein we show ALKBH7 regulates dialdehyde metabolism, which impacts the cardiac response to ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Using a multi-omics approach, we find no evidence ALKBH7 functions as a prolyl-hydroxylase, but we do find &lt;i&gt;Alkbh7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice have elevated glyoxalase I (GLO-1), a dialdehyde detoxifying enzyme. Metabolic pathways related to the glycolytic by-product methylglyoxal (MGO) are rewired in &lt;i&gt;Alkbh7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice, along with elevated levels of MGO protein adducts. Despite greater glycative stress, hearts from &lt;i&gt;Alkbh7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice are protected against IR injury, in a manner blocked by GLO-1 inhibition. Integrating these observations, we propose ALKBH7 regulates glyoxal metabolism, and that protection against necrosis and cardiac IR injury bought on by ALKBH7 deficiency originates from the signaling response to elevated MGO stress.</description>

	<description>Intracellular transport undergoes remodeling upon cell differentiation, which involves cell type-specific regulators. Bone morphogenetic protein 2-inducible kinase (BMP2K) has been potentially implicated in endocytosis and cell differentiation but its molecular functions remained unknown. We discovered that its longer (L) and shorter (S) splicing variants regulate erythroid differentiation in a manner unexplainable by their involvement in AP-2 adaptor phosphorylation and endocytosis. However, both variants interact with SEC16A and could localize to the juxtanuclear secretory compartment. Variant-specific depletion approach showed that BMP2K isoforms constitute a BMP2K-L/S regulatory system that controls the distribution of SEC16A and SEC24B as well as SEC31A abundance at COPII assemblies. Finally, we found L to promote and S to restrict autophagic degradation and erythroid differentiation. Hence, we propose that BMP2K-L and BMP2K-S differentially regulate abundance and distribution of COPII assemblies as well as autophagy, possibly thereby fine-tuning erythroid differentiation.</description>

	<description>Receptor endocytosis is important for signal activation, transduction, and deactivation. However, how a receptor interprets conflicting signals to adjust cellular output is not clearly understood. Using genetic, cell biological, and pharmacological approaches, we report here that ERECTA-LIKE1 (ERL1), the major receptor restricting plant stomatal differentiation, undergoes dynamic subcellular behaviors in response to different EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR (EPF) peptides. Activation of ERL1 by EPF1 induces rapid ERL1 internalization via multivesicular bodies/late endosomes to vacuolar degradation, whereas ERL1 constitutively internalizes in the absence of EPF1. The co-receptor, TOO MANY MOUTHS is essential for ERL1 internalization induced by EPF1 but not by EPFL6. The peptide antagonist, Stomagen, triggers retention of ERL1 in the endoplasmic reticulum, likely coupled with reduced endocytosis. In contrast, the dominant-negative ERL1 remained dysfunctional in ligand-induced subcellular trafficking. Our study elucidates that multiple related yet unique peptides specify cell fate by deploying the differential subcellular dynamics of a single receptor.</description>

	<description>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important but difficult to study human pathogen. Most basics of the hepadnaviral life-cycle were unraveled using duck HBV (DHBV) as a model although DHBV has a capsid protein (CP) comprising ~260 rather than ~180 amino acids. Here we present high-resolution structures of several DHBV capsid-like particles (CLPs) determined by electron cryo-microscopy. As for HBV, DHBV CLPs consist of a dimeric a-helical frame-work with protruding spikes at the dimer interface. A fundamental new feature is a ~45 amino acid proline-rich extension in each monomer replacing the tip of the spikes in HBV CP. In vitro, folding of the extension takes months, implying a catalyzed process &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. DHBc variants lacking a folding-proficient extension produced regular CLPs in bacteria but failed to form stable nucleocapsids in hepatoma cells. We propose that the extension domain acts as a conformational switch with differential response options during viral infection.</description>

	<title>eLife: Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier is required for optimal brown fat thermogenesis</title>

	<description>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is composed of thermogenic cells that convert chemical energy into heat to help maintain a constant body temperature and counteract metabolic disease in mammals. The metabolic adaptations required for thermogenesis are not fully understood. Here we explore how steady state levels of metabolic intermediates are altered in brown adipose tissue in response to cold exposure. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed changes in pathways involved in amino acid, glucose, and TCA cycle metabolism. Using isotopic labeling experiments, we found that activated brown adipocytes increased labeling of pyruvate and TCA cycle intermediates from U&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-glucose. Although glucose oxidation has been implicated as being essential for thermogenesis, its requirement for efficient thermogenesis has not been directly tested. Here we show that mitochondrial pyruvate uptake is essential for optimal thermogenesis, as conditional deletion of &lt;i&gt;Mpc1&lt;/i&gt; in brown adipocytes leads to impaired cold adaptation. Isotopic labeling experiments using U&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-glucose showed that loss of MPC1 led to impaired labeling of TCA cycle intermediates, while labeling of glycolytic intermediates was unchanged. Loss of MPC1 in BAT increased 3-hydroxybutyrate levels in blood and BAT in response to the cold, suggesting that ketogenesis provides an alternative fuel source to compensate for impaired mitochondrial oxidation of cytosolic pyruvate. Collectively, these studies highlight that complete glucose oxidation is essential for optimal brown fat thermogenesis.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Genotype networks of 80 quantitative &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; phenotypes reveal phenotypic evolvability despite pervasive epistasis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriel Schweizer, Andreas Wagner&lt;/p&gt;

We study the genotype-phenotype maps of 80 quantitative phenotypes in the model plant &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, by representing the genotypes affecting each phenotype as a genotype network. In such a network, each vertex or node corresponds to an individual’s genotype at all those genomic loci that affect a given phenotype. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the associated genotypes differ in exactly one nucleotide. The 80 genotype networks we analyze are based on data from genome-wide association studies of 199 &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thaliana&lt;/i&gt; accessions. They form connected graphs whose topography differs substantially among phenotypes. We focus our analysis on the incidence of epistasis (non-additive interactions among mutations) because a high incidence of epistasis can reduce the accessibility of evolutionary paths towards high or low phenotypic values. We find epistatic interactions in 67 phenotypes, and in 51 phenotypes every pairwise mutant interaction is epistatic. Moreover, we find phenotype-specific differences in the fraction of accessible mutational paths to maximum phenotypic values. However, even though epistasis affects the accessibility of maximum phenotypic values, the relationships between genotypic and phenotypic change of our analyzed phenotypes are sufficiently smooth that some evolutionary paths remain accessible for most phenotypes, even where epistasis is pervasive. The genotype network representation we use can complement existing approaches to understand the genetic architecture of polygenic traits in many different organisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OvgRp6w03Vg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

To address this question, the authors use a simple model for cellular information processing, using parameter values determined from published data sets. Parameter-free predictions of the model capture qualitative trends of cell-to-cell variability and the inferred information processing capacity found in experiments.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Single-channel EEG features during n-back task correlate with working memory load. (arXiv:2008.04987v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04987</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04987</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Working Memory (WM) load is an important cognitive feature that is highly
correlated with mental effort. Several neurological biomarkers such as theta
power and mid-frontal activity show increased activity with increasing WM load.
Such correlations often break down in cognitively impaired individuals, making
WM load biomarkers a valuable tool for the detection of cognitive impairment.
However, most studies have used a multi-channel EEG or an fMRI, which are not
massively accessible. In the present study, we evaluate the ability of novel
features extracted from a single-channel EEG located on the forehead, to serve
as markers of WM load. We employed the widely used n-back task to manipulate WM
load. Fourteen participants performed the n-back task while their brain
activity was recorded with the Neurosteer inc Aurora EEG device. The results
showed that the activity of the newly introduced features increased with WM
load, similar to the theta band, but exhibited higher sensitivity to finer WM
load changes. These more sensitive biomarkers of WM load are a promising tool
for mass screening of mild cognitive impairment.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Control for Multifunctionality: Bioinspired Control Based on Feeding in Aplysia californica. (arXiv:2008.04978v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04978</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04978</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animals exhibit remarkable feats of behavioral flexibility and
multifunctional control that remain challenging for robotic systems. The neural
and morphological basis of multifunctionality in animals can provide a source
of bio-inspiration for robotic controllers. However, many existing approaches
to modeling biological neural networks rely on computationally expensive models
and tend to focus solely on the nervous system, often neglecting the
biomechanics of the periphery. As a consequence, while these models are
excellent tools for neuroscience, they fail to predict functional behavior in
real time, which is a critical capability for robotic control. To meet the need
for real-time multifunctional control, we have developed a hybrid Boolean model
framework capable of modeling neural bursting activity and simple biomechanics
at speeds faster than real time. Using this approach, we present a
multifunctional model of Aplysia californica feeding that qualitatively
reproduces three key feeding behaviors (biting, swallowing, and rejection),
demonstrates behavioral switching in response to external sensory cues, and
incorporates both known neural connectivity and a simple bioinspired mechanical
model of the feeding apparatus. We demonstrate that the model can be used for
formulating testable hypotheses and discuss the implications of this approach
for robotic control and neuroscience.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04940</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The relationship between complex, brain oscillations and the dynamics of
individual neurons is poorly understood. Here we utilize Maximum Caliber, a
dynamical inference principle, to build a minimal, yet general model of the
collective (mean-field) dynamics of large populations of neurons. In agreement
with previous experimental observations, we describe a simple, testable
mechanism, involving only a single type of neuron, by which many of these
complex oscillatory patterns may emerge. Our model predicts that the refractory
period of neurons, which has been previously neglected, is essential for these
behaviors.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Temporal-Coded Deep Spiking Neural Network with Easy Training and Robust Performance. (arXiv:1909.10837v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10837</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10837</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural network (SNN) is interesting both theoretically and
practically because of its strong bio-inspiration nature and potentially
outstanding energy efficiency. Unfortunately, its development has fallen far
behind the conventional deep neural network (DNN), mainly because of difficult
training and lack of widely accepted hardware experiment platforms. In this
paper, we show that a deep temporal-coded SNN can be trained easily and
directly over the benchmark datasets CIFAR10 and ImageNet, with testing
accuracy within 1% of the DNN of equivalent size and architecture. Training
becomes similar to DNN thanks to the closed-form solution to the spiking
waveform dynamics. Considering that SNNs should be implemented in practical
neuromorphic hardwares, we train the deep SNN with weights quantized to 8, 4, 2
bits and with weights perturbed by random noise to demonstrate its robustness
in practical applications. In addition, we develop a phase-domain signal
processing circuit schematic to implement our spiking neuron with 90% gain of
energy efficiency over existing work. This paper demonstrates that the
temporal-coded deep SNN is feasible for applications with high performance and
high energy efficient.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Renewed Perspectives on the Deep Roots and Broad Distribution of Animal Consciousness</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of neurobiologists have long abandoned the Cartesian view of non-human animals as unconscious automatons—acknowledging instead the high likelihood that mammals and birds have mental experiences akin to subjective consciousness. Several lines of evidence are now extending those limits to all vertebrates and even some invertebrates, though graded in degrees as argued originally by Darwin, correlated with the complexity of the animal’s brain. A principal argument for this view is that the function of consciousness is to promote the survival of an animal—especially one actively moving about—in the face of dynamic changes and real-time contingencies. Cognitive ecologists point to the unique features of each animal’s environment and the specific behavioral capabilities that different environments invoke, thereby suggesting that consciousness must take on a great variety of forms, many of which differ substantially from human subjective experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Cortico-Striatal Oscillations Are Correlated to Motor Activity Levels in Both Physiological and Parkinsonian Conditions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00056</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00056</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Oscillatory neural activity in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical (CBGTC) loop is associated with the motor state of a subject, but also with the availability of modulatory neurotransmitters. For example, increased low-frequency oscillations in Parkinson’s disease (PD) are related to decreased levels of dopamine and have been proposed as biomarkers to adapt and optimize therapeutic interventions, such as deep brain stimulation. Using neural oscillations as biomarkers require differentiating between changes in oscillatory patterns associated with parkinsonism vs. those related to a subject’s motor state. To address this point, we studied the correlation between neural oscillatory activity in the motor cortex and striatum and varying degrees of motor activity under normal and parkinsonian conditions. Using rats with bilateral or unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions as PD models, we correlated the motion index (MI)—a measure based on the physical acceleration of the head of rats—to the local field potential (LFP) oscillatory power in the 1–80 Hz range. In motor cortices and striata, we observed a robust correlation between the motion index and the oscillatory power in two main broad frequency ranges: a low-frequency range [5.0–26.5 Hz] was negatively correlated to motor activity, whereas a high-frequency range [35.0–79.9 Hz] was positively correlated. We observed these correlations in both normal and parkinsonian conditions. In addition to these general changes in broad-band power, we observed a more restricted narrow-band oscillation [25–40 Hz] in dopamine-denervated hemispheres. This oscillation, which seems to be selective to the parkinsonian state, showed a linear frequency dependence on the concurrent motor activity level. We conclude that, independently of the parkinsonian condition, changes in broad-band oscillatory activities of cortico-basal ganglia networks (including changes in the relative power of low- and high-frequency bands) are closely correlated to ongoing motions, most likely reflecting he operations of these neural circuits to control motor activity. Hence, biomarkers based on neural oscillations should focus on specific features, such as narrow frequency bands, to allow differentiation between parkinsonian states and physiological movement-dependent circuit modulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Fixel Based Analysis Reveals Atypical White Matter Micro- and Macrostructure in Adults With Autism Spectrum Disorder: An Investigation of the Role of Biological Sex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00040</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Atypical white matter (WM) microstructure is commonly implicated in the neuropathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Fixel based analysis (FBA), at the cutting-edge of diffusion-weighted imaging, can account for crossing WM fibers and can provide indices of both WM micro- and macrostructure. We applied FBA to investigate WM structure between 25 (12 males, 13 females) adults with ASD and 24 (12 males, 12 females) matched controls. As the role of biological sex on the neuropathophysiology of ASD is of increasing interest, this was also explored. There were no significant differences in WM micro- or macrostructure between adults with ASD and matched healthy controls. When data were stratified by sex, females with ASD had reduced fiber density and cross-section (FDC), a combined metric comprised of micro- and macrostructural measures, in the corpus callosum, a finding not detected between the male sub-groups. We conclude that micro- and macrostructural WM aberrations are present in ASD, and may be influenced by biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Retinal Functional and Structural Changes in the 5xFAD Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00862</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the aberrant deposition of protein in the brain and is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Increasingly, there have been reports of the presence of these protein hallmarks in the retina. In this study, we assayed the retina of 5xFAD mice, a transgenic model of amyloid deposition known to exhibit dementia-like symptoms with age. Using OCT, we found that the retinal nerve fiber layer was thinner in 5xFAD at 6, 12, and 17 months of age compared with wild-type littermates, but the inner plexiform layer was thicker at 6 months old. Retinal function showed reduced ganglion cell responses to light in 5xFAD at 6, 12, and 17 months of age. This functional loss was observed in the outer retina at 17 months of age but not in younger mice. We showed using immunohistochemistry and ELISA that soluble and insoluble amyloid was present in the retina and brain at all ages. In conclusion, we report that amyloid is present in brain and retina of 5xFAD mice and that the pattern of neuronal dysfunction occurs in the inner retina at the early ages and progresses to encompass the outer retina with age. This implies that the inner retina is more sensitive to amyloid changes in early disease and that the outer retina is also affected with disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Conductive Hearing Loss Aggravates Memory Decline in Alzheimer Model Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The study of cognitive impairment associated with hearing loss has recently garnered considerable interest. Epidemiological data have demonstrated that hearing loss is a risk factor for cognitive decline as a result of aging. However, no previous study has examined the effect of hearing loss in patients with cognitive problems such as Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, we investigated the effect of conductive hearing loss in an Alzheimer’s mouse model. Positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to evaluate changes in glucose metabolism and gray matter concentrations in the 5xFAD Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) transgenic mouse model with and without conductive hearing loss (HL). Conductive hearing loss was induced using chronic perforation of the tympanic membrane. Behavioral data from the Y-maze and passive avoidance tests revealed greater memory deficits in the AD with HL (AD-HL) group than in the AD group. Following induction of hearing loss, lower cerebral glucose metabolism in the frontal association cortex was observed in the AD-HL group than in the AD group. Although lower glucose metabolism in the hippocampus and cerebellum was found in the AD-HL group than in the AD group at 3 months, the gray matter concentrations in these regions were not significantly different between the groups. Furthermore, the gray matter concentrations in the simple lobule, cingulate/retrosplenial cortex, substantia nigra, retrosigmoid nucleus, medial geniculate nucleus, and anterior pretectal nucleus at 7 months were significantly lower in the AD-HL group than in the AD group. Taken together, these results indicate that even partial hearing loss can aggravate memory impairment in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Evaluation of Glymphatic System Using Diffusion MR Technique in T2DM Cases</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00300</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: We aimed to evaluate the activity of the human glymphatic system in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using diffusion tensor image analysis along with the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Diffusion tensor images were acquired to calculate the diffusivities in the direction of the x-axis (right-to-left; Dx), y-axis (anterior-to-posterior; Dy), and z-axis (inferior-to-superior; Dz) of the plane of the lateral ventricle body in 20 patients with type 2 diabetes and 10 people in a control group. We evaluated the diffusivity along with the perivascular spaces, as well as the projection fibers and association fibers, separately. The analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS-index) was defined as the mean (Dxpro, Dypro)/mean (Dypro, Dzasc), where the Dxpro and Dxasc were the Dx values in the projection and association fiber areas, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: There were significant differences in diffusivity along the projection fibers and the association fibers among the groups. The significant differences among the groups along the perivascular spaces, shown as the ALPS-index and medical history of T2DM, indicating lower water diffusivity along the perivascular space concerning type 2 diabetes severity, was also observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Lower diffusivity along the perivascular space on DTI-APLS can reflect impairment of the glymphatic system in T2DM. This study showed that the activity of the glymphatic system could be evaluated by diffusion tensor image analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Interactions Between Motor Thalamic Field Potentials and Single-Unit Spiking Are Correlated With Behavior in Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00052</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00052</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Field potential (FP) oscillations are believed to coordinate brain activity over large spatiotemporal scales, with specific features (e.g., phase and power) in discrete frequency bands correlated with motor output. Furthermore, complex correlations between oscillations in distinct frequency bands (phase-amplitude, amplitude-amplitude, and phase-phase coupling) are commonly observed. However, the mechanisms underlying FP-behavior correlations and cross-frequency coupling remain unknown. The thalamus plays a central role in generating many circuit-level neural oscillations, and single-unit activity in motor thalamus (Mthal) is correlated with behavioral output. We, therefore, hypothesized that motor thalamic spiking coordinates motor system FPs and underlies FP-behavior correlations. To investigate this possibility, we recorded wideband motor thalamic (Mthal) electrophysiology as healthy rats performed a two-alternative forced-choice task. Delta (1–4 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz), low gamma (30–70 Hz), and high gamma (70–200 Hz) power were strongly modulated by task performance. As in the cortex, the delta phase was correlated with beta/low gamma power and reaction time. Most interestingly, subpopulations of Mthal neurons defined by their relationship to the behavior exhibited distinct relationships with FP features. Specifically, neurons whose activity was correlated with action selection and movement speed were entrained to delta oscillations. Furthermore, changes in their activity anticipated power fluctuations in beta/low gamma bands. These complex relationships suggest mechanisms for commonly observed FP-FP and spike-FP correlations, as well as subcortical influences on motor output.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: In silico Hierarchical Clustering of Neuronal Populations in the Rat Ventral Tegmental Area Based on Extracellular Electrophysiological Properties</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00051</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00051</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a heterogeneous brain region, containing different neuronal populations. During in vivo recordings, electrophysiological characteristics are classically used to distinguish the different populations. However, the VTA is also considered as a region harboring neurons with heterogeneous properties. In the present study, we aimed to classify VTA neurons using in silico approaches, in an attempt to determine if homogeneous populations could be extracted. Thus, we recorded 291 VTA neurons during in vivo extracellular recordings in anesthetized rats. Initially, 22 neurons with high firing rates (&amp;gt;10 Hz) and short-lasting action potentials (AP) were considered as a separate subpopulation, in light of previous studies. To segregate the remaining 269 neurons, presumably dopaminergic (DA), we performed in silico analyses, using a combination of different electrophysiological parameters. These parameters included: (1) firing rate; (2) firing rate coefficient of variation (CV); (3) percentage of spikes in a burst; (4) AP duration; (5) Δt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; duration (i.e., time from initiation of depolarization until end of repolarization); and (6) presence of a notched AP waveform. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed two neuronal populations that differed in their bursting activities. The largest population presented low bursting activities (&amp;lt;17.5% of total spikes in burst), while the remaining neurons presented higher bursting activities (&amp;gt;17.5%). Within non-high-firing neurons, a large heterogeneity was noted concerning AP characteristics. In conclusion, this analysis based on conventional electrophysiological criteria clustered two subpopulations of putative DA VTA neurons that are distinguishable by their firing patterns (firing rates and bursting activities) but not their AP properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Elamipretide Attenuates Pyroptosis and Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders in Aged Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00251</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00251</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pyroptosis is a recently characterized inflammatory form of programmed cell death that is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND). Elamipretide (SS-31), a mitochondrial-targeted peptide with multiple pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory activity, has been demonstrated to protect against many neurological diseases. However, the effect of elamipretide on pyroptosis in PND has not been studied. We established an animal model of PND by performing an exploratory laparotomy on mice under isoflurane anesthesia and examined the effects of elamipretide on cognitive function, synaptic integrity, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial function, and signaling controlling pyroptosis. Our results showed that anesthesia and surgery caused mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal morphology, activation of canonicalnod-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-caspase-1 dependent pyroptosis, and downregulation of synaptic integrity-related proteins in the hippocampus in aged mice, thus leading to learning and memory deficits in behavioral tests. Remarkably, treatment with the mitochondrial-targeted peptide elamipretide not only had protective effects against mitochondrial dysfunction but also attenuated surgery-induced pyroptosis and cognitive deficits. Our results provide a promising strategy for the treatment of PND involving mitochondrial dysfunction and pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Age-related chronic inflammatory activation of microglia and their dysfunction are observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, and the potential contributions of these dysfunctional cells to neurodegeneration have been demonstrated recently. The housekeeping and defensive functions of microglia, such as surveying the brain parenchyma and phagocytosis of neuronal debris after injury, are important for brain homeostasis and immunity. During neurodegenerative diseases, loss of these functions can promote disease pathology by producing proinflammatory cytokines and increasing oxidative stress, which can exaggerate the ongoing neuroinflammation. A recent surge in microglial research has unraveled myriads of microglial phenotypes associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases, in addition to the conventional M1/M2 paradigm. Each of these phenotypes can be characterized by distinct transcriptional profiles as well as altered metabolism, migration, and phagocytosis characteristics. Mutations in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2) and granulin (GRN) are associated with various neurodegenerative diseases, and these genes are dysregulated in the majority of recently identified microglial phenotypes. These genes act as checkpoint regulators and maintain microglial inflammatory fitness, principally through metabolic modulation. Dysfunctional microglia typically show mitochondrial deficits, glycolysis elevation, and lipid droplet accumulation, which results in reduced migration and phagocytosis and increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion and reactive oxygen species release. In this mini-review article, we discuss the existing data regarding metabolic perturbations in dysfunctional microglia and their documented associations with neurodegeneration, highlighting how aging-induced chronic microglial activation alters microglial bioenergetics, leading to impaired homeostatic and housekeeping functions. Dysfunctional microglia initiate or exacerbate neurodegeneration, and key pathways involved in the dysfunctional processes, including metabolism, may represent potential intervention targets for correcting imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are produced during abnormal and normal physiological conditions. Understanding the expression profile of microRNA (miRNA) in plasma-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) and their roles in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) that cause cerebral vasospasm (CVS) is imperative.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Sprague Dawley rats (250–300 g) were allocated to sham or SAH groups established using endovascular perforation method. miRNA expression profiles of plasma sEVs in both groups (each n = 4) were evaluated using next-generation sequencing (NGS).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There were 142 microRNAs (miRNAs) significantly expressed differently between the two groups, of which 73 were up-regulated while 69 were down-regulated in SAH sEVs compared with those of sham (p &amp;lt; 0.05; fold change ≥ 2). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses of differently expressed (DE) miRNAs revealed signaling pathways and target genes (TGs) in the SAH group. rno-miR-185-5p, rno-miR-103-3p, rno-miR-15b-3p, rno-miR-93-5p, and rno-miR-98-5p were the top five most up-regulated sEVs miRNAs.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that miRNA can be selectively packaged into sEVs under SAH, and this could help develop potential targets for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of CVS after this condition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: CCR2 Inhibition Reduces Neurotoxic Microglia Activation Phenotype After Japanese Encephalitis Viral Infection</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Controlling the proinflammatory response of microglia by targeting chemokines (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) could be an important therapeutic approach for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. Here, through JEV infection to BV2 microglia and young BALB/c mice, we investigated that CCR2 is highly upregulated after JEV infection and plays a key role in determining microglia activation phenotype and associated with neurotoxic proinflammatory mediators of TNF-α and IFNγ. In addition, we found JEV infection to BV2 microglia causes an increase in microglial proliferation and cell body area at day 1 and day 3. Using the agonist molecule of CCR2 inhibition; RS102895, significantly reduces microglia reactive phenotype and nitric oxide production. Further, to define the role of CCR2 in functional responses of microglia and their activation phenotype, we performed in vitro cell scratch functional assay and ImageJ analysis. When compared with control, microglia cells showed a significant increase in elongated or rod-like activated phenotype in JEV-infected cells at 24 h post-infection and CCR2 inhibition significantly reduced the elongated activation phenotype induced by JEV infection, suggesting that CCR2 acts as a critical regulator for microglia activation phenotype after JEV infection. We found that JEV-infected mice treated with RS102895 had less microglia activation and reduced mRNA expression of CCR2 and proinflammatory mediators such as IFN-γ in cortical tissue. Collectively, our data indicate that CCR2 drives reactive phenotype of microglia and its inhibition reduces microglia activation and neurotoxic proinflammatory mediators after JEV infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chromosomal abnormality causes congenital and acquired intractable diseases. In general, there are no fundamental treatments for these diseases. To establish platforms to develop therapeutics for these diseases, patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are highly beneficial. To study abnormal chromosomal diseases, it is often hard to apply animal disease models because the chromosomal structures are variable among species. It is also difficult to apply simple genome editing technology in cells or individuals for abnormal chromosomes. Thus, these patient-derived iPSCs have advantages for developing disease models with multiple cell and tissue types, which are typically seen in the symptoms of abnormal chromosomal diseases. Here we review the studies of patient-derived iPSCs carrying abnormal chromosomes, focusing on pluripotent state and neural lineages. We also discuss the technological advances in chromosomal manipulations toward establishing experimental models and future therapeutics. Patient-derived iPSCs carrying chromosomal abnormality are valuable as cellular bioresources since they can indefinitely proliferate and provide various cell types. Also, these findings and technologies are important for future studies on elucidating pathogenesis, drug development, regenerative medicine, and gene therapy for abnormal chromosomal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Microglia Dystrophy Following Binge-Like Alcohol Exposure in Adolescent and Adult Male Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00052</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are dynamic cells that have roles in neuronal plasticity as well as in recovery responses following neuronal injury. Although many hypothesize that hyperactivation of microglia contributes to alcohol-induced neuropathology, in other neurodegenerative conditions disruption of normal microglial processes also contributes to neuronal loss, particularly as microglia become dystrophic or dysfunctional. Based on the observation of a striking, abnormal morphology in microglia during binge-like ethanol exposure, the present study investigated the impact of excessive ethanol exposure on microglia number and dystrophic morphology in a model of alcohol dependence that includes neurodegeneration in both adult and adolescent rats. Following 2- and 4-day binge ethanol exposure, the number of microglia was decreased in the hippocampus and the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices of both adult and adolescent rats. Furthermore, a significant number of microglia with a dystrophic morphology were observed in ethanol-exposed tissue, accompanied by a significant decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus. Together these findings suggest another means by which microglia may contribute to alcohol-induced neurodegeneration, specifically dystrophic microglia and/or loss of microglia may disrupt homeostatic and recovery mechanisms. These results demonstrate that microglia also degenerate with excessive alcohol exposure, which has important implications for understanding the role of microglia—and specifically their contributions to plasticity and neuronal survival—in neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Transcriptome Analyses in BV2 Microglial Cells Following Treatment With Amino-Terminal Fragments of Apolipoprotein E</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that harboring the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele represents the single greatest risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the exact mechanism by which ApoE4 contributes to disease progression remains unknown. Recently, we demonstrated that a 151 amino-terminal fragment of ApoE4 (nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt;) localizes within the nucleus of microglia in the human AD brain and traffics to the nucleus causing toxicity in BV2 microglia cells. In the present study, we examined in detail what genes may be affected following treatment by nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt;. Transcriptome analyses in BV2 microglial cells following sublethal treatment with nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; revealed the upregulation of almost 4,000 genes, with 20 of these genes upregulated 182- to 715-fold compared to untreated control cells. The majority of these 20 genes play a role in the immune response and polarization toward microglial M1 activation. As a control, an identical nApoE3&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; fragment that differed by a single amino acid at position 112 (Cys→Arg) was tested and produced a similar albeit lower level of upregulation of an identical set of genes. In this manner, enriched pathways upregulated by nApoE3&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; and nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; following exogenous treatment included Toll receptor signaling, chemokine/cytokine signaling and apoptosis signaling. There were unique genes differentially expressed by at least two-fold for either fragment. For nApoE3&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt;, these included 16 times as many genes, many of which are involved in physiological functions within microglia. For nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt;, on the other hand the number genes uniquely upregulated was significantly lower, with many of the top upregulated genes having unknown functions. Taken together, our results suggest that while nApoE3&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; may serve a more physiological role in microglia, nApoE4&lt;sub&gt;1–151&lt;/sub&gt; may activate genes that contribute to disease inflammation associated with AD. These data support the hypothesis that the link between harboring the APOE4 allele and dementia risk could be enhanced inflammation through activation of microglia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Nicotinamide, a Poly [ADP-Ribose] Polymerase 1 (PARP-1) Inhibitor, as an Adjunctive Therapy for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00255</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) is a key component in the cellular production of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) and has long been associated with neuronal development, survival and death. Numerous data suggest that nicotinamide may offer therapeutic benefits in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Beyond its effect in NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; stores, nicotinamide is an inhibitor of Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1), an enzyme with multiple cellular functions, including regulation of cell death, energy/metabolism and inflammatory response. PARP-1 functions as a DNA repair enzyme but under intense DNA damage depletes the cell of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and ATP and leads to a non-apoptotic type of cell death called Parthanatos, which has been associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; availability might potentially improve mitochondrial function, which is severely impaired in AD. PARP-1 inhibition may also exert a protective effect against neurodegeneration by its action to diminish neuroinflammation and microglial activation which are also implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Here we discuss the evidence supporting the use of nicotinamide as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of early stages of AD based on the inhibitory effect of nicotinamide on PARP-1 activity. The data support evaluating nicotinamide as an adjunctive treatment for AD at early stages of the disease not only to increase NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; stores but as a PARP-1 inhibitor, raising the hypothesis that other PARP-1 inhibitors – drugs that are already approved for breast cancer treatment – might be explored for the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Distinct Relationship Between Cognitive Flexibility and White Matter Integrity in Individuals at Risk of Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00250</guid>

	<description>Background and Objective&lt;p&gt;Executive dysfunction is the most common cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD), occurring even in its early stages. In our study, we applied diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate white matter integrity and its association with a specific executive function such as cognitive flexibility in individuals with risk factors for PD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We examined 50 individuals with risk factors for developing PD and 24 healthy controls from the TREND (Tübinger Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration) study including neuropsychological evaluation and DTI. Cognitive flexibility was assessed using the trail making test (TMT). Tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) were employed to assess white matter abnormalities and their correlation with cognitive flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;TMT performance correlated with mean and axial diffusivity in several white matter regions, predominantly in the frontoparietal white matter. These effects were stronger in PD risk persons (PD-RP) than in controls as evidenced by a significant group interaction. White matter integrity and TMT performance did not significantly differ across groups.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Based on our results, PD-RP do no exhibit white matter changes or impaired cognitive flexibility. However, specific executive functions in PD-RP are more related to white matter alterations than in healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Attention and Functional Connectivity Among Patients With Early-Stage Subcortical Ischemic Vascular Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00239</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00239</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The current study compared attention profiles and functional connectivity of frontal regions in patients with early-stage subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Twenty patients with SIVD, 32 patients with AD, and 23 subjects with normal cognition (NC) received cognition and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) evaluations. The Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) was used to assess global cognition, and simple attention, processing speed, divided attention, and vigilance/sustained attention were evaluated using the Digit Span Forward, Trail Making Test, Symbol Digit Modality Test, and Conners Continuous Performance Test, respectively. Voxel-based regional homogeneity (ReHo) derived from rs-fMRI data was analyzed to identify significant clusters, which were further correlated with attention profiles. Although the patients with SIVD and AD had comparable global cognitive ability, those with SIVD exhibited worse divided attention and vigilance/sustained attention than those with AD. Compared with the NC group, the patients with SIVD exhibited decreased ReHo within the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and left anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG), whereas the patients with AD exhibited increased ReHo within the right orbital part of frontal regions. Correlations between these three clusters with attention exhibited distinct patterns according to the dementia subtype, as did attention indices with significance in predicting global cognition. In summary, our study suggested that worse attention performance was associated with functional disconnection within the frontal regions among patients with SIVD than in those with AD. Frontal functional disconnection may underlie the pathogenesis responsible for defective divided attention, vigilance/sustained attention, and notable within-group variations identified in SIVD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Early analysis of the Australian COVID-19 epidemic</title>

	<description>As of 1 May 2020, there had been 6,808 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Australia. Of these, 98 had died from the disease. The epidemic had been in decline since mid-March, with 308 cases confirmed nationally since 14 April. This suggests that the collective actions of the Australian public and government authorities in response to COVID-19 were sufficiently early and assiduous to avert a public health crisis — for now. Analysing factors that contribute to individual country experiences of COVID-19, such as the intensity and timing of public health interventions, will assist in the next stage of response planning globally. We describe how the epidemic and public health response unfolded in Australia up to 13 April. We estimate that the effective reproduction number was likely below 1 in each Australian state since mid-March and forecast that clinical demand would remain below capacity thresholds over the forecast period (from mid-to-late April).</description>

	<title>eLife: Atypical meiosis can be adaptive in outcrossed Schizosaccharomyces pombe due to wtf meiotic drivers</title>

	<description>Killer meiotic drivers are genetic parasites that destroy ‘sibling’ gametes lacking the driver allele. The fitness costs of drive can lead to selection of unlinked suppressors. This suppression could involve evolutionary tradeoffs that compromise gametogenesis and contribute to infertility. &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&lt;/i&gt;, an organism containing numerous gamete (spore)-killing &lt;i&gt;wtf&lt;/i&gt; drivers, offers a tractable system to test this hypothesis. Here, we demonstrate that in scenarios analogous to outcrossing, &lt;i&gt;wtf&lt;/i&gt; drivers generate a fitness landscape in which atypical spores, such as aneuploids and diploids, are advantageous. In this context, &lt;i&gt;wtf&lt;/i&gt; drivers can decrease the fitness costs of mutations that disrupt meiotic fidelity and, in some circumstances, can even make such mutations beneficial. Moreover, we find that &lt;i&gt;S. pombe&lt;/i&gt; isolates vary greatly in their ability to make haploid spores, with some isolates generating up to 46% aneuploid or diploid spores. This work empirically demonstrates the potential for meiotic drivers to shape the evolution of gametogenesis.</description>

	<title>eLife: Plasticity and evolutionary convergence in the locomotor skeleton of Greater Antillean Anolis lizards</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57468</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57468</link>
	<description>Plasticity can put evolution on repeat if development causes species to generate similar morphologies in similar environments. &lt;i&gt;Anolis&lt;/i&gt; lizards offer the opportunity to put this role of developmental plasticity to the test. Following colonization of the four Greater Antillean islands, &lt;i&gt;Anolis&lt;/i&gt; lizards independently and repeatedly evolved six ecomorphs adapted to manoeuvring different microhabitats. By quantifying the morphology of the locomotor skeleton of 95 species, we demonstrate that ecomorphs on different islands have diverged along similar trajectories. However, microhabitat-induced morphological plasticity differed between species and did not consistently improve individual locomotor performance. Consistent with this decoupling between morphological plasticity and locomotor performance, highly plastic features did not show greater evolvability, and plastic responses to microhabitat were poorly aligned with evolutionary divergence between ecomorphs. The locomotor skeleton of &lt;i&gt;Anolis&lt;/i&gt; may have evolved within a subset of possible morphologies that are highly accessible through genetic change, enabling adaptive convergence independently of plasticity.</description>

	<description>Chronic pain remains challenging to both diagnose and treat. These challenges, in part, arise from limited systems-level understanding of the basic mechanisms that process nociceptive information and ultimately instantiate a subjectively available experience of pain. Here, I provide a framework, the distributed nociceptive system, for understanding nociceptive mechanisms at a systems level by integrating the concepts of neural population coding with distributed processing. Within this framework, wide-spread engagement of populations of neurons produces representations of nociceptive information that are highly resilient to disruption.</description>

	<description>Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular clearance pathway in which cytoplasmic contents are trafficked to the lysosome for degradation. Within neurons, it helps to remove damaged organelles and misfolded or aggregated proteins and has therefore been the subject of intense research in relation to neurodegenerative disease. However, far less is understood about the role of autophagy in other aspects of neuronal physiology. Here we review the literature on the role of autophagy in maintaining neuronal stem cells and in neuronal plasticity in adult life and we discuss how these contribute to structural and functional deficits observed in a range of human disorders.</description>

	<description>Neurovascular coupling is a critical brain mechanism whereby changes to blood flow accompany localised neural activity. The breakdown of neurovascular coupling is linked to the development and progression of several neurological conditions including dementia. However, experimental data commonly arise from preclinical models in young mice with one disease only. In this study, we examined cortical haemodynamics in preparations that modelled common co-existing conditions namely Alzheimer's disease (J20-AD) combined with atherosclerosis (PCSK9-ATH) between 9-12m of age. We report novel findings with atherosclerosis where neurovascular decline is characterised by significantly reduced blood volume (HbT), levels of oxyhaemoglobin (HbO) &amp;amp; deoxyhaemoglobin (HbR), in addition to global neuroinflammation. In the comorbid mixed model (J20-PCSK9-MIX), we report a highly significant increase (3x fold) in hippocampal amyloid-beta plaques, without any further alterations to neurovascular function. There were no significant changes in evoked neural activity in any of the disease models, suggesting a breakdown of neurovascular coupling in PCSK9-ATH mice with inadequate oxygen delivery. A key finding was that cortical spreading depression (CSD) due to electrode insertion into the brain was worse in the diseased animals and led to a prolonged period of hypoxia and potentially ischaemia. The inflammatory environment in the brain was also perturbed, with interleukin-1 beta raised up to 2-fold and tumour necrosis factor raised up to 7-fold in brain tissues from these mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that systemic atherosclerosis can be detrimental to neurovascular health and that having cardiovascular comorbidities can exacerbate pre-existing Alzheimer's-related amyloid-plaques.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Chondroitinase and antidepressants promote plasticity by releasing TRKB from dephosphorylating control of PTPσ in parvalbumin neurons</title>

	<description>Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are an extracellular matrix structure rich in chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) which preferentially encase parvalbumin-containing (PV+) interneurons. PNNs restrict cortical network plasticity but the molecular mechanisms involved are unclear. We found that reactivation of ocular dominance plasticity in the adult visual cortex induced by chondroitinase (chABC)-mediated PNN removal requires intact TRKB signaling in PV+ neurons. Additionally, we demonstrate that chABC increases TRKB phosphorylation (pTRKB), while PNN component aggrecan attenuates BDNF-induced pTRKB in cortical neurons in culture. We further found that protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTP{sigma}, PTPRS), receptor for CSPGs, interacts with TRKB and restricts TRKB phosphorylation. PTP{sigma} deletion increases phosphorylation of TRKB in vivo and in vitro, and juvenile-like plasticity is retained in the visual cortex of adult PTP{sigma} deficient mice (PTP{sigma}+/-). The antidepressant drug fluoxetine, which is known to promote TRKB phosphorylation and reopen critical period-like plasticity in the adult brain, disrupts the interaction between TRKB and PTP{sigma} by binding to the transmembrane domain of TRKB. We propose that both chABC and fluoxetine reopen critical period-like plasticity in the adult visual cortex by promoting TRKB signaling in PV+ neurons through inhibition of TRKB dephosphorylation by the PTP{sigma}-CSPG complex.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Optineurin promotes aggregation of mutant huntingtin and mutant ataxin-3, and reduces cytotoxicity of aggregates</title>

	<description>Optineurin (OPTN), a cytoplasmic adaptor protein involved in cargo selective autophagy of bacteria, damaged mitochondria and mutant protein aggregates, is frequently seen in pathological structures containing protein aggregates, associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the function of OPTN in these protein aggregates is not known. Here, we have explored the role of OPTN in mutant protein aggregation and in cytoprotection from toxicity of mutant proteins. Mutant huntingtin (mHtt) and mutant ataxin-3 (mAtax-3) showed reduced formation of aggregates in Optn-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts as compared with wild type cells. Co-expression of OPTN enhanced aggregate formation by mHtt and mAtax-3 in Optn-/- cells. C-terminal domain of OPTN (412-577 amino acids) was necessary and sufficient to promote aggregate formation by these mutant proteins. The E478G mutant of OPTN, defective in ubiquitin-binding and autophagy, was also able to promote aggregation of mHtt and mAtax-3. OPTN and its C-terminal domain form a complex with the chaperone HSP70 known to promote mutant protein aggregation. Overexpression of mHtt or mAtax-3 induced more cell death in Optn-/- cells compared with wild type cells. Importantly, compared to wild type cells, Optn-deficient cells having mHtt or mAtax-3 aggregates showed higher level of cell death in neuronal (N2A) and non-neuronal cells. Our results show that OPTN promotes formation of mutant huntingtin and mutant ataxin-3 aggregates, and this function of OPTN might be mediated through interaction with HSP70 chaperones. Our results also show that OPTN reduces cytotoxicity caused by these mutant protein aggregates.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Fezf2 transient expression via modRNA with concurrent SIRT1 inhibition enhances differentiation of cortical subcerebral / corticospinal neuron identity from mES cells</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.13.242230v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>During late embryonic development of the cerebral cortex, the major class of cortical output neurons termed subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN; including the predominant population of corticospinal neurons, CSN) and the class of interhemispheric callosal projection neurons (CPN) initially express overlapping molecular controls that later undergo subtype-specific refinements. Such molecular refinements are largely absent in heterogeneous, maturation-stalled, neocortical-like neurons (termed 'cortical' here) spontaneously generated by established embryonic stem cell (ES) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation. Building on recently identified central molecular controls over SCPN development, we used a combination of synthetic modified mRNA (modRNA) for Fezf2, the central transcription factor controlling SCPN specification, and small molecule screening to investigate whether distinct chromatin modifiers might complement Fezf2 functions to promote SCPN-specific differentiation by mouse ES (mES)-derived cortical-like neurons. We find that the inhibition of a specific histone deacetylase, Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), enhances refinement of SCPN subtype molecular identity by both mES-derived cortical-like neurons and primary dissociated E12.5 mouse cortical neurons. In vivo, we identify that SIRT1 is specifically expressed by CPN, but not SCPN, during late embryonic and postnatal differentiation. Together, these data indicate that SIRT1 has neuronal subtype-specific expression in the mouse cortex in vivo, and its inhibition enhances subtype-specific differentiation of highly clinically relevant SCPN / CSN cortical neurons in vitro.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Learning an efficient place cell map from grid cells using non-negative sparse coding</title>

	<description>Experimental studies of grid cells in the Medial Entorhinal Cortex (MEC) have shown that they are selective to an array of spatial locations in the environment that form a hexagonal grid. However, place cells in the hippocampus are only selective to a single-location of the environment while granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus have multiple discrete firing locations, but lack spatial periodicity. Given the anatomical connection from MEC to the hippocampus, previous feedforward models of grid-to-place have been proposed. Here, we propose a unified learning model that can describe the spatial tuning properties of both hippocampal place cells and dentate gyrus granule cells based on non-negative sparse coding. Sparse coding plays an important role in many cortical areas and is proposed here to have a key role in the navigational system of the brain in the hippocampus.Our results show that the hexagonal patterns of grid cells with various orientations, grid spacings and phases are necessary for model cells to learn a single spatial field that efficiently tile the entire spatial environment. However, if there is a lack of diversity in any grid parameters or a lack of cells in the network, this will lead to the emergence of place cells that have multiple firing locations. More surprisingly, the model shows that place cells can also emerge even when non-negative sparse coding is used with weakly-tuned MEC cells, instead of MEC grid cells, as the input to place cells. This work suggests that sparse coding may be one of the underlying organizing principles for the navigational system of the brain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Aβ-induced NOX2 activation underlies oxidative stress leading to brain hypometabolism and hyperactivity in Alzheimer's disease</title>

	<description>A paramount driver of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the synergy of oxidative stress and glucose hypometabolism in the brain. Oxidative stress damages cellular macromolecules such as DNA, lipids and proteins, whereas glucose hypometabolism impairs cellular energy supply and antioxidant defence; Together, these cellular and functional alterations may be primary triggers of AD. However, the exact molecular basis of AD-associated glucose hypometabolism has remained unknown, hampering the search for effective interventions. Here, we identify NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) activation by beta-amyloid peptide (A{beta}1-42) as the main molecular source of oxidative stress driving brain glucose hypometabolism and network hyperactivity. Using a combination of electrophysiology with dynamic recordings of autofluorescence and metabolic biosensors, we show that in hippocampal brain slices, A{beta}1-42 application reduced network activity-driven glucose consumption and glycolysis by half, while NOX2 antagonism prevented this effect. In vivo, intracerebroventricular injection of A{beta}1-42 exerted a profound inhibitory effect on brain glucose consumption, resulting in long-lasting network hyperactivity and changes in animal behavioral profile. Critically, the novel bioavailable NOX2 antagonist GSK2795039 prevented all of the observed A{beta}-related detrimental effects. These data suggest that targeting NOX2-induced oxidative stress is a promising approach to both the prevention and treatment of AD.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Shared and divergent phase separation and aggregation properties of brain-expressed ubiquilins</title>

	<description>The brain-expressed ubiquilins, UBQLNs 1, 2 and 4, are highly homologous proteins that participate in multiple aspects of protein homeostasis and are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Studies have established that UBQLN2 forms liquid-like condensates and accumulates in pathogenic aggregates, much like other proteins linked to neurodegenerative diseases. However, the relative condensate and aggregate formation of the three brain-expressed ubiquilins is unknown. We report that the three ubiquilins differ in aggregation propensity, revealed by in-vitro experiments, cellular models, and analysis of human brain tissue. UBQLN4 displays heightened aggregation propensity over the other ubiquilins and, like amyloids, UBQLN4 forms ThioflavinT-positive fibrils in vitro. Measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of puncta in cells, we report that all three ubiquilins undergo liquid-liquid phase transition. UBQLN2 and 4 exhibit slower recovery than UBQLN1, suggesting the condensates formed by the brain-expressed ubiquilins have different compositions and undergo distinct internal rearrangements. We conclude that while all brain-expressed ubiquilins exhibit self-association behavior manifesting as condensates, they follow distinct courses of phase-separation and levels of aggregation. This variability among ubiquilins along the continuum from liquid-like to solid likely informs both the normal ubiquitin-linked functions of ubiquilins and their accumulation and potential contribution to toxicity in various neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<description>Brain areas are organized into functionally connected networks though the mechanism underlying this widespread coordination remains unclear. Here we apply deep learning-based dimensionality reduction to task-free functional magnetic resonance images to discover the principal latent dimensions of human brain functional activity. We find that each dimension corresponds to a distinct and stable spatial activity gradient. Brain areas are distributed non-uniformly along each gradient, reflecting modular boundaries and hub properties. Gradients appear to dynamically steepen or flatten to produce task-specific activation patterns. Dynamical systems modelling reveals that gradients can interact via state-specific coupling parameters, allowing accurate forecasts and simulations of brain activity during different tasks. Together, these findings indicate that a small set of overlapping global activity gradients determine the repertoire of possible functional connectivity states.</description>

	<description>Most people have a right-ear advantage for the perception of spoken syllables, consistent with left hemisphere dominance for speech processing. However, there is considerable variation, with some people showing left-ear advantage. The extent to which this variation is reflected in brain structure remains unclear. We tested for relations between hemispheric asymmetries of auditory processing and of grey matter in 281 adults, using dichotic listening and voxel-based morphometry. This was the largest study of this issue to date. Per-voxel asymmetry indexes were derived for each participant following registration of brain magnetic resonance images to a template that was symmetrized. The asymmetry index derived from dichotic listening was related to grey matter asymmetry in clusters of voxels corresponding to the amygdala and cerebellum lobule VI. There was also a smaller, non-significant cluster in the posterior superior temporal gyrus, a region of auditory cortex. These findings contribute to the mapping of asymmetrical structure-function links in the human brain, and suggest that subcortical structures should be investigated in relation to hemispheric dominance for speech processing, in addition to auditory cortex.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: L1CAM is not Associated with Extracellular Vesicles in Human Cerebrospinal Fluid or Plasma</title>

	<description>Neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) present a tremendous opportunity to learn about the biochemistry of brain cells in living patients. L1CAM is a transmembrane protein expressed in neurons that is presumed to be found on NDEVs in human biofluids. Previous studies have used L1CAM immuno-isolation from human plasma to isolate NDEVs for neurodegenerative disease diagnostics. We developed a panel of ultrasensitive Single Molecule Array (Simoa) assays for known EV markers, as well as L1CAM, and applied it to study EVs in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We fractionated plasma and CSF by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and density gradient centrifugation (DGC) to separate EVs from free proteins. We observed that L1CAM did not elute in the EV fractions, but rather eluted in the free protein fractions. We found that L1CAM is present as a free protein in human plasma and CSF, possibly due to proteolytic cleavage and/or alternative splicing. We further demonstrate that the isoforms found in CSF and plasma are different. These data collectively establish that L1CAM in plasma is not EV associated and should therefore not be used for NDEV isolation. Importantly, the framework and tools described herein will allow for evaluation of other potential candidate markers for isolation of NDEVs.</description>

	<description>High-frequency activities (HFAs) and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) are gaining attention as key neurophysiological biomarkers for studying human epilepsy. We aimed to clarify and visualize how HFAs are modulated by the phase of low-frequency bands during seizures. We used intracranial electrodes to record seizures of symptomatic focal epilepsy (15 seizures in seven patients). Ripples (80-250 Hz), as representative of HFAs, were evaluated along with PAC. The synchronization index (SI), representing PAC, was used to analyze the coupling between the amplitude of ripples and the phase of lower frequencies. The main low frequency band modulating ictal-ripple activities was the {theta} band (4-8 Hz), and after completion of ictal-ripple burst, {delta} (1-4 Hz)-ripple PAC occurred. We created a video in which the intracranial electrode contacts were represented by circles that were scaled linearly to the power changes of ripple. The video showed that fluctuation of the diameter of these circles indicated the rhythmic changes during significant high values of {theta}-ripple PAC. Moreover, clonic seizures were observed when values of {delta}-ripple PAC were significantly high. We inferred that ripple activities occurring during seizure evolution were modulated by {theta} rhythm, and ripple activities involved in clonic seizures were modulated by {delta} rhythm. In addition, we concluded that rhythmic circles' fluctuation presented in the video represents the PAC phenomenon. Our video is thus a useful tool for understanding how ripple activity is modulated by the low-frequency phase in relation with PAC.</description>

	<description>&quot;Resting-state&quot; functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is widely used to study brain connectivity. So far, researchers have been restricted to measures of functional connectivity that are computationally efficient but undirected, or to effective connectivity estimates that are directed but limited to small networks. Here, we show that a method recently developed for task-fMRI - regression dynamic causal modeling (rDCM) - extends to rs-fMRI and offers both directional estimates and scalability to whole-brain networks. First, simulations demonstrate that rDCM faithfully recovers parameter values over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios and repetition times. Second, we test construct validity of rDCM in relation to an established model of effective connectivity, spectral DCM. Using rs-fMRI data from nearly 200 healthy participants, rDCM produces biologically plausible results consistent with estimates by spectral DCM. Importantly, rDCM is computationally highly efficient, reconstructing whole-brain networks (&amp;gt;200 areas) within minutes on standard hardware. This opens promising new avenues for connectomics.</description>

	<description>Pathological protein aggregation in Alzheimers disease and other dementias is proposed to spread through the nervous system by a process of intercellular transfer of pathogenic forms of tau protein. Defining the cellular mechanisms of tau entry to human neurons is essential for understanding dementia pathogenesis and the rational design of disease-modifying therapeutics. Using whole genome CRISPR knockout screens in human iPSC-derived excitatory neurons, the primary cell type affected in these diseases, we identified genes and pathways required specifically for uptake of monomeric and aggregated tau. Monomeric and aggregated tau are both taken up by human neurons by receptor-mediated endocytosis, with the low-density lipoprotein LRP1 a significant surface receptor for both forms of tau. Perturbations of the endolysosome and autophagy systems at many levels, and specifically endosome sorting and receptor recycling, greatly reduced tau uptake. Of particular therapeutic interest is that loss of function of the endocytosis and autophagy regulator LRRK2, as well as acute inhibition of its kinase activity, reduced neuronal uptake of monomeric and aggregated tau. Kinase-activating mutations in LRRK2 are a cause of Parkinsons disease accompanied by neuronal tau aggregation, suggesting that LRRK2 mediates tau spreading in vivo and that LRRK2 inhibition has the potential to inhibit interneuronal spread of tau pathology, slowing disease progression. Overall, pathways for tau entry share significant similarity with those required for virus entry by receptor-mediated endocytosis, suggesting that tau spreading is a quasi-infectious process.</description>

	<description>SUMARYThe ability to genetically manipulate organisms has led to significant insights in functional genomics in many species. In birds, manipulation of the genome is hindered by the inaccessibility of the one-cell embryo. During embryonic development, avian primordial germ cells (PGCs) migrate through the blood stream and reach the gonadal anlage; where they develop into mature germ cells. Here, we explored the use of PGCs to produce transgenic offspring in the zebra finch, which is a major animal model for sexual brain differentiation, vocal learning and vocal communication. Zebra finch PGCs (zfPGCs) obtained from embryonic blood significantly proliferated when cultured in an optimized culture medium and conserved the expression of germ and stem cell markers. Transduction of cultured zfPGCs with lentiviral vectors was highly efficient leading to strong expression of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Transduced zfPGCs were injected into the host embryo and transgenic songbirds were successfully generated.</description>

	<description>Heavy and frequent use of cannabis during adolescence increases the risk of developing psychiatric disorders. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this vulnerability remain largely unknown. Here, we explore whether adolescent vulnerability to long-term behavioral effects of cannabis is modulated by Reelin, a gene implicated in the development of the brain and of psychiatric disorders. To this aim, heterozygous Reeler (HR) mice, that express reduced level of Reelin, were chronically exposed during adolescence to high doses (10mg/kg) of {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a major psychoactive component of cannabis. Mice were tested in early adulthood with multiple behavioral assays, including working memory, social interaction, locomotor activity, anxiety-like responses, stress reactivity, and pre-pulse inhibition. Compared to wild-type (WT), HR mice treated with THC showed impaired social behaviors, elevated disinhibitory phenotypes and increased responsiveness to aversive situations, in a sex-specific manner. Independent of THC exposure, HR mice also spent more time exploring unfamiliar objects, indicating that Reelin modulates novelty seeking behavior. To identify the neuronal ensemble underlying this elevated novelty seeking in HR mice, we mapped the regional brain expression of the immediate early gene, Fos, in mice exposed to novel objects. HR mice exhibited reduced neuronal activation in the lateral septum, a subcortical brain structure implicated in emotions, cognition and reward processes. Overall, these findings show that (1) Reelin deficiency influences behavioral abnormalities caused by heavy consumption of THC during adolescence, and (2) that Reelin plays a role in the neurobiological mechanisms underlying disinhibitory behaviors, such as novelty seeking.

Significant StatementThe link between cannabis abuse and the development psychiatric disorders, especially in adolescents, makes understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cannabis effects on the brain a significant biomedical problem. Reelin is a key signaling molecule in the development of the adolescent brain and of psychiatric disorders, but its role in modulating the behavioral changes induced by cannabis remain unknown. Here, we report an interaction between Reelin deficiency and chronic adolescent exposure to THC, a major psychoactive component of cannabis. This interaction led to cognitive deficits, disinhibitory behaviors and altered emotional reactivity in mice, in a sex-specific manner. These experiments are the first to establish a link between Reelin signaling and the endocannabinoid system targeted by THC.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Meta-matching: a simple framework to translate phenotypic predictive models from big to small data</title>

	<description>There is significant interest in using brain imaging data to predict non-brain-imaging phenotypes in individual participants. However, most prediction studies are underpowered, relying on less than a few hundred participants, leading to low reliability and inflated prediction performance. Yet, small sample sizes are unavoidable when studying clinical populations or addressing focused neuroscience questions. Here, we propose a simple framework - &quot;meta-matching&quot; - to translate predictive models from large-scale datasets to new unseen non-brain-imaging phenotypes in boutique studies. The key observation is that many large-scale datasets collect a wide range inter-correlated phenotypic measures. Therefore, a unique phenotype from a boutique study likely correlates with (but is not the same as) some phenotypes in some large-scale datasets. Meta-matching exploits these correlations to boost prediction in the boutique study. We applied meta-matching to the problem of predicting non-brain-imaging phenotypes using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Using the UK Biobank (N = 36,848), we demonstrated that meta-matching can boost the prediction of new phenotypes in small independent datasets by 100% to 400% in many scenarios. When considering relative prediction performance, meta-matching significantly improved phenotypic prediction even in samples with 10 participants. When considering absolute prediction performance, meta-matching significantly improved phenotypic prediction when there were least 50 participants. With a growing number of large-scale population-level datasets collecting an increasing number of phenotypic measures, our results represent a lower bound on the potential of meta-matching to elevate small-scale boutique studies.</description>

	<description>The geometry that describes the relationship among colors is unsettled despite centuries of study. Here we present a new approach, using multivariate analyses of direct measurements of brain activity obtained with magnetoencephalography to reverse-engineer the geometry of the neural representation of color space. The analyses depend upon determining similarity relationships among the neural responses to different colors and assessing how these relationships change in time. To evaluate the approach, we relate patterns of neural activity to universal patterns in color naming. Control experiments showed that responses to color words could not decode activity elicited by color stimuli. The results suggest that three patterns of color naming can be accounted for by decoding the similarity relationships in the neural representation of color: the association of warm colors such as reds and oranges with &quot;light&quot; and cool colors such as blues and greens with &quot;dark&quot;; the greater precision among all languages in naming warm colors compared to cool colors; and the preeminence of red.</description>

	<description>Children are found to exhibit high degrees of delay discounting compared with adults in many delay discounting studies. However, the temporal dynamics of the differences behind the behaviors are not well known. In this study, we chose two age groups of participants and adopted event-related potential (ERP) techniques to investigate the neural dynamic differences between children and adults during delay discounting processes. Behavioral findings showed that children discounted more than adults and chose more immediate choices. Electrophysiological findings revealed that children exhibited longer neural processing (longer P2 latency) than adults during the early detection and identification phase. Children showed less cognitive control (smaller N2 amplitude) than adults over the middle frontal areas, and they devoted more neural effort (larger P3 amplitudes) to making final choices than adults. The factors of reward amount and time delay could influence the development of delay discounting in male children.</description>

	<description>Humans are fast and accurate when they recognize familiar faces. Previous neurophysiological studies have shown enhanced representations for the dichotomy of familiar vs. unfamiliar faces. As familiarity is a spectrum, however, any neural correlate should reflect graded representations for more vs. less familiar faces along the spectrum. By systematically varying familiarity across stimuli, we show a neural familiarity spectrum using electroencephalography. We then evaluated the spatiotemporal dynamics of familiar face recognition across the brain. Specifically, we developed a novel informational connectivity method to test whether peri-frontal brain areas contribute to familiar face recognition. Results showed that feed-forward flow dominates for the most familiar faces and top-down flow was only dominant when sensory evidence was insufficient to support face recognition. These results demonstrate that perceptual difficulty and the level of familiarity influence the neural representation of familiar faces and the degree to which peri-frontal neural networks contribute to familiar face recognition.</description>

	<description>Extracellular electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging are widely used methods for measuring physiological activity with single-cell resolution across large populations of neurons in the brain. While these two modalities have distinct advantages and disadvantages, neither provides complete, unbiased information about the underlying neural population. Here, we compare evoked responses in visual cortex recorded in awake mice under highly standardized conditions using either imaging or electrophysiology. Across all stimulus conditions tested, we observe a larger fraction of responsive neurons in electrophysiology and higher stimulus selectivity in calcium imaging. This work explores which data transformations are most useful for explaining these modality-specific discrepancies. We show that the higher selectivity in imaging can be partially reconciled by applying a spikes-to-calcium forward model to the electrophysiology data. However, the forward model could not reconcile differences in responsiveness without sub-selecting neurons based on event rate or level of signal contamination. This suggests that differences in responsiveness more likely reflect neuronal sampling bias or cluster-merging artifacts during spike sorting of electrophysiological recordings, rather than flaws in event detection from fluorescence time series. This work establishes the dominant impacts of the two modalities respective biases on a set of functional metrics that are fundamental for characterizing sensory-evoked responses.</description>

	<description>Visual search is one of the most ecologically important perceptual task domains. One research tradition has studied visual search using simple, parametric stimuli and a signal detection theory or Bayesian modeling framework. However, this tradition has mostly focused on homogeneous distractors (distractors that are identical to each other), which are not very realistic. In a different tradition, Duncan and Humphreys (1989) conducted a landmark study on visual search in the presence of heterogeneous distractors. However, they used complex stimuli, making modeling and dissociation of component processes more difficult. Here, we attempt to unify these research traditions by systematically examining visual search with heterogeneous distractors using simple, parametric stimuli and a Bayesian modeling framework. Specifically, our experiment varied multiple factors that could potentially influence performance: set size, task (N-AFC localization vs detection), whether the target was revealed before or after the search array (perception versus memory), and stimulus spacing. Across all conditions, we found that performance decreased with increasing set size. We then examined various within-trial summary statistics, and found that the minimum target-to-distractor feature difference was a stronger predictor of behavior than the mean target-to-distractor difference and than distractor variance. To move from summary statistics to process-level understanding, we formulated a Bayesian optimal-observer model with a variable-precision encoding stage. This model, which makes trial-by-trial predictions, accurately accounted for all summary statistics. This was still the case when we fitted the model jointly to the localization and detection data. We replicated these results in a separate experiment with reduced stimulus spacing. Together, our results represent a critique of Duncan and Humphreys purely descriptive approach, bring visual search with heterogeneous distractors firmly within the reach of quantitative process models, and affirm the &quot;unreasonable effectiveness&quot; of Bayesian models in explaining visual search.</description>

	<description>The serotonergic system is widely implicated in affect regulation, and a common target for psychopharmacological interventions. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are the foremost drug class for treating depression, as well as anxiety, phobia and other affective disorders. However, the functional mechanisms determining SSRI efficacy remain elusive, hindering the targeted further development of serotonergic system interventions. Assays for longitudinal whole-brain interrogation of the serotonergic system are unavailable, yet such techniques are essential for identifying differential intervention effects across projection areas. We present a novel longitudinal opto-fMRI assay suitable for imaging longitudinal drug treatment effects on the mouse serotonergic system -- within-subject and with sub-millimetre spatial resolution. We apply this assay to a longitudinal fluoxetine treatment, and document reliable segmentation of brain-wide treatment effects, including identification of a brainstem cluster with a highly significant longitudinal trajectory, constituting a novel neurophenotype for psychopharmacological interventions. We differentiate serotonergic neuron activation from projection area activation, and offer brain-wide fMRI evidence for the prominent autoinhibition downregulation theory of SSRI effects. Further, we show that given the sensitivity of the assay, SSRI treatment produces no persistent effects after treatment cessation in healthy subjects.</description>

	<description>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established treatment option for a variety of neurological disorders, including Parkinsons disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET). It is widely believed that the efficacy, efficiency and side-effects of the treatment can be improved by stimulating  closed-loop, according to the symptoms of a patient. Multi-contact electrodes powered by independent current sources are a recent development in DBS technology which allow for greater precision when targeting one or more pathological regions but, in order to realise the potential of such systems, algorithms must be developed to deal with their increased complexity. This motivates the need to understand how applying DBS to multiple regions (or neural populations) can affect the efficacy and efficiency of the treatment. On the basis of a theoretical model, our paper aims to address the question of how to best apply DBS to multiple neural populations to maximally desynchronise brain activity. Using a coupled oscillator model, we derive analytical expressions which predict how the symptom severity should change as a result of applying stimulation. On the basis of these expressions we derive an algorithm describing when the stimulation should be delivered to individual contacts. Remarkably, these expressions also allow us to determine the conditions for when stimulation using information from individual contacts is likely to be advantageous. Using numerical simulation, we demonstrate that our methods have the potential to be both more effective and efficient than existing methods found in the literature.</description>

Many cognitive processes involve transformations of distributed representations in neural populations, creating a need for population-level models. Recurrent neural network models fulfill this need, but there are many open questions about how their connectivity gives rise to dynamics that solve a task. Here, we present a method for finding the connectivity of networks for which the dynamics are specified to solve a task in an interpretable way. We apply our method to a working memory task by synthesizing a network that implements a drift-diffusion process over a ring-shaped manifold. We also use our method to demonstrate how inputs can be used to control network dynamics for cognitive flexibility and explore the relationship between representation geometry and network capacity. Our work fits within the broader context of understanding neural computations as dynamics over relatively low-dimensional manifolds formed by correlated patterns of neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iEhpglNKGpY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Dendritic spine abnormalities correlate with behavioral and cognitive deficits in mouse models of Lafora disease&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b9806c5d-c279-4a1d-88fc-14deed7079ae/cne25006-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alterations in dendritic spine morphology are known to associate with cognitive dysfunctions in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we analyzed the dendritic spine morphologies in the mouse model for Lafora disease ‐ a fatal form of epileptic disorder associated with cognitive defects. We found a significant increase in the density, length, and reduction in the width of the dendritic spines from the postnatal period onwards. These animals also exhibited hyperactivity, reduced anxiety‐like behavior, and deficits in the spatial and non‐spatial memory. Thus, dendritic spine abnormalities appear to be a primary developmental defect in the Lafora disease mouse model and may contribute to the cognitive deficits in the disease.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lafora disease (LD) is a genetic and fatal form of neurodegenerative disorder characterized by myoclonic epilepsy and cognitive deficits. LD is caused by loss‐of‐function mutations in the EPM2A or the NHLRC1 gene. A major hallmark of LD is the presence of abnormal glycogen aggregates in neurons and other tissues. Functional studies on the genes have, therefore, mostly focused on glycogen metabolism. The physiological basis of cognitive deficits in LD is thus largely unexplored. Alterations in dendritic spine morphology are known in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We, therefore, analyzed the dendritic spine morphologies in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal and cortical layer V of the Epm2a or Nhlrc1 knockout mice brain. We found a significant increase in the density, length, and reduction in the width of the dendritic spines in postnatal day 21 to 12‐month‐old LD animals. Similar observations were made in the primary cultures of neurons derived from the hippocampi of the embryonic brain, suggesting that the aberrant spine phenotype could be a developmental defect in LD. We also looked at the cognitive and behavioral deficits as a possible readout of the spine abnormalities. The LD animals exhibited hyperactivity, reduced anxiety‐like behavior, and deficits in the spatial and non‐spatial memory. Such abnormalities were seen in the younger (1‐to‐2 months) as well as the older (7‐to‐8 months) age groups. Taken together, our results suggest that the dendritic spine abnormalities are primary developmental defects in the LD model and these defects might underlie some of the symptoms, including cognitive deficits, in LD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The present study reveals that low doses of BrdU (from 25 to 75 μg/g) have no deleterious effects on the development of the rat cerebellar neuroepithelium. Our results also denotes that the BrdU injection at doses ranging from 100 to 300 μg/g alters neuroblasts proliferation and induces the activation of apoptotic cellular events in the prenatal cerebellum.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study was conducted to assess whether a single administration of 5‐bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine (BrdU) interferes with cell proliferation and leads to the activation of apoptotic cellular events in the prenatal cerebellum. BrdU effects across a wide range of doses (25 to 300 μg/g b.w.) were analyzed using immunohistochemical and ultrastructural procedures. The pregnant rats were injected with BrdU at embryonic day 13, and their fetuses were sacrificed from 5 to 35 h after exposure. The quantification of several parameters such as the density of mitotic figures, and BrdU and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)‐reactive cells showed that, in comparison with the saline injected rats, the administration of BrdU impairs the proliferative behavior of neuroepithelial cells. The above mentioned parameters were significantly reduced in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The reduction was more evident using 200 μg/g b.w. The most severe effects were found with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The present findings also revealed that high doses of BrdU lead to the activation of apoptotic cellular events as evidenced by both terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick‐end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemistry for active caspase‐3. In comparison with saline rats, many apoptotic cells were found in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The number of dying cells increased with 200 μg/g b.w. The most important number of apoptotic cells were observed in animals injected with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the presence of neuroblasts at different stages of apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Ontogeny of the electric organ discharge and of the papillae of the electrocytes in the weakly electric fish Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus (Teleostei: Mormyridae)</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Ontogeny of the electric organ discharge and of the papillae of the electrocytes in the weakly electric fish Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus (Teleostei: Mormyridae)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ec975b8e-c06e-4b6b-b5d2-e3fb97ae734a/cne25003-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electric organ (EO) of mormyrid weakly electric fish is located in the tail on either side of the spinal cord. It consists of dorsal and ventral columns of serially arranged electrocytes which are derivatives of  muscle cells. In Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus it produces a long triphasic discharge. We investigated the development of the EOD and the morphology of the electrocytes in order to correlate ontogenetic changes in length and shape of the EOD with dynamic morphological characteristics of the electrocyte, in particular the formation of surface evaginations (papillae) of the anterior face of electrocytes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electric organ of the mormyrid weakly electric fish, &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus &lt;/i&gt; (Boulenger, 1898), undergoes changes in both the electric organ discharge (EOD) and the light and electron microscopic morphology as the fish mature from the juvenile to the adult form. Of particular interest was the appearance of papillae, surface specializations of the uninnervated anterior face of the electrocyte, which have been hypothesized to increase
the duration of the EOD. In a 24.5 mm long juvenile the adult electric organ (EO) was not yet functional, and the electrocytes lacked papillae. A 40 mm long juvenile, which produced a short biphasic EOD of 1.3 ms duration, shows small papillae (average area 136 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast, the EOD of a 79 mm long juvenile was triphasic. The large increase in duration of the EOD to 23.2 ms was accompanied by a small change in size of the papillae (average area 159 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Similarly, a 150 mm long adult produced a triphasic EOD of comparable duration to the younger stage (24.7 ms) but featured a prominent increase in size of the papillae (average area 402 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, there was no linear correlation between EOD duration and papillary size. The most prominent ultrastructural change was at the level of the myofilaments, which regularly extended into the papillae, only in the oldest specimen – probably serving a supporting function. Physiological mechanisms, like gene expression levels, as demonstrated in some &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus &lt;/i&gt; species, might be more important concerning the duration of the EOD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The SNARE Regulator Complexin3 is a Target of the Cone Circadian Clock</title>

&lt;p&gt;Complexin3 (CPLX3) is a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses. Here we show that the expression of CPLX3 is rhythmic at the synaptic terminal of cone photoreceptors with high values during the day and lower values at night. Silencing the circadian clock specifically in cones eliminates rhythmic expression of the protein in cone pedicles. Rhythmic expression of CPLX3 may modulate the synaptic transmission of cone signals to downstream retinal circuits between day and night.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMAL1 is a core component of the mammalian circadian clockwork. Removal of BMAL1 from the retina significantly affects visual information processing in both rod and cone pathways. To identify potential pathways and/or molecules through which BMAL1 alters signal transmission at the cone pedicle, we performed an RNA‐seq differential expression analysis between cone‐specific &lt;i&gt;Bmal1 &lt;/i&gt; knock out cones (cone‐&lt;i&gt;Bmal1 &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) and wild type cones. We found 88 genes differentially expressed. Among these, &lt;i&gt;Complexin3 &lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cplx3 &lt;/i&gt;), a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses, was downregulated fivefold in the mutant cones. The purpose of this work was to determine whether BMAL1 and/or the cone clock controls CPLX3 protein expression at cone pedicles. We found that CPLX3 expression level was decreased twofold in cone‐&lt;i&gt;Bmal1 &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; cones. Furthermore, CPLX3 expression was downregulated at night compared to the day in wild type cones but remained constitutively low in mutant cones both day and night. The transcript and protein expression levels of &lt;i&gt;Cplx4‐‐ &lt;/i&gt;the other complexin expressed in cones‐‐ were similar in wild type and mutant cones; in wild type cones, CPLX4 protein level did not change with the time of day. &lt;i&gt;In silico &lt;/i&gt; analysis revealed four potential BMAL1:CLOCK binding sites upstream from exon one of &lt;i&gt;Cplx3 &lt;/i&gt; and none upstream of exon one of &lt;i&gt;Cplx4 &lt;/i&gt;. Our results suggest that CPLX3 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by the cone clock. The modulation of CPLX3 may be a mechanism by which the clock controls the cone synaptic transfer function to second‐order cells and thereby impacts retinal signal processing during the day/night cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the essential aspects of power system planning is generation expansion
planning (GEP). The purpose of GEP is to enhance construction planning and
reduce the costs of installing different types of power plants. This paper
proposes a method based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) for GEP in the presence of
wind power plants. Since it is desired to integrate the maximum possible wind
power production in GEP, the constraints for incorporating different levels of
wind energy in power generation are investigated comprehensively. This will
allow obtaining the maximum reasonable amount of wind penetration in the
network. Besides, due to the existence of different wind regimes, the
penetration of strong and weak wind on GEP is assessed. The results show that
the maximum utilization of wind power generation capacity could increase the
exploitation of more robust wind regimes. Considering the growth of the wind
farm industry and the cost reduction for building wind power plants, the
sensitivity of GEP to the variations of this cost is investigated. The results
further indicate that for a 10% reduction in the initial investment cost of
wind power plants, the proposed model estimates that the overall cost will be
minimized.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite recent progress in robot learning, it still remains a challenge to
program a robot to deal with open-ended object manipulation tasks. One approach
that was recently used to autonomously generate a repertoire of diverse skills
is a novelty based Quality-Diversity~(QD) algorithm. However, as most
evolutionary algorithms, QD suffers from sample-inefficiency and, thus, it is
challenging to apply it in real-world scenarios. This paper tackles this
problem by integrating a neural network that predicts the behavior of the
perturbed parameters into a novelty based QD algorithm. In the proposed
Model-based Quality-Diversity search (M-QD), the network is trained
concurrently to the repertoire and is used to avoid executing unpromising
actions in the novelty search process. Furthermore, it is used to adapt the
skills of the final repertoire in order to generalize the skills to different
scenarios. Our experiments show that enhancing a QD algorithm with such a
forward model improves the sample-efficiency and performance of the
evolutionary process and the skill adaptation.

for current speech enhancement models, larger scale networks often suffer from
decreased robustness to the variety of real-world use cases beyond what is
encountered in training data. We introduce several innovations that lead to
better large neural networks for speech enhancement. The novel PoCoNet
architecture is a convolutional neural network that, with the use of
frequency-positional embeddings, is able to more efficiently build
frequency-dependent features in the early layers. A semi-supervised method
helps increase the amount of conversational training data by pre-enhancing
noisy datasets, improving performance on real recordings. A new loss function
biased towards preserving speech quality helps the optimization better match
human perceptual opinions on speech quality. Ablation experiments and objective
and human opinion metrics show the benefits of the proposed improvements.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the activity of large populations of neurons is difficult due
to the combinatorial complexity of possible cell-cell interactions. To reduce
the complexity, coarse-graining had been previously applied to experimental
neural recordings, which showed over two decades of scaling in free energy,
activity variance, eigenvalue spectra, and correlation time, hinting that the
mouse hippocampus operates in a critical regime. We model the experiment by
simulating conditionally independent binary neurons coupled to a small number
of long-timescale stochastic fields and then replicating the coarse-graining
procedure and analysis. This reproduces the experimentally-observed scalings,
suggesting that they may arise from coupling the neural population activity to
latent dynamic stimuli. Further, parameter sweeps for our model suggest that
emergence of scaling requires most of the cells in a population to couple to
the latent stimuli, predicting that even the celebrated place cells must also
respond to non-place stimuli.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Creativity, or the ability to produce new useful ideas, is commonly
associated to the human being, but there are many other examples in nature
where this phenomenon can be observed. Inspired by this fact, in engineering
and particularly in computational sciences, many different models have been
developed to tackle a number of problems. Music, a form of art broadly present
along the human history, is the main field addressed in this thesis, taking
advantage of the kind of ideas that bring diversity and creativity to nature
and computation. We present Melomics, an algorithmic composition method based
on evolutionary search, with a genetic encoding of the solutions that are
interpreted in a complex developmental process that leads to music in standard
formats. This bioinspired compositional system has exhibited a highly creative
power and versatility to produce music of different type, which in many
occasions has proven to be indistinguishable from the music made by human
composers. The system also has enabled the emergence of a set of completely
novel applications: from effective tools that help anyone to easily obtain the
precise music they need, to radically new uses like adaptive music for therapy,
amusement or many other purposes. It is clear to us that there is yet much
research to be done in this field and that countless and new unimaginable uses
will derive from it.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Advances in deep learning have led to state-of-the-art performance across a
multitude of speech recognition tasks. Nevertheless, the widespread deployment
of deep neural networks for on-device speech recognition remains a challenge,
particularly in edge scenarios where the memory and computing resources are
highly constrained (e.g., low-power embedded devices) or where the memory and
computing budget dedicated to speech recognition is low (e.g., mobile devices
performing numerous tasks besides speech recognition). In this study, we
introduce the concept of attention condensers for building low-footprint,
highly-efficient deep neural networks for on-device speech recognition on the
edge. More specifically, an attention condenser is a self-attention mechanism
that learns and produces a condensed embedding characterizing joint local and
cross-channel activation relationships, and performs adaptive activation
recalibration accordingly for selective concentration. To illustrate its
efficacy, we introduce TinySpeech, low-precision deep neural networks
comprising largely of attention condensers tailored for on-device speech
recognition using a machine-driven design exploration strategy. Experimental
results on the Google Speech Commands benchmark dataset for limited-vocabulary
speech recognition showed that TinySpeech networks achieved significantly lower
architectural complexity (as much as $207\times$ fewer parameters) and lower
computational complexity (as much as $21\times$ fewer multiply-add operations)
when compared to previous deep neural networks in research literature. These
results not only demonstrate the efficacy of attention condensers for building
highly efficient deep neural networks for on-device speech recognition, but
also illuminate its potential for accelerating deep learning on the edge and
empowering a wide range of TinyML applications.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The main power of artificial intelligence is not in modeling what we already
know, but in creating solutions that are new. Such solutions exist in extremely
large, high-dimensional, and complex search spaces. Population-based search
techniques, i.e. variants of evolutionary computation, are well suited to
finding them. These techniques make it possible to find creative solutions to
practical problems in the real world, making creative AI through evolutionary
computation the likely &quot;next deep learning.&quot;

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Effect of Diverse Recoding of Granule Cells on Optokinetic Response in A Cerebellar Ring Network with Synaptic Plasticity. (arXiv:2003.11325v4 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11325</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11325</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider a cerebellar ring network for the optokinetic response (OKR), and
investigate the effect of diverse recoding of granule (GR) cells on OKR by
varying the connection probability $p_c$ from Golgi to GR cells. For an optimal
value of $p_c^*~(=0.06)$, individual GR cells exhibit diverse spiking patterns
which are in-phase, anti-phase, or complex out-of-phase with respect to their
population-averaged firing activity. Then, these diversely-recoded signals via
parallel fibers (PFs) from GR cells are effectively depressed by the
error-teaching signals via climbing fibers from the inferior olive which are
also in-phase ones. Synaptic weights at in-phase PF-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses
of active GR cells are strongly depressed via strong long-term depression
(LTD), while those at anti-phase and complex out-of-phase PF-PC synapses are
weakly depressed through weak LTD. This kind of &quot;effective&quot; depression (i.e.,
strong/weak LTD) at the PF-PC synapses causes a big modulation in firings of
PCs, which then exert effective inhibitory coordination on the vestibular
nucleus (VN) neuron (which evokes OKR). For the firing of the VN neuron, the
learning gain degree ${\cal{L}}_g$, corresponding to the modulation gain ratio,
increases with increasing the learning cycle, and it saturates at about the
300th cycle. By varying $p_c$ from $p_c^*$, we find that a plot of saturated
learning gain degree ${\cal L}_g^*$ versus $p_c$ forms a bell-shaped curve with
a peak at $p_c^*$ (where the diversity degree in spiking patterns of GR cells
is also maximum). Consequently, the more diverse in recoding of GR cells, the
more effective in motor learning for the OKR adaptation.

Here the authors demonstrate a hydrogel design using tandem-repeat proteins as the cross-linkers and random coiled polymers as the percolating network which results in high stretchability, low hysteresis and high fracture toughness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/nK3B5mqhbYE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Gene-Editing Technologies Paired With Viral Vectors for Translational Research Into Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00148</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) have historically been among the most difficult to treat using conventional pharmacological approaches. This is due to a confluence of factors, including the limited regenerative capacity and overall complexity of the brain, problems associated with repeated drug administration, and difficulties delivering drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Viral-mediated gene transfer represents an attractive alternative for the delivery of therapeutic cargo to the nervous system. Crucially, it usually requires only a single injection, whether that be a gene replacement strategy for an inherited disorder or the delivery of a genome- or epigenome-modifying construct for treatment of CNS diseases and disorders. It is thus understandable that considerable effort has been put towards the development of improved vector systems for gene transfer into the CNS. Different viral vectors are of course tailored to their specific applications, but they generally should share several key properties. The ideal viral vector incorporates a high-packaging capacity, efficient gene transfer paired with robust and sustained expression, lack of oncogenicity, toxicity and pathogenicity, and scalable manufacturing for clinical applications. In this review, we will devote attention to viral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (lentiviral vectors; LVs) and adeno-associated virus (AAVs). The high interest in these viral delivery systems vectors is due to: (i) robust delivery and long-lasting expression; (ii) efficient transduction into postmitotic cells, including the brain; (iii) low immunogenicity and toxicity; and (iv) compatibility with advanced manufacturing techniques. Here, we will outline basic aspects of LV and AAV biology, particularly focusing on approaches and techniques aiming to enhance viral safety. We will also allocate a significant portion of this review to the development and use of LVs and AAVs for delivery into the CNS, with a focus on the genome and epigenome-editing tools based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas 9) and the development of novel strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Profile of MIF in Developing Hippocampus: Association With Cell Proliferation and Neurite Outgrowth</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Proinflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a multifunctional cytokine and has been found involved in many neurological diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD), epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. Previous studies have shown that MIF is expressed in neocortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and spinal cord in adult mice. It is expressed by astrocytes and activates microglias in neuroinflammation. Further studies have shown that MIF is detected in moss fibers of dentate granule cells and in apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in adult hippocampus. Only NeuroD-positive immature granule neurons but not NeuN-positive mature neurons express MIF. These findings led us eager to know the exact role of MIF in the development of hippocampus. Therefore, we systematically checked the spatial and temporal expression pattern of MIF and characterized MIF-positive cells in hippocampus from mice aged from postnatal day 0 (P0) to 3 months. Our results showed that the lowest level of MIF protein occurred at P7 and mif mRNA increased from P0, reached a peak at P7, and stably expressed until P30 before declining dramatically at 3 months. MIF was localized in fibers of GFAP- and BLBP-positive radial glial precursor cells in dentate gyrus (DG). DCX-expressing newly generated neurons were MIF-negative. Inhibition of MIF by MIF antagonist S, R-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4, 5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester (ISO-1) reduced BrdU-positive cells. Interestingly, MIF was expressed by NeuN-positive GABAergic interneurons including parvalbumin-and Reelin-expressing cells in the DG. Neither NeuN-positive granule cells nor NeuN-positive pyramidal neurons expressed MIF. In transgenic mice, POMC-EGFP–positive immature dentate granule cells and Thy1-EGFP–positive mature granule cells were MIF-negative. Treatment of neuronal cultures with ISO-1 inhibited neurite outgrowth. Therefore, we conclude that MIF might be important for feature maintenance of neural stem cells and neurite outgrowth during hippocampal development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Gut Metabolite TMAO Induces Synaptic Plasticity Deficits by Promoting Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00138</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dysbiosis of gut microbiota is strongly associated with metabolic diseases including diabetes mellitus, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Recent studies indicate that Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbe-dependent metabolite is implicated in the development of age-related cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms of the impact of TMAO on neuronal function has not been elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between TMAO and deficits in synaptic plasticity in an Alzheimer’s model (3×Tg-AD) and insulin resistance (Leptin deficient db/db) mouse by measuring plasma and brain levels of TMAO. We observed increased TMAO levels in the plasma and brain of both db/db and 3×Tg-AD mice in comparison to wild-type mice. Besides, TMAO levels further increased as mice progressed in age. Deficits in synaptic plasticity, in the form of reduced long-term potentiation (LTP), were noted in both groups of mice in comparison to wild-type mice. To further explore the impact of TMAO on neuronal function, we utilized an ex-vivo model by incubating wild-type hippocampal brain slices with TMAO and found impaired synaptic transmission. We observed that TMAO induced the PERK-EIF2α-ER stress signaling axis in TMAO treated ex-vivo slices as well as in both db/db and 3×Tg-AD mice. Lastly, we also observed altered presynaptic and reduced postsynaptic receptor expression. Our findings suggest that TMAO may induce deficits in synaptic plasticity through the ER stress-mediated PERK signaling pathway. Our results offer novel insight into the mechanism by which TMAO may induce cognitive deficits by promoting ER stress and identifies potential targets for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: P2X7 Receptor-Dependent microRNA Expression Profile in the Brain Following Status Epilepticus in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00127</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ionotropic ATP-gated P2X7 receptor is an important contributor to inflammatory signaling cascades via the release of Interleukin-1β, as well as having roles in cell death, neuronal plasticity and the release of neurotransmitters. Accordingly, there is interest in targeting the P2X7 receptor for the treatment of epilepsy. However, the signaling pathways downstream of P2X7 receptor activation remain incompletely understood. Notably, recent studies showed that P2X7 receptor expression is controlled, in part, by microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we explored P2X7 receptor-dependent microRNA expression by comparing microRNA expression profiles of wild-type (wt) and P2X7 receptor knockout mice before and after status epilepticus. Genome-wide microRNA profiling was performed using hippocampi from wt and P2X7 receptor knockout mice following status epilepticus induced by intra-amygdala kainic acid. This revealed that the genetic deletion of the P2X7 receptor results in distinct patterns of microRNA expression. Specifically, we found that in vehicle-injected control mice, the lack of the P2X7 receptor resulted in the up-regulation of 50 microRNAs and down-regulation of 35 microRNAs. Post-status epilepticus, P2X7 receptor deficiency led to the up-regulation of 44 microRNAs while 13 microRNAs were down-regulated. Moreover, there was only limited overlap among identified P2X7 receptor-dependent microRNAs between control conditions and post-status epilepticus, suggesting that the P2X7 receptor regulates the expression of different microRNAs during normal physiology and pathology. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that genes targeted by P2X7 receptor-dependent microRNAs were particularly overrepresented in pathways involved in intracellular signaling, inflammation, and cell death; processes that have been repeatedly associated with P2X7 receptor activation. Moreover, whereas genes involved in signaling pathways and inflammation were common among up- and down-regulated P2X7 receptor-dependent microRNAs during physiological and pathological conditions, genes associated with cell death seemed to be restricted to up-regulated microRNAs during both physiological conditions and post-status epilepticus. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the P2X7 receptor impacts on the expression profile of microRNAs in the brain, thereby possibly contributing to both the maintenance of normal cellular homeostasis and pathological processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Analyzing and Decoding Natural Reach-and-Grasp Actions Using Gel, Water and Dry EEG Systems</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00849</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reaching and grasping is an essential part of everybody’s life, it allows meaningful interaction with the environment and is key to independent lifestyle. Recent electroencephalogram (EEG)-based studies have already shown that neural correlates of natural reach-and-grasp actions can be identified in the EEG. However, it is still in question whether these results obtained in a laboratory environment can make the transition to mobile applicable EEG systems for home use. In the current study, we investigated whether EEG-based correlates of natural reach-and-grasp actions can be successfully identified and decoded using mobile EEG systems, namely the water-based EEG-Versatile&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; system and the dry-electrodes EEG-Hero&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; headset. In addition, we also analyzed gel-based recordings obtained in a laboratory environment (g.USBamp/g.Ladybird, gold standard), which followed the same experimental parameters. For each recording system, 15 study participants performed 80 self-initiated reach-and-grasp actions toward a glass (palmar grasp) and a spoon (lateral grasp). Our results confirmed that EEG-based correlates of reach-and-grasp actions can be successfully identified using these mobile systems. In a single-trial multiclass-based decoding approach, which incorporated both movement conditions and rest, we could show that the low frequency time domain (LFTD) correlates were also decodable. Grand average peak accuracy calculated on unseen test data yielded for the water-based electrode system 62.3% (9.2% STD), whereas for the dry-electrodes headset reached 56.4% (8% STD). For the gel-based electrode system 61.3% (8.6% STD) could be achieved. To foster and promote further investigations in the field of EEG-based movement decoding, as well as to allow the interested community to make their own conclusions, we provide all datasets publicly available in the BNCI Horizon 2020 database (http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Functional Alterations in Resting-State Visual Networks in High-Tension Glaucoma: An Independent Component Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00330</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00330</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;High-tension glaucoma (HTG) is the most common type of primary open angle glaucoma and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the major risk factor of the disease. The aim of this study was to assess alterations in resting-state visual networks in patients with HTG and investigate the effect of elevated IOP on the visual networks.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;T1-weighted and resting-state functional MRI images were acquired from 36 HTG patients (aged 49.22 ± 15.26 years) and 20 healthy controls (aged 49.90 ± 5.62 years). Group independent component analysis (ICA) was utilized to evaluate altered functional connectivity (FC) in resting-state visual networks between HTG patients and healthy controls. Pearson correlation analysis between mean IOP and altered FCs in the visual networks was performed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;ICA demonstrated decreased FCs in HTG group in the left calcarine cortex of the lateral visual network, in the bilateral lingual gyrus of the medial visual network and in the bilateral lingual gyrus of the occipital visual network compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed negative correlation between mean IOP and altered FC within the lateral visual network.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The results suggested reduced FCs between primary and higher visual cortices in HTG brain. The IOP elevation might be responsible for the functional alterations in the visual networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: A Special Cranial Nucleus (CSF-Contacting Nucleus) in Primates</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00053</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00053</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;There is a unique nucleus (CSF-contacting nucleus) in the brain of rat. It has been demonstrated in our previous research. The extraordinary feature of this nucleus is that it is not connected to any parenchymal organ but to the CSF. In primates, however, the presence or absence of this nucleus has not been proven. Confirmation of the presence of this nucleus in primates will provide the structural basis for brain-CSF communication and help to understand the neurohumoral regulatory mechanisms in humans.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The tracer cholera toxin B subunit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (CB-HRP) was injected into the CSF in the lateral ventricle (LV) of primate rhesus monkeys. After 48 h, the monkeys were perfused and the brain was dissected out, and sectioned for CB-HRP staining. The CB-HRP positive structures were observed under confocal and electron microscopy. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the CB-HRP positive neurons cluster was reconstructed by computer software.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;(1) CB-HRP labeling is confined within the ventricle, but not leakage into the brain parenchyma. (2) From the midbrain inferior colliculus superior border plane ventral to the aqueduct to the upper part of the fourth ventricle (4V) floor, a large number of CB-HRP positive neurons are consistently located, form a cluster, and are symmetrically located on both sides of the midline. (3) 3D reconstruction shows that the CB-HRP positive neurons cluster in the monkey brain occupies certain space. The rostral part is large and caudal part is thin appearing a “rivet”-like shape. (4) Under electron microscopy, the CB-HRP positive neurons show different types of synaptic connections with the non-CSF-contacting structures in the brain. Some of the processes stretch directly into the ventricle cavity.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Same as we did in rats, the CSF-contacting nucleus is also existed in the primate brain parenchyma. We also recommend listing it as the XIII pair of cranial nucleus, which is specialized in the communications between the brain and the CSF. It is significant to the completing of innervation in the organism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Disrupted Functional Network Connectivity Predicts Cognitive Impairment in Presbycusis Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00246</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00246</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: Individuals with presbycusis often show deficits in cognitive function, however, the exact neurophysiological mechanisms are not well understood. This study explored the alterations in intra- and inter-network functional connectivity (FC) of multiple networks in presbycusis patients, and further correlated FC with cognitive assessment scores to assess their ability to predict cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was performed in 40 presbycusis patients and 40 matched controls, and 12 resting-state networks (RSNs) were identified by independent component analysis (ICA) approach. A two-sample t-test was carried out to detect the intra-network FC differences, and functional network connectivity (FNC) was calculated to compare the inter-network FC differences. Pearson or Spearman correlation analysis was subsequently used to explore the correlation between altered FC and cognitive assessment scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our study demonstrated that patients with presbycusis showed significantly decreased FC in the subcortical limbic network (scLN), default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), and attention network (AN) compared with the control group. Moreover, the connectivity for scLN-AUN (auditory network) and VN (visual network)-DMN were found significantly increased while AN-DMN was found significantly decreased in presbycusis patients. Ultimately, this study revealed the intra- and inter-network alterations associated with some cognitive assessment scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study observed intra- and inter-network FC alterations in presbycusis patients, and investigated that presbycusis can lead to abnormal connectivity of RSNs and plasticity compensation mechanism, which may be the basis of cognitive impairment, suggesting that FNC can be used to predict potential cognitive impairment in their early stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Aging Slopes of Brain Structures Vary by Ethnicity and Sex: Evidence From a Large Magnetic Resonance Imaging Dataset From a Single Scanner of Cognitively Healthy Elderly People in Korea</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00233</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aging of the brain is a well-investigated topic, but existing analyses have mainly focused on Caucasian samples. To investigate brain aging in East Asians, we measured cortical and subcortical volumes from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 1,008 cognitively normal elderly Koreans from the Gwangju Alzheimer’s and Related Dementia cohort and 342 Caucasians from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. To determine whether the aging effect varies with ethnicity and sex, beta coefficients of age and confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated in each ethnicity–sex group using a bootstrap method and a regression analysis using the relative volume to intracranial volume as predicted. The betas or aging slopes largely were not significantly different between ethnicity and sex groups in most types of brain structures. However, ethnic differences between the two female groups were found in the brain, most cortical regions, and a few subcortical regions. Ethnic differences in brain aging are likely due in large part to genetic factors; thus, we compared carriers and non-carriers of a gene relevant to longevity and neurodegenerative diseases, such as apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4. The regions with ethnic differences in women also showed significant differences between Korean APOE ε4 non-carriers and Caucasian APOE ε4 carriers. Furthermore, Caucasian women showed significant APOE ε4 effects in the largest number of regions. These results illustrate that much of the ethnic differences in females may be explained by synergistic effects of ethnic background and APOE ε4 carrier status. Our results suggest that sex-dependent differences of aging between ethnic backgrounds may be due to ethnicity-dependent effects of genetic risk factors, such as APOE ε4. We also presented the normative information on volume estimates of the brain structures of the elderly Korean people in the subdivided age groups. This normative information of the aging brain stratified by ethnicity provides the age-related reference ranges quantified to replace visual judgment and facilitate precise clinical decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Gray Matter Alterations in Parkinson's Disease With Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder: A Meta-Analysis of Voxel-Based Morphometry Studies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00213</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00213</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Gray matter (GM) alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) have been demonstrated in many neuroimaging studies using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). However, the inconsistent findings between studies cannot be applied to clinical practice as a neuroimaging biomarker. We performed a meta-analysis of VBM studies at a whole-brain level to investigate GM differences between PD patients with and without RBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from inception to November 2019 to identify eligible VBM studies. We adopted the latest Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images technique to quantitatively estimate the difference of regional GM volume between PD patients with and without RBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We included five studies comprising 105 PD patients with RBD and 140 PD patients without RBD. The pooled meta-analysis revealed that PD patients with RBD showed a significant reduction of GM volume in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) compared with those without RBD. This result was confirmed to be robust by the jackknife sensitivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our finding shows significantly and robustly reduced GM volume in the right STG in PD patients with RBD, preliminarily suggesting the association of GM atrophy in this brain region with the occurrence of RBD in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Male-predominant galanin mediates androgen-dependent aggressive chases in medaka</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59470</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59470</link>
	<description>Recent studies in mice demonstrate that a subset of neurons in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) that express galanin play crucial roles in regulating parental behavior in both sexes. However, little information is available on the function of galanin in social behaviors in other species. Here, we report that, in medaka, a subset of MPOA galanin neurons occurred nearly exclusively in males, resulting from testicular androgen stimulation. Galanin-deficient medaka showed a greatly reduced incidence of male–male aggressive chases. Furthermore, while treatment of female medaka with androgen induced male-typical aggressive acts, galanin deficiency in these females attenuated the effect of androgen on chases. Given their male-biased and androgen-dependent nature, the subset of MPOA galanin neurons most likely mediate androgen-dependent male–male chases. Histological studies further suggested that variability in the projection targets of the MPOA galanin neurons may account for the species-dependent functional differences in these evolutionarily conserved neural substrates.</description>

	<title>eLife: Alterations of specific cortical GABAergic circuits underlie abnormal network activity in a mouse model of Down syndrome</title>

	<description>Down syndrome (DS) results in various degrees of cognitive deficits. In DS mouse models, recovery of behavioral and neurophysiological deficits using GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonists led to hypothesize an excessive activity of inhibitory circuits in this condition. Nonetheless, whether over-inhibition is present in DS and whether this is due to specific alterations of distinct GABAergic circuits is unknown. In the prefrontal cortex of Ts65Dn mice (a well-established DS model), we found that the dendritic synaptic inhibitory loop formed by somatostatin-positive Martinotti cells (MCs) and pyramidal neurons (PNs) was strongly enhanced, with no alteration in their excitability. Conversely, perisomatic inhibition from parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons was unaltered, but PV cells of DS mice lost their classical fast-spiking phenotype and exhibited increased excitability. These microcircuit alterations resulted in reduced pyramidal-neuron firing and increased phase locking to cognitive-relevant network oscillations &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These results define important synaptic and circuit mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunctions in DS.</description>

	<description>The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) was published in 2013 and described how funding agencies, institutions, publishers, organizations that supply metrics, and individual researchers could better evaluate the outputs of scientific research. Since then DORA has evolved into an active initiative that gives practical advice to institutions on new ways to assess and evaluate research. This article outlines a framework for driving institutional change that was developed at a meeting convened by DORA and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The framework has four broad goals: understanding the obstacles to changes in the way research is assessed; experimenting with different approaches; creating a shared vision when revising existing policies and practices; and communicating that vision on campus and beyond.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Efferent feedback enforces bilateral coupling of spontaneous activity in the developing auditory system</title>

	<description>In the developing auditory system, spontaneous activity generated in the cochleae propagates into the central nervous system to promote circuit formation before hearing onset. Effects of the evolving peripheral firing pattern on spontaneous activity in the central auditory system are not well understood. Here, we describe the wide-spread bilateral coupling of spontaneous activity that coincides with the period of transient efferent modulation of inner hair cells from the medial olivochlear (MOC) system. Knocking out the alpha9/alpha10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a requisite part of the efferent cholinergic pathway, abolishes these bilateral correlations. Pharmacological and chemogenetic experiments confirm that the MOC system is necessary and sufficient to produce the bilateral coupling. Moreover, auditory sensitivity at hearing onset is reduced in the absence of pre-hearing efferent modulation. Together, our results demonstrate how ascending and descending pathways collectively shape spontaneous activity patterns in the auditory system and reveal the essential role of the MOC efferent system in linking otherwise independent streams of bilateral spontaneous activity during the prehearing period.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Midkine in chick and mouse retinas: neuroprotection, glial reactivity and the formation of Müller glia-derived progenitor cells</title>

	<description>Recent studies have shown that midkine (MDK), a basic heparin-binding growth factor, is involved in the development and regeneration of the zebrafish retina. However, very little is known about MDK in the retinas of warm-blooded vertebrates. We investigate the expression patterns of MDK and related factors, roles in neuronal survival, and influence upon the formation of Muller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) in chick and mouse model systems. By using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), we find that MDK and related factors are dynamically expressed by maturing MG and by MG in retinas damaged by NMDA or treated with insulin and FGF2. Interestingly, MDK is significantly up-regulated by MG in damaged chick retinas, but down-regulated by MG in damaged mouse retinas. In both chick and mouse retinas, exogenous MDK selectively up-regulates cFOS and pS6 (a readout of mTOR-signaling) in Muller glia. In the chick, intraocular injections of MDK before injury decrease numbers of dying cells, decrease microglial reactivity, decrease the accumulation of Non-astrocytic Inner Retinal Glial (NIRG) cells, and decrease numbers of proliferating MGPCs. Addition of MDK signaling inhibitor sodium vanadate following retinal injury reverses these effects to increase the number of dying cells, accumulation of NIRG cells, and decrease the number of proliferating MGPCs. Inhibitors of PP2A and Pak1 had specific inhibitory effects on MGPC formation. In mice, MDK administration with NMDA damage drives a small but significant increase in MGPCs. We conclude that MDK expression is dynamically regulated in reactive Muller glia and during reprogramming into MGPCs. MDK acts to coordinate glial activity, neuronal survival, and may act in an autocrine manner to influence the re-programming of Muller glia into proliferating MGPCs.</description>

	<description>Visual working memory (WM) storage is largely independent between the left and right visual hemifields/cerebral hemispheres, yet somehow WM feels seamless. We studied how WM is integrated across hemifields by recording neural activity bilaterally from lateral prefrontal cortex. An instructed saccade during the WM delay shifted the remembered location from one hemifield to the other. Before the shift, spike rates and oscillatory power showed clear signatures of memory laterality. After the shift, the lateralization inverted, consistent with transfer of the memory trace from one hemisphere to the other. Transferred traces initially used different neural ensembles from feedforward-induced ones but they converged at the end of the delay. Around the time of transfer, synchrony between the two prefrontal hemispheres peaked in theta and low-gamma frequencies, with a directionality consistent with memory trace transfer. This illustrates how dynamics between the two cortical hemispheres can stitch together WM traces across visual hemifields.</description>

	<description>L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (LVGCCs) are important regulators of neuronal activity and are widely expressed throughout the brain. One of the major LVGCC isoforms in the brain is CaV1.3. Mice lacking CaV1.3 (CaV1.3 KO) have impairments in fear conditioning and depressive-like behaviors, which have been linked to the role of CaV1.3 in hippocampal and amygdala function. Genetic variation in CaV1.3 has been linked to a variety of psychiatric disorders, including autism and schizophrenia, which are associated with motor, learning, and social deficits. Here, we explored whether CaV1.3 plays a role in these behaviors. We found that CaV1.3 KO mice have deficits in rotarod learning despite normal locomotor function. Deletion of CaV1.3 is also associated with impaired associative learning on the Erasmus Ladder. We did not observe any impairments in CaV1.3 KO mice on assays of anxiety-like, depression-like, or social preference behaviors. Our results suggest an important role for CaV1.3 in neural circuits involved in motor learning and concur with previous data showing its involvement in associative learning.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: CAP1 and cofilin1 cooperate in neuronal actin dynamics, growth cone function and neuron connectivity</title>

	<description>Neuron connectivity depends on growth cones that navigate axons through the developing brain. Growth cones protrude and retract actin-rich structures to sense guidance cues. These cues control local actin dynamics and steer growth cones towards attractants and away from repellents, thereby directing axon outgrowth. Hence, actin binding proteins (ABPs) moved into the focus as critical regulators of neuron connectivity. We found cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1), an ABP with unknown brain function, abundant in growth cones. Super-resolution microscopy and live cell imaging combined with pharmacological approaches on hippocampal neurons from gene-targeted mice revealed a crucial role for CAP1 in actin dynamics that is critical for growth cone morphology and function. Growth cone defects in mutant neurons compromised neuron differentiation and was associated with impaired neuron connectivity in CAP1 mutant brains. Mechanistically, we found that CAP1 and cofilin1 synergistically control growth cone actin dynamic and morphology. Together, we identified CAP1 as a novel actin regulator in growth cone that is relevant for neuron connectivity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The biophysical basis underlying the maintenance of early phase long-term potentiation</title>

	<description>The maintenance of synaptic changes resulting from long-term potentiation (LTP) is essential for brain functions. Different LTP phases have been associated with diverse molecular processes and pathways, and the molecular underpinnings of LTP on the time scales of a few minutes or of several hours are well established. However, the principles underlying the maintenance of the early phase of LTP (E-LTP) on the intermediate time scale of 1-6 hours remains elusive. We hypothesize that specific features of postsynaptic receptor trafficking would be responsible for sustaining synaptic changes during this LTP phase. We test this hypothesis by formalizing a biophysical model that integrates several experimentally-motivated mechanisms. The model captures a wide range of experimental findings and predicts that synaptic changes are preserved for hours when the receptor dynamics are shaped by the interplay of structural changes of the spine in conjunction with increased trafficking from recycling endosomes and the cooperative binding of receptors. Furthermore, our model provides several predictions to verify experimentally our findings.</description>

	<description>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease affecting social behavior. Many of the high-confident ASD risk genes relate to mRNA translation. Specifically, many of these genes are involved in regulation of gene expression for subcellular compartmentalization of proteins. Cis-regulatory motifs that often localize to 3'- and 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs) offer an additional path for posttranscriptional control of gene expression. Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) affect 3'UTR length thereby influencing the presence or absence of regulatory elements. However, APA has not yet been addressed in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we used single cell 3'end sequencing to examine changes in 3'UTRs along the differentiation from neural stem cells (NSCs) to neuroblasts within the adult brain. We identified many APA events in genes involved in neurodevelopment, many of them being high confidence ASD risk genes. Further, analysis of 3'UTR lengths in single cells from ASD and healthy individuals detected longer 3'UTRs in ASD patients. Motif analysis of modulated 3'UTRs in the mouse adult neurogenic lineage and ASD-patients revealed enrichment of the cytoplasmic and polyadenylation element (CPE). This motif is bound by CPE binding protein 4 (CPEB4). In human and mouse data sets we observed co-regulation of CPEB4 and the CPEB-binding synaptic adhesion molecule amyloid beta precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1). We show that mice deficient in APLP1 show aberrant regulation of APA, decreased number of neural stem cells, and autistic-like traits. Our findings indicate that APA is used for control of gene expression along neuronal differentiation and is altered in ASD patients.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Order matters: How covert value updating during sequential option sampling shapes economic preference</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Chen Hu, Philippe Domenech, Mathias Pessiglione&lt;/p&gt;

Standard neuroeconomic decision theory assumes that choice is based on a value comparison process, independent from how information about alternative options is collected. Here, we investigate the opposite intuition that preferences are dynamically shaped as options are sampled, through iterative covert pairwise comparisons. Our model builds on two lines of research, one suggesting that a natural frame of comparison for the brain is between default and alternative options, the other suggesting that comparisons spread preferences between options. We therefore assumed that during sequential option sampling, people would 1) covertly compare every new alternative to the current best and 2) update their values such that the winning (losing) option receives a positive (negative) bonus. We confronted this “covert pairwise comparison” model to models derived from standard decision theory and from known memory effects. Our model provided the best account of human choice behavior in a novel task where participants (n = 92 in total) had to browse through a sequence of items (food, music or movie) of variable length and ultimately select their favorite option. Consistently, the order of option presentation, which was manipulated by design, had a significant influence on the eventual choice: the best option was more likely to be chosen when it came earlier in the sequence, because it won more covert comparisons (hence a greater total bonus). Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of how the option sampling process shapes economic preference, which should be integrated into decision theory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Vlknqot9jVc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Tissue vibrations in the larynx produce most sounds that comprise vocal communication in mammals. Larynx morphology is thus predicted to be a key target for selection, particularly in species with highly developed vocal communication systems. Here, we present a novel database of digitally modeled scanned larynges from 55 different mammalian species, representing a wide range of body sizes in the primate and carnivoran orders. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we demonstrate that the primate larynx has evolved more rapidly than the carnivoran larynx, resulting in a pattern of larger size and increased deviation from expected allometry with body size. These results imply fundamental differences between primates and carnivorans in the balance of selective forces that constrain larynx size and highlight an evolutionary flexibility in primates that may help explain why we have developed complex and diverse uses of the vocal organ for communication.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MrGQspFPUS8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Working Memory is the brain module that holds and manipulates information
online. In this work, we design a hybrid model in which a simple feed-forward
network is coupled to a balanced random network via a read-write vector called
the interface vector. First, we consider some simple memory binding tasks in
which the output is set to be a copy of the given input and a selective
sequence of previous inputs online. Next, we design a more complex binding task
based on a cue that encodes binding relations. The important result is that our
dual-component model of working memory shows good performance with learning
restricted to the feed-forward component only. Here we take advantage of the
random network property without learning. To our knowledge, this is the first
time that random networks as a flexible memory is shown to play an important
role in online binding tasks. We may interpret our results as a candidate model
of working memory in which the feed-forward network learns to interact with the
temporary storage random network as an attentional-controlling executive
system.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Automatic industrial scheduling, aiming at optimizing the sequence of jobs
over limited resources, is widely needed in manufacturing industries. However,
existing scheduling systems heavily rely on heuristic algorithms, which either
generate ineffective solutions or compute inefficiently when job scale
increases. Thus, it is of great importance to develop new large-scale
algorithms that are not only efficient and effective, but also capable of
satisfying complex constraints in practice. In this paper, we propose a Bilevel
Deep reinforcement learning Scheduler, \textit{BDS}, in which the higher level
is responsible for exploring an initial global sequence, whereas the lower
level is aiming at exploitation for partial sequence refinements, and the two
levels are connected by a sliding-window sampling mechanism. In the
implementation, a Double Deep Q Network (DDQN) is used in the upper level and
Graph Pointer Network (GPN) lies within the lower level. After the theoretical
guarantee for the convergence of BDS, we evaluate it in an industrial automatic
warehouse scenario, with job number up to $5000$ in each production line. It is
shown that our proposed BDS significantly outperforms two most used heuristics,
three strong deep networks, and another bilevel baseline approach. In
particular, compared with the most used greedy-based heuristic algorithm in
real world which takes nearly an hour, our BDS can decrease the makespan by
27.5\%, 28.6\% and 22.1\% for 3 largest datasets respectively, with
computational time less than 200 seconds.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the past decades, the rapid growth of computer and database technologies
has led to the rapid growth of large-scale datasets. On the other hand, data
mining applications with high dimensional datasets that require high speed and
accuracy are rapidly increasing. An important issue with these applications is
the curse of dimensionality, where the number of features is much higher than
the number of patterns. One of the dimensionality reduction approaches is
feature selection that can increase the accuracy of the data mining task and
reduce its computational complexity. The feature selection method aims at
selecting a subset of features with the lowest inner similarity and highest
relevancy to the target class. It reduces the dimensionality of the data by
eliminating irrelevant, redundant, or noisy data. In this paper, a comparative
analysis of different feature selection methods is presented, and a general
categorization of these methods is performed. Moreover, in this paper,
state-of-the-art swarm intelligence are studied, and the recent feature
selection methods based on these algorithms are reviewed. Furthermore, the
strengths and weaknesses of the different studied swarm intelligence-based
feature selection methods are evaluated.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper has two purposes. One is to demonstrate contextuality analysis of
systems of epistemic random variables. The other is to evaluate the performance
of a new, hierarchical version of the measure of (non)contextuality introduced
in earlier publications. As objects of analysis we use impossible figures of
the kind created by the Penroses and Escher. We make no assumptions as to how
an impossible figure is perceived, taking it instead as a fixed physical object
allowing one of several deterministic descriptions. Systems of epistemic random
variables are obtained by probabilistically mixing these deterministic systems.
This probabilistic mixture reflects our uncertainty or lack of knowledge rather
than random variability in the frequentist sense.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Using Neural Networks and Diversifying Differential Evolution for Dynamic Optimisation. (arXiv:2008.04002v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic optimisation occurs in a variety of real-world problems. To tackle
these problems, evolutionary algorithms have been extensively used due to their
effectiveness and minimum design effort. However, for dynamic problems, extra
mechanisms are required on top of standard evolutionary algorithms. Among them,
diversity mechanisms have proven to be competitive in handling dynamism, and
recently, the use of neural networks have become popular for this purpose.
Considering the complexity of using neural networks in the process compared to
simple diversity mechanisms, we investigate whether they are competitive and
the possibility of integrating them to improve the results. However, for a fair
comparison, we need to consider the same time budget for each algorithm. Thus,
instead of the usual number of fitness evaluations as the measure for the
available time between changes, we use wall clock timing. The results show the
significance of the improvement when integrating the neural network and
diversity mechanisms depends on the type and the frequency of changes.
Moreover, we observe that for differential evolution, having a proper diversity
in population when using neural networks plays a key role in the neural
network's ability to improve the results.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: When words collide: Bayesian meta-analyses of distractor and target properties in the picture-word interference paradigm. (arXiv:2008.03972v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03972</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03972</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the picture-word interference paradigm, participants name pictures while
ignoring a written or spoken distractor word. Naming times to the pictures are
slowed down by the presence of the distractor word. Various properties of the
distractor modulate this slow down, for example naming times are shorter with
frequent vs. infrequent distractors. Building on this line of research, the
present study investigates in more detail the impact of distractor and target
word properties on picture naming times. We report the results of several
Bayesian meta-analyses, based on 35 datasets. The aim of the first analysis was
to obtain an estimation of the size of the distractor frequency effect, and of
its precision, in typical picture-word interference experiments where this
variable is not manipulated. The analysis shows that a one-unit increase in log
frequency results in response times to the pictures decreasing by about 4ms
(95% Credible Interval: [-6, -2]). With the second and third analyses, we show
that after accounting for the effect of frequency, two variables known to
influence processing times in visual word processing tasks also influence
picture naming times: distractor length and orthographic neighborhood. Finally,
we found that distractor word frequency and target word frequency interact; the
effect of distractor frequency decreases as the frequency of the target word
increases. We discuss the theoretical and methodological implications of these
findings, as well as the importance of obtaining high-precision estimates of
experimental effects.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a novel machine learning architecture that uses the exponential of
a single input-dependent matrix as its only nonlinearity. The mathematical
simplicity of this architecture allows a detailed analysis of its behaviour,
providing robustness guarantees via Lipschitz bounds. Despite its simplicity, a
single matrix exponential layer already provides universal approximation
properties and can learn fundamental functions of the input, such as periodic
functions or multivariate polynomials. This architecture outperforms other
general-purpose architectures on benchmark problems, including CIFAR-10, using
substantially fewer parameters.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Databases of directed- and weighted- connectivity for mouse, macaque and
marmoset monkeys, have recently become available and begun to be used to build
dynamical models. A hierarchical organization can be defined based on laminar
patterns of cortical connections, possibly improved by thalamocortical
projections. A large-scale model of the macaque cortex endowed with a laminar
structure accounts for layer-dependent and frequency-modulated interplays
between bottom-up and top-down processes. Signal propagation in a version of
the model with spiking neurons displays a threshold of stimulus amplitude for
the activity to gain access to the prefrontal cortex, reminiscent of the
ignition phenomenon associated with conscious perception. These two examples
illustrate how connectomics may inform theory leading to discoveries.
Computational modeling raises open questions for future empirical research, in
a back-and-forth collaboration of experimentalists and theorists.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Randomness Evaluation of a Genetic Algorithm for Image Encryption: A Signal Processing Approach. (arXiv:2008.03681v1 [cs.CR])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03681</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03681</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper a randomness evaluation of a block cipher for secure image
communication is presented. The GFHT cipher is a genetic algorithm, that
combines gene fusion (GF) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) both inspired from
antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The symmetric encryption key is generated by
four pairs of chromosomes with multi-layer random sequences. The encryption
starts by a GF of the principal key-agent in a single block, then HGT performs
obfuscation where the genes are pixels and the chromosomes are the rows and
columns. A Salt extracted from the image hash-value is used to implement
one-time pad (OTP) scheme, hence a modification of one pixel generates a
different encryption key without changing the main passphrase or key.
Therefore, an extreme avalanche effect of 99% is achieved. Randomness
evaluation based on random matrix theory, power spectral density, avalanche
effect, 2D auto-correlation, pixels randomness tests and chi-square hypotheses
testing show that encrypted images adopt the statistical behavior of uniform
white noise; hence validating the theoretical model by experimental results.
Moreover, performance comparison with chaos-genetic ciphers shows the merit of
the GFHT algorithm.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bio-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs), operating with asynchronous
binary signals (or spikes) distributed over time, can potentially lead to
greater computational efficiency on event-driven hardware. The state-of-the-art
SNNs suffer from high inference latency, resulting from inefficient input
encoding, and sub-optimal settings of the neuron parameters (firing threshold,
and membrane leak). We propose DIET-SNN, a low latency deep spiking network
that is trained with gradient descent to optimize the membrane leak and the
firing threshold along with other network parameters (weights). The membrane
leak and threshold for each layer of the SNN are optimized with end-to-end
backpropagation to achieve competitive accuracy at reduced latency. The analog
pixel values of an image are directly applied to the input layer of DIET-SNN
without the need to convert to spike-train. The information is converted into
spikes in the first convolutional layer where leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF)
neurons integrate the weighted inputs and generate an output spike when the
membrane potential crosses the trained firing threshold. The trained membrane
leak controls the flow of input information and attenuates irrelevant inputs to
increase the activation sparsity in the convolutional and linear layers of the
network. The reduced latency combined with high activation sparsity provides
large improvements in computational efficiency. We evaluate DIET-SNN on image
classification tasks from CIFAR and ImageNet datasets on VGG and ResNet
architectures. We achieve top-1 accuracy of 66.52% with 25 timesteps (inference
latency) on the ImageNet dataset with 3.1X less compute energy than an
equivalent standard ANN. Additionally, DIET-SNN performs 5-100X faster
inference compared to other state-of-the-art SNN models.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: State-Dependent and Bandwidth-Specific Effects of Ketamine and Propofol on Electroencephalographic Complexity in Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00050</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00050</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is an ongoing debate as to whether ketamine anesthesia suppresses neurophysiologic complexity at doses sufficient for surgical anesthesia, with previous human studies reporting surrogates of both suppressed and preserved levels of cortical complexity. However, these studies have not assessed cortical dynamics in higher gamma frequencies, which have previously been demonstrated to correlate with the level of consciousness during anesthesia. In this study, we used Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZc) to characterize frontal and parietal electroencephalographic complexity (0.5–175 Hz, 0.5–55 Hz, 65–175 Hz) before, during, and after ketamine or propofol anesthesia in the rat. To control for the potential influence of spectral changes in complexity estimation, LZc was normalized with phase-shuffled surrogate data. We demonstrate that ketamine and propofol anesthesia were characterized by a significant reduction in broadband (0.5–175 Hz) LZc. Further analysis showed that while the reduction of LZc during ketamine anesthesia was significant in 65–175 Hz range, during propofol anesthesia, a significant decrease was observed in 0.5–55 Hz bandwidth. LZc in broadband and 0.5–55 Hz range showed a significant increase during emergence from ketamine anesthesia. Phase-shuffled normalized LZc revealed that (1) decrease in complexity during ketamine and propofol anesthesia—not increase in complexity during emergence—were dissociable from the influence of spectral changes, and (2) reduced LZc during ketamine anesthesia was present across all three bandwidths. Ketamine anesthesia was characterized by reduced complexity in high gamma bandwidth, as reflected in both raw and phase-shuffled normalized LZc, which suggests that reduced high gamma complexity is a neurophysiological feature of ketamine anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that results in social-communication impairments, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors. Moreover, ASD is more prevalent in males, with a male to female ratio of 4 to 1. Although the underlying etiology of ASD is generally unknown, recent advances in genome sequencing have facilitated the identification of a host of associated genes. Among these, synaptic proteins such as cell adhesion molecules have been strongly linked with ASD. Interestingly, many large genome sequencing studies exclude sex chromosomes, which leads to a shift in focus toward autosomal genes as targets for ASD research. However, there are many genes on the X chromosome that encode synaptic proteins, including strong candidate genes. Here, we review findings regarding two members of the neuroligin (NLGN) family of postsynaptic adhesion molecules, NLGN3 and NLGN4. Neuroligins have multiple isoforms (NLGN1-4), which are both autosomal and sex-linked. The sex-linked genes, NLGN3 and NLGN4, are both on the X chromosome and were among the first few genes to be linked with ASD and intellectual disability (ID). In addition, there is a less studied human neuroligin on the Y chromosome, NLGN4Y, which forms an X-Y pair with NLGN4X. We will discuss recent findings of these neuroligin isoforms regarding function at the synapse in both rodent models and human-derived differentiated neurons, and highlight the exciting challenges moving forward to a better understanding of ASD/ID.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The presynaptic compartment of the chemical synapse is a small, yet extremely complex structure. Considering its size, most methods of optical microscopy are not able to resolve its nanoarchitecture and dynamics. Thus, its ultrastructure could only be studied by electron microscopy. In the last decade, new methods of optical superresolution microscopy have emerged allowing the study of cellular structures and processes at the nanometer scale. While this is a welcome addition to the experimental arsenal, it has necessitated careful analysis and interpretation to ensure the data obtained remains artifact-free. In this article we review the application of nanoscopic techniques to the study of the synapse and the progress made over the last decade with a particular focus on the presynapse. We find to our surprise that progress has been limited, calling for imaging techniques and probes that allow dense labeling, multiplexing, longer imaging times, higher temporal resolution, while at least maintaining the spatial resolution achieved thus far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Anxiety and Startle Phenotypes in Glrb Spastic and Glra1 Spasmodic Mouse Mutants</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A GWAS study recently demonstrated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human GLRB gene of individuals with a prevalence for agoraphobia. GLRB encodes the glycine receptor (GlyRs) β subunit. The identified SNPs are localized within the gene flanking regions (3′ and 5′ UTRs) and intronic regions. It was suggested that these nucleotide polymorphisms modify GlyRs expression and phenotypic behavior in humans contributing to an anxiety phenotype as a mild form of hyperekplexia. Hyperekplexia is a human neuromotor disorder with massive startle phenotypes due to mutations in genes encoding GlyRs subunits. GLRA1 mutations have been more commonly observed than GLRB mutations. If an anxiety phenotype contributes to the hyperekplexia disease pattern has not been investigated yet. Here, we compared two mouse models harboring either a mutation in the murine Glra1 or Glrb gene with regard to anxiety and startle phenotypes. Homozygous spasmodic animals carrying a Glra1 point mutation (alanine 52 to serine) displayed abnormally enhanced startle responses. Moreover, spasmodic mice exhibited significant changes in fear-related behaviors (freezing, rearing and time spent on back) analyzed during the startle paradigm, even in a neutral context. Spastic mice exhibit reduced expression levels of the full-length GlyRs β subunit due to aberrant splicing of the Glrb gene. Heterozygous animals appear normal without an obvious behavioral phenotype and thus might reflect the human situation analyzed in the GWAS study on agoraphobia and startle. In contrast to spasmodic mice, heterozygous spastic animals revealed no startle phenotype in a neutral as well as a conditioning context. Other mechanisms such as a modulatory function of the GlyRs β subunit within glycinergic circuits in neuronal networks important for fear and fear-related behavior may exist. Possibly, in human additional changes in fear and fear-related circuits either due to gene-gene interactions e.g., with GLRA1 genes or epigenetic factors are necessary to create the agoraphobia and in particular the startle phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Vestibular Modulation of Long-Term Potentiation and NMDA Receptor Expression in the Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00140</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Loss of vestibular function is known to cause spatial memory deficits and hippocampal dysfunction, in terms of impaired place cell firing and abnormal theta rhythm. Based on these results, it has been of interest to determine whether vestibular loss also affects the development and maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. This article summarizes and critically reviews the studies of hippocampal LTP following a vestibular loss and its relationship to NMDA receptor expression, that have been published to date. Although the available in vitro studies indicate that unilateral vestibular loss (UVL) results in reduced hippocampal field potentials in CA1 and the dentate gyrus (DG), the in vivo studies involving bilateral vestibular loss (BVL) do not. This may be due to the differences between UVL and BVL or it could be a result of in vitro/in vivo differences. One in vitro study reported a decrease in LTP in hippocampal slices following UVL; however, the two available in vivo studies have reported different results: either no effect or an increase in EPSP/Population Spike (ES) potentiation. This discrepancy may be due to the different high-frequency stimulation (HFS) paradigms used to induce LTP. The increased ES potentiation following BVL may be related to an increase in synaptic NMDA receptors, possibly increasing the flow of vestibular input coming into CA1, with a loss of selectivity. This might cause increased excitability and synaptic noise, which might lead to a degradation of spatial learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus May Exacerbate Gray Matter Atrophy in Patients With Early-Onset Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00856</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;The precise physiopathological association between the courses of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains unclear. This study sought to comprehensively investigate the distribution characteristics of gray matter atrophy in middle-aged T2DM patients with newly diagnosed mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Four groups, including 28 patients with early-onset MCI, 28 patients with T2DM, 28 T2DM patients with early-onset MCI (T2DM-MCI), and 28 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls underwent three-dimensional high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging. Cortical and subcortical gray matter volumes were calculated, and a structural covariance method was used to evaluate the morphological relationships within the default mode network (DMN).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Overlapped and unique cortical/subcortical gray matter atrophy was found in patients with MCI, T2DM and T2DM-MCI in our study, and patients with T2DM-MCI showed lower volumes in several areas than patients with MCI or T2DM. Volume loss in subcortical areas (including the thalamus, putamen, and hippocampus), but not in cortical areas, was related to cognitive impairment in patients with MCI and T2DM-MCI. No associations between biochemical measurements and volumetric reductions were found. Furthermore, patients with MCI and those with T2DM-MCI showed disrupted structural connectivity within the DMN.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings provide further evidence that T2DM may exacerbate atrophy of specific gray matter regions, which may be primarily associated with MCI. Impairments in gray matter volume related to T2DM or MCI are independent of cardiovascular risk factors, and subcortical atrophy may play a more pivotal role in cognitive impairment than cortical alterations in patients with MCI and T2DM-MCI. The enhanced structural connectivity within the DMN in patients with T2DM-MCI may suggest a compensatory mechanism for the chronic neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Fingolimod Inhibits Inflammation but Exacerbates Brain Edema in the Acute Phases of Cerebral Ischemia in Diabetic Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00842</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00842</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background and Purpose: Diabetes mellitus increases stroke incidence and mortality and hampers functional recovery after stroke. Fingolimod has been shown to improve neurofunctional recovery and reduce brain infarction after ischemic injury in mice without comorbidities. In this work, we investigated the effects of fingolimod in diabetic mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Hyperglycemia was induced by a single bolus streptozotocin injection. Adult male ICR mice (n = 86) underwent 1-h tMCAO surgery and received intraperitoneal injection of fingolimod (1 mg/kg) or vehicle immediately after reperfusion. Clark neurological score, brain infarction and edema, blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity, apoptosis, and inflammation were evaluated at 24 h after tMCAO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Fingolimod treatment reduced the number of infiltrated inflammatory cells and lowered the mRNA level of Tnfα. It also increased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. However, fingolimod significantly aggravated brain edema and reduced the expression levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin. The negative impacts of fingolimod on BBB integrity outweighed its beneficial effects in anti-inflammation, which resulted in the lack of improvement in endpoint outcomes at 24 h after tMCAO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Caution should be taken in considering the acute treatment using fingolimod for ischemic stroke with diabetes comorbidity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Understanding the Real State of Human Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis From Studies of Rodents and Non-human Primates</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The concept of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) has been widely accepted, and a large number of studies have been performed in rodents using modern experimental techniques, which have clarified the nature and developmental processes of adult neural stem/progenitor cells, the functions of AHN, such as memory and learning, and its association with neural diseases. However, a fundamental problem is that it remains unclear as to what extent AHN actually occurs in humans. The answer to this is indispensable when physiological and pathological functions of human AHN are deduced from studies of rodent AHN, but there are controversial data on the extent of human AHN. In this review, studies on AHN performed in rodents and humans will be briefly reviewed, followed by a discussion of the studies in non-human primates. Then, how data of rodent and non-human primate AHN should be applied for understanding human AHN will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: CHIME: CMOS-Hosted in vivo Microelectrodes for Massively Scalable Neuronal Recordings</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mammalian brains consist of 10s of millions to 100s of billions of neurons operating at millisecond time scales, of which current recording techniques only capture a tiny fraction. Recording techniques capable of sampling neural activity at high spatiotemporal resolution have been difficult to scale. The most intensively studied mammalian neuronal networks, such as the neocortex, show a layered architecture, where the optimal recording technology samples densely over large areas. However, the need for application-specific designs as well as the mismatch between the three-dimensional architecture of the brain and largely two-dimensional microfabrication techniques profoundly limits both neurophysiological research and neural prosthetics. Here, we discuss a novel strategy for scalable neuronal recording by combining bundles of glass-ensheathed microwires with large-scale amplifier arrays derived from high-density CMOS in vitro MEA systems or high-speed infrared cameras. High signal-to-noise ratio (&amp;lt;25 μV RMS noise floor, SNR up to 25) is achieved due to the high conductivity of core metals in glass-ensheathed microwires allowing for ultrathin metal cores (down to &amp;lt;1 μm) and negligible stray capacitance. Multi-step electrochemical modification of the tip enables ultra-low access impedance with minimal geometric area, which is largely independent of the core diameter. We show that the microwire size can be reduced to virtually eliminate damage to the blood-brain-barrier upon insertion and we demonstrate that microwire arrays can stably record single-unit activity. Combining microwire bundles and CMOS arrays allows for a highly scalable neuronal recording approach, linking the progress in electrical neuronal recordings to the rapid progress in silicon microfabrication. The modular design of the system allows for custom arrangement of recording sites. Our approach of employing bundles of minimally invasive, highly insulated and functionalized microwires to extend a two-dimensional CMOS architecture into the 3rd dimension can be translated to other CMOS arrays, such as electrical stimulation devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Systems Biology: A Panel of Synapse-Related Genes as a Biomarker for Gliomas</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00822</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gliomas are the most common primary brain cancers. In recent years, IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion have been suggested as biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of gliomas. However, these biomarkers are only effective for a part of glioma patients, and thus more biomarkers are still emergently needed. Recently, an electrochemical communication between normal neurons and glioma cells by neuro-glioma synapse has been reported. Moreover, it was discovered that breast-to-brain metastasis tumor cells have pseudo synapses with neurons, and these synapses were indicated to promote tumor progression and metastasis. Based on the above observations, we first curated a panel of 17 synapse-related genes and then proposed a metric, synapse score to quantify the “stemness” for each sample of 12 glioma gene expression datasets from TCGA, CGGA, and GEO. Strikingly, synapse score showed excellent predictive ability for the prognosis, diagnosis, and grading of gliomas. Moreover, being compared with the two established biomarkers, IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion, synapse score demonstrated independent and better predictive performance. In conclusion, this study proposed a quantitative method, synapse score, as an efficient biomarker for monitoring gliomas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Deciphering Brain Function by Miniaturized Fluorescence Microscopy in Freely Behaving Animals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00819</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animal behavior is regulated by environmental stimuli and is shaped by the activity of neural networks, underscoring the importance of assessing the morpho-functional properties of different populations of cells in freely behaving animals. In recent years, a number of optical tools have been developed to monitor and modulate neuronal and glial activity at the protein, cellular, or network level and have opened up new avenues for studying brain function in freely behaving animals. Tools such as genetically encoded sensors and actuators are now commonly used for studying brain activity and function through their expression in different neuronal ensembles. In parallel, microscopy has also made major progress over the last decades. The advent of miniature microscopes (mini-microscopes also called mini-endoscopes) has become a method of choice for studying brain activity at the cellular and network levels in different brain regions of freely behaving mice. This technique also allows for longitudinal investigations while animals carrying the microscope on their head are performing behavioral tasks. In this review, we will discuss mini-endoscopic imaging and the advantages that these devices offer to research. We will also discuss current limitations of and potential future improvements in mini-endoscopic imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Tracing Pilots’ Situation Assessment by Neuroadaptive Cognitive Modeling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00795</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00795</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study presents the integration of a passive brain-computer interface (pBCI) and cognitive modeling as a method to trace pilots’ perception and processing of auditory alerts and messages during operations. Missing alerts on the flight deck can result in out-of-the-loop problems that can lead to accidents. By tracing pilots’ perception and responses to alerts, cognitive assistance can be provided based on individual needs to ensure they maintain adequate situation awareness. Data from 24 participating aircrew in a simulated flight study that included multiple alerts and air traffic control messages in single pilot setup are presented. A classifier was trained to identify pilots’ neurophysiological reactions to alerts and messages from participants’ electroencephalogram (EEG). A neuroadaptive ACT-R model using EEG data was compared to a conventional normative model regarding accuracy in representing individual pilots. Results show that passive BCI can distinguish between alerts that are processed by the pilot as task-relevant or irrelevant in the cockpit based on the recorded EEG. The neuroadaptive model’s integration of this data resulted in significantly higher performance of 87% overall accuracy in representing individual pilots’ responses to alerts and messages compared to 72% accuracy of a normative model that did not consider EEG data. We conclude that neuroadaptive technology allows for implicit measurement and tracing of pilots’ perception and processing of alerts on the flight deck. Careful handling of uncertainties inherent to passive BCI and cognitive modeling shows how the representation of pilot cognitive states can be improved iteratively for providing assistance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Electroencephalographic Cross-Frequency Coupling as a Sign of Disease Progression in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Pilot Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to mild objective cognitive deficits and is associated with the later development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, not all patients with MCI convert to AD. EEG spectral power has shown promise as a marker of progression, but brain oscillations in different frequencies are not isolated entities. Coupling between different frequency bands, so-called cross-frequency coupling (CFC), has been associated with memory function and may further contribute to our understanding of what characterizes patients with MCI who progress to AD. In the current study, we wanted to investigate the changes in gamma/theta CFC in patients with AD and MCI compared to HC and in patients with pMCI compared to patients with sMCI. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate the association with cognitive test scores. EEGs were included at baseline for 15 patients with AD, 25 patients with MCI, and 36 older HC, and the participants were followed for up to 3 years. To investigate CFC, we calculated the modulation index (MI), which has been shown to be less affected by noisy data compared to other techniques. We found that patients with pMCI showed a significantly lower global gamma/theta CFC compared to patients with sMCI. In addition, global gamma/theta CFC was significantly correlated with Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination (ACE) score (p-value = 0.030, rho = 0.527). Although not significant, patients with AD and MCI showed a lower gamma/theta CFC compared to HC. These findings suggest that gamma/theta CFC is important for proper cognitive functioning and that a decrease in gamma/theta CFC in patients with MCI may be a sign of progression. Gamma/theta CFC may therefore serve as a progression marker in MCI, but larger studies are needed to validate these findings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) are crucial for non-image forming functions of the eye, including the photoentrainment of circadian rhythms and the regulation of the pupillary light reflex (PLR). Chromatic pupillometry, using light stimuli at different wavelengths, makes possible the isolation of the contribution of rods, cones, and mRGCs to the PLR. In particular, post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) is the most reliable pupil metric of mRGC function. We have previously described, in post-mortem investigations of AD retinas, a loss of mRGCs, and in the remaining mRGCs, we demonstrated extensive morphological abnormalities. We noted dendrite varicosities, patchy distribution of melanopsin, and reduced dendrite arborization. In this study, we evaluated, with chromatic pupillometry, the PLR in a cohort of mild-moderate AD patients compared to controls. AD and controls also underwent an extensive ophthalmological evaluation. In our AD cohort, PIPR did not significantly differ from controls, even though we observed a higher variability in the AD group and 5/26 showed PIPR values outside the 2 SD from the control mean values. Moreover, we found a significant difference between AD and controls in terms of rod-mediated transient PLR amplitude. These results suggest that in the early stage of AD there are PLR abnormalities that may reflect a pathology affecting mRGC dendrites before involving the mRGC cell body. Further studies, including AD cases with more severe and longer disease duration, are needed to further explore this hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The restoration of a useful visual sense in a profoundly blind person by direct electrical stimulation of the visual cortex has been a subject of study for many years. However, the field of cortically based sight restoration has made few advances in the last few decades, and many problems remain. In this context, the scientific and technological problems associated with safe and effective communication with the brain are very complex, and there are still many unresolved issues delaying its development. In this work, we review some of the biological and technical issues that still remain to be solved, including long-term biotolerability, the number of electrodes required to provide useful vision, and the delivery of information to the implants. Furthermore, we emphasize the possible role of the neuroplastic changes that follow vision loss in the success of this approach. We propose that increased collaborations among clinicians, basic researchers, and neural engineers will enhance our ability to send meaningful information to the brain and restore a limited but useful sense of vision to many blind individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effect of Healthy Diet on Cognitive Performance Among Healthy Seniors – A Mini Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00325</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00325</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;At present, a healthy diet appears to be one of the suitable strategies in slowing down cognitive decline in the process of aging. A number of evidence-based studies confirm its efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. The aim of this mini review is to evaluate and describe recent randomized clinical and cohort studies exploring the effect of healthy diet on cognitive performance among healthy seniors, as well as to update the existing information on this research issue. For these reasons, the authors reviewed full-text, peer-reviewed journal articles written in English and available in Web of Science and PubMed between September 2017 and February 2020. Altogether nine original studies were detected. The results indicate that healthy diet and healthy diet components generally have a positive impact on the enhancement of cognitive functions. Furthermore, the findings reveal that dietary patterns, as well as single nutrients might have a significant effect on specific cognitive domains, such as memory in general, episodic memory, or processing speed. It also seems that a strict adherence to the dietary patterns and a higher diet variety have a more significant effect on the improvement of cognitive functions. Nevertheless, there seem to be gender differences in dietary behavior. More recently, personalized dietary interventions started to be used in delaying cognitive decline among healthy seniors. Therefore, more randomized control trials or N-of-1 trials should be performed in this research area in order to detect the most suitable dietary pattern or nutrients, which would, together with other modifiable lifestyle factors, contribute to the improvement of quality of life of the aging population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;When people talk, they gesture. Gesture is a fundamental component of language that contributes meaningful and unique information to a spoken message and reflects the speaker’s underlying knowledge and experiences. Theoretical perspectives of speech and gesture propose that they share a common conceptual origin and have a tightly integrated relationship, overlapping in time, meaning, and function to enrich the communicative context. We review a robust literature from the field of psychology documenting the benefits of gesture for communication for both speakers and listeners, as well as its important cognitive functions for organizing spoken language, and facilitating problem-solving, learning, and memory. Despite this evidence, gesture has been relatively understudied in populations with neurogenic communication disorders. While few studies have examined the rehabilitative potential of gesture in these populations, others have ignored gesture entirely or even discouraged its use. We review the literature characterizing gesture production and its role in intervention for people with aphasia, as well as describe the much sparser literature on gesture in cognitive communication disorders including right hemisphere damage, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer’s disease. The neuroanatomical and behavioral profiles of these patient populations provide a unique opportunity to test theories of the relationship of speech and gesture and advance our understanding of their neural correlates. This review highlights several gaps in the field of communication disorders which may serve as a bridge for applying the psychological literature of gesture to the study of language disorders. Such future work would benefit from considering theoretical perspectives of gesture and using more rigorous and quantitative empirical methods in its approaches. We discuss implications for leveraging gesture to explore its untapped potential in understanding and rehabilitating neurogenic communication disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Is the Immunological Response a Bottleneck for Cell Therapy in Neurodegenerative Diseases?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s (PD) and Huntington’s disease (HD) are characterized by a selective detrimental impact on neurons in a specific brain area. Currently, these diseases have no cures, although some promising trials of therapies that may be able to slow the loss of brain cells are underway. Cell therapy is distinguished by its potential to replace cells to compensate for those lost to the degenerative process and has shown a great potential to replace degenerated neurons in animal models and in clinical trials in PD and HD patients. Fetal-derived neural progenitor cells, embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells are the main cell sources that have been tested in cell therapy approaches. Furthermore, new strategies are emerging, such as the use of adult stem cells, encapsulated cell lines releasing trophic factors or cell-free products, containing an enriched secretome, which have shown beneficial preclinical outcomes. One of the major challenges for these potential new treatments is to overcome the host immune response to the transplanted cells. Immune rejection can cause significant alterations in transplanted and endogenous tissue and requires immunosuppressive drugs that may produce adverse effects. T-, B-lymphocytes and microglia have been recognized as the main effectors in striatal graft rejection. This review aims to summarize the preclinical and clinical studies of cell therapies in PD and HD. In addition, the precautions and strategies to ensure the highest quality of cell grafts, the lowest risk during transplantation and the reduction of a possible immune rejection will be outlined. Altogether, the wide-ranging possibilities of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) could make therapeutic treatment of these incurable diseases possible in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Altered Sensory Neuron Development in CMT2D Mice Is Site-Specific and Linked to Increased GlyRS Levels</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dominant, missense mutations in the widely and constitutively expressed GARS1 gene cause peripheral neuropathy that usually begins in adolescence and principally impacts the upper limbs. Caused by a toxic gain-of-function in the encoded glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) enzyme, the neuropathology appears to be independent of the canonical role of GlyRS in aminoacylation. Patients display progressive, life-long weakness and wasting of muscles in hands followed by feet, with frequently associated deficits in sensation. When dysfunction is observed in motor and sensory nerves, there is a diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D), or distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V if the symptoms are purely motor. The cause of this varied sensory involvement remains unresolved, as are the pathomechanisms underlying the selective neurodegeneration characteristic of the disease. We have previously identified in CMT2D mice that neuropathy-causing Gars mutations perturb sensory neuron fate and permit mutant GlyRS to aberrantly interact with neurotrophin receptors (Trks). Here, we extend this work by interrogating further the anatomy and function of the CMT2D sensory nervous system in mutant Gars mice, obtaining several key results: (1) sensory pathology is restricted to neurons innervating the hindlimbs; (2) perturbation of sensory development is not common to all mouse models of neuromuscular disease; (3) in vitro axonal transport of signaling endosomes is not impaired in afferent neurons of all CMT2D mouse models; and (4) Gars expression is selectively elevated in a subset of sensory neurons and linked to sensory developmental defects. These findings highlight the importance of comparative neurological assessment in mouse models of disease and shed light on key proposed neuropathogenic mechanisms in GARS1-linked neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Rapamycin, by Inhibiting mTORC1 Signaling, Prevents the Loss of Striatal Bidirectional Synaptic Plasticity in a Rat Model of L-DOPA-Induced Dyskinesia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00230</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00230</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Levodopa (L-DOPA) treatment is the main gold-standard therapy for Parkinson disease (PD). Besides good antiparkinsonian effects, prolonged use of this drug is associated to the development of involuntary movements known as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia is linked to a sensitization of dopamine (DA) D1 receptors located on spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the dorsal striatum. Several evidences have shown that the emergence of LID can be related to striatal D1/cAMP/PKA/DARPP-32 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) pathway overactivation associated to aberrant N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function. In addition, within striatum, ERK1/2 is also able to modulate in a D1 receptor-dependent manner the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway under DA depletion and L-DOPA therapy. Consistently, increased mTORC1 signaling appears during chronic administration of L-DOPA and shows a high correlation with the severity of dyskinesia. Furthermore, the abnormal activation of the D1/PKA/DARPP-32 cascade is paralleled by increased phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor at the PKA Ser845 site. The GluA1 promotes excitatory AMPA receptor-mediated transmission and may be implicated in the alterations found at the corticostriatal synapses of dyskinetic animals. In our study, we investigated the role of mTORC1 pathway activation in modulating bidirectional striatal synaptic plasticity in L-DOPA-treated parkinsonian rats. Inhibition of mTORC1 by coadministration of rapamycin to L-DOPA was able to limit the magnitude of LID expression, accounting for a therapeutic effect of this drug. In particular, behavioral data showed that, in L-DOPA-treated rats, rapamycin administration induced a selective decrease of distinct components of abnormal involuntary movements (i.e., axial and orolingual dyskinesia). Furthermore, ex vivo patch clamp and intracellular recordings of SPNs revealed that pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 also resulted associated with a physiological bidirectional plasticity, when compared to dyskinetic rats treated with L-DOPA alone. This study uncovers the important role of mTORC1 inhibition to prevent the loss of striatal bidirectional plasticity under chronic L-DOPA treatment in rodent models of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Deletion of Stk11 and Fos in mouse BLA projection neurons alters intrinsic excitability and impairs formation of long-term aversive memory</title>

	<description>Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is a form of one-trial learning dependent on basolateral amygdala projection neurons (BLApn). Its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. RNAseq from BLApn identified changes in multiple candidate learning-related transcripts including the expected immediate early gene &lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Stk11&lt;/i&gt;, a master kinase of the AMP-related kinase pathway with important roles in growth, metabolism and development, but not previously implicated in learning. Deletion of &lt;i&gt;Stk11&lt;/i&gt; in BLApn blocked memory prior to training, but not following it and increased neuronal excitability. Conversely, BLApn had reduced excitability following CTA. BLApn knockout of a second learning-related gene, &lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt;, also increased excitability and impaired learning. Independently increasing BLApn excitability chemogenetically during CTA also impaired memory. STK11 and C-FOS activation were independent of one another. These data suggest key roles for &lt;i&gt;Stk11&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt; in CTA long-term memory formation, dependent at least partly through convergent action on BLApn intrinsic excitability.</description>

	<title>eLife: Irisin directly stimulates osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in vitro and in vivo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58172</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58172</link>
	<description>The myokine irisin facilitates muscle-bone crosstalk and skeletal remodeling in part by its action on osteoblasts and osteocytes. In the current study we investigated whether irisin also directly regulates osteoclasts. &lt;i&gt;In vitro,&lt;/i&gt; irisin (2-10 ng/mL) increased osteoclast differentiation in C57BL/6J mouse bone marrow progenitors; this increase was blocked by a neutralizing antibody to integrin α&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Irisin also increased bone resorption on several substrates &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;. RNAseq revealed differential gene expression induced by irisin including upregulation of markers for osteoclast differentiation and resorption, as well as osteoblast-stimulating 'clastokines'. Forced expression of the irisin precursor &lt;i&gt;Fndc5&lt;/i&gt; in transgenic C57BL/6J mice resulted in low bone mass at three ages, and greater &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; osteoclastogenesis from &lt;i&gt;Fndc5&lt;/i&gt;-transgenic bone marrow progenitors. This work demonstrates that irisin acts directly on osteoclast progenitors to increase differentiation and promote bone resorption, supporting the tenet that irisin not only stimulates bone remodeling but may also be an important counter-regulatory hormone.</description>

	<title>eLife: MARCH8 inhibits viral infection by two different mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57763</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57763</link>
	<description>Membrane-associated RING-CH 8 (MARCH8) inhibits infection with both HIV-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus G-glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped viruses by reducing virion incorporation of envelope glycoproteins. The molecular mechanisms by which MARCH8 targets envelope glycoproteins remain unknown. Here, we show two different mechanisms by which MARCH8 inhibits viral infection. Viruses pseudotyped with the VSV-G mutant, in which cytoplasmic lysine residues were mutated, were insensitive to the inhibitory effect of MARCH8, whereas those with a similar lysine mutant of HIV-1 Env remained sensitive to it. Indeed, the wild-type VSV-G, but not its lysine mutant, was ubiquitinated by MARCH8. Furthermore, the MARCH8 mutant, which had a disrupted cytoplasmic tyrosine motif that is critical for intracellular protein sorting, did not inhibit HIV-1 Env-mediated infection, while it still impaired infection by VSV-G-pseudotyped viruses. Overall, we conclude that MARCH8 reduces viral infectivity by downregulating envelope glycoproteins through two different mechanisms mediated by a ubiquitination-dependent or tyrosine motif-dependent pathway.</description>

	<title>eLife: A Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer protein paralog defines a novel class of heme-binding proteins</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57081</link>
	<description>Yeast Sfh5 is an unusual member of the Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) family. Whereas PITPs are defined by their abilities to transfer phosphatidylinositol between membranes in vitro, and to stimulate phosphoinositide signaling in vivo, Sfh5 does not exhibit these activities. Rather, Sfh5 is a redox-active penta-coordinate high spin Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; hemoprotein with an unusual heme-binding arrangement that involves a co-axial tyrosine/histidine coordination strategy and a complex electronic structure connecting the open shell iron &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-orbitals with three aromatic ring systems. That Sfh5 is not a PITP is supported by demonstrations that heme is not a readily exchangeable ligand, and that phosphatidylinositol-exchange activity is resuscitated in heme binding-deficient Sfh5 mutants. The collective data identify Sfh5 as the prototype of a new class of fungal hemoproteins, and emphasize the versatility of the Sec14-fold as scaffold for translating the binding of chemically distinct ligands to the control of diverse sets of cellular activities.</description>

	<title>eLife: A theory of joint attractor dynamics in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex accounts for artificial remapping and grid cell field-to-field variability</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56894</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56894</link>
	<description>The representation of position in the mammalian brain is distributed across multiple neural populations. Grid cell modules in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) express activity patterns that span a low-dimensional manifold which remains stable across different environments. In contrast, the activity patterns of hippocampal place cells span distinct low-dimensional manifolds in different environments. It is unknown how these multiple representations of position are coordinated. Here we develop a theory of joint attractor dynamics in the hippocampus and the MEC. We show that the system exhibits a coordinated, joint representation of position across multiple environments, consistent with global remapping in place cells and grid cells. In addition, our model accounts for recent experimental observations that lack a mechanistic explanation: variability in the firing rate of single grid cells across firing fields, and artificial remapping of place cells under depolarization, but not under hyperpolarization, of layer II stellate cells of the MEC.</description>

	<title>eLife: Caterpillar-induced rice volatiles provide enemy-free space for the offspring of the brown planthopper</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55421</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55421</link>
	<description>Plants typically release large quantities of volatiles in response to herbivory by insects. This benefits the plants by, for instance, attracting the natural enemies of the herbivores. We show that the brown planthopper (BPH) has cleverly turned this around by exploiting herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that provide safe havens for its offspring. BPH females preferentially oviposit on rice plants already infested by the rice striped stem borer (SSB), which are avoided by the egg parasitoid &lt;i&gt;Anagrus nilaparvatae&lt;/i&gt;, the most important natural enemy of BPH. Using synthetic versions of volatiles identified from plants infested by BPH and/or SSB, we demonstrate the role of HIPVs in these interactions. Moreover, greenhouse and field cage experiments confirm the adaptiveness of the BPH oviposition strategy, resulting in 80% lower parasitism rates of its eggs. Besides revealing a novel exploitation of HIPVs, these findings may lead to novel control strategies against an exceedingly important rice pest.</description>

	<description>A variety of microscopy techniques are used by researchers in the life and biomedical sciences. As these techniques become more powerful and more complex, it is vital that scientific articles containing images obtained with advanced microscopes include full details about how each image was obtained. To explore the reporting of such details we examined 240 original research articles published in eight journals. We found that the quality of reporting was poor, with some articles containing no information about how images were obtained, and many articles lacking important basic details. Efforts by researchers, funding agencies, journals, equipment manufacturers and staff at shared imaging facilities are required to improve the reporting of experiments that rely on microscopy techniques.</description>

	<description>One key bottleneck in understanding the human genome is the relative under-characterization of 90% of protein coding regions. We report a collection of 1,200 transgenic zebrafish strains made with the gene-break transposon (GBT) protein trap to simultaneously report and reversibly knockdown the tagged genes. Protein trap-associated mRFP expression shows previously undocumented expression of 35% and 90% of cloned genes at 2 and 4 days post-fertilization, respectively. Further, investigated alleles regularly show 99% gene-specific mRNA knockdown. Homozygous GBT animals in &lt;i&gt;ryr1b&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;fras1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;tnnt2a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;edar&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;hmcn1&lt;/i&gt; phenocopied established mutants. 204 cloned lines trapped diverse proteins, including 64 orthologs of human disease-associated genes with 40 as potential new disease models. Severely reduced skeletal muscle Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in GBT &lt;i&gt;ryr1b&lt;/i&gt; homozygous animals validated the ability to explore molecular mechanisms of genetic diseases. This GBT system facilitates novel functional genome annotation towards understanding cellular and molecular underpinnings of vertebrate biology and human disease.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54051</link>
	<description>Decision making requires integrating self-gathered information with advice from others. However, the arbitration process by which one source of information is selected over the other has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we formalised arbitration as the relative precision of predictions, afforded by each learning system, using hierarchical Bayesian modelling. In a probabilistic learning task, participants predicted the outcome of a lottery using recommendations from a more informed advisor and/or self-sampled outcomes. Decision confidence, as measured by the number of points participants wagered on their predictions, varied with our relative precision definition of arbitration. Functional neuroimaging demonstrated arbitration signals that were independent of decision confidence and involved modality-specific brain regions. Arbitrating in favour of self-gathered information activated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the midbrain, whereas arbitrating in favour of social information engaged the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. These findings indicate that relative precision captures arbitration between social and individual learning systems at both behavioural and neural levels.</description>

	<description>The filarial nematode &lt;i&gt;Brugia malayi&lt;/i&gt; represents a leading cause of disability in the developing world, causing lymphatic filariasis in nearly 40 million people. Currently available drugs are not well-suited to mass drug administration efforts, so new treatments are urgently required. One potential vulnerability is the endosymbiotic bacteria &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt;—present in many filariae—which is vital to the worm. Genome scale metabolic networks have been used to study prokaryotes and protists and have proven valuable in identifying therapeutic targets, but have only been applied to multicellular eukaryotic organisms more recently. Here, we present &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;DC625, the first compartmentalized metabolic model of a parasitic worm. We used this model to show how metabolic pathway usage allows the worm to adapt to different environments, and predict a set of 102 reactions essential to the survival of &lt;i&gt;B. malayi&lt;/i&gt;. We validated three of those reactions with drug tests and demonstrated novel antifilarial properties for all three compounds.</description>

	<description>Guitchounts et al. find that the primary visual cortex (V1) of freely moving rats encodes 3D orienting movements of the head (HOMs). V1 is suppressed or enhanced by HOMs, depending on lighting condition, and individual neurons encode HOM direction. This encoding depends on secondary motor cortex (M2).</description>

	<description>The vestibular system broadcasts head-movement-related signals throughout the brain. Bouvier et al. show that ambient light affects how primary visual cortex (V1) responds to head movements. V1 is suppressed by head movements in darkness and excited by head movements in light through the differential recruitment of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons.</description>

	<description>The bottleneck for microglia-based gene therapy is the lack of tools for genetic manipulation of microglia and/or their allotransplantation. In this study, Xu et al. develop three strategies achieving efficient microglia replacement at the CNS-wide scale or specific brain regions of interest. Each approach has its own advantages and application scenarios.</description>

	<description>Reimer et al. show that EFhd2 restricts migration of germinal center B cells and hapten-specific immunity. Selection of speedy germinal center B cells occurs earlier and they are more likely to differentiate. EFhd2 supports contact of germinal center B cells with follicular dendritic cells, enabling successful competition of rapidly migrating germinal center B cells.</description>

	<description>Kweon et al. find that NACHO protein is essential for assembly of transmembrane domains within the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. NACHO associates with the endoplasmic reticulum oligosaccharyltransferase machinery and with calnexin. Accordingly, functional expression of neuronal α7 receptors requires N-glycosylation and calnexin chaperone activity.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; co-factor balance estimation using constraint-based modelling informs metabolic engineering in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Laura de Arroyo Garcia, Patrik R. Jones&lt;/p&gt;

In the growing field of metabolic engineering, where cells are treated as “factories” that synthesize industrial compounds, it is essential to consider the ability of the cells’ native metabolism to accommodate the demands of synthetic pathways, as these pathways will alter the homeostasis of cellular energy and electron metabolism. From the breakdown of substrate, microorganisms activate and reduce key co-factors such as ATP and NAD(P)H, which subsequently need to be hydrolysed and oxidized, respectively, in order to restore cellular balance. A balanced supply and consumption of such co-factors, here termed &lt;i&gt;co-factor balance&lt;/i&gt;, will influence biotechnological performance. To aid the strain selection and design process, we used stoichiometric modelling (FBA, pFBA, FVA and MOMA) and the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;) core stoichiometric model to investigate the network-wide effect of butanol and butanol precursor production pathways differing in energy and electron demand on the final product yield. An FBA-based co-factor balance assessment (CBA) algorithm was developed to track and categorise how ATP and NAD(P)H pools are affected in the presence of a new pathway. CBA was compared to the balance calculations proposed by Dugar et al. (Nature Biotechnol. 29 (12), 1074–1078). Predicted solutions were compromised by excessively underdetermined systems, displaying greater flexibility in the range of reaction fluxes than experimentally measured by &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-metabolic flux analysis (MFA) and the appearance of unrealistic futile co-factor cycles. With the assumption that futile cycles are tightly regulated in reality, the FBA models were manually constrained in a step-wise manner. Solutions with minimal futile cycling diverted surplus energy and electrons towards biomass formation. As an alternative, the use of loopless FBA or constraining the models with measured flux ranges were tried but did not prevent futile co-factor cycles. The results highlight the need to account for co-factor imbalance and confirm that better-balanced pathways with minimal diversion of surplus towards biomass formation present the highest theoretical yield. The analysis also suggests that ATP and NAD(P)H balancing cannot be assessed in isolation from each other, or even from the balance of additional co-factors such as AMP and ADP. We conclude that, through revealing the source of co-factor imbalance CBA can facilitate pathway and host selection when designing new biocatalysts for implementation by metabolic engineering.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cksuVli6J44&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Transient oscillations in network activity upon sensory stimulation have been reported in different sensory areas of the brain. These evoked oscillations are the generic response of networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons (&lt;i&gt;EI&lt;/i&gt;-networks) to a transient external input. Recently, it has been shown that this resonance property of &lt;i&gt;EI&lt;/i&gt;-networks can be exploited for communication in modular neuronal networks by enabling the transmission of sequences of synchronous spike volleys (’pulse packets’), despite the sparse and weak connectivity between the modules. The condition for successful transmission is that the pulse packet (PP) intervals match the period of the modules’ resonance frequency. Hence, the mechanism was termed &lt;i&gt;communication through resonance (CTR)&lt;/i&gt;. This mechanism has three severe constraints, though. First, it needs periodic trains of PPs, whereas single PPs fail to propagate. Second, the inter-PP interval needs to match the network resonance. Third, transmission is very slow, because in each module, the network resonance needs to build up over multiple oscillation cycles. Here, we show that, by adding appropriate feedback connections to the network, the CTR mechanism can be improved and the aforementioned constraints relaxed. Specifically, we show that adding feedback connections between two upstream modules, called the resonance pair, in an otherwise feedforward modular network can support successful propagation of a single PP throughout the entire network. The key condition for successful transmission is that the sum of the forward and backward delays in the resonance pair matches the resonance frequency of the network modules. The transmission is much faster, by more than a factor of two, than in the original CTR mechanism. Moreover, it distinctly lowers the threshold for successful communication by synchronous spiking in modular networks of weakly coupled networks. Thus, our results suggest a new functional role of bidirectional connectivity for the communication in cortical area networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zIpLJn8J4Lc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Reliable estimation of membrane curvature for cryo-electron tomography</title>

Curvature is a fundamental morphological descriptor of cellular membranes. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is particularly well-suited to visualize and analyze membrane morphology in a close-to-native state and molecular resolution. However, current curvature estimation methods cannot be applied directly to membrane segmentations in cryo-ET, as these methods cannot cope with some of the artifacts introduced during image acquisition and membrane segmentation, such as quantization noise and open borders. Here, we developed and implemented a Python package for membrane curvature estimation from tomogram segmentations, which we named PyCurv. From a membrane segmentation, a signed surface (triangle mesh) is first extracted. The triangle mesh is then represented by a graph, which facilitates finding neighboring triangles and the calculation of geodesic distances necessary for local curvature estimation. PyCurv estimates curvature based on tensor voting. Beside curvatures, this algorithm also provides robust estimations of surface normals and principal directions. We tested PyCurv and three well-established methods on benchmark surfaces and biological data. This revealed the superior performance of PyCurv not only for cryo-ET, but also for data generated by other techniques such as light microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. Altogether, PyCurv is a versatile open-source software to reliably estimate curvature of membranes and other surfaces in a wide variety of applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MMlj9Wbreok&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: CaMKII controls neuromodulation via neuropeptide gene expression and axonal targeting of neuropeptide vesicles</title>

Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) regulates synaptic plasticity in multiple ways, supposedly including the secretion of neuromodulators like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Here, we show that neuromodulator secretion is indeed reduced in mouse α- and βCaMKII-deficient (αβCaMKII double-knockout [DKO]) hippocampal neurons. However, this was not due to reduced secretion efficiency or neuromodulator vesicle transport but to 40% reduced neuromodulator levels at synapses and 50% reduced delivery of new neuromodulator vesicles to axons. αβCaMKII depletion drastically reduced neuromodulator expression. Blocking BDNF secretion or BDNF scavenging in wild-type neurons produced a similar reduction. Reduced neuromodulator expression in αβCaMKII DKO neurons was restored by active βCaMKII but not inactive βCaMKII or αCaMKII, and by CaMKII downstream effectors that promote cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. These data indicate that CaMKII regulates neuromodulation in a feedback loop coupling neuromodulator secretion to βCaMKII- and CREB-dependent neuromodulator expression and axonal targeting, but CaMKIIs are dispensable for the secretion process itself.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6ioF5P1TIuw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The right temporoparietal junction enables delay of gratification by allowing decision makers to focus on future events</title>

Studies of neural processes underlying delay of gratification usually focus on prefrontal networks related to curbing affective impulses. Here, we provide evidence for an alternative mechanism that facilitates delaying gratification by mental orientation towards the future. Combining continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) with functional neuroimaging, we tested how the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) facilitates processing of future events and thereby promotes delay of gratification. Participants performed an intertemporal decision task and a mental time-travel task in the MRI scanner before and after receiving cTBS over the rTPJ or the vertex (control site). rTPJ cTBS led to both stronger temporal discounting for longer delays and reduced processing of future relative to past events in the mental time-travel task. This finding suggests that the rTPJ contributes to the ability to delay gratification by facilitating mental representation of outcomes in the future. On the neural level, rTPJ cTBS led to a reduction in the extent to which connectivity of rTPJ with striatum reflected the value of delayed rewards, indicating a role of rTPJ–striatum connectivity in constructing neural representations of future rewards. Together, our findings provide evidence that the rTPJ is an integral part of a brain network that promotes delay of gratification by facilitating mental orientation to future rewards.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/RqA111s2EcY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNTs), members of the solute carrier (SLC) 28 transporter family, facilitate the salvage of nucleosides and therapeutic nucleoside derivatives across the plasma membrane. Despite decades of investigation, the structures of human CNTs remain unknown. We determined the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human CNT (hCNT) 3 at an overall resolution of 3.6 Å. As with its bacterial homologs, hCNT3 presents a trimeric architecture with additional N-terminal transmembrane helices to stabilize the conserved central domains. The conserved binding sites for the substrate and sodium ions unravel the selective nucleoside transport and distinct coupling mechanism. Structural comparison of hCNT3 with bacterial homologs indicates that hCNT3 is stabilized in an inward-facing conformation. This study provides the molecular determinants for the transport mechanism of hCNTs and potentially facilitates the design of nucleoside drugs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zsxneFFEhxI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Neuroanatomy of transgender persons in a Non‐Western population and improving reliability in clinical neuroimaging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24702?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroanatomy of transgender persons in a Non‐Western population and improving reliability in clinical neuroimaging&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0d1d5311-1d84-4675-98f1-2cbe3de8896c/jnr24702-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study assesses the reproducibility of previous neuroanatomical findings in Western transgender persons in a Non‐Western population. It then shows that repeating an anatomical MRI sequence can increase data reliability especially in brain regions that have previously been implicated to differ between transgender and cisgender persons. This &lt;i&gt;scan–rescan &lt;/i&gt; method might enhance the power of studies with small samples due to low prevalence of target population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the neuroanatomy of transgender persons is slowly being charted, findings are presently discrepant. Moreover, the major body of work has focused on Western populations. One important factor is the issue of power and low signal‐to‐noise (SNR) ratio in neuroimaging studies of rare study populations including endocrine or neurological patient groups. The present study focused on the structural neuroanatomy of a Non‐Western (Iranian) sample of 40 transgender men (TM), 40 transgender women (TW), 30 cisgender men (CM), and 30 cisgender women (CW), while assessing whether the reliability of findings across structural anatomical measures including gray matter volume (GMV), cortical surface area (CSA), and cortical thickness (CTh) could be increased by using two back‐to‐back within‐session structural MRI scans. Overall, findings in transgender persons were more consistent with sex assigned at birth in GMV and CSA, while no group differences emerged for CTh. Repeated measures analysis also indicated that having a second scan increased SNR in all regions of interest, most notably bilateral frontal poles, pre‐ and postcentral gyri and putamina. The results suggest that a simple time and cost‐effective measure to improve SNR in rare clinical populations with low prevalence rates is a second anatomical scan when structural MRI is of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Permeability Measures Predict Hemorrhagic Transformation after Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25785?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25785?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sought to examine the diagnostic utility of existing predictors of any hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and compare them with new perfusion imaging permeability measures in ischemic stroke patients receiving alteplase only.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pixel‐based analysis of pretreatment CT perfusion (CTP) was undertaken to define the optimal CTP permeability thresholds to predict the likelihood of HT. We then compared previously proposed predictors of HT using regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to produce an area under the curve (AUC). We compared AUCs using χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 5 centers, 1,407 patients were included in this study; of these, 282 had HT. The cohort was split into a derivation cohort (1,025, 70% patients) and a validation cohort (382 patients or 30%). The extraction fraction (&lt;i&gt;E &lt;/i&gt;) permeability map at a threshold of 30% relative to contralateral had the highest AUC at predicting any HT (derivation AUC 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79–0.91; validation AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.77–0.91). The AUC improved when permeability was assessed within the acute perfusion lesion for the &lt;i&gt;E &lt;/i&gt; maps at a threshold of 30% (derivation AUC 0.91, 95% CI 0.86–0.95; validation AUC 0.89, 95% CI 0.86–0.95). Previously proposed associations with HT and parenchymal hematoma showed lower AUC values than the permeability measure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this large multicenter study, we have validated a highly accurate measure of HT prediction. This measure might be useful in clinical practice to predict hemorrhagic transformation in ischemic stroke patients before receiving alteplase alone. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Acetylcholinesterase and Nissl‐staining in the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin Hippocampal Formation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cetacean hippocampal formation has been noted to be one of the smallest relative to brain size of all mammals studied. This region, comprised of the dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum and the entorhinal cortex, is important in learning, memory and navigation. There have been a number of studies detailing the distribution of acetylcholinesterase in the hippocampal formation of terrestrial mammals with the goal of gaining a greater understanding of some aspects of the cholinergic innervation to this region as well as its parcellation. The present study was undertaken to describe the organization, cytoarchitecture and distribution of acetylcholinesterase in the hippocampal formation of the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin (AWSD) with the view to understand similarities and differences between this aquatic mammal and terrestrial mammals. Nissl‐staining demonstrated cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal formation in the AWSD comparable to that reported in other cetaceans. In addition, the AWSD had a rich pattern of AChE staining that distinctly varied between regions and laminae. A number of differences in the distribution of AChE staining in areas comparable to those of terrestrial species reported suggested possible alterations in connectivity of this region. Overall, however, AChE‐staining suggested that cholinergic innervation, neural pathways and function of the hippocampal formation of the AWSD is conserved, similar to other mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We identified the afferent projections to the brainstem expiratory oscillator located in the lateral parafacial region (pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;). We combined retrograde viruses with RNAScope and immunofluorescence to identify the neurochemical phenotype of neurons. pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; neurons receive extensive excitatory and inhibitory inputs that contribute to the modulation of the conditional pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; oscillator.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lateral parafacial region (pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;; which encompasses the parafacial respiratory group, pFRG) is a conditional oscillator that drives active expiration during periods of high respiratory demand, and increases ventilation through the recruitment of expiratory muscles. The pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; activity is highly modulated, and systematic analysis of its afferent projections is required to understand its connectivity and modulatory control. We combined a viral retrograde tracing approach to map direct brainstem projections to the putative location of pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, with RNAScope and immunofluorescence to identify the neurochemical phenotype of the projecting neurons. Within the medulla, retrogradely‐labeled, glutamatergic, glycinergic and GABAergic neurons were found in the ventral respiratory column (Bötzinger and preBötzinger Complex [preBötC], ventral respiratory group, ventral parafacial region [pF&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;] and pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), reticular formation (RF), pontine and midbrain vestibular nuclei, and medullary raphe. In the pons and midbrain, retrogradely‐labeled neurons of the same phenotypes were found in the Kölliker‐Fuse and parabrachial nuclei, periaqueductal gray, pedunculopontine nucleus (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). We also identified somatostatin‐expressing neurons in the preBötC and PHOX2B immunopositive cells in the pF&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;, NTS, and part of the RF. Surprisingly, we found no catecholaminergic neurons in the NTS, A5 or &lt;i&gt;Locus Coeruleus &lt;/i&gt;, no serotoninergic raphe neurons nor any cholinergic neurons in the PPT and LDT that projected to the pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. Our results indicate that pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; neurons receive extensive excitatory and inhibitory inputs from several respiratory and nonrespiratory related brainstem regions that could contribute to the complex modulation of the conditional pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; oscillator for active expiration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Stopping production of pathological tau rescues NO signaling, neurovascular coupling and neuronal function, but doesn’t remove tangles, suggesting that (like amyloid-β) soluble tau is an important driver of early neurovascular dysfunction and subsequent neuronal damage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/9BBZ_m-hyP8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Antero-Posterior vs. Lateral Vestibular Input Processing in Human Visual Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visuo-vestibular integration is crucial for locomotion, yet the cortical mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. We combined binaural monopolar galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize the cortical networks activated during antero-posterior and lateral stimulations in humans. We focused on functional areas that selectively respond to egomotion-consistent optic flow patterns: the human middle temporal complex (hMT+), V6, the ventral intraparietal (VIP) area, the cingulate sulcus visual (CSv) area and the posterior insular cortex (PIC). Areas hMT+, CSv, and PIC were equivalently responsive during lateral and antero-posterior GVS while areas VIP and V6 were highly activated during antero-posterior GVS, but remained silent during lateral GVS. Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, we confirmed that a cortical network including areas V6 and VIP is engaged during antero-posterior GVS. Our results suggest that V6 and VIP play a specific role in processing multisensory signals specific to locomotion during navigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Endoplasmic Reticulum Lumenal Indicators in Drosophila Reveal Effects of HSP-Related Mutations on Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium Dynamics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genes for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-shaping proteins are among the most commonly mutated in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Mutation of these genes in model organisms can lead to disruption of the ER network. To investigate how the physiological roles of the ER might be affected by such disruption, we developed tools to interrogate its Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling function. We generated GAL4-driven Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensors targeted to the ER lumen, to record ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; fluxes in identified Drosophila neurons. Using GAL4 lines specific for Type Ib or Type Is larval motor neurons, we compared the responses of different lumenal indicators to electrical stimulation, in axons and presynaptic terminals. The most effective sensor, ER-GCaMP6-210, had a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; affinity close to the expected ER lumenal concentration. Repetitive nerve stimulation generally showed a transient increase of lumenal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in both the axon and presynaptic terminals. Mutants lacking neuronal reticulon and REEP proteins, homologs of human HSP proteins, showed a larger ER lumenal evoked response compared to wild type; we propose mechanisms by which this phenotype could lead to neuronal dysfunction or degeneration. Our lines are useful additions to a Drosophila Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging toolkit, to explore the physiological roles of ER, and its pathophysiological roles in HSP and in axon degeneration more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Distinct Residential and Infiltrated Macrophage Populations and Their Phagocytic Function in Mild and Severe Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Damage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00244</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neonatal brain injury, especially severe injury induced by hypoxia-ischemia (HI), causes mortality and long-term neurological impairments. Our previous study demonstrated activation of CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; myeloid cells, including residential microglial cells (MGs) and infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in a murine model of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD), with unknown functions. Here, we study the differences in the phagocytic function of MGs and MDMs to clarify their potential roles after HIBD. HI was induced in 9–10-day postnatal mice. On days 1 and 3 after injury, pathological and neurobehavioral tests were performed to categorize the brain damage as mild or severe. Flow cytometry was applied to quantify the dynamic change in the numbers of MGs and MDMs according to the relative expression level of CD45 in CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. CX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;GFP&lt;/sup&gt;CCR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;RFP&lt;/sup&gt; double-transformed mice were used to identify MGs and MDMs in the brain parenchyma after HIBD. Lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), CD36, and transforming growth factor (TGF-β) expression levels were measured to assess the underlying function of phagocytes and neuroprotective factors in these cells. The FITC-dextran 40 phagocytosis assay was applied to examine the change in phagocytic function under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro. We found that neonatal HI induced a different degree of brain damage: mild or severe injury. Compared with mildly injured animals, mice with severe injury had lower weight, worse neurobehavioral scores, and abnormal brain morphology. In a severely injured brain, CD11b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells remarkably increased, including an increase in the MDM population and a decrease in the MG population. Furthermore, MDM infiltration into the brain parenchyma was evident in CX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;GFP&lt;/sup&gt;CCR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;RFP&lt;/sup&gt; double-transformed mice. Mild and severe brain injury caused different phagocytosis-related responses and neuroprotective functions of MDMs and MGs at 1 and 3 days following HI. The phagocytic function was activated in BV2 cells but downregulated in Raw264.7 cells under OGD in vitro. These observations indicate that neonatal HI induced different degrees of brain injury. The proportion of infiltrated macrophage MDMs was increased and they were recruited into the injured brain parenchyma in severe brain injury. The resident macrophage MGs proportion decreased and maintained activated phagocytic function in both mild and severe brain injury, and restored neuroprotective function in severe brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: The autophagy adaptor NDP52 and the FIP200 coiled-coil allosterically activate ULK1 complex membrane recruitment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59099</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59099</link>
	<description>The selective autophagy pathways of xenophagy and mitophagy are initiated when the adaptor NDP52 recruits the ULK1 complex to autophagic cargo. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) was used to map the membrane and NDP52 binding sites of the ULK1 complex to unique regions of the coiled coil of the FIP200 subunit. Electron microscopy of the full-length ULK1 complex shows that the FIP200 coiled coil projects away from the crescent-shaped FIP200 N-terminal domain dimer. NDP52 allosterically stimulates membrane-binding by FIP200 and the ULK1 complex by promoting a more dynamic conformation of the membrane-binding portion of the FIP200 coiled coil. Giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) reconstitution confirmed that membrane recruitment by the ULK1 complex is triggered by NDP52 engagement. These data reveal how the allosteric linkage between NDP52 and the ULK1 complex could drive the first membrane recruitment event of phagophore biogenesis in xenophagy and mitophagy.</description>

	<description>T regulatory (Treg) cells play vital roles in modulating immunity and tissue homeostasis. Their actions depend on TCR recognition of peptide-MHC molecules; yet the degree of peptide specificity of Treg-cell function, and whether Treg ligands can be used to manipulate Treg cell biology are unknown. Here, we developed an A&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;-peptide library that enabled unbiased screening of peptides recognized by a bona fide murine Treg cell clone isolated from the visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and identified surrogate agonist peptides, with differing affinities and signaling potencies. The VAT-Treg cells expanded &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by one of the surrogate agonists preserved the typical VAT-Treg transcriptional programs. Immunization with this surrogate, especially when coupled with blockade of TNFa signaling, expanded VAT-Treg cells, resulting in protection from inflammation and improved metabolic indices, including promotion of insulin sensitivity. These studies suggest that antigen-specific targeting of VAT-localized Treg cells could eventually be a strategy for improving metabolic disease.</description>

	<description>The dynamic tyrosination-detyrosination cycle of α-tubulin regulates microtubule functions. Perturbation of this cycle impairs mitosis, neural physiology, and cardiomyocyte contraction. The carboxypeptidases vasohibins 1 and 2 (VASH1 and VASH2), in complex with the small vasohibin-binding protein (SVBP), mediate α-tubulin detyrosination. These enzymes detyrosinate microtubules more efficiently than soluble αβ-tubulin heterodimers. The structural basis for this substrate preference is not understood. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we have determined the structure of human VASH1-SVBP bound to microtubules. The acidic C-terminal tail of α-tubulin binds to a positively charged groove near the active site of VASH1. VASH1 forms multiple additional contacts with the globular domain of α-tubulin, including contacts with a second α-tubulin in an adjacent protofilament. Simultaneous engagement of two protofilaments by VASH1 can only occur within the microtubule lattice, but not with free αβ heterodimers. These lattice-specific interactions enable preferential detyrosination of microtubules by VASH1.</description>

	<title>eLife: The role of the NMD factor UPF3B in olfactory sensory neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57525</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57525</link>
	<description>The UPF3B-dependent branch of the nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway is critical for human cognition. Here, we examined the role of UPF3B in the olfactory system. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis demonstrated considerable heterogeneity of olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) cell populations in wild type (WT) mice, and revealed that UPF3B loss influences specific subsets of these cell populations. UPF3B also regulates the expression of a large cadre of anti-microbial genes in OSNs, and promotes the selection of specific olfactory receptor (&lt;i&gt;Olfr&lt;/i&gt;) genes for expression in mature OSNs (mOSNs). RNA-seq and Ribotag analyses identified classes of mRNAs expressed and translated at different levels in WT and &lt;i&gt;Upf3b&lt;/i&gt;-null mOSNs. Integrating multiple computational approaches, UPF3B-dependent NMD target transcripts that are candidates to mediate the functions of NMD in mOSNs were identified &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Together, our data provides a valuable resource for the olfactory field and insights into the roles of NMD &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

	<description>Human disease phenotypes are ultimately driven primarily by alterations in protein expression and/or function. To date, relatively little is known about the variability of the human proteome in populations and how this relates to variability in mRNA expression and to disease loci. Here, we present the first comprehensive proteomic analysis of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), a key cell type for disease modelling, analysing 202 iPSC lines derived from 151 donors, with integrated transcriptome and genomic sequence data from the same lines. We characterised the major genetic and non-genetic determinants of proteome variation across iPSC lines and assessed key regulatory mechanisms affecting variation in protein abundance. We identified 654 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) in iPSCs, including disease-linked variants in protein coding sequences and variants with &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; regulatory effects. These include pQTL linked to GWAS variants that cannot be detected at the mRNA level, highlighting the utility of dissecting pQTL at peptide level resolution.</description>

	<title>eLife: Differentiating Drosophila female germ cells initiate Polycomb silencing by regulating PRC2-interacting proteins</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56922</link>
	<description>Polycomb silencing represses gene expression and provides a molecular memory of chromatin state that is essential for animal development. We show that &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; female germline stem cells (GSCs) provide a powerful system for studying Polycomb silencing. GSCs have a non-canonical distribution of PRC2 activity and lack silenced chromatin, like embryonic progenitors. As GSC daughters differentiate into nurse cells and oocytes, nurse cells silence genes in traditional Polycomb domains and in generally inactive chromatin like embryonic somatic cells. Developmentally controlled expression of two Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-interacting proteins, Pcl and Scm, initiate silencing during differentiation. In GSCs, abundant Pcl inhibits PRC2-dependent silencing globally, while in nurse cells Pcl declines and newly-induced Scm concentrates PRC2 activity on traditional Polycomb domains. Our results suggest that PRC2-dependent silencing is developmentally regulated by accessory proteins that either increase the concentration of PRC2 at target sites or inhibit the rate that PRC2 samples chromatin.</description>

	<title>eLife: A large effective population size for established within-host influenza virus infection</title>

	<description>Strains of the influenza virus form coherent global populations, yet exist at the level of single infections in individual hosts. The relationship between these scales is a critical topic for understanding viral evolution. Here we investigate the within-host relationship between selection and the stochastic effects of genetic drift, estimating an effective population size of infection N&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; for influenza infection. Examining whole-genome sequence data describing a chronic case of influenza B in a severely immunocompromised child we infer an N&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; of 2.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; (95% confidence range 1.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; to 9.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;) suggesting that genetic drift is of minimal importance during an established influenza infection. Our result, supported by data from influenza A infection, suggests that positive selection during within-host infection is primarily limited by the typically short period of infection. Atypically long infections may have a disproportionate influence upon global patterns of viral evolution.</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Role of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptors (PPARs) in the pathophysiology of stroke and protective effects of PPAR ligands have been widely investigated in the last 20 years. Activation of all three PPAR isoforms, but especially PPAR‐γ, was documented to limit postischemic injury in the numerous &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;, as well as in &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt; studies. PPARs have been demonstrated to act on multiple mechanisms and were shown to activate multiple protective pathways related to inflammation, apoptosis, BBB protection, neurogenesis, and oxidative stress. The aim of this review was to summarize two decades of PPAR research in stroke with emphasis on &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; animal studies. We focus on each PPAR receptor separately and detail their implication in stroke. This review also discusses recent clinical efforts in the field and the epidemiological data with regard to role of PPAR polymorphisms in susceptibility to stroke, and tries to draw conclusions and describe future perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Slow‐sustained delivery of naloxone reduces typical naloxone‐induced precipitated opioid withdrawal effects in male morphine‐dependent mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/11c60809-f512-4122-9519-cd2403708c5b/jnr24627-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morphine‐dependent mice treated with unmodified naloxone exhibit precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW) behaviors. POW behaviors observed in morphine‐dependent mice treated with covalent naloxone nanoparticles (Nal‐&lt;i&gt;c &lt;/i&gt;NPs) are minimal to none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of individuals die each year from opioid‐related overdoses. While naloxone (Narcan®) is currently the most widely employed treatment to reverse opioid toxicity, high or repeated doses of this antidote often lead to precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW). We hypothesized that a slow linear release of naloxone from a nanoparticle would induce fewer POW symptoms compared to high‐dose free naloxone. First, we measured the acute impact of covalent naloxone nanoparticles (Nal‐&lt;i&gt;c &lt;/i&gt;NPs) on morphine‐induced antinociception in the hotplate test. We found that Nal‐&lt;i&gt;c &lt;/i&gt;NP treatment blocked the antinociceptive effect of morphine within 15 min of administration. Next, we tested the impact of Nal‐&lt;i&gt;c &lt;/i&gt;NPs on POW symptoms in male morphine‐dependent mice. To induce morphine dependence, mice were treated with 5 mg/kg morphine (or saline) twice‐daily for six consecutive days. On day 7 mice received 5 mg/kg morphine (or saline) injections 2 hr prior to receiving treatment of either unmodified free naloxone, a high or low dose of Nal‐&lt;i&gt;c &lt;/i&gt;NP, empty nanoparticle (&lt;i&gt;c &lt;/i&gt;NP‐empty), or saline. Behavior was analyzed for 0–6 hr followed by 24 and 48 hr time points after treatment. As expected, free naloxone induced a significant increase in POW behavior in morphine‐dependent mice compared to saline‐treated mice upon free naloxone administration. In comparison, reduced POW behavior was observed with both doses of Nal‐&lt;i&gt;c &lt;/i&gt;NP. Side effects of Nal‐&lt;i&gt;c &lt;/i&gt;NP on locomotion and fecal boli production were measured and no significant side‐effects were observed. Overall, our data show that sustained release of naloxone from a covalent nanoparticle does not induce severe POW symptoms in morphine‐dependent mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Presynaptic inhibition rapidly stabilises recurrent excitation in the face of plasticity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Bella Naumann, Henning Sprekeler&lt;/p&gt;

Hebbian plasticity, a mechanism believed to be the substrate of learning and memory, detects and further enhances correlated neural activity. Because this constitutes an unstable positive feedback loop, it requires additional homeostatic control. Computational work suggests that in recurrent networks, the homeostatic mechanisms observed in experiments are too slow to compensate instabilities arising from Hebbian plasticity and need to be complemented by rapid compensatory processes. We suggest presynaptic inhibition as a candidate that rapidly provides stability by compensating recurrent excitation induced by Hebbian changes. Presynaptic inhibition is mediated by presynaptic GABA receptors that effectively and reversibly attenuate transmitter release. Activation of these receptors can be triggered by excess network activity, hence providing a stabilising negative feedback loop that weakens recurrent interactions on sub-second timescales. We study the stabilising effect of presynaptic inhibition in a recurrent networks, in which presynaptic inhibition is implemented as a multiplicative reduction of recurrent synaptic weights in response to increasing inhibitory activity. We show that networks with presynaptic inhibition display a gradual increase of firing rates with growing excitatory weights, in contrast to traditional excitatory-inhibitory networks. This alleviates the positive feedback loop between Hebbian plasticity and network activity and thereby allows homeostasis to act on timescales similar to those observed in experiments. Our results generalise to spiking networks with a biophysically more detailed implementation of the presynaptic inhibition mechanism. In conclusion, presynaptic inhibition provides a powerful compensatory mechanism that rapidly reduces effective recurrent interactions and thereby stabilises Hebbian learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/B8M0a75I0Uo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Drug repurposing, identifying novel indications for drugs, bypasses common drug development pitfalls to ultimately deliver therapies to patients faster. However, most repurposing discoveries have been led by anecdotal observations (e.g. Viagra) or experimental-based repurposing screens, which are costly, time-consuming, and imprecise. Recently, more systematic computational approaches have been proposed, however these rely on utilizing the information from the diseases a drug is already approved to treat. This inherently limits the algorithms, making them unusable for investigational molecules. Here, we present a computational approach to drug repurposing, CATNIP, that requires only biological and chemical information of a molecule. CATNIP is trained with 2,576 diverse small molecules and uses 16 different drug similarity features, such as structural, target, or pathway based similarity. This model obtains significant predictive power (AUC = 0.841). Using our model, we created a repurposing network to identify broad scale repurposing opportunities between drug types. By exploiting this network, we identified literature-supported repurposing candidates, such as the use of systemic hormonal preparations for the treatment of respiratory illnesses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that we can use our approach to identify novel uses for defined drug classes. We found that adrenergic uptake inhibitors, specifically amitriptyline and trimipramine, could be potential therapies for Parkinson’s disease. Additionally, using CATNIP, we predicted the kinase inhibitor, vandetanib, as a possible treatment for Type 2 Diabetes. Overall, this systematic approach to drug repurposing lays the groundwork to streamline future drug development efforts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GaN2Ncpsy4I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The brain consists of many interconnected networks with time-varying, partially autonomous activity. There are multiple sources of noise and variation yet activity has to eventually converge to a stable, reproducible state (or sequence of states) for its computations to make sense. We approached this problem from a control-theory perspective by applying contraction analysis to recurrent neural networks. This allowed us to find mechanisms for achieving stability in multiple connected networks with biologically realistic dynamics, including synaptic plasticity and time-varying inputs. These mechanisms included inhibitory Hebbian plasticity, excitatory anti-Hebbian plasticity, synaptic sparsity and excitatory-inhibitory balance. Our findings shed light on how stable computations might be achieved despite biological complexity. Crucially, our analysis is not limited to analyzing the stability of fixed geometric objects in state space (e.g points, lines, planes), but rather the stability of state trajectories which may be complex and time-varying.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/660jkWwn5gk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe and complex psychiatric disorder characterized by intense fear about weight gain and finalized to food‐related control behaviors. Growing interest has been demonstrated about neurobiological processes subtend to AN physiopathology. The present review aimed to collect neurostructural and neurofunctional available data from 2010 to 2019. Results have been organized according to the neuroimaging technique employed, also including a specific section on electroencephalographic results, mostly neglected in previous reviews. Diffuse cerebral vulnerability has been demonstrated and the contribution of several structures has been identified. Insula, cingulate cortex, parietal and frontal areas are primarily involved both by structural and functional perspectives. Moreover, consistent alterations in white matter integrity and brain electrical activity have been reported. Neuroimaging findings give a substantial contribution to AN pathophysiological description, also in order to understand altered but reversible processes in the passage from acute illness phase to disorder's remission, useful also for defining therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latest studies have revealed that pain negatively impacts on reward processing and motivation leading to negative affective states and stress. These states not only reduce quality of life of patients by increasing the appearance of psychiatric comorbidities, but also have an important impact on vulnerability to drug abuse, including alcohol. In fact, clinical, epidemiological but also preclinical studies have revealed that the presence of pain is closely related to alcohol use disorders (AUDs). All this evidence suggests that pain is a factor that increases the risk of suffering AUD, predicting heavy drinking behavior and relapse drinking in those patients with a previous history of AUD. The negative consequences of chronic pain and its impact on stress and AUD are likely mediated by alterations in the central nervous system, especially in the stress and reward systems. Therefore, pain and stress impact on dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway can lead to an increase in drug abuse liability. In this mini review we analyze the interaction between pain, stress, and alcohol addiction, and how dynamic changes in the kappa opioid system might play a crucial role in the development of compulsive alcohol drinking in chronic pain patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Pain management with opioids in adults</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the ubiquitous nature of opioids in the treatment of pain, it is an interesting paradox that this class of medications also represents one of the least understood components of clinical pain medicine. For many years, there has been intense interest in the mechanisms of opioid activity, but this has not resulted in a corresponding increase in convincing clinical data. This review focuses primarily on the evidence surrounding the long‐term use of opioids in chronic pain, but discussions of this research are often conflated with the very different data governing acute and cancer‐related pain, where evidence of efficacy is clearer. It is therefore important to clarify the evidence‐based indications for opioid therapy. There remains very little evidence that opioids improve function or quality of life beyond 3 months in people with chronic pain conditions. In all three patient populations, the development of tolerance, dependence, hyperalgesia and withdrawal are key phenomena that affect the patient experience, and in particular the decision to remain on opioids in the long term. This is a common thread that connects the opioid literature in all of these spheres, and justifies the burgeoning interest in these phenomena in the basic science literature. There is an urgent need to address these negative consequences of opioid use, in order to maximize the therapeutic benefit that opioids can offer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Optic Disc Classification by Deep Learning versus Expert Neuro‐Ophthalmologists</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25839?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25839?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare the diagnostic performance of an artificial intelligence deep learning system with that of expert neuro‐ophthalmologists in classifying optic disc appearance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deep learning system was previously trained and validated on 14,341 ocular fundus photographs from 19 international centers. The performance of the system was evaluated on 800 new fundus photographs (400 normal optic discs, 201 papilledema [disc edema from elevated intracranial pressure], 199 other optic disc abnormalities) and compared with that of 2 expert neuro‐ophthalmologists who independently reviewed the same randomly presented images without clinical information. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system correctly classified 678 of 800 (84.7%) photographs, compared with 675 of 800 (84.4%) for Expert 1 and 641 of 800 (80.1%) for Expert 2. The system yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.96–0.98), 0.96 (95% CI = 0.94–0.97), and 0.89 (95% CI = 0.87–0.92) for the detection of normal discs, papilledema, and other disc abnormalities, respectively. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the system's classification of optic discs were similar to or better than the 2 experts. Intergrader agreement at the eye level was 0.71 (95% CI = 0.67–0.76) between Expert 1 and Expert 2, 0.72 (95% CI = 0.68–0.76) between the system and Expert 1, and 0.65 (95% CI = 0.61–0.70) between the system and Expert 2.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of this deep learning system at classifying optic disc abnormalities was at least as good as 2 expert neuro‐ophthalmologists. Future prospective studies are needed to validate this system as a diagnostic aid in relevant clinical settings. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Anti‐migraine Calcitonin Gene–Related Peptide Receptor Antagonists Worsen Cerebral Ischemic Outcome in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25831?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25831?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) pathway inhibitors are emerging treatments for migraine. CGRP‐mediated vasodilation is, however, a critical rescue mechanism in ischemia. We, therefore, investigated whether gepants, small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, worsen cerebral ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle cerebral artery was occluded for 12 to 60 minutes in mice. We compared infarct risk and volumes, collateral flow, and neurological deficits after pretreatment with olcegepant (single or 10 daily doses of 0.1–1mg/kg) or rimegepant (single doses of 10–100mg/kg) versus vehicle. We also determined their potency on CGRP‐induced relaxations in mouse and human vessels, in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olcegepant (1mg/kg, single dose) increased infarct risk after 12‐ to 20‐minute occlusions mimicking transient ischemic attacks (14/19 vs 6/18 with vehicle, relative risk = 2.21, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.022), and doubled infarct volumes (&lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and worsened neurological deficits (median score = 9 vs 5 with vehicle, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.008) after 60‐minute occlusion. Ten daily doses of 0.1 to 1mg/kg olcegepant yielded similar results. Rimegepant 10mg/kg increased infarct volumes by 60% after 20‐minute ischemia (&lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.03); 100mg/kg caused 75% mortality after 60‐minute occlusion. In familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 mice, olcegepant 1mg/kg increased infarct size after 30‐minute occlusion (1.6‐fold, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.017). Both gepants consistently diminished collateral flow and reduced reperfusion success. Olcegepant was 10‐fold more potent than rimegepant on CGRP‐induced relaxations in mouse aorta.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gepants worsened ischemic stroke in mice via collateral dysfunction. CGRP pathway blockers might thus aggravate coincidental cerebral ischemic events. The cerebrovascular safety of these agents must therefore be better delineated, especially in patients at increased risk of ischemic events or on prophylactic CGRP inhibition.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Cortical Inactivation Does Not Block Response Enhancement in the Superior Colliculus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00059</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Repetitive visual stimulation is successfully used in a study on the visual evoked potential (VEP) plasticity in the visual system in mammals. Practicing visual tasks or repeated exposure to sensory stimuli can induce neuronal network changes in the cortical circuits and improve the perception of these stimuli. However, little is known about the effect of visual training at the subcortical level. In the present study, we extend the knowledge showing positive results of this training in the rat’s Superior colliculus (SC). In electrophysiological experiments, we showed that a single training session lasting several hours induces a response enhancement both in the primary visual cortex (V1) and in the SC. Further, we tested if collicular responses will be enhanced without V1 input. For this reason, we inactivated the V1 by applying xylocaine solution onto the cortical surface during visual training. Our results revealed that SC’s response enhancement was present even without V1 inputs and showed no difference in amplitude comparing to VEPs enhancement while the V1 was active. These data suggest that the visual system plasticity and facilitation can develop independently but simultaneously in different parts of the visual system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: A Critical Analysis on Characterizing the Meditation Experience Through the Electroencephalogram</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Meditation practices, originated from ancient traditions, have increasingly received attention due to their potential benefits to mental and physical health. The scientific community invests efforts into scrutinizing and quantifying the effects of these practices, especially on the brain. There are methodological challenges in describing the neural correlates of the subjective experience of meditation. We noticed, however, that technical considerations on signal processing also don't follow standardized approaches, which may hinder generalizations. Therefore, in this article, we discuss the usage of the electroencephalogram (EEG) as a tool to study meditation experiences in healthy individuals. We describe the main EEG signal processing techniques and how they have been translated to the meditation field until April 2020. Moreover, we examine in detail the limitations/assumptions of these techniques and highlight some good practices, further discussing how technical specifications may impact the interpretation of the outcomes. By shedding light on technical features, this article contributes to more rigorous approaches to evaluate the construct of meditation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Accounting for Changing Structure in Functional Network Analysis of TBI Patients</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last 15 years, network analysis approaches based on MR data have allowed a renewed understanding of the relationship between brain function architecture and consciousness. Application of this approach to Disorders of Consciousness (DOC) highlights the relationship between specific aspects of network topology and levels of consciousness. Nonetheless, such applications do not acknowledge that DOC patients present with a dramatic level of heterogeneity in structural connectivity (SC) across groups (e.g., etiology, diagnostic categories) and within individual patients (e.g., over time), which possibly affects the level and quality of functional connectivity (FC) patterns that can be expressed. In addition, it is rarely acknowledged that the most frequently employed outcome metrics in the study of brain connectivity (e.g., degree distribution, inter- or intra-resting state network connectivity, and clustering coefficient) are interrelated and cannot be assumed to be independent of each other. We present empirical data showing that, when the two points above are not taken into consideration with an appropriate analytic model, it can lead to a misinterpretation of the role of each outcome metric in the graph's structure and thus misinterpretation of FC results. We show that failing to account for either SC or the inter-relation between outcome measures can lead to inflated false positives (FP) and/or false negatives (FN) in inter- or intra-resting state network connectivity results (defined, respectively, as a positive or negative result in network connectivity that is present when not accounting for SC and/or outcome measure inter-relation, but becomes not significant when accounting for all variables). Overall, we find that unconscious patients have lower rates of FP and FN for within cortical connectivity, lower rates of FN for cortico-subcortical connectivity, and lower rates of FP for within subcortical connectivity. These lower rates in unconscious patients may reflect differences in their triadic closure and SC metrics, which bias the interpretations of the inter- or intra-resting state network connectivity if the SC metrics and triadic closure are not modeled. We suggest that future studies of functional connectivity in DOC patients (i) incorporate where possible SC metrics and (ii) properly account for the intercorrelated nature of outcome variables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: SNARE-Mediated Exocytosis in Neuronal Development</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The formation of the nervous system involves establishing complex networks of synaptic connections between proper partners. This developmental undertaking requires the rapid expansion of the plasma membrane surface area as neurons grow and polarize, extending axons through the extracellular environment. Critical to the expansion of the plasma membrane and addition of plasma membrane material is exocytic vesicle fusion, a regulated mechanism driven by soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment proteins receptors (SNAREs). Since their discovery, SNAREs have been implicated in several critical neuronal functions involving exocytic fusion in addition to synaptic transmission, including neurite initiation and outgrowth, axon specification, axon extension, and synaptogenesis. Decades of research have uncovered a rich variety of SNARE expression and function. The basis of SNARE-mediated fusion, the opening of a fusion pore, remains an enigmatic event, despite an incredible amount of research, as fusion is not only heterogeneous but also spatially small and temporally fast. Multiple modes of exocytosis have been proposed, with full-vesicle fusion (FFV) and kiss-and-run (KNR) being the best described. Whereas most in vitro work has reconstituted fusion using VAMP-2, SNAP-25, and syntaxin-1; there is much to learn regarding the behaviors of distinct SNARE complexes. In the past few years, robust heterogeneity in the kinetics and fate of the fusion pore that varies by cell type have been uncovered, suggesting a paradigm shift in how the modes of exocytosis are viewed is warranted. Here, we explore both classic and recent work uncovering the variety of SNAREs and their importance in the development of neurons, as well as historical and newly proposed modes of exocytosis, their regulation, and proteins involved in the regulation of fusion kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine replacement therapy with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is the only temporary therapy for Parkinson’s disease (PD), but it triggers dyskinesia over time. Since dyskinesia is associated with increased neuronal firing that bolsters purinergic signaling, we now tested whether the selective and blood-brain barrier-permeable P2X7 receptor antagonist Brilliant Blue-G (BBG, 22.5–45 mg/kg ip) attenuated behavioral, neurochemical and biochemical alterations in rats turned hemiparkinsonian upon unilateral striatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and treated daily with L-DOPA (30 mg/kg by gavage) for 22 days. The blockade of P2X7 receptors decreased L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and motor incoordination in hemiparkinsonian rats. In parallel, BBG treatment rebalanced the altered dopamine D1 and D2 receptor density and signaling as well as some neuroinflammation-associated parameters in the striatum and substantia nigra. These findings herald a hitherto unrecognized role for purinergic signaling in the etiopathology of dyskinesia and prompt P2X7 receptor antagonists as novel candidate anti-dyskinesia drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Volume conduction of electrical potentials in the brain is highly influenced by the material properties and geometry of the tissue and recording devices implanted into the tissue. These effects are very large in EEG due to the volume conduction through the skull and scalp but are often neglected in intracranial electrophysiology. When considering penetrating electrodes deep in the brain, the assumption of an infinite and homogenous medium can be used when the sources are far enough from the brain surface and the electrodes to minimize the boundary effect. When the electrodes are recording from the brain's surface the effect of the boundary cannot be neglected, and the large surface area and commonly used insulating materials in surface electrode arrays may further increase the effect by altering the nature of the boundary in the immediate vicinity of the electrodes. This gives the experimenter some control over the spatial profiles of the potentials by appropriate design of the electrode arrays. We construct a simple three-layer model to describe the effect of material properties and geometry above the brain surface on the electric potentials and conduct empirical experiments to validate this model. A laminar electrode array is used to measure the effect of insulating and relatively conducting layers above the cortical surface by recording evoked potentials alternating between a dried surface and saline covering layer, respectively. Empirically, we find that an insulating boundary amplifies the potentials relative to conductive saline by about a factor of 4, and that the effect is not constrained to potentials that originate near the surface. The model is applied to predict the influence of array design and implantation procedure on the recording amplitude and spatial selectivity of the surface electrode arrays.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With the release of the multi-site Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange, many researchers have applied machine learning methods to distinguish between healthy subjects and autistic individuals by using features extracted from resting state functional MRI data. An important part of applying machine learning to this problem is extracting these features. Specifically, whether to include negative correlations between brain region activities as relevant features and how best to define these features. For the second question, the graph theoretical properties of the brain network may provide a reasonable answer. In this study, we investigated the first issue by comparing three different approaches. These included using the positive correlation matrix (comprising only the positive values of the original correlation matrix), the absolute value of the correlation matrix, or the anticorrelation matrix (comprising only the negative correlation values) as the starting point for extracting relevant features using graph theory. We then trained a multi-layer perceptron in a leave-one-site out manner in which the data from a single site was left out as testing data and the model was trained on the data from the other sites. Our results show that on average, using graph features extracted from the anti-correlation matrix led to the highest accuracy and AUC scores. This suggests that anti-correlations should not simply be discarded as they may include useful information that would aid the classification task. We also show that adding the PCA transformation of the original correlation matrix to the feature space leads to an increase in accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The growing importance of astrocytes in the field of neuroscience has led to a greater number of computational models devoted to the study of astrocytic functions and their metabolic interactions with neurons. The modeling of these interactions demands a combined understanding of brain physiology and the development of computational frameworks based on genomic-scale reconstructions, system biology, and dynamic models. These computational approaches have helped to highlight the neuroprotective mechanisms triggered by astrocytes and other glial cells, both under normal conditions and during neurodegenerative processes. In the present review, we evaluate some of the most relevant models of astrocyte metabolism, including genome-scale reconstructions and astrocyte-neuron interactions developed in the last few years. Additionally, we discuss novel strategies from the multi-omics perspective and computational models of other glial cell types that will increase our knowledge in brain metabolism and its association with neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Tomographic Quantitative Electroencephalography (qEEGt) toolbox is integrated with the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) Neuroinformatics Ecosystem as a docker into the Canadian Brain Imaging Research Platform (CBRAIN). qEEGt produces age-corrected normative Statistical Parametric Maps of EEG log source spectra testing compliance to a normative database. This toolbox was developed at the Cuban Neuroscience Center as part of the first wave of the Cuban Human Brain Mapping Project (CHBMP) and has been validated and used in different health systems for several decades. Incorporation into the MNI ecosystem now provides CBRAIN registered users access to its full functionality and is accompanied by a public release of the source code on GitHub and Zenodo repositories. Among other features are the calculation of EEG scalp spectra, and the estimation of their source spectra using the Variable Resolution Electrical Tomography (VARETA) source imaging. Crucially, this is completed by the evaluation of z spectra by means of the built-in age regression equations obtained from the CHBMP database (ages 5–87) to provide normative Statistical Parametric Mapping of EEG log source spectra. Different scalp and source visualization tools are also provided for evaluation of individual subjects prior to further post-processing.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Sparse Logistic Regression With L1/2 Penalty for Emotion Recognition in Electroencephalography Classification</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a current focus in brain-computer interface research. However, the classification of EEG is difficult owing to large amounts of data and high levels of noise. Therefore, it is important to determine how to effectively extract features that include important information. Regularization, one of the effective methods for EEG signal processing, can effectively extract important features from the signal and has potential applications in EEG emotion recognition. Currently, the most popular regularization technique is Lasso (L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and Ridge Regression (L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In recent years, researchers have proposed many other regularization terms. In theory, L&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-type regularization has a lower q value, which means that it can be used to find solutions with better sparsity. L&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; regularization is of L&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; type (0 &amp;lt; q &amp;lt; 1) and has been shown to have many attractive properties. In this work, we studied the L&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; penalty in sparse logistic regression for three-classification EEG emotion recognition, and used a coordinate descent algorithm and a univariate semi-threshold operator to implement L&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; penalty logistic regression. The experimental results on simulation and real data demonstrate that our proposed method is better than other existing regularization methods. Sparse logistic regression with L&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; penalty achieves higher classification accuracy than the conventional L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, Ridge Regression, and Elastic Net regularization methods, using fewer but more informative EEG signals. This is very important for high-dimensional small-sample EEG data and can help researchers to reduce computational complexity and improve computational accuracy. Therefore, we propose that sparse logistic regression with the L&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; penalty is an effective technique for emotion recognition in practical classification problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: What Direct Electrostimulation of the Brain Taught Us About the Human Connectome: A Three-Level Model of Neural Disruption</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00315</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00315</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the relevance of the information provided by direct electrostimulation (DES) for mapping brain functions was debated. Recently, major advances in intraoperative DES for guiding resection of cerebral tumors in awake patients enabled the validation of this method and its increased utilization in basic neurosciences. Indeed, in addition to the cortical stimulation used for many decades in epilepsy surgery, axonal mapping was developed thanks to DES of the white matter tracts, giving original insights into the neural connectivity. Moreover, functional results collected during intrasurgical mapping have been correlated with neuropsychological performances before and after DES-guided resection, and with perioperative neuroimaging data. Thus, it was evidenced that DES offers the unique opportunity to identify both cortical and subcortical structures critical for cerebral functions. Here, the first aim is to propose a three-level model of DES-generated functional disruption, able to explain the behavioral consequences elicited during awake surgery, i.e., (i) DES of an input/output unimodal (e.g., somatosensory or motor) network inducing “positive” responses (as involuntary movement); (ii) DES of a distributed specialized network inducing a within-system disruption leading to specific “negative” disorders (e.g., exclusive language deficit with no other disorders); (iii) DES generating an inter-system disruption leading to more complex behavioral disturbances (e.g., the inability to perform dual-task while each function can be performed separately). Second, in light of this model, original findings gained from DES concerning the human connectome, complementary to those provided by functional neuroimaging (FNI), are reviewed. Further longitudinal multimodal investigations are needed to explore neuroplasticity mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Field Theory of Evoked Response Potentials With Attentional Gain Dynamics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00293</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A generalized neural field model of large-scale activity in the corticothalamic system is used to predict standard evoked potentials. This model embodies local feedbacks that modulate the gains of neural activity as part of the response to incoming stimuli and thus enables both activity changes and effective connectivity changes to be calculated as parts of a generalized evoked response, and their relative contributions to be determined. The results show that incorporation of gain modulations enables a compact and physically justifiable description of the differences in gain between background-EEG and standard-ERP conditions, with the latter able to be initiated from the background state, rather than requiring distinct parameters as in earlier work. In particular, top-down gains are found to be reduced during an ERP, consistent with recent theoretical suggestions that the role of internal models is diminished in favor of external inputs when the latter change suddenly. The static-gain and modulated-gain system transfer functions are analyzed via control theory in terms of system resonances that were recently shown to implement data filtering whose gain adjustments can be interpreted as attention. These filters are shown to govern early and late features in standard evoked responses and their gain parameters are shown to be dynamically adjusted in a way that implements a form of attention. The results show that dynamically modulated resonant filters responsible for the low-frequency oscillations in an evoked potential response have different parameters than those responsible for low-frequency resting EEG responses, while both responses share similar mid- and high-frequency resonant filters. These results provide a biophysical mechanism by which oscillatory activity in the theta, alpha, and beta frequency ranges of an evoked response are modulated as reflections of attention; notably theta is enhanced and alpha suppressed during the latter parts of the ERP. Furthermore, the model enables the part of the ERP response induced by gain modulations to be estimated and interpreted in terms of attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Optimal Self-Induced Stochastic Resonance in Multiplex Neural Networks: Electrical vs. Chemical Synapses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00062</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electrical and chemical synapses shape the dynamics of neural networks, and their functional roles in information processing have been a longstanding question in neurobiology. In this paper, we investigate the role of synapses on the optimization of the phenomenon of self-induced stochastic resonance in a delayed multiplex neural network by using analytical and numerical methods. We consider a two-layer multiplex network in which, at the intra-layer level, neurons are coupled either by electrical synapses or by inhibitory chemical synapses. For each isolated layer, computations indicate that weaker electrical and chemical synaptic couplings are better optimizers of self-induced stochastic resonance. In addition, regardless of the synaptic strengths, shorter electrical synaptic delays are found to be better optimizers of the phenomenon than shorter chemical synaptic delays, while longer chemical synaptic delays are better optimizers than longer electrical synaptic delays; in both cases, the poorer optimizers are, in fact, worst. It is found that electrical, inhibitory, or excitatory chemical multiplexing of the two layers having only electrical synapses at the intra-layer levels can each optimize the phenomenon. Additionally, only excitatory chemical multiplexing of the two layers having only inhibitory chemical synapses at the intra-layer levels can optimize the phenomenon. These results may guide experiments aimed at establishing or confirming to the mechanism of self-induced stochastic resonance in networks of artificial neural circuits as well as in real biological neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Type 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells Accumulate in the Brain After Hypoxia-Ischemia but Do Not Contribute to the Development of Preterm Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00249</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;The immune system of human and mouse neonates is relatively immature. However, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), commonly divided into the subsets ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3, are already present in the placenta and other fetal compartments and exhibit higher activity than what is seen in adulthood. Recent reports have suggested the potential role of ILCs, especially ILC2s, in spontaneous preterm labor, which is associated with brain damage and subsequent long-term neurodevelopmental deficits. Therefore, we hypothesized that ILCs, and especially ILC2s, play a role in preterm brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;C57Bl/6J mice at postnatal day 6 were subjected to hypoxia-ischemia (HI) insult induced by left carotid artery ligation and subsequent exposure to 10% oxygen in nitrogen. The presence of ILCs and ILC2s in the brain was examined at different time points after HI. The contribution of ILC2s to HI-induced preterm brain damage was explored using a conditionally targeted ILC2-deficient mouse strain (Rorα&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;IL7r&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt;), and gray and white-matter injury were evaluated at 7 days post-HI. The inflammatory response in the injured brain was assessed using immunoassays and immunochemistry staining.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Significant increases in ILCs and ILC2s were observed at 24 h, 3 days, and 7 days post-HI in the injured brain hemisphere compared with the uninjured hemisphere in wild-type mice. ILC2s in the brain were predominantly located in the meninges of the injured ipsilateral hemispheres after HI but not in the brain parenchyma. Overall, we did not observe changes in cytokine/chemokine levels in the brains of Rorα&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;IL7r&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared with wild type animals apart from IL-13. Gray and white-matter tissue loss in the brain was not affected after HI in Rorα&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;IL7r&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Correspondingly, we did not find any differences in reactive microglia and astrocyte numbers in the brain in Rorα&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;IL7r&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared with wild-type mice following HI insult.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;After HI, ILCs and ILC2s accumulate in the injured brain hemisphere. However, ILC2s do not contribute to the development of brain damage in this mouse model of preterm brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Membrane tethering is an important communication method for membrane-packaged organelles. Mitochondria are organelles with a bilayer membrane, and the membrane contact between mitochondria and other organelles is indispensable for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Increased levels of molecular determinants that mediate the membrane contact between mitochondria and other organelles, and their functions, have been revealed in recent years. In this review article, we aim to summarize the findings on the tethering between mitochondria and other organelles in physiological or pathological conditions, and discuss their roles in cellular homeostasis, neural activity, and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cerebral Arterial Pulsatility and Global White Matter Microstructure Impact Spatial Working Memory in Older Adults With and Without Cardiovascular Risk Factors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00245</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00245</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging is associated with an increased prevalence of vascular health conditions that are linked to a disruption in the cerebral vasculature and white matter microstructural organization. In people with cardiovascular risk factors, increased cerebral arterial pulsatility is associated with poorer white matter microstructural organization and cognitive functioning. This study examines the relationship among arterial pulsatility, white matter microstructural organization, and cognitive ability in a healthy adult lifespan sample. One hundred and eighty-nine adults were divided into a younger adult (&amp;lt;50 years, n = 97) and older adult (&amp;gt;50 years, n = 92). The latter were further subdivided into two subgroups with (CV+, n = 25) and without (CV−, n = 67) cardiovascular risk factors. Arterial pulsatility was measured using cardiac-gated phase-contrast flow quantification sequence and three indexes of whole-brain white matter microstructural organization [i.e., fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RaD), mean diffusivity (MD)] were derived from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Cognitive ability was assessed using global cognitive functioning (MoCA) and a measure of working memory [sensitivity (d′) from a 2-back task]. Neither the whole group analysis nor the younger adult group showed an association between measures of arterial pulsatility, global white matter microstructural organization, and cognition. In older adults, higher MD and RaD were associated with increased arterial pulsatility and poorer working memory performance. The indirect pathway from arterial pulsatility to working memory performance via both MD and RaD measures was significant in this group. Interestingly, a comparison of CV+ and CV− subgroups showed that this mediating relationship was only evident in older adults with at least one CV risk factor. These findings are consistent with cardiovascular risk factors as underlying arterial, white matter, and cognitive decline in cognitively normal older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Transmembrane Protein 230 Mediates a Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase-1-Linked Apoptosis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in transmembrane protein 230 (TMEM230) gene are suggested to be associated with the autosomal dominant Parkinson’s disease (PD) with typical movement disorders and Lewy body pathology. However, the normal functions and the pathological roles of TMEM230 are not clear. In this study, we used TMEM230 isoform II constructs including wild-type (WT) and four reported PD-linked mutation constructs (Y92C, R141L, 184Wext*5, and 184PGext*5). Ectopic expression of WT and PD-linked mutant TMEM230 variants in cultured cells dramatically induced apoptotic cell death compared with that of vector control cells. Mutant TMEM230 caused cell toxicity at an increased severity than WT TMEM230. Moreover, expression of TMEM230 increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, decreased cellular ATP, activated caspase 3/7, and increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) cleavage. Treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC; an ROS scavenger) or Z-VAD-FMK (a caspase inhibitor) significantly attenuated TMEM230-induced apoptosis in both cultured cells and primary neurons. Our results indicated that TMEM230 mediated a PARP1-linked apoptotic cell death pathway. These findings not only provide the novel insight into the biological roles of TMEM230 in the PARP1-linked pathway but also provide a TMEM230-induced cell death mechanism underlying PD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Effect of magnitude and variability of energy of activation in multisite ultrasensitive biochemical processes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Leonila Lagunes, Lee Bardwell, German A. Enciso&lt;/p&gt;

Protein activity is often regulated by ligand binding or by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. Moreover, proteins that are regulated in this way often contain multiple ligand binding sites or modification sites, which can operate to create an ultrasensitive dose response. Here, we consider the contribution of the individual modification/binding sites to the activation process, and how their individual values affect the ultrasensitive behavior of the overall system. We use a generalized Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model that allows for variable conformational free energy contributions from distinct sites, and associate a so-called activation parameter to each site. Our analysis shows that the ultrasensitivity generally increases as the conformational free energy contribution from one or more sites is strengthen. Furthermore, ultrasensitivity depends on the mean of the activation parameters and not on their variability. In some cases, we find that the best way to maximize ultrasensitivity is to make the contribution from all sites as strong as possible. These results provide insights into the performance objectives of multiple modification/binding sites and thus help gain a greater understanding of signaling and its role in diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RJBqMdkzcCs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Radiation causes tissue damage by dysregulating inflammasome–gasdermin D signaling in both host and transplanted cells</title>

Radiotherapy is a commonly used conditioning regimen for bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Cytotoxicity limits the use of this life-saving therapy, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we use the syngeneic mouse BMT model to test the hypothesis that lethal radiation damages tissues, thereby unleashing signals that indiscriminately activate the inflammasome pathways in host and transplanted cells. We find that a clinically relevant high dose of radiation causes severe damage to bones and the spleen through mechanisms involving the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes but not the NLRC4 inflammasome. Downstream, we demonstrate that gasdermin D (GSDMD), the common effector of the inflammasomes, is also activated by radiation. Remarkably, protection against the injury induced by deadly ionizing radiation occurs only when NLRP3, AIM2, or GSDMD is lost simultaneously in both the donor and host cell compartments. Thus, this study reveals a continuum of the actions of lethal radiation relayed by the inflammasome-GSDMD axis, initially affecting recipient cells and ultimately harming transplanted cells as they grow in the severely injured and toxic environment. This study also suggests that therapeutic targeting of inflammasome-GSDMD signaling has the potential to prevent the collateral effects of intense radiation regimens.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/2JzKjJWvFho&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Dynamic centriolar localization of Polo and Centrobin in early mitosis primes centrosome asymmetry</title>

Centrosomes, the main microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) of metazoan cells, contain an older “mother” and a younger “daughter” centriole. Stem cells either inherit the mother or daughter-centriole-containing centrosome, providing a possible mechanism for biased delivery of cell fate determinants. However, the mechanisms regulating centrosome asymmetry and biased centrosome segregation are unclear. Using 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) and live-cell imaging, we show in fly neural stem cells (neuroblasts) that the mitotic kinase Polo and its centriolar protein substrate Centrobin (Cnb) accumulate on the daughter centriole during mitosis, thereby generating molecularly distinct mother and daughter centrioles before interphase. Cnb’s asymmetric localization, potentially involving a direct relocalization mechanism, is regulated by Polo-mediated phosphorylation, whereas Polo’s daughter centriole enrichment requires both Wdr62 and Cnb. Based on optogenetic protein mislocalization experiments, we propose that the establishment of centriole asymmetry in mitosis primes biased interphase MTOC activity, necessary for correct spindle orientation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/nIq8ciYcrXg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Intact Brain Network Function in an Unresponsive Patient with COVID‐19</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) remain unresponsive after surviving critical illness. Although several structural brain abnormalities have been described, their impact on brain function and implications for prognosis are unknown. Functional neuroimaging, which has prognostic significance, has yet to be explored in this population. Here we describe a patient with severe COVID‐19 who, despite prolonged unresponsiveness and structural brain abnormalities, demonstrated intact functional network connectivity, and weeks later recovered the ability to follow commands.

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Location and arrangement of campaniform sensilla in Drosophila melanogaster&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/651eb958-2de2-4e93-affa-7ed07ab4034f/cne24987-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaniform sensilla are a sensory system in insects that detect deformations of the exoskeleton. The comparison of front, middle, and hindleg sensilla reveals robust locations with a small amount of interindividual variability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensory systems provide input to motor networks on the state of the body and environment. One such sensory system in insects is the campaniform sensilla (CS), which detect deformations of the exoskeleton arising from resisted movements or external perturbations. When physical strain is applied to the cuticle, CS external structures are compressed, leading to transduction in an internal sensory neuron. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster &lt;/i&gt;, the distribution of CS on the exoskeleton has not been comprehensively described. To investigate CS number, location, spatial arrangement, and potential differences between individuals, we compared the front, middle, and hind legs of multiple flies using scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, we imaged the entire body surface to confirm known CS locations. On the legs, the number and relative arrangement of CS varied between individuals, and single CS of corresponding segments showed characteristic differences between legs. This knowledge is fundamental for studying the relevance of cuticular strain information within the complex neuromuscular networks controlling posture and movement. This comprehensive account of all &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster &lt;/i&gt; CS helps set the stage for experimental investigations into their responsivity, sensitivity, and roles in sensory acquisition and motor control in a light‐weight model organism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Quantification of aromatase binding in the female human brain using [11C]cetrozole positron emission tomography&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/93c200b1-1f70-4b8b-8f64-56e5d3153254/jnr24707-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantification of the binding of [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole to aromatase in the brain is best done using the two‐tissue reversible compartment model, or the simplified reference tissue model with the cerebellum as reference region. Receptor parametric mapping and Logan reference tissue model are suitable for parametric mapping. One hour of data acquisition is sufficient for the quantification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aromatase, the enzyme that in the brain converts testosterone and androstenedione to estradiol and estrone, respectively, is a putative key factor in psychoneuroendocrinology. &lt;i&gt;In vivo &lt;/i&gt; assessment of aromatase was performed to evaluate tracer kinetic models and optimal scan duration, for quantitative analysis of the aromatase positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole. Anatomical magnetic resonance and 90‐min dynamic [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole PET‐CT scans were performed on healthy women. Volume of interest (VOI)‐based analyses with a plasma‐input function were performed using the single‐tissue and two‐tissue (2TCM) reversible compartment models and plasma‐input Logan analysis. Additionally, the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), Logan reference tissue model (LRTM), and standardized uptake volume ratio model, with cerebellum as reference region, were evaluated. Parametric images were generated and regionally averaged voxel values were compared with VOI‐based analyses of the reference tissue models. The optimal reference model was used for evaluation of a decreased scan duration. Differences between the plasma‐input‐ and reference tissue‐based methods and comparisons between scan durations were assessed by linear regression. The [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole time–activity curves were best described by the 2TCM. SRTM nondisplaceable binding potential (BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt;), with cerebellum as reference region, can be used to estimate [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole binding and generated robust and quantitatively accurate results for a reduced scan duration of 60 min. Receptor parametric mapping, a basis function implementation of SRTM, as well as LRTM, produced quantitatively accurate parametric images, showing BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; at the voxel level. As PET tracer, [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole can be employed for relatively short brain scans to measure aromatase binding using a reference tissue‐based approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genetic studies have identified variants in the LRRK2 gene as important components of Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathobiology. Biochemical and emergent biomarker studies have coalesced around LRRK2 hyperactivation in disease. Therapeutics that diminish LRRK2 activity, either with small molecule kinase inhibitors or anti-sense oligonucleotides, have recently advanced to the clinic. Historically, there have been few successes in the development of therapies that might slow or halt the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Over the past few decades of biomedical research, retrospective analyses suggest the broad integration of informative biomarkers early in development tends to distinguish successful pipelines from those that fail early. Herein, we discuss the biomarker regulatory process, emerging LRRK2 biomarker candidates, assays, underlying biomarker biology, and clinical integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Cross Talk Between Ferroptosis and Cerebral Ischemia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00776</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, ferroptosis has been revealed as a new form of regulated cell death. Distinct from apoptosis and necrosis, ferroptosis is evoked by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, the metabolism of iron, lipids, and amino acids plays a significant regulatory role in ferroptosis, which can be reversed by glutathione peroxidase 4 and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1. Ferroptosis is implicated in the onset and development of numerous neurological diseases. Emerging studies have reported that ferroptosis induces and aggravates brain tissue damage following cerebral ischemia, whereas inhibition of ferroptosis dramatically attenuates induced damage. In this review, we have summarized the mechanistic relationship between ferroptosis and cerebral ischemia, including through iron overload, downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4, and upregulation of lipid peroxidation. Although considerable attention has been paid to the effect of ferroptosis on cerebral ischemic injury, specific mechanisms need to be experimentally confirmed, including how cerebral ischemia induces ferroptosis and how ferroptosis deteriorates cerebral ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Blood-Brain Barrier: More Contributor to Disruption of Central Nervous System Homeostasis Than Victim in Neurological Disorders</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a dynamic but solid shield in the cerebral microvascular system. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis by regulating the exchange of materials between the circulation and the brain and protects the neural tissue from neurotoxic components as well as pathogens. Here, we discuss the development of the BBB in physiological conditions and then focus on the role of the BBB in cerebrovascular disease, including acute ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage, and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Finally, we summarize recent advancements in the development of therapies targeting the BBB and outline future directions and outstanding questions in the field. We propose that BBB dysfunction not only results from, but is causal in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders; the BBB is more a contributor to the disruption of CNS homeostasis than a victim in neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Sleep Disturbances and Sleep Disordered Breathing Impair Cognitive Performance in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Sleep disturbances and impairment of cognitive function are among the most frequent non-motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD) with negative implications on quality of life of patients and caregivers. Despite the fact that sleep disturbances are a major issue in PD patients, only limited data are available regarding interactions of sleep disturbances and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This post hoc analysis of the RaSPar trial was therefore designed to further elucidate sleep disturbances and their impact on cognition in PD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six PD patients with sleep disturbances were evaluated thoroughly including assessments of patients’ subjective and objective sleep quality by interview, questionnaires, and polysomnography (PSG). Cognitive performance was assessed by Parkinson Neuropsychometric Dementia Assessment (PANDA) and Test of Attentional Performance (TAP), and associations of sleep and cognitive function were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We did not detect differences in cognitive performance between patients with and without rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Instead, cognitive impairment, particularly affecting cognitive domains attention, executive function/working memory, and semantic memory, was associated with impaired PSG-measured sleep quality (e.g., sleep efficiency) and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) (Apnea-Hypopnea Index &amp;gt; 5/h). Global cognitive performance was decreased in patients with SDB (PANDA score 23.2 ± 3.5 vs. 26.9 ± 2.2, P = 0.020, unpaired two-sided t-test).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea and other sleep disturbances impair cognitive performance in PD and should be evaluated in routine care, and treatment options such as continuous airway pressure therapy should be considered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Economical Assessment of Working Memory and Response Inhibition in ADHD Using a Combined n-back/Nogo Paradigm: An ERP Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00322</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00322</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The development of cognitive interventions in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often requires the assessment of multiple cognitive functions. However, experimental settings consisting of various tasks are particularly strenuous for patients and can thus result in poor data quality. For the economical assessment of working memory and response inhibition, this study aims to validate a combined n-back/nogo paradigm by comparing it to single task versions and to demonstrate its applicability for ADHD research. Twenty-five healthy individuals and 34 ADHD patients between 9 and 16 years participated in this event-related potential (ERP) study. Healthy controls underwent single task versions of a 2-back working memory task and a go/nogo response inhibition task as well as the introduced combined 2-back/nogo task. This combined task demonstrated a comparable ERP structure for working memory and response inhibition aspects as single task versions. Behaviorally, higher working memory performance during the combined paradigm indicated lower task difficulty, while high correlations between combined and single task versions still indicated valid working memory measures. For response inhibition performance, different task versions resulted in similar outcomes. The application of the combined n-back/nogo paradigm in ADHD patients revealed the expected working memory and response inhibition deficits, increased omission errors, reaction times, and standard deviation of reaction time, as well as diminished n-back P3 and nogo P3 amplitudes. We conclude that the combined n-back/nogo task is an effective paradigm for the economical assessment of working memory and response inhibition deficits in ADHD on a behavioral and neurophysiological level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Predicting Motor Imagery Performance From Resting-State EEG Using Dynamic Causal Modeling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00321</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00321</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motor imagery-based brain–computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) send commands to a computer using the brain activity registered when a subject imagines—but does not perform—a given movement. However, inconsistent MI-BCI performance occurs in variations of brain signals across subjects and experiments; this is considered to be a significant problem in practical BCI. Moreover, some subjects exhibit a phenomenon referred to as “BCI-inefficiency,” in which they are unable to generate brain signals for BCI control. These subjects have significant difficulties in using BCI. The primary goal of this study is to identify the connections of the resting-state network that affect MI performance and predict MI performance using these connections. We used a public database of MI, which includes the results of psychological questionnaires and pre-experimental resting-state taken over two sessions on different days. A dynamic causal model was used to calculate the coupling strengths between brain regions with directionality. Specifically, we investigated the motor network in resting-state, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which performs motor planning. As a result, we observed a significant difference in the connectivity strength from the supplementary motor area to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the low- and high-MI performance groups. This coupling, measured in the resting-state, is significantly stronger in the high-MI performance group than the low-MI performance group. The connection strength is positively correlated with MI-BCI performance (Session 1: r = 0.54; Session 2: r = 0.42). We also predicted MI performance using linear regression based on this connection (r-squared = 0.31). The proposed predictors, based on dynamic causal modeling, can develop new strategies for improving BCI performance. These findings can further our understanding of BCI-inefficiency and help BCI users to lower costs and save time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Emergence of Stable Synaptic Clusters on Dendrites Through Synaptic Rewiring</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The connectivity structure of neuronal networks in cortex is highly dynamic. This ongoing cortical rewiring is assumed to serve important functions for learning and memory. We analyze in this article a model for the self-organization of synaptic inputs onto dendritic branches of pyramidal cells. The model combines a generic stochastic rewiring principle with a simple synaptic plasticity rule that depends on local dendritic activity. In computer simulations, we find that this synaptic rewiring model leads to synaptic clustering, that is, temporally correlated inputs become locally clustered on dendritic branches. This empirical finding is backed up by a theoretical analysis which shows that rewiring in our model favors network configurations with synaptic clustering. We propose that synaptic clustering plays an important role in the organization of computation and memory in cortical circuits: we find that synaptic clustering through the proposed rewiring mechanism can serve as a mechanism to protect memories from subsequent modifications on a medium time scale. Rewiring of synaptic connections onto specific dendritic branches may thus counteract the general problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: New Optical Tools to Study Neural Circuit Assembly in the Retina</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;During development, neurons navigate a tangled thicket of thousands of axons and dendrites to synapse with just a few specific targets. This phenomenon termed wiring specificity, is critical to the assembly of neural circuits and the way neurons manage this feat is only now becoming clear. Recent studies in the mouse retina are shedding new insight into this process. They show that specific wiring arises through a series of stages that include: directed axonal and dendritic growth, the formation of neuropil layers, positioning of such layers, and matching of co-laminar synaptic partners. Each stage appears to be directed by a distinct family of recognition molecules, suggesting that the combinatorial expression of such family members might act as a blueprint for retinal connectivity. By reviewing the evidence in support of each stage, and by considering their underlying molecular mechanisms, we attempt to synthesize these results into a wiring model which generates testable predictions for future studies. Finally, we conclude by highlighting new optical methods that could be used to address such predictions and gain further insight into this fundamental process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Developmentally Regulated Rebound Depolarization Enhances Spike Timing Precision in Auditory Midbrain Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00236</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The inferior colliculus (IC) is an auditory midbrain structure involved in processing biologically important temporal features of sounds. The responses of IC neurons to these temporal features reflect an interaction of synaptic inputs and neuronal biophysical properties. One striking biophysical property of IC neurons is the rebound depolarization produced following membrane hyperpolarization. To understand how the rebound depolarization is involved in spike timing, we made whole-cell patch clamp recordings from IC neurons in brain slices of P9–21 rats. We found that the percentage of rebound neurons was developmentally regulated. The precision of the timing of the first spike on the rebound increased when the neuron was repetitively injected with a depolarizing current following membrane hyperpolarization. The average jitter of the first spikes was only 0.5 ms. The selective T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel antagonist, mibefradil, significantly increased the jitter of the first spike of neurons in response to repetitive depolarization following membrane hyperpolarization. Furthermore, the rebound was potentiated by one to two preceding rebounds within a few hundred milliseconds. The first spike generated on the potentiated rebound was more precise than that on the non-potentiated rebound. With the addition of a calcium chelator, BAPTA, into the cell, the rebound potentiation no longer occurred, and the precision of the first spike on the rebound was not improved. These results suggest that the postinhibitory rebound mediated by T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel promotes spike timing precision in IC neurons. The rebound potentiation and precise spikes may be induced by increases in intracellular calcium levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Insight Into the Role of Ferroptosis in Non-neoplastic Neurological Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of cell death characterized by the accumulation of intracellular lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ferroptosis is significantly different from other types of cell death including apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis, both in morphology and biochemical characteristics. The mechanisms that are associated with ferroptosis include iron metabolism, lipid oxidation, and other pathophysiological changes. Ferroptosis inducers or inhibitors can influence its occurrence through different pathways. Ferroptosis was initially discovered in tumors, though recent studies have confirmed that it is also closely related to a variety of neurological diseases including neurodegenerative disease [Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), etc.] and stroke. This article reviews the definition and characteristics of ferroptosis, the potential mechanisms associated with its development, inducers/inhibitors, and its role in non-neoplastic neurological diseases. We hope to provide a theoretical basis and novel treatment strategies for the treatment of central nervous system diseases by targeting ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Effects of Lactate on One Class of Group III (CT3) Muscle Afferents</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00215</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00215</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A class of Group III muscle afferent neurons has branching sensory terminals in the connective tissue between layers of mouse abdominal muscles (“CT3 muscle afferents”). These sensory endings are both mechanosensitive and metabosensitive. In the present study, responses of CT3 afferents to lactate ions and changes in temperature were recorded. Raising muscle temperature from 32.7°C to 37°C had no consistent effects on CT3 afferent basal firing rate or responses to either von Frey hair stimulation or to an applied load. Superfusion with lactate ions (15 mM, pH 7.4) was associated with an increase in firing from 6 ± 0.7 Hz to 11.7 ± 6.7 Hz (14 units, n = 13, P &amp;lt; 0.05, P = 0.0484) but with considerable variability in the nature and latency of response. Reducing the concentration of extracellular divalent cations, which mimicked the chelating effects of lactate, did not increase firing. Raised concentrations of divalent cations (to compensate for chelation) did not block excitatory effects of lactate on CT3 afferents, suggesting that effects via ASIC3 were not involved. Messenger RNA for the G-protein coupled receptor, hydroxyl carboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1) was detected in dorsal root ganglia and HCAR1-like immunoreactivity was present in spinal afferent nerve cell bodies retrogradely labeled from mouse abdominal muscles. HCAR1-like immunoreactivity was also present in axons in mouse abdominal muscles. This raises the possibility that some effects of lactate on group III muscle afferents may be mediated by HCAR1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory processes and microglia activation accompany most of the pathophysiological diseases in the central nervous system. It is proven that glial pathology precedes and even drives the development of multiple neurodegenerative conditions. A growing number of studies point out the importance of microglia in brain development as well as in physiological functioning. These resident brain immune cells are divergent from the peripherally infiltrated macrophages, but their precise in situ discrimination is surprisingly difficult. Microglial heterogeneity in the brain is especially visible in their morphology and cell density in particular brain structures but also in the expression of cellular markers. This often determines their role in physiology or pathology of brain functioning. The species differences between rodent and human markers add complexity to the whole picture. Furthermore, due to activation, microglia show a broad spectrum of phenotypes ranging from the pro-inflammatory, potentially cytotoxic M1 to the anti-inflammatory, scavenging, and regenerative M2. A precise distinction of specific phenotypes is nowadays essential to study microglial functions and tissue state in such a quickly changing environment. Due to the overwhelming amount of data on multiple sets of markers that is available for such studies, the choice of appropriate markers is a scientific challenge. This review gathers, classifies, and describes known and recently discovered protein markers expressed by microglial cells in their different phenotypes. The presented microglia markers include qualitative and semi-quantitative, general and specific, surface and intracellular proteins, as well as secreted molecules. The information provided here creates a comprehensive and practical guide through the current knowledge and will facilitate the choosing of proper, more specific markers for detailed studies on microglia and neuroinflammatory mechanisms in various physiological as well as pathological conditions. Both basic research and clinical medicine need clearly described and validated molecular markers of microglia phenotype, which are essential in diagnostics, treatment, and prevention of diseases engaging glia activation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The adult central nervous system (CNS) contains resident stem cells within specific niches that maintain a self-renewal and proliferative capacity to generate new neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes throughout adulthood. Physiological aging is associated with a progressive loss of function and a decline in the self-renewal and regenerative capacities of CNS stem cells. Also, the biggest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases is age, and current in vivo and in vitro models of neurodegenerative diseases rarely consider this. Therefore, combining both aging research and appropriate interrogation of animal disease models towards the understanding of the disease and age-related stem cell failure is imperative to the discovery of new therapies. This review article will highlight the main intrinsic and extrinsic regulators of neural stem cell (NSC) aging and discuss how these factors impact normal homeostatic functions within the adult brain. We will consider established in vivo animal and in vitro human disease model systems, and then discuss the current and future trajectories of novel senotherapeutics that target aging NSCs to ameliorate brain disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Evaluation of the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment for Predicting Post-stroke Cognitive Impairment During the Acute Phase in Chinese Minor Stroke Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00236</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00236</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To assess the value of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) during acute phase in predicting post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) at 3–6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We prospectively recruited 229 patients who had suffered their first-ever ischemic stroke. PSCI was determined in 104 of these patients by a comprehensive neuropsychological battery performed at 3–6 months. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was then performed to compare the discriminatory ability of the MMSE and MoCA. Also, we applied a decision tree generated by the classification and regression tree methodology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In total, 66 patients had PSCI when evaluated 3–6 months after the onset of minor stroke. Logistic regression analysis revealed that education, body mass index (BMI), and baseline MoCA scores were independently associated with PSCI. ROC curve analysis showed that the ability to predict PSCI was similar when compared between baseline MoCA scores [area under curve (AUC), 0.821; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.743–0.898] and baseline MMSE scores (AUC, 0.809; 95% CI, 0.725–0.892, P = 0.75). Both MMSE and MoCA exhibited similar predictive values at their optimal cut-off points (MMSE ≤27; sensitivity, 0.682; specificity, 0.816; MoCA ≤21; sensitivity, 0.636; specificity, 0.895). Classification and regression tree-derived analysis yielded an AUC of 0.823 (sensitivity, 0.803; specificity, 0.842).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: When applied within 2 weeks of stroke, the MMSE and MoCA are both useful and have similar predictive value for PSCI 3–6 months after the onset of minor stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Associated with Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25847?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25847?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim was to investigate whether neurodegenerative biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) differentiate patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) who respond to CSF drainage from patients who do not respond.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from 62 consecutive patients who presented with magnetic resonance imaging changes indicative of NPH were studied with regard to cognitive and gait functions before and after drainage of 40–50ml of CSF. Additionally, S100 protein, neuron‐specific enolase, β‐amyloid protein, tau protein and phospho‐tau were determined in CSF. Statistical analyses were carried out with ANOVA and multiple linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with CSF constellations typical for Alzheimer's disease (n = 28) improved significantly in cognitive and gait‐related functions after CSF drainage. In contrast, those patients without a CSF constellation typical for Alzheimer's disease (n = 34) did not improve in cognitive and gait‐related functions after CSF drainage. In addition, positive CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease predicted these improvements.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data suggest an association between Alzheimer's disease and NPH changes, supporting the recently suggested dichotomy of a neurodegenerative NPH and a true idiopathic NPH, with the latter appearing to be rare. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Non‐motor symptoms in Parkinson´s disease are reduced by nabilone</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25864?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25864?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the efficacy and safety of nabilone, a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol analogue, as a treatment for non‐motor symptoms (NMS) in Parkinson´s Disease (PD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a phase II placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, parallel‐group, enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal trial at the Medical University Innsbruck. A random sample of 47 PD patients with stable motor disease and disturbing NMS defined by a score of ≥4 points on the Movement Disorder Society‐Unified PD Rating Scale‐I (MDS‐UPDRS‐I) underwent open‐label nabilone titration (0.25mg once daily‐1mg twice daily, Phase 1). Responders were randomized 1:1 to continue with nabilone or switch to placebo for four weeks (Phase 2). The primary efficacy criterion was the change of the MDS‐UPDRS‐I between randomization and week four. Safety was analyzed in all patients who received at least one nabilone dose.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between October 2017 and July 2019, 19 patients received either nabilone (median dose=0.75mg) or placebo. At week four, mean change of the MDS‐UPDRS‐I was 2.63 (95%CI 1.53‐3.74, p=0.002, effect size=1.15) in the placebo versus 1.00 (95%CI ‐0.16‐2.16, p=0.280, effect size=0.42) in the nabilone‐group (difference:1.63, 95%CI 0.09‐3.18, p=0.030, effect size=0.66). Seventy‐seven percent of patients had adverse events (AEs) during open‐label titration, most of them were transient. In the double‐blind phase, similar proportions of patients in each group had AEs (42% placebo‐group, 32% nabilone‐group). There were no serious AEs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results highlight the potential efficacy of nabilone for PD patients with disturbing NMS, which appears to be driven by positive effects on anxious mood and night‐time sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Anticoagulation Timing in Cardioembolic Stroke and Recurrent Event Risk</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25844?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25844?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidelines recommend initiating anticoagulation within 4 to 14 days after cardioembolic stroke. Data supporting this did not account for key factors potentially affecting the decision to initiate anticoagulation, such as infarct size, hemorrhagic transformation, or high‐risk features on echocardiography.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pooled data from stroke registries of 8 comprehensive stroke centers across the United States. We included consecutive patients admitted with ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation. The primary predictor was timing of initiating anticoagulation (0–3 days, 4–14 days, or &amp;gt;14 days), and outcomes were recurrent stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolism, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and major extracranial hemorrhage (ECH) within 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 2,084 patients, 1,289 met the inclusion criteria. The combined endpoint occurred in 10.1% (n = 130) subjects (87 ischemic events, 20 sICH, and 29 ECH). Overall, there was no significant difference in the composite endpoint between the 3 groups (0–3 days: 10.3%, 64/617; 4–14 days: 9.7%, 52/535; &amp;gt;14 days: 10.2%, 14/137; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.933). In adjusted models, patients started on anticoagulation between 4 and 14 days did not have a lower rate of sICH (vs 0–3 days; odds ratio [OR] = 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50–4.43), nor did they have a lower rate of recurrent ischemic events (vs &amp;gt;14 days; OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.36–1.62, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.482).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this multicenter real‐world cohort, the recommended (4–14 days) time frame to start oral anticoagulation was not associated with reduced ischemic and hemorrhagic outcomes. Randomized trials are required to determine the optimal timing of anticoagulation initiation. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Non-genomic Actions of Methylprednisolone Differentially Influence GABA and Glutamate Release From Isolated Nerve Terminals of the Rat Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00146</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00146</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Corticosteroids exert a dual role in eukaryotic cells through their action via (1) intracellular receptors (slow genomic responses), or (2) membrane-bound receptors (fast non-genomic responses). Highly vulnerable regions of the brain, like the hippocampus, express high amounts of corticosteroid receptors, yet their actions on ionic currents and neurotransmitters release are still undefined. Here, we investigated the effect of methylprednisolone (MP) on GABA and glutamate (Glu) release from isolated nerve terminals of the rat hippocampus. MP favored both spontaneous and depolarization-evoked [&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]Glu release from rat hippocampal nerve terminals, without affecting [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]GABA outflow. Facilitation of [&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]Glu release by MP is mediated by a Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-independent non-genomic mechanism relying on the activation of membrane-bound glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors sensitive to their antagonists mifepristone and spironolactone, respectively. The involvement of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent high-affinity EAAT transport reversal was inferred by blockage of MP-induced [&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]Glu release by DL-TBOA. Depolarization-evoked [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]GABA release in the presence of MP was partially attenuated by the selective P2X7 receptor antagonist A-438079, but this compound did not affect the release of [&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]Glu. Data indicate that MP differentially affects GABA and glutamate release from rat hippocampal nerve terminals via fast non-genomic mechanisms putatively involving the activation of membrane-bound corticosteroid receptors. Facilitation of Glu release strengthen previous assumptions that MP may act as a cognitive enhancer in rats, while crosstalk with ATP-sensitive P2X7 receptors may promote a therapeutically desirable GABAergic inhibitory control during paroxysmal epileptic crisis that might be particularly relevant when extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels decrease below the threshold required for transmitter release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: LAMA2-Related Dystrophies: Clinical Phenotypes, Disease Biomarkers, and Clinical Trial Readiness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00123</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00123</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in the LAMA2 gene affect the production of the α2 subunit of laminin-211 (= merosin) and result in either partial or complete laminin-211 deficiency. Complete merosin deficiency is typically associated with a more severe congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), clinically manifested by hypotonia and weakness at birth, the development of contractures of large joints, and progressive respiratory involvement. Muscle atrophy and severe weakness typically prevent independent ambulation. Partial merosin deficiency is mostly manifested by later onset limb-girdle weakness and joint contractures so that independent ambulation is typically achieved. Collectively, complete and partial merosin deficiency is referred to as LAMA2-related dystrophies (LAMA2-RDs) and represents one of the most common forms of congenital muscular dystrophies worldwide. LAMA2-RDs are classically characterized by both central and peripheral nervous system involvement with abnormal appearing white matter (WM) on brain MRI and dystrophic appearing muscle on muscle biopsy as well as creatine kinase (CK) levels commonly elevated to &amp;gt;1,000 IU/L. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has greatly improved diagnostic abilities for LAMA2-RD, and the majority of patients with merosin deficiency carry recessive pathogenic variants in the LAMA2 gene. The existence of multiple animal models for LAMA2-RDs has helped to advance our understanding of laminin-211 and has been instrumental in preclinical research progress and translation to clinical trials. The first clinical trial for the LAMA2-RDs was a phase 1 pharmacokinetic and safety study of the anti-apoptotic compound omigapil, based on preclinical studies performed in the dy&lt;sup&gt;W&lt;/sup&gt;/dy&lt;sup&gt;W&lt;/sup&gt; and dy&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;/dy&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mouse models. This phase 1 study enabled the collection of pulmonary and motor outcome measures and also provided the opportunity for investigating exploratory outcome measures including muscle ultrasound, muscle MRI and serum, and urine biomarker collection. Natural history studies, including a five-year prospective natural history and comparative outcome measures study in patients with LAMA2-RD, have helped to better delineate the natural history and identify viable outcome measures. Plans for further clinical trials for LAMA2-RDs are presently in progress, highlighting the necessity of identifying adequate, disease-relevant biomarkers, capable of reflecting potential therapeutic changes, in addition to refining the clinical outcome measures and time-to-event trajectory analysis of affected patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in the development of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract during the early postnatal period can influence brain development and vice-versa. It is increasingly recognized that communication between the GI tract and brain is mainly driven by neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic mediators, collectively called the gut-brain axis (GBA). Changes in the GBA mediators occur in response to the developmental changes in the body during this period. This review provides an overview of major developmental events in the GI tract and brain in the early postnatal period and their parallel developmental trajectories under physiological conditions. Current knowledge of GBA mediators in context to brain function and behavioral outcomes and their synthesis and metabolism (site, timing, etc.) is discussed. This review also presents hypotheses on the role of the GBA mediators in response to the parallel development of the GI tract and brain in infants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reward and punishment have demonstrated dissociable effects on motor learning and memory, which suggests that these reinforcers are differently processed by the brain. To test this possibility, we use electroencephalography to record cortical neural activity after the presentation of reward and punishment feedback during a visuomotor rotation task. Participants were randomly placed into Reward, Punishment, or Control groups and performed the task under different conditions to assess the adaptation (learning) and retention (memory) of the motor task. These conditions featured an incongruent position between the cursor and the target, with the cursor trajectory, rotated 30° counterclockwise, requiring the participant to adapt their movement to hit the target. Feedback based on error magnitude was provided during the Adaptation condition in the form of a positive number (Reward) or negative number (Punishment), each representing a monetary gain or loss, respectively. No reinforcement or visual feedback was provided during the No Vision condition (retention). Performance error and event-related potentials (ERPs) time-locked to feedback presentation were calculated for each participant during both conditions. Punishment feedback reduced performance error and promoted faster learning during the Adaptation condition. In contrast, punishment feedback increased performance error during the No Vision condition compared to Control and Reward groups, which suggests a diminished motor memory. Moreover, the Punishment group showed a significant decrease in the amplitude of ERPs during the No Vision condition compared to the Adaptation condition. The amplitude of ERPs did not change in the other two groups. These results suggest that punishment feedback impairs motor retention by altering the neural processing involved in memory encoding. This study provides a neurophysiological underpinning for the dissociative effects of punishment feedback on motor learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: SARS-CoV-2 Dissemination Through Peripheral Nerves Explains Multiple Organ Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease (CoVID-19), caused by recently identified severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is characterized by inconsistent clinical presentations. While many infected individuals remain asymptomatic or show mild respiratory symptoms, others develop severe pneumonia or even respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be able to infect the lungs, the intestines, blood vessels, the bile ducts, the conjunctiva, macrophages, T lymphocytes, the heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. More than a third of cases displayed neurological involvement, and many severely ill patients developed multiple organ infection and injury. However, less than 1% of patients had a detectable level of SARS-CoV-2 in the blood, raising a question of how the virus spreads throughout the body. We propose that nerve terminals in the orofacial mucosa, eyes, and olfactory neuroepithelium act as entry points for the brain invasion, allowing SARS-CoV-2 to infect the brainstem. By exploiting the subcellular membrane compartments of infected cells, a feature common to all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is capable to disseminate from the brain to periphery via vesicular axonal transport and passive diffusion through axonal endoplasmic reticula, causing multiple organ injury independently of an underlying respiratory infection. The proposed model clarifies a wide range of clinically observed phenomena in CoVID-19 patients, such as neurological symptoms unassociated with lung pathology, protracted presence of the virus in samples obtained from recovered patients, exaggerated immune response, and multiple organ failure in severe cases with variable course and dynamics of the disease. We believe that this model can provide novel insights into CoVID-19 and its long-term sequelae, and establish a framework for further research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Role of Chondroitin Sulfation Following Spinal Cord Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic spinal cord injury produces long-term neurological damage, and presents a significant public health problem with nearly 18,000 new cases per year in the U.S. The injury results in both acute and chronic changes in the spinal cord, ultimately resulting in the production of a glial scar, consisting of multiple cells including fibroblasts, macrophages, microglia, and reactive astrocytes. Within the scar, there is an accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules—primarily tenascins and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs)—which are considered to be inhibitory to axonal regeneration. In this review article, we discuss the role of CSPGs in the injury response, especially how sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains act to inhibit plasticity and regeneration. This includes how sulfation of GAG chains influences their biological activity and interactions with potential receptors. Comprehending the role of CSPGs in the inhibitory properties of the glial scar provides critical knowledge in the much-needed production of new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Fear Priming: A Method for Examining Postural Strategies Associated With Fear of Falling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fear of falling influences postural strategies used for balance, and is key in the maintenance of independent living and quality of life as adults age. However, there is a distinct need for methodology that aims to specifically address and prime fear under dynamic conditions, and to better determine the role of fear in movement preparation. This preliminary study investigated how fear priming influences fear of falling in young and older individuals, and assessed how changes in fear of falling map to movement behavior. Young (21.5 ± 1.7 years, n = 10) and older (58.1 ± 2.2 years) participants matched for height, weight, and sex were repeatedly exposed to four different and incrementally challenging laboratory-based slipping perturbations during a self-initiated, goal-directed step and reach task. Both younger and older cohorts showed similar heightened perceptions in fear of falling after fear priming, and changes in peak joint excursions including reduced ankle flexion, and increased lumbar flexion after fear priming. Age-related changes were only evident in total mediolateral center of mass displacement, with younger participants showing greater displacement after fear priming. Despite clear differences in preparatory muscle onsets relative to reach onset seen in older participants, muscle timings or co-contraction indices were not significantly different. Methods utilizing repeated exposure to varying increases of a slip-based postural challenge can successfully prime fear of falling in individuals, regardless of age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Nearly all brain functions involve routing neural activity among a distributed network of areas. Understanding this routing requires more than a description of interareal anatomical connectivity: it requires understanding what controls the flow of signals through interareal circuitry and how this communication might be modulated to allow flexible behavior. Here we review proposals of how communication, particularly between visual cortical areas, is instantiated and modulated, highlighting recent work that offers new perspectives.</description>

	<description>Vancraeyenest et al. reversibly inactivated the pathway from the VTA to the NAc using a double-infection viral vector approach in macaques. This mainly affected dopaminergic projections and resulted in increased functional connectivity, especially pronounced in fronto-temporal circuits. Surprisingly, reinforcement-based learning remained unaffected, contrary to motivational behavior requiring high effort.</description>

	<description>In this issue of Neuron, Vandael et al. (2020) reveal that post-tetanic potentiation at dentate gyrus mossy fiber synapses is induced by natural activity patterns. This plasticity is mediated by an increase in readily releasable vesicle pool size and is extended in the absence of activity, forming a “pool engram.”</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Predicting precision grip grasp locations on three-dimensional objects</title>

We rarely experience difficulty picking up objects, yet of all potential contact points on the surface, only a small proportion yield effective grasps. Here, we present extensive behavioral data alongside a normative model that correctly predicts human precision grasping of unfamiliar 3D objects. We tracked participants’ forefinger and thumb as they picked up objects of 10 wood and brass cubes configured to tease apart effects of shape, weight, orientation, and mass distribution. Grasps were highly systematic and consistent across repetitions and participants. We employed these data to construct a model which combines five cost functions related to force closure, torque, natural grasp axis, grasp aperture, and visibility. Even without free parameters, the model predicts individual grasps almost as well as different individuals predict one another’s, but fitting weights reveals the relative importance of the different constraints. The model also accurately predicts human grasps on novel 3D-printed objects with more naturalistic geometries and is robust to perturbations in its key parameters. Together, the findings provide a unified account of how we successfully grasp objects of different 3D shape, orientation, mass, and mass distribution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YoLZSjliezU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Identification of regenerative processes in neonatal spinal cord injury in the opossum (Monodelphis domestica): A transcriptomic study&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f47a19fd-4fc5-40b4-b6c2-be836b8ff57a/cne24994-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In opossums, spinal injury early in development results in spontaneous axon growth through the injury, but this regeneration diminishes with maturity until it is lost entirely. Analysis of the postinjury transcriptomes suggests that there is a more complex transcriptomic response in nonregenerating cords, suggesting a stronger influence of non‐neuronal cells in the outcome after injury, and suggesting that a prolonged immune response may be inhibitory to spinal cord regeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the response to spinal cord injury in the gray short‐tailed opossum (&lt;i&gt;Monodelphis domestica &lt;/i&gt;). In opossums spinal injury early in development results in spontaneous axon growth through the injury, but this regenerative potential diminishes with maturity until it is lost entirely. The mechanisms underlying this regeneration remain unknown. RNA sequencing was used to identify differential gene expression in regenerating (SCI at postnatal Day 7, P7SCI) and nonregenerating (SCI at Day 28, P28SCI) cords +1d, +3d, and +7d after complete spinal transection, compared to age‐matched controls. Genes showing significant differential expression (log2FC ≥ 1, &lt;i&gt;Padj &lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.05) were used for downstream analysis. Across all time‐points 233 genes altered expression after P7SCI, and 472 genes altered expression after P28SCI. One hundred and forty‐seven genes altered expression in both injury ages (63% of P7SCI data set). The majority of changes were gene upregulations. Gene ontology overrepresentation analysis in P7SCI gene‐sets showed significant overrepresentations only in immune‐associated categories, while P28SCI gene‐sets showed overrepresentations in these same immune categories, along with other categories such as “cell proliferation,” “cell adhesion,” and “apoptosis.” Cell‐type–association analysis suggested that, regardless of injury age, injury‐associated gene transcripts were most strongly associated with microglia and endothelial cells, with strikingly fewer astrocyte, oligodendrocyte and neuron‐related genes, the notable exception being a cluster of mostly downregulated oligodendrocyte‐associated genes in the P7SCI + 7d gene‐set. Our findings demonstrate a more complex transcriptomic response in nonregenerating cords, suggesting a strong influence of non‐neuronal cells in the outcome after injury and providing the largest survey yet of the transcriptomic changes occurring after SCI in this model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Distribution of polysialic acid (polySia) immunoreactivity in the adult rat brainstem (a) and thoracolumbar spinal cord (b–e). Discrete neural regions express the glycan, including the nucleus of solitary tract, Sp5C, A1 region (a) and dorsal horn and lateral horn (b) where choline acetyltransferase positive sympathetic preganglionic neurons are often coated with polySia (c–e).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polysialic acid (polySia), a homopolymer of α2,8‐linked glycans, is a posttranslational modification on a few glycoproteins, most commonly in the brain, on the neural cell adhesion molecule. Most research in the adult central nervous system has focused on its expression in higher brain regions, where its distribution coincides with regions known to exhibit high levels of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, scant attention has been paid to the expression of polySia in the hindbrain. The main aims of the study were to examine the distribution of polySia immunoreactivity in the brainstem and thoracolumbar spinal cord, to compare the distribution of polySia revealed by two commercial antibodies commonly used for its investigation, and to compare labeling in the rat and mouse. We present a comprehensive atlas of polySia immunoreactivity: we report that polySia labeling is particularly dense in the dorsal tegmentum, medial vestibular nuclei and lateral parabrachial nucleus, and in brainstem regions associated with autonomic function, including the dorsal vagal complex, A5, rostral ventral medulla, A1, and midline raphe, as well as sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord and central targets of primary sensory afferents (nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and dorsal horn [DH]). Ultrastructural examination showed labeling was present predominantly on the plasma membrane/within the extracellular space/in or on astrocytes. Labeling throughout the brainstem and spinal cord were very similar for the two antibodies and was eliminated by the polySia‐specific sialidase, Endo‐NF. Similar patterns of distribution were found in rat and mouse brainstem with differences evident in DH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Melatonin alters neuronal architecture and increases cysteine‐rich protein 1 signaling in the male mouse hippocampus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5a169b77-30db-4c92-ac85-8e520d6453ea/jnr24708-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exogenous melatonin significantly alters hippocampal neuronal micromorphometry, increases cysteine‐rich protein 1 (crp‐1) expression, and improves memory retention in mice. These findings expand our knowledge about the beneficial effects of melatonin on hippocampal neurons, and implicates alterations of structural neuroplasticity and crp‐1 upregulation as possible key players in this process of cognitive function improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal plasticity describes changes in structure, function, and connections of neurons. The hippocampus, in particular, has been shown to exhibit considerable plasticity regarding both physiological and morphological functions. Melatonin, a hormone released by the pineal gland, promotes cell survival and dendrite maturation of neurons in the newborn brain and protects against neurological disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of exogenous melatonin on neuronal architecture and its possible mechanism in the hippocampus of adult male C57BL/6 mice. Melatonin treatment significantly increased the total length and complexity of dendrites in the apical and basal &lt;i&gt;cornu ammonis &lt;/i&gt; (CA) 1 and in the dentate gyrus in mouse hippocampi. Spine density in CA1 apical dendrites was increased, but no significant differences in other subregions were observed. In primary cultured hippocampal neurons, the length and arborization of neurites were significantly augmented by melatonin treatment. Additionally, western blot and immunohistochemical analyses in both &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt; systems revealed significant increases in the level of cysteine‐rich protein 1 (crp‐1) protein, which is known to be involved in dendritic branching in mouse hippocampal neurons after melatonin treatment. Our results suggest that exogenous melatonin leads to significant alterations of neuronal micromorphometry in the adult hippocampus, possibly via crp‐1 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Impaired intracellular trafficking of sodium‐dependent vitamin C transporter 2 contributes to the redox imbalance in Huntington’s disease&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d254913a-608d-45be-9adb-f4f86586a802/jnr24693-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular ascorbic acid induces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, stimulating sodium‐dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2) anterograde trafficking in wild‐type cells. No ascorbic acid‐induced cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase was observed in Huntington's disease (HD) cells. Thus, SVCT2 would fail to reach the cellular surface, affecting ascorbic acid uptake in HD cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a glutamine expansion at the first exon of the huntingtin gene. Huntingtin protein (Htt) is ubiquitously expressed and it is localized in several organelles, including endosomes. HD is associated with a failure in energy metabolism and oxidative damage. Ascorbic acid is a powerful antioxidant highly concentrated in the brain where it acts as a messenger, modulating neuronal metabolism. It is transported into neurons via the sodium‐dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2). During synaptic activity, ascorbic acid is released from glial reservoirs to the extracellular space, inducing an increase in SVCT2 localization at the plasma membrane. Here, we studied SVCT2 trafficking and localization in HD. SVCT2 is decreased at synaptic terminals in YAC128 male mice. Using cellular models for HD (STHdhQ7 and STHdhQ111 cells), we determined that SVCT2 trafficking through secretory and endosomal pathways is altered in resting conditions. We observed Golgi fragmentation and SVCT2/Htt‐associated protein‐1 mis‐colocalization. Additionally, we observed altered ascorbic acid‐induced calcium signaling that explains the reduced SVCT2 translocation to the plasma membrane in the presence of extracellular ascorbic acid (active conditions) described in our previous results. Therefore, SVCT2 trafficking to the plasma membrane is altered in resting and active conditions in HD, explaining the redox imbalance observed during early stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The entorhinal cortex of the monkey: VI. Organization of projections from the hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3222d5e6-4c58-4d3d-8888-58edc6f7d85b/cne24983-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projections from hippocampal fields CA1 and the subiculum to the entorhinal cortex are topographically organized. Projections from the presubiculum preferentially distribute to the caudal half of the entorhinal cortex and thus provides a potential indicator for a primate homologue of the medial entorhinal cortex as defined in rodents.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization of projections from the macaque monkey hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum to the entorhinal cortex was analyzed using anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques. Projections exclusively originate in the CA1 field of the hippocampus and in the subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. The CA1 and subicular projections terminate most densely in Layers V and VI of the entorhinal cortex, with sparser innervation of the deep portion of Layers III and II. Entorhinal projections from CA1 and the subiculum are topographically organized such that a rostrocaudal axis of origin is related to a medial‐to‐lateral axis of termination. A proximodistal axis of origin in CA1 and distoproximal axis in subiculum are related to a rostrocaudal axis of termination in the entorhinal cortex. The presubiculum sends a dense, bilateral projection to caudal parts of the entorhinal cortex. This projection terminates most densely in Layer III with sparser termination in Layers I, II, and V. The same parts of entorhinal cortex receive a dense projection from the parasubiculum. This projection terminates in Layers III and II. Both presubicular and parasubicular projections demonstrate the same longitudinal topographic organization as the projections from CA1 and the subiculum. These studies demonstrate that: (a) hippocampal and subicular inputs to the entorhinal cortex in the monkey are organized similar to those described in nonprimate species; (b) the topographic organization of the projections from the hippocampus and subicular areas matches that of the reciprocal projections from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus and the subicular areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Effects of Cortical Cooling on Activity Across Layers of the Rat Barrel Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00052</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00052</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Moderate cortical cooling is known to suppress slow oscillations and to evoke persistent cortical activity. However, the cooling-induced changes in electrical activity across cortical layers remain largely unknown. Here, we performed multi-channel local field potential (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA) recordings with linear silicone probes through the layers of single cortical barrel columns in urethane-anesthetized rats under normothermia (38°C) and during local cortical surface cooling (30°C). During cortically generated slow oscillations, moderate cortical cooling decreased delta wave amplitude, delta-wave occurrence, the duration of silent states, and delta wave-locked MUA synchronization. Moderate cortical cooling increased total time spent in the active state and decreased total time spent in the silent state. Cooling-evoked changes in the MUA firing rate in cortical layer 5 (L5) varied from increase to decrease across animals, and the polarity of changes in L5 MUA correlated with changes in total time spent in the active state. The decrease in temperature reduced MUA firing rates in all other cortical layers. Sensory-evoked MUA responses also decreased during cooling through all cortical layers. The cooling-dependent slowdown was detected at the fast time-scale with a decreased frequency of sensory-evoked high-frequency oscillations (HFO). Thus, moderate cortical cooling suppresses slow oscillations and desynchronizes neuronal activity through all cortical layers, and is associated with reduced firing across all cortical layers except L5, where cooling induces variable and non-consistent changes in neuronal firing, which are common features of the transition from slow-wave synchronization to desynchronized activity in the barrel cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Fentanyl Inhibits Air Puff-Evoked Sensory Information Processing in Mouse Cerebellar Neurons Recorded in vivo</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00051</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aim: To examine the effects of fentanyl, a potent mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, on-air puff-evoked responses in Purkinje cells (PCs), and molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) using in vivo patch-clamp recordings in anesthetized mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Male mice 6–8 weeks-old were anesthetized and fixed on a custom-made stereotaxic frame. The cerebellar surface was exposed and perfused with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). Patch-clamp recordings in the cell-attached mode were obtained from PCs and MLIs. Facial stimulation by air-puff of the ipsilateral whisker pad was performed through a pressurized injection system. Fentanyl citrate, CTOP, and H-89 dissolved in ACSF were perfused onto the cerebellar surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Fentanyl significantly inhibited the amplitude and area under the curve (AUC) of sensory stimulation-evoked inhibitory responses in PCs. Although fentanyl did not influence the frequency of simple spikes (SSs), it decreased the pause of SS. The IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of the fentanyl-induced suppression of the P1 response amplitude was 5.53 μM. The selective MOR antagonist CTOP abolished fentanyl-induced inhibitory responses in PCs. However, the application of CTOP alone increased the amplitude, AUC of P1, and the pause of SS. Notably, fentanyl significantly inhibited the tactile-evoked response of MLIs but did not affect their spontaneous firing. The fentanyl-induced decrease of inhibitory responses in PCs was partially prevented by a PKA inhibitor, H-89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These results suggest that fentanyl binds to MORs in MLIs to reduce GABAergic neurotransmission in MLI-PC projections and one potential mechanism is via modulation of the cAMP-PKA pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of senile dementia, characterized by neurofibrillary tangle and amyloid plaque in brain pathology. Major efforts in AD drug were devoted to the interference with the production and accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), which plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of AD. Aβ is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP), by consecutive cleavage by β-secretase and γ-secretase. Therefore, β-secretase and γ-secretase inhibition have been the focus for AD drug discovery efforts for amyloid reduction. Here, we review β-secretase inhibitors and γ-secretase inhibitors/modulators, and their efficacies in clinical trials. In addition, we discussed the novel concept of specifically targeting the γ-secretase substrate APP. Targeting amyloidogenic processing of APP is still a fundamentally sound strategy to develop disease-modifying AD therapies and recent advance in γ-secretase/APP complex structure provides new opportunities in designing selective inhibitors/modulators for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Collapsin Response Mediator Protein 2 and Endophilin2 Coordinate Regulation of AMPA Receptor GluA1 Subunit Recycling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The dynamic trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which enables the endocytosis, recycling, and exocytosis of AMPARs, is crucial for synaptic plasticity. Endophilin2, which directly interacts with the GluA1 subunit of AMPARs, plays an important role in AMPAR endocytosis. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) promotes the maturation of the dendritic spine and can transfer AMPARs to the membrane. Although the mechanisms of AMPAR endocytosis and exocytosis are well known, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying AMPAR recycling remain unclear. Here, we report a unique interaction between CRMP2 and endophilin2. Our results showed that overexpression of CRMP2 and endophilin2 increased the amplitude and frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic currents (mEPSCs) and modestly enhanced AMPAR levels in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, the CRMP2 and endophilin2 overexpression phenotype failed to occur when the interaction between these two proteins was inhibited. Further analysis revealed that this interaction was regulated by CRMP2 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of CRMP2 inhibited its interaction with endophilin2; this was mainly affected by the phosphorylation of Thr514 and Ser518 by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β. CRMP2 phosphorylation increased degradation and inhibited the surface expression of AMPAR GluA1 subunits in cultured hippocampal neurons. However, the dephosphorylation of CRMP2 inhibited degradation and promoted the surface expression of AMPAR GluA1 subunits in cultured hippocampal neurons. Taken together, our data demonstrated that the interaction between CRMP2 and endophilin2 was conductive to the recycling of AMPA receptor GluA1 subunits in hippocampal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Assessing the Effects of Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation Over the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex on Human Cognition: A Systematic Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00035</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00035</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Theta burst stimulation is increasingly growing in popularity as a non-invasive method of moderating corticospinal networks. Theta burst stimulation uses gamma frequency trains applied at the rhythm of theta, thus, mimicking theta–gamma coupling involved in cognitive processes. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been found to play a crucial role in numerous cognitive processes. Here, we include 25 studies for review to determine the cognitive effects of continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; 20 of these studies are healthy participant and five are patient (pharmacotherapy-resistant depression) studies. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the included studies, only a descriptive approach is used and meta-analytics ruled out. The cognitive effect is measured on various cognitive domains: attention, working memory, planning, language, decision making, executive function, and inhibitory and cognitive control. We conclude that continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex mainly inhibits cognitive performance. However, in some instances, it can lead to improved performance by inhibiting the effect of distractors or other competing irrelevant cognitive processes. To be precise, continuous theta burst stimulation over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired attention, inhibitory control, planning, and goal-directed behavior in decision making but also improved decision making by reducing impulsivity. Conversely, continuous theta burst stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired executive function, working, auditory feedback regulation, and cognitive control but accelerated the planning, decision-making process. These findings constitute a useful contribution to the literature on the cognitive effects of continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Apathy is one of the most common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, its pathophysiology remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired at a 3.0T MRI scanner using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) metric in 20 de novo, drug-naïve, non-demented PD patients with apathy (PD-A), 26 PD patients without apathy (PD-NA) without comorbidity of depressive or anxious symptoms, and 23 matched healthy control (HC) subjects.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We found that the ALFF decreased significantly in the bilateral nucleus accumbens, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with PD-A compared to patients with PD-NA and HC subjects. Furthermore, apathy severity was negatively correlated with the ALFF in the bilateral nucleus accumbens and dorsal ACC in the pooled patients with PD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The present study characterized the functional pattern of changes in spontaneous neural activity in patients with PD-A. With the aim to better elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for these changes, this study controlled for the potentially confounding effects of dopaminergic medication, depression, anxiety, and global cognitive impairment. The findings of the current study add to the literature by highlighting potential abnormalities in mesocorticolimbic pathways involved in the development of apathy in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: TRP Channels Role in Pain Associated With Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transient receptor potential (TRP) are cation channels expressed in both non-excitable and excitable cells from diverse tissues, including heart, lung, and brain. The TRP channel family includes 28 isoforms activated by physical and chemical stimuli, such as temperature, pH, osmotic pressure, and noxious stimuli. Recently, it has been shown that TRP channels are also directly or indirectly activated by reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress plays an essential role in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, and TRP channels are involved in the progression of those diseases by mechanisms involving changes in the crosstalk between Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; regulation, oxidative stress, and production of inflammatory mediators. TRP channels involved in nociception include members of the TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, and TRPC subfamilies that transduce physical and chemical noxious stimuli. It has also been reported that pain is a complex issue in patients with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, and adequate management of pain in those conditions is still in discussion. TRPV1 has a role in neuroinflammation, a critical mechanism involved in neurodegeneration. Therefore, some studies have considered TRPV1 as a target for both pain treatment and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, this review aimed to describe the TRP-dependent mechanism that can mediate pain sensation in neurodegenerative diseases and the therapeutic approach available to palliate pain and neurodegenerative symptoms throughout the regulation of these channels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: MR Imaging of SCA3/MJD</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00749</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado–Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is a progressive autosomal dominantly inherited cerebellar ataxia characterized by the aggregation of polyglutamine-expanded protein within neuronal nuclei in the brain, which can lead to brain damage that precedes the onset of clinical manifestations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques such as morphometric MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have gained increasing attention as non-invasive and quantitative methods for the assessment of structural and functional alterations in clinical SCA3/MJD patients as well as preclinical carriers. Morphometric MRI has demonstrated typical patterns of atrophy or volume loss in the cerebellum and brainstem with extensive lesions in some supratentorial areas. DTI has detected widespread microstructural alterations in brain white matter, which indicate disrupted brain anatomical connectivity. Task-related fMRI has presented unusual brain activation patterns within the cerebellum and some extracerebellar tissue, reflecting the decreased functional connectivity of these brain regions in SCA3/MJD subjects. MRS has revealed abnormal neurochemical profiles, such as the levels or ratios of N-acetyl aspartate, choline, and creatine, in both clinical cases and preclinical cases before the alterations in brain anatomical structure. Moreover, a number of studies have reported correlations of MR imaging alterations with clinical and genetic features. The utility of these MR imaging techniques can help to identify preclinical SCA3/MJD carriers, monitor disease progression, evaluate response to therapeutic interventions, and illustrate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the occurrence, development, and prognosis of SCA3/MJD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Self-Selection of Interesting Occupation Facilitates Cognitive Response to the Task: An Event-Related Potential Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00299</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00299</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: In this study, we examined whether the self-selection of occupations of interest affects reaction times (RTs) and cognitive processing by using the Aid for Decision-making in Occupation Choice (ADOC) and event-related potentials (ERP). We also assessed the relationship of these with psychological indicators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: We extracted 78 occupations from the ADOC in consideration of the subjects’ age, and three conditions were set: (1) self-selection of an interesting occupation; (2) self-selection of a disliked occupation; and (3) forced selection. The RT task was executed under their conditions during which ERP was measured. We compared the P300 component of ERP in these conditions. Moreover, we examined the association of cognitive processing and degree of satisfaction and performance concerning occupation, with psychological indicators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: P300 amplitude at Fz significantly increased in the self-selection of an interesting occupation. P300 amplitude at Pz was significantly positively correlated with the occupational satisfaction score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Self-selection of interesting occupations in the ADOC resulted in increased attention resource allocation by increasing motivation. Further, there was a positive correlation between satisfaction concerning the occupation and attention of resource allocation. Therefore, occupational therapists should know which occupations the patients consider interesting and help them to select by themselves, thus enhancing their satisfaction after consultation. These interventions may contribute to promoting motivation and cognitive processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Adolescent Substance Use and the Brain: Behavioral, Cognitive and Neuroimaging Correlates</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adolescence is an important ontogenetic period that is characterized by behaviors such as enhanced novelty-seeking, impulsivity, and reward preference, which can give rise to an increased risk for substance use. While substance use rates in adolescence are generally on a decline, the current rates combined with emerging trends, such as increases in e-cigarette use, remain a significant public health concern. In this review, we focus on the neurobiological divergences associated with adolescent substance use, derived from a cross-sectional, retrospective, and longitudinal studies, and highlight how the use of these substances during adolescence may relate to behavioral and neuroimaging-based outcomes. Identifying and understanding the associations between adolescent substance use and changes in cognition, mental health, and future substance use risk may assist our understanding of the consequences of drug exposure during this critical window.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Being in the Past and Perform the Future in a Virtual World: VR Applications to Assess and Enhance Episodic and Prospective Memory in Normal and Pathological Aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00297</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The process of aging commonly features a gradual deterioration in cognitive performance and, in particular, the decline of memory. Despite the increased longevity of the world’s population, the prevalence of neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia, continues to be a major burden on public health, and consequently, the latest research has been focused on memory and aging. Currently, the failure of episodic and Prospective memory (PM) is one of the main complaints in the elderly, considered among the early symptoms of dementia. It is therefore increasingly important to define more clearly the boundaries between normal and pathological aging. Recently, researchers have begun to build and apply Virtual Environments (VE) to the explicit purpose of better understanding the performance of episodic and PM in complex and realistic contexts, with the perspective of further developing effective training procedures that depend on reliable cognitive assessment methods. Virtual technology offers higher levels of realism than “pen and paper” testing and at the same time more experimental control than naturalistic settings. In this mini-review article, we examine the outcomes of recently available studies on virtual reality technology applications developed for the assessment and improvement of episodic and/or PM. To consider the latest technology, we selected 29 articles that have been published in the last 10 years. These documents show that VR-based technologies can provide a valid basis for screening and treatment and, through increased sensory stimulation and enriched environments reproducing the scenarios of everyday life, could represent effective stimulating experiences even in pathological aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Admittance Method for Estimating Local Field Potentials Generated in a Multi-Scale Neuron Model of the Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00072</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Significant progress has been made toward model-based prediction of neral tissue activation in response to extracellular electrical stimulation, but challenges remain in the accurate and efficient estimation of distributed local field potentials (LFP). Analytical methods of estimating electric fields are a first-order approximation that may be suitable for model validation, but they are computationally expensive and cannot accurately capture boundary conditions in heterogeneous tissue. While there are many appropriate numerical methods of solving electric fields in neural tissue models, there isn't an established standard for mesh geometry nor a well-known rule for handling any mismatch in spatial resolution. Moreover, the challenge of misalignment between current sources and mesh nodes in a finite-element or resistor-network method volume conduction model needs to be further investigated. Therefore, using a previously published and validated multi-scale model of the hippocampus, the authors have formulated an algorithm for LFP estimation, and by extension, bidirectional communication between discretized and numerically solved volume conduction models and biologically detailed neural circuit models constructed in NEURON. Development of this algorithm required that we assess meshes of (i) unstructured tetrahedral and grid-based hexahedral geometries as well as (ii) differing approaches for managing the spatial misalignment of current sources and mesh nodes. The resulting algorithm is validated through the comparison of Admittance Method predicted evoked potentials with analytically estimated LFPs. Establishing this method is a critical step toward closed-loop integration of volume conductor and NEURON models that could lead to substantial improvement of the predictive power of multi-scale stimulation models of cortical tissue. These models may be used to deepen our understanding of hippocampal pathologies and the identification of efficacious electroceutical treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Overall Survival Prediction in Glioblastoma With Radiomic Features Using Machine Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00061</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma is a WHO grade IV brain tumor, which leads to poor overall survival (OS) of patients. For precise surgical and treatment planning, OS prediction of glioblastoma (GBM) patients is highly desired by clinicians and oncologists. Radiomic research attempts at predicting disease prognosis, thus providing beneficial information for personalized treatment from a variety of imaging features extracted from multiple MR images. In this study, first-order, intensity-based volume and shape-based and textural radiomic features are extracted from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T1ce MRI data. The region of interest is further decomposed with stationary wavelet transform with low-pass and high-pass filtering. Further, radiomic features are extracted on these decomposed images, which helped in acquiring the directional information. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge training, validation, and test datasets. The proposed approach achieved 0.695, 0.571, and 0.558 on BraTS training, validation, and test datasets. The proposed approach secured the third position in BraTS 2018 challenge for the OS prediction task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Maternal Immune Activation Affects Hippocampal Excitatory and Inhibitory Synaptic Transmission in Offspring From an Early Developmental Period to Adulthood</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the risk factors for schizophrenia is maternal infection. We have previously shown that Polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C) induced maternal immune activation in mice caused histological changes in the hippocampal CA1 area of offspring during the developmental period and impaired sensorimotor gating in offspring during adulthood, resulting in behavioral changes. However, it remains unclear how maternal immune activation functionally impacts the hippocampal neuronal activity of offspring. We studied the effect of prenatal poly I:C treatment on synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in postnatal and adult offspring. Treatment with poly I:C diminished excitatory and enhanced inhibitory (GABAergic) synaptic transmission on pyramidal cells in adult offspring. During the early developmental period, we still observed that treatment with poly I:C decreased excitatory synaptic transmission and potentially increased GABAergic synaptic transmission, which was uncovered under a condition of high extracellular potassium-activated neurons. In conclusion, we demonstrate that maternal immune activation decreased excitatory and increased inhibitory synaptic transmission on hippocampal pyramidal cells from an early developmental period to adulthood, which could result in net inhibition in conjunction with poor functional organization and integration of hippocampal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: What Have Advances in Transcriptomic Technologies Taught us About Human White Matter Pathologies?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time, post-mortem analysis of human brain pathologies has been purely descriptive, limiting insight into the pathological mechanisms. However, starting in the early 2000s, next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the routine application of bulk RNA-sequencing and microarray technologies have revolutionized the usefulness of post-mortem human brain tissue. This has allowed many studies to provide novel mechanistic insights into certain brain pathologies, albeit at a still unsatisfying resolution, with masking of lowly expressed genes and regulatory elements in different cell types. The recent rapid evolution of single-cell technologies has now allowed researchers to shed light on human pathologies at a previously unreached resolution revealing further insights into pathological mechanisms that will open the way for the development of new strategies for therapies. In this review article, we will give an overview of the incremental information that single-cell technologies have given us for human white matter (WM) pathologies, summarize which single-cell technologies are available, and speculate where these novel approaches may lead us for pathological assessment in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: FGF5 Regulates Schwann Cell Migration and Adhesion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family polypeptides play key roles in promoting tissue regeneration and repair. FGF5 is strongly up-regulated in Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system following injury; however, a role for FGF5 in peripheral nerve regeneration has not been shown up to now. In this report, we examined the expression of FGF5 and its receptors FGFR1-4 in Schwann cells of the mouse sciatic nerve following injury, and then measured the effects of FGF5 treatment upon cultured primary rat Schwann cells. By microarray and mRNA sequencing data analysis, RT-PCR, qPCR, western blotting and immunostaining, we show that FGF5 is highly up-regulated in Schwann cells of the mouse distal sciatic nerve following injury, and FGFR1 and FGFR2 are highly expressed in Schwann cells of the peripheral nerve both before and following injury. Using cultured primary rat Schwann cells, we show that FGF5 inhibits ERK1/2 MAP kinase activity but promotes rapid Schwann cell migration and adhesion via the upregulation of N-cadherin. Thus, FGF5 is an autocrine regulator of Schwann cells to regulate Schwann cell migration and adhesion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Streptozotocin Induces Alzheimer’s Disease-Like Pathology in Hippocampal Neuronal Cells via CDK5/Drp1-Mediated Mitochondrial Fragmentation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aberrant brain insulin signaling plays a critical role in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in the progression of AD, with excessive mitochondrial fission in the hippocampus being one of the pathological mechanisms of AD. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of AD and mitochondrial fragmentation induced by aberrant brain insulin signaling in the hippocampal neurons are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanistic signaling associated with mitochondrial dynamics using streptozotocin (STZ), a diabetogenic compound, in the hippocampus cell line, HT-22 cells. In this metabolic dysfunctional cellular model, hallmarks of AD such as neuronal apoptosis, synaptic loss, and tau hyper-phosphorylation are induced by STZ. We found that in the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, phosphorylation is increased in STZ-treated HT-22 cells. We also determined that inhibition of mitochondrial fragmentation suppresses STZ-induced AD-like pathology. Furthermore, we found that phosphorylation of Drp1 was induced by CDK5, and inhibition of CDK5 suppresses STZ-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and AD-like pathology. Therefore, these findings indicate that mitochondrial morphology and functional regulation may be a strategy of potential therapeutic for treating abnormal metabolic functions associated with the pathogenesis of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: That’s a Wrap! Molecular Drivers Governing Neuronal Nogo Receptor-Dependent Myelin Plasticity and Integrity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00227</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00227</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Myelin is a dynamic membrane that is important for coordinating the fast propagation of action potentials along small or large caliber axons (0.1–10 μm) some of which extend the entire length of the spinal cord. Due to the heterogeneity of electrical and energy demands of the variable neuronal populations, the axo-myelinic and axo-glial interactions that regulate the biophysical properties of myelinated axons also vary in terms of molecular interactions at the membrane interfaces. An important topic of debate in neuroscience is how myelin is maintained and modified under neuronal control and how disruption of this control (due to disease or injury) can initiate and/or propagate neurodegeneration. One of the key molecular signaling cascades that have been investigated in the context of neural injury over the past two decades involves the myelin-associated inhibitory factors (MAIFs) that interact with Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1). Chief among the MAIF superfamily of molecules is a reticulon family protein, Nogo-A, that is established as a potent inhibitor of neurite sprouting and axon regeneration. However, an understated role for NgR1 is its ability to control axo-myelin interactions and Nogo-A specific ligand binding. These interactions may occur at axo-dendritic and axo-glial synapses regulating their functional and dynamic membrane domains. The current review provides a comprehensive analysis of how neuronal NgR1 can regulate myelin thickness and plasticity under normal and disease conditions. Specifically, we discuss how NgR1 plays an important role in regulating paranodal and juxtaparanodal domains through specific signal transduction cascades that are important for microdomain molecular architecture and action potential propagation. Potential therapeutics designed to target NgR1-dependent signaling during disease are being developed in animal models since interference with the involvement of the receptor may facilitate neurological recovery. Hence, the regulatory role played by NgR1 in the axo-myelinic interface is an important research field of clinical significance that requires comprehensive investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Substantia Nigra Hyperechogenicity Reflects the Progression of Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration in 6-OHDA Rat Model of Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, and there is still no effective way to stop its progress. Therefore, early detection is crucial for the prevention and the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. The current diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, however, mainly depends on the symptoms, so it is necessary to establish a reliable imaging modality for PD diagnosis and its progression monitoring. Other studies and our previous ones demonstrated that substantia nigra hyperechogenicity (SNH) was detected by transcranial sonography (TCS) in the ventral midbrain of PD patients, and SNH is regarded as a characteristic marker of PD. The present study aimed to explore whether SNH could serve as a reliable imaging modality to monitor the progression of dopaminergic neurodegeneration of PD. The results revealed that the size of SNH was positively related with the degree of dopaminergic neuron death in PD animal models. Furthermore, we revealed that microglia activation contributed to the SNH formation in substantia nigra (SN) in PD models. Taken together, this study suggests that SNH through TCS is a promising imaging modality to monitor the progression of dopaminergic neurodegeneration of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Estradiol Replacement at the Critical Period Protects Hippocampal Neural Stem Cells to Improve Cognition in APP/PS1 Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00240</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00240</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that there is a critical window for estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) in postmenopausal women with Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, supporting evidence is lacking. To address this issue, we investigated the effective period for estradiol (E2) treatment using a mouse model of AD. Four-month-old female APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice were ovariectomized (OVX) and treated with E2 for 2 months starting at the age of 4 months (early period), 6 months (mid-period), or 8 months (late period). We then evaluated hippocampal neurogenesis, β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation, telomerase activity, and hippocampal-dependent behavior. Compared to age-matched wild type mice, APP/PS1 mice with intact ovaries showed increased proliferation of hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) at 8 months of age and decreased proliferation of NSCs at 10 months of age; meanwhile, Aβ accumulation progressively increased with age, paralleling the reduced survival of immature neurons. OVX-induced depletion of E2 in APP/PS1 mice resulted in elevated Aβ levels accompanied by elevated p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;) expression and increased NSC proliferation at 6 months of age, which subsequently declined; accelerated reduction of immature neurons starting from 6 months of age, and reduced telomerase activity and worsened memory performance at 10 months of age. Treatment with E2 in the early period post-OVX, rather than in the mid or late period, abrogated these effects, and p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; inhibition reduced the overproliferation of NSCs in 6-month-old OVX-APP/PS1 mice. Thus, E2 deficiency in young APP/PS1 mice exacerbates cognitive deficits and depletes the hippocampal NSC pool in later life; this can be alleviated by E2 treatment in the early period following OVX, which prevents Aβ/p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;-induced NSC overproliferation and preserves telomerase activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by senile plaques (SPs), which are caused by amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) binds to advanced glycation end products deposited during vascular dysfunction. Alzheimer’s disease may occur when RAGE binds to Aβ and releases reactive oxygen species, further exacerbating Aβ deposition and eventually leading to SPs and NFTs. As it is involved in early AD, RAGE may be considered as a more potent biomarker than Aβ. Positron emission tomography provides valuable information regarding the underlying pathological processes of AD many years before the appearance of clinical symptoms. Thus, to further reveal the role of RAGE in AD pathology and for early diagnosis of AD, a tracer that targets RAGE is needed. In this review, we first describe the early diagnosis of AD and then summarize the interaction between RAGE and Aβ and Tau that is required to induce AD pathology, and finally focus on RAGE-targeting probes, highlighting the potential of RAGE to be used as an effective target. The development of RAGE probes is expected to aid in AD diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Flexible neural connectivity under constraints on total connection strength</title>

Neural computation is determined by neurons’ dynamics and circuit connectivity. Uncertain and dynamic environments may require neural hardware to adapt to different computational tasks, each requiring different connectivity configurations. At the same time, connectivity is subject to a variety of constraints, placing limits on the possible computations a given neural circuit can perform. Here we examine the hypothesis that the organization of neural circuitry favors computational flexibility: that it makes many computational solutions available, given physiological constraints. From this hypothesis, we develop models of connectivity degree distributions based on constraints on a neuron’s total synaptic weight. To test these models, we examine reconstructions of the mushroom bodies from the first instar larva and adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. We perform a Bayesian model comparison for two constraint models and a random wiring null model. Overall, we find that flexibility under a homeostatically fixed total synaptic weight describes Kenyon cell connectivity better than other models, suggesting a principle shaping the apparently random structure of Kenyon cell wiring. Furthermore, we find evidence that larval Kenyon cells are more flexible earlier in development, suggesting a mechanism whereby neural circuits begin as flexible systems that develop into specialized computational circuits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OhEIj0eIIGQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We consider how a signalling system can act as an information hub by multiplexing information arising from multiple signals. We formally define multiplexing, mathematically characterise which systems can multiplex and how well they can do it. While the results of this paper are theoretical, to motivate the idea of multiplexing, we provide experimental evidence that tentatively suggests that the NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B transcription factor can multiplex information about changes in multiple signals. We believe that our theoretical results may resolve the apparent paradox of how a system like NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B that regulates cell fate and inflammatory signalling in response to diverse stimuli can appear to have the low information carrying capacity suggested by recent studies on scalar signals. In carrying out our study, we introduce new methods for the analysis of large, nonlinear stochastic dynamic models, and develop computational algorithms that facilitate the calculation of fundamental constructs of information theory such as Kullback–Leibler divergences and sensitivity matrices, and link these methods to a new theory about multiplexing information. We show that many current models such as those of the NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B system cannot multiplex effectively and provide models that overcome this limitation using post-transcriptional modifications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9MxzVqLUduA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Combining hypoxia-activated prodrugs and radiotherapy &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;: Impact of treatment scheduling and the intra-tumoural oxygen landscape</title>

Hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) present a conceptually elegant approach to not only overcome, but better yet, exploit intra-tumoural hypoxia. Despite being successful &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, HAPs are yet to achieve successful results in clinical settings. It has been hypothesised that this lack of clinical success can, in part, be explained by the insufficiently stringent clinical screening selection of determining which tumours are suitable for HAP treatments. Taking a mathematical modelling approach, we investigate how tumour properties and HAP-radiation scheduling influence treatment outcomes in simulated tumours. The following key results are demonstrated &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;i&gt;(i)&lt;/i&gt; HAP and ionising radiation (IR) monotherapies may attack tumours in dissimilar, and complementary, ways. &lt;i&gt;(ii)&lt;/i&gt; HAP-IR scheduling may impact treatment efficacy. &lt;i&gt;(iii)&lt;/i&gt; HAPs may function as IR treatment intensifiers. &lt;i&gt;(iv)&lt;/i&gt; The spatio-temporal intra-tumoural oxygen landscape may impact HAP efficacy. Our &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; framework is based on an on-lattice, hybrid, multiscale cellular automaton spanning three spatial dimensions. The mathematical model for tumour spheroid growth is parameterised by multicellular tumour spheroid (MCTS) data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oXpNL_S1XMU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Optimising efficacy of antibiotics against systemic infection by varying dosage quantities and times</title>

Mass production and use of antibiotics has led to the rise of resistant bacteria, a problem possibly exacerbated by inappropriate and non-optimal application. Antibiotic treatment often follows &lt;i&gt;fixed-dose&lt;/i&gt; regimens, with a standard dose of antibiotic administered equally spaced in time. But are such fixed-dose regimens optimal or can alternative regimens be designed to increase efficacy? Yet, few mathematical models have aimed to identify optimal treatments based on biological data of infections inside a living host. In addition, assumptions to make the mathematical models analytically tractable limit the search space of possible treatment regimens (e.g. to fixed-dose treatments). Here, we aimed to address these limitations by using experiments in a &lt;i&gt;Galleria mellonella&lt;/i&gt; (insect) model of bacterial infection, to create a fully parametrised mathematical model of a systemic &lt;i&gt;Vibrio&lt;/i&gt; infection. We successfully validated this model with biological experiments, including treatments unseen by the mathematical model. Then, by applying artificial intelligence, this model was used to determine optimal antibiotic dosage regimens to treat the host to maximise survival while minimising total antibiotic used. As expected, host survival increased as total quantity of antibiotic applied during the course of treatment increased. However, many of the optimal regimens tended to follow a large initial ‘loading’ dose followed by doses of incremental reductions in antibiotic quantity (dose ‘tapering’). Moreover, application of the entire antibiotic in a single dose at the start of treatment was never optimal, except when the total quantity of antibiotic was very low. Importantly, the range of optimal regimens identified was broad enough to allow the antibiotic prescriber to choose a regimen based on additional criteria or preferences. Our findings demonstrate the utility of an insect host to model antibiotic therapies &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and the approach lays a foundation for future regimen optimisation for patient and societal benefits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n6KNpSUkA4E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Task-evoked activity quenches neural correlations and variability across cortical areas</title>

Many large-scale functional connectivity studies have emphasized the importance of communication through increased inter-region correlations during task states. In contrast, local circuit studies have demonstrated that task states primarily reduce correlations among pairs of neurons, likely enhancing their information coding by suppressing shared spontaneous activity. Here we sought to adjudicate between these conflicting perspectives, assessing whether co-active brain regions during task states tend to increase or decrease their correlations. We found that variability and correlations primarily decrease across a variety of cortical regions in two highly distinct data sets: non-human primate spiking data and human functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Moreover, this observed variability and correlation reduction was accompanied by an overall increase in dimensionality (reflecting less information redundancy) during task states, suggesting that decreased correlations increased information coding capacity. We further found in both spiking and neural mass computational models that task-evoked activity increased the stability around a stable attractor, globally quenching neural variability and correlations. Together, our results provide an integrative mechanistic account that encompasses measures of large-scale neural activity, variability, and correlations during resting and task states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5-P3CCpUKEk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Heritable gene expression variability and stochasticity govern clonal heterogeneity in circadian period</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by K. L. Nikhil, Sandra Korge, Achim Kramer&lt;/p&gt;

A ubiquitous feature of the circadian clock across life forms is its organization as a network of cellular oscillators, with individual cellular oscillators within the network often exhibiting considerable heterogeneity in their intrinsic periods. The interaction of coupling and heterogeneity in circadian clock networks is hypothesized to influence clock’s entrainability, but our knowledge of mechanisms governing period heterogeneity within circadian clock networks remains largely elusive. In this study, we aimed to explore the principles that underlie intercellular period variation in circadian clock networks (clonal period heterogeneity). To this end, we employed a laboratory selection approach and derived a panel of 25 clonal cell populations exhibiting circadian periods ranging from 22 to 28 h. We report that a single parent clone can produce progeny clones with a wide distribution of circadian periods, and this heterogeneity, in addition to being stochastically driven, has a heritable component. By quantifying the expression of 20 circadian clock and clock-associated genes across our clone panel, we found that inheritance of expression patterns in at least three clock genes might govern clonal period heterogeneity in circadian clock networks. Furthermore, we provide evidence suggesting that heritable epigenetic variation in gene expression regulation might underlie period heterogeneity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/nO7_HYsM5lM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Cell–substrate adhesion drives Scar/WAVE activation and phosphorylation by a Ste20-family kinase, which controls pseudopod lifetime</title>

The Scar/WAVE complex is the principal catalyst of pseudopod and lamellipod formation. Here we show that Scar/WAVE’s proline-rich domain is polyphosphorylated after the complex is activated. Blocking Scar/WAVE activation stops phosphorylation in both &lt;i&gt;Dictyostelium&lt;/i&gt; and mammalian cells, implying that phosphorylation modulates pseudopods after they have been formed, rather than controlling whether they are initiated. Unexpectedly, phosphorylation is not promoted by chemotactic signaling but is greatly stimulated by cell:substrate adhesion and diminished when cells deadhere. Phosphorylation-deficient or phosphomimetic Scar/WAVE mutants are both normally functional and rescue the phenotype of knockout cells, demonstrating that phosphorylation is dispensable for activation and actin regulation. However, pseudopods and patches of phosphorylation-deficient Scar/WAVE last substantially longer in mutants, altering the dynamics and size of pseudopods and lamellipods and thus changing migration speed. Scar/WAVE phosphorylation does not require ERK2 in &lt;i&gt;Dictyostelium&lt;/i&gt; or mammalian cells. However, the MAPKKK homologue SepA contributes substantially—&lt;i&gt;sep&lt;/i&gt;A mutants have less steady-state phosphorylation, which does not increase in response to adhesion. The mutants also behave similarly to cells expressing phosphorylation-deficient Scar, with longer-lived pseudopods and patches of Scar recruitment. We conclude that pseudopod engagement with substratum is more important than extracellular signals at regulating Scar/WAVE’s activity and that phosphorylation acts as a pseudopod timer by promoting Scar/WAVE turnover.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Z8MkWjL8crs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by I-Ting Lin, Meng-Chao Yao&lt;/p&gt;

Recognition of self and nonself is important for outcrossing organisms, and different mating types establish the barrier against self-mating. In the unicellular ciliate &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thermophila&lt;/i&gt;, mating type determination requires complex DNA rearrangements at a single &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt; locus during conjugation to produce a type-specific gene pair (&lt;i&gt;MTA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MTB&lt;/i&gt;) for 1 of 7 possible mating types. Surprisingly, we found that decreased expression of the DNA breakage-repair protein Ku80 at late stages of conjugation generated persistent selfing phenotype in the progeny. DNA analysis revealed multiple mating-type gene pairs as well as a variety of mis-paired, unusually arranged mating-type genes in these selfers that resemble some proposed rearrangement intermediates. They are found also in normal cells during conjugation and are lost after 10 fissions but are retained in Ku mutants. Silencing of &lt;i&gt;TKU80&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;TKU70-2&lt;/i&gt; immediately after conjugation also generated selfing phenotype, revealing a hidden DNA rearrangement process beyond conjugation. Mating reactions between the mutant and normal cells suggest a 2-component system for self–nonself-recognition through &lt;i&gt;MTA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MTB&lt;/i&gt; genes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/O3TPN2fSdms&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Down-regulation of a cytokine secreted from peripheral fat bodies improves visual attention while reducing sleep in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;</title>

Sleep is vital for survival. Yet under environmentally challenging conditions, such as starvation, animals suppress their need for sleep. Interestingly, starvation-induced sleep loss does not evoke a subsequent sleep rebound. Little is known about how starvation-induced sleep deprivation differs from other types of sleep loss, or why some sleep functions become dispensable during starvation. Here, we demonstrate that down-regulation of the secreted cytokine unpaired 2 (&lt;i&gt;upd2&lt;/i&gt;) in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; flies may mimic a starved-like state. We used a genetic knockdown strategy to investigate the consequences of &lt;i&gt;upd2&lt;/i&gt; on visual attention and sleep in otherwise well-fed flies, thereby sidestepping the negative side effects of undernourishment. We find that knockdown of &lt;i&gt;upd2&lt;/i&gt; in the fat body (FB) is sufficient to suppress sleep and promote feeding-related behaviors while also improving selective visual attention. Furthermore, we show that this peripheral signal is integrated in the fly brain via insulin-expressing cells. Together, these findings identify a role for peripheral tissue-to-brain interactions in the simultaneous regulation of sleep quality and attention, to potentially promote adaptive behaviors necessary for survival in hungry animals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vW68mrDTUfg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;PPP2R5D‐ &lt;/i&gt;related neurodevelopmental disorder is characterized by a range of neurodevelopmental and behavioral manifestations. We report the association of early‐onset parkinsonism with the &lt;i&gt;PPP2R5D &lt;/i&gt; p.E200K mutation. Clinical characterization and exome sequencing were performed on three patients, with postmortem neuropathologic examination for one patient. All patients had mild developmental delay and developed levodopa‐responsive parkinsonism between ages 25 to 40. The &lt;i&gt;PPP2R5D &lt;/i&gt; c.598G&amp;gt;A (p.E200K) mutation was identified in all patients&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt; Neuropathologic examination demonstrated uneven, focally severe neuronal loss and gliosis in the substantia nigra pars compacta, without Lewy bodies. Our findings suggest the &lt;i&gt;PPP2R5D &lt;/i&gt; p.E200K mutation to be a possible new cause of early‐onset parkinsonism.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mapping the Insula with Stereo‐Electroencephalography: The Emergence of Semiology in Insula Lobe Seizures</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25817?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25817?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insula epilepsy is rare and can be evaluated effectively by Stereotactic intracerebral EEG (SEEG). Many previous studies of insulo‐opercular seizures have been unable to separate insular and opercular onset. With adequate sampling of the insula, this study shows this is possible.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed intrainsular dynamics and extrainsular propagation in 12 patients with “pure” insula epilepsy (n = 9) or insular and only deepest opercular involvement (n = 3) at seizure onset. Review of semiology defined clinical groups, agglomerative cluster, and principal component analysis of semiological features were performed. Quantitative epileptogenicity, and intrainsular and extrainsular propagation were computed via time frequency analysis and epileptogenicity mapping.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seizure onset patterns were heterogeneous; the seizure onset zone was focal. Seizure onset and first ictal change within insula functional subdivision correlated with aura and reflex component. No paninsular spread occurred; contralateral insular spread was very early. While the discharge was intrainsular, clinical signs related to aura or vegetative signs. Extrainsular propagation was early and related to the emergence of the majority of clinical signs. Cluster analysis found an anterior, intermediate, and posterior insula seizure onset group. The largest principal component separated anterior insula manifestations, including early hypermotor signs, early recovery, and no aura from posterior insula features of early dystonia, early tonic motor features, and sensorimotor aura.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aura is vital to identifying seizure onset and relates to insula functional subdivision. Seizures are heterogenous; extrainsular propagation occurs early, accounting for most of the semiology. With adequate sampling, &quot;pure&quot; insula epilepsy can be identified and focal curative resection is possible. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Circulating metabolites differentiate acute ischemic stroke from stroke mimics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25859?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25859?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early discrimination of patients with ischemic stroke (IS) from stroke mimics (SM) poses a diagnostic challenge. The circulating metabolome might reflect pathophysiological events related to acute IS. Here, we investigated the utility of early metabolic changes for differentiating IS from SM.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed untargeted metabolomics on serum samples obtained from patients with IS (N=508) and SM (N=349; defined by absence of a DWI positive lesion on MRI) who presented to hospital within 24 hours after symptom onset (median time from symptom onset to blood sampling= 3.3h; IQR: 1.6‐6.7h) and from neurologically normal controls (NC, N=112). We compared diagnostic groups in a discovery‐validation approach by applying multivariable linear regression models, machine learning techniques, and propensity score matching. We further performed a targeted look‐up of published metabolite sets.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levels of forty‐one metabolites were significantly associated with IS compared to NC. The top metabolites showing the highest value in separating IS from SM were asymmetrical and symmetrical dimethylarginine, pregnenolone sulfate, and adenosine. Together, these four metabolites differentiated patients with IS from SM with an AUC of 0.90 in the replication sample, which was superior to multimodal cranial computed tomography (AUC=0.80) obtained for routine diagnostics. They were further superior to previously published metabolite sets detected in our samples. All four metabolites returned to control levels by day 90.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set of four metabolites with known biological effects relevant to stroke pathophysiology shows unprecedented utility to identify patients with IS upon hospital arrival thus encouraging further investigation including multicenter studies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Estrogen receptor alpha, G‐protein coupled estrogen receptor 1, and aromatase: Developmental, sex, and region‐specific differences across the rat caudate–putamen, nucleus accumbens core and shell&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/06534c94-5dd3-487c-918d-fc93d958252e/cne24978-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rat striatal regions express nuclear estrogen receptor α and GPER‐1 early in development, while aromatase expression increases with age. (a–f) Caudate–putamen micrographs depicting ERα positive cells or lack thereof females P3 (a), P20 (b), and adult (c); males P3 (d), P20 (e), and adult (f). Examples of ERα positive cells are marked by small white arrows.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex steroid hormones such as 17β‐estradiol (estradiol) regulate neuronal function by binding to estrogen receptors (ERs), including ERα and GPER1, and through differential production via the enzyme aromatase. ERs and aromatase are expressed across the nervous system, including in the striatal brain regions. These regions, comprising the nucleus accumbens core, shell, and caudate–putamen, are instrumental for a wide‐range of functions and disorders that show sex differences in phenotype and/or incidence. Sex‐specific estrogen action is an integral component for generating these sex differences. A distinctive feature of the striatal regions is that in adulthood neurons exclusively express membrane but not nuclear ERs. This long‐standing finding dominates models of estrogen action in striatal regions. However, the developmental etiology of ER and aromatase cellular expression in female and male striatum is unknown. This omission in knowledge is important to address, as developmental stage influences cellular estrogenic mechanisms. Thus, ERα, GPER1, and aromatase cellular immunoreactivity was assessed in perinatal, prepubertal, and adult female and male rats. We tested the hypothesis that ERα, GPER1, and aromatase exhibits sex, region, and age‐specific differences, including nuclear expression. ERα exhibits nuclear expression in all three striatal regions before adulthood and disappears in a region‐ and sex‐specific time‐course. Cellular GPER1 expression decreases during development in a region‐ but not sex‐specific time‐course, resulting in extranuclear expression by adulthood. Somatic aromatase expression presents at prepuberty and increases by adulthood in a region‐ but not sex‐specific time‐course. These data indicate that developmental period exerts critical sex‐specific influences on striatal cellular estrogenic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Projections from the dorsomedial division of the bed nucleus of the Stria terminalis to hypothalamic nuclei in the mouse</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Projections from the dorsomedial division of the bed nucleus of the Stria terminalis to hypothalamic nuclei in the mouse&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/12a8960b-3e25-4484-b88c-fb46b5766432/cne24988-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurons of the dorsomedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTdm) project onto hypothalamic nuclei including the paraventricular (PVH), dorsomedial (DMH), arcuate (ARH) nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). In particular, BNSTdm neurons innervate proopiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti‐related peptide (AgRP), melanin‐concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin (ORX) expressing neurons of the ARH and the LHA, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stressful environment is a potent modulator of feeding, we seek in the present work to decipher the neuroanatomical basis for an interplay between stress and feeding behaviors. For this, we combined anterograde and retrograde tracing with immunohistochemical approaches to investigate the patterns of projections between the dorsomedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), well connected to the amygdala, and hypothalamic structures such as the paraventricular (PVH) and dorsomedial (DMH), the arcuate (ARH) nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic areas (LHA) known to control feeding and motivated behaviors. We particularly focused our study on afferences to proopiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti‐related peptide (AgRP), melanin‐concentrating‐hormone (MCH) and orexin (ORX) neurons characteristics of the ARH and the LHA, respectively. We found light to intense innervation of all these hypothalamic nuclei. We particularly showed an innervation of POMC, AgRP, MCH and ORX neurons by the dorsomedial and dorsolateral divisions of the BNST. Therefore, these results lay the foundation for a better understanding of the neuroanatomical basis of the stress‐related feeding behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Light sheet microscopy of the gerbil cochlea</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24977?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24977?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Light sheet microscopy of the gerbil cochlea&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/240aac2d-6b7b-43af-9f6f-d6ccfb559a89/cne24977-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light sheet microcopy is used to map frequency along the basilar membrane within intact cochleae, retaining spatial orientation and relationships with internal and external structural landmarks. Three‐dimensional measures of how frequency domains relate to one another gives insight into how the geometric organization of the cochlea may influence its physiology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) provides a rapid and complete three‐dimensional image of the cochlea. The method retains anatomical relationships—on a micrometer scale—between internal structures such as hair cells, basilar membrane (BM), and modiolus with external surface structures such as the round and oval windows. Immunolabeled hair cells were used to visualize the spiraling BM in the intact cochlea without time intensive dissections or additional histological processing; yet material prepared for LSFM could be rehydrated, the BM dissected out and reimaged at higher resolution with the confocal microscope. In immersion‐fixed material, details of the cochlear vasculature were seen throughout the cochlea. Hair cell counts (both inner and outer) as well as frequency maps of the BM were comparable to those obtained by other methods, but with the added dimension of depth. The material provided measures of angular, linear, and vector distance between characteristic frequency regions along the BM. Thus, LSFM provides a unique ability to rapidly image the entire cochlea in a manner applicable to model and interpret physiological results. Furthermore, the three‐dimensional organization of the cochlea can be studied at the organ and cellular level with LSFM, and this same material can be taken to the confocal microscope for detailed analysis at the subcellular level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Adaptation Modulates Spike-Phase Coupling Tuning Curve in the Rat Primary Auditory Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adaptation is an important mechanism that causes a decrease in the neural response both in terms of local field potentials (LFP) and spiking activity. We previously showed this reduction effect in the tuning curve of the primary auditory cortex. Moreover, we revealed that a repeated stimulus reduces the neural response in terms of spike-phase coupling (SPC). In the current study, we examined the effect of adaptation on the SPC tuning curve. To this end, employing the phase-locking value (PLV) method, we estimated the spike-LFP coupling. The data was obtained by a simultaneous recording from four single-electrodes in the primary auditory cortex of 15 rats. We first investigated whether the neural system may use spike-LFP phase coupling in the primary auditory cortex to encode sensory information. Secondly, we investigated the effect of adaptation on this potential SPC tuning. Our data showed that the coupling between spikes’ times and the LFP phase in beta oscillations represents sensory information (different stimulus frequencies), with an inverted bell-shaped tuning curve. Furthermore, we showed that adaptation to a specific frequency modulates SPC tuning curve of the adapter and its neighboring frequencies. These findings could be useful for interpretation of feature representation in terms of SPC and the underlying neural mechanism of adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Foveal Therapy in Blue Cone Monochromacy: Predictions of Visual Potential From Artificial Intelligence</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Novel therapeutic approaches for treating inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) prompt a need to understand which patients with impaired vision have the anatomical potential to gain from participation in a clinical trial. We used supervised machine learning to predict foveal function from foveal structure in blue cone monochromacy (BCM), an X-linked congenital cone photoreceptor dysfunction secondary to mutations in the OPN1LW/OPN1MW gene cluster. BCM patients with either disease-associated large deletion or missense mutations were studied and results compared with those from subjects with other forms of IRD and various degrees of preserved central structure and function. A machine learning technique was used to associate foveal sensitivities and best-corrected visual acuities to foveal structure in IRD patients. Two random forest (RF) models trained on IRD data were applied to predict foveal function in BCM. A curve fitting method was also used and results compared with those of the RF models. The BCM and IRD patients had a comparable range of foveal structure. IRD patients had peak sensitivity at the fovea. Machine learning could successfully predict foveal sensitivity (FS) results from segmented or un-segmented optical coherence tomography (OCT) input. Application of machine learning predictions to BCM at the fovea showed differences between predicted and measured sensitivities, thereby defining treatment potential. The curve fitting method provided similar results. Given a measure of visual acuity (VA) and foveal outer nuclear layer thickness, the question of how many lines of acuity would represent the best efficacious result for each BCM patient could be answered. We propose that foveal vision improvement potential in BCM is predictable from retinal structure using machine learning and curve fitting approaches. This should allow estimates of maximal efficacy in patients being considered for clinical trials and also guide decisions about dosing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: HIF-1α Mediates TRAIL-Induced Neuronal Apoptosis via Regulating DcR1 Expression Following Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00192</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Neuronal apoptosis involved in secondary injury following traumatic brain injury (TBI) significantly contributes to the poor outcomes of patients with TBI. The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) can selectively induce apoptosis of tumor cells. Hypoxia factor (HIF) 1α is a controversial factor that mediates the neuronal apoptotic pathway. Herein, we hypothesize that HIF-1α may mediate the TRAIL-induced neuronal apoptosis after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We used Western blots and immunofluorescence to study the expression and cell localization of TRAIL and death receptor 5 (DR5) after TBI in rats. Soluble DR5 (sDR5) administration was used to block the TRAIL-induced neuronal death and neural deficits. HIF-1α inhibitor 2ME and agonist DMOG were used to study the role of HIF-1α in TRAIL-induced neuronal death. Meanwhile, HIF-1α siRNA was used to investigate the role of HIF-1α in TRAIL-induced neuronal death in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The expressions of microglia-located TRAIL and neuron-located DR5 were significantly upregulated after TBI. sDR5 significantly attenuated TRAIL-induced neuronal apoptosis and neurological deficits. 2ME decreased neuronal apoptosis, lesion area, and brain edema and improved neurological function via increased expression of TRAIL decoy receptor 1 (DcR1), which inhibited TRAIL-induced apoptosis after TBI. The administration of DMOG produced the opposite effect than did 2ME. Similarly, HIF-1α siRNA attenuated TRAIL-induced neuronal death via increased DcR1 expression in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our findings suggested that the TRAIL/DR5 signaling pathway plays an important role after neuronal apoptosis after TBI. HIF-1α mediates TRAIL-induced neuronal apoptosis by regulating DcR1 expression following TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Biological agents adapt behavior to support the survival needs of the individual and the species. In this review we outline the anatomical, physiological, and computational processes that support reinforcement learning (RL). We describe two circuits in the primate brain that are linked to specific aspects of learning and goal-directed behavior. The ventral circuit, that includes the amygdala, ventral medial prefrontal cortex, and ventral striatum, has substantial connectivity with the hypothalamus.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: The effects of low intensity focused ultrasonic stimulation on dorsal root ganglion neurons and Schwann cells in vitro</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The effects of low intensity focused ultrasonic stimulation on dorsal root ganglion neurons and Schwann cells in vitro&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/702ef598-2b06-46d0-906b-9c0368b63c2d/jnr24700-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrasonic neuromodulation of peripheral nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satisfactory treatment of peripheral nerve injury (PNI) faces difficulties owing to the intrinsic biological barriers in larger injuries and invasive surgical interventions. Injury gaps &amp;gt;3 cm have low chances of full motor and sensory recovery, and the unmet need for PNI repair techniques which increase the likelihood of functional recovery while limiting invasiveness motivate this work. Building upon prior work in ultrasound stimulation (US) of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, the effects of US on DRG neuron and Schwann cell (SC) cocultures were investigated to uncover the role of SCs in mediating the neuronal response to US &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt;. Acoustic intensity‐dependent alteration in selected neuromorphometrics of DRG neurons in coculture with SCs was observed in total outgrowth, primary neurites, and length compared to previously reported DRG monoculture in a calcium‐independent manner. SC viability and proliferation were not impacted by US. Conditioned medium studies suggest secreted factors from SCs subjected to US impact DRG neuron morphology. These findings advance the current understanding of mechanisms by which these cell types respond to US, which may lead to new noninvasive US therapies for treating PNI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alertness Training Improves Spatial Bias and Functional Ability in Spatial Neglect</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25862?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25862?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a multi‐site, randomized, double‐blinded controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a digital health intervention targeting the intrinsic regulation of goal‐directed alertness in patients with chronic hemispatial neglect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty‐nine participants with hemispatial neglect that demonstrated significant spatially biased attention following acquired brain injury were randomly assigned to the experimental attention remediation treatment or active control group. The participants engaged with the remotely administered interventions for twelve weeks. The primary outcome was spatial bias on the Posner cueing task (response time difference: left – right target trials). Secondary outcomes included functional abilities (measured via the Catherine Bergego scale and Barthel index), spatial cognition, executive function, quality of life and sleep. Assessments were conducted prior to and immediately following participation in the experimental intervention or control condition, and again after a three‐month no contact period.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with the active control group, the intervention group exhibited a significant improvement in the primary outcome—a reduction in spatially biased attention on the Posner cueing task (p=0.010, Cohen’s d=0.96)—as well as significant improvements in functional abilities as measured on the Catherine Bergego and Barthel indices (p=0.027, Cohen’s d=0.24).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate that our attention training program was effective in improving the debilitating attention deficits common to hemispatial neglect. This benefit generalized to improvements in real‐world functional abilities. This safe, highly scalable and self‐administered treatment for hemispatial neglect may serve as a useful addition to the existing standard of care.&lt;/p&gt;
