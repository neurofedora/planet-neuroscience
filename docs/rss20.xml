	<description>To develop a complete description of sensory encoding, it is necessary to account for trial-to-trial variability in cortical neurons. Using a generalized linear model with terms corresponding to the visual stimulus, mouse running speed, and experimentally measured neuronal correlations, we modeled short term dynamics of L2/3 murine visual cortical neurons to evaluate the relative importance of each factor to neuronal variability within single trials. We find single trial predictions improve most when conditioning on the experimentally measured local correlations in comparison to predictions based on the stimulus or running speed. Specifically, accurate predictions are driven by positively co-varying and synchronously active functional groups of neurons. Including functional groups in the model enhances decoding accuracy of sensory information compared to a model that assumes neuronal independence. Functional groups, in encoding and decoding frameworks, provide an operational definition of Hebbian assemblies in which local correlations largely explain neuronal responses on individual trials.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A platform for semi-automated voluntary training of common marmosets for behavioral neuroscience</title>

	<description>In most cases, behavioral neuroscience studies of the common marmoset employ adaptations of well-established methods used with macaque monkeys. However, in most cases these approaches do not readily generalize to marmosets indicating a need for alternatives. Here we present the development of one such alternate: a platform for semi-automated, voluntary in-home cage behavioral training that allows for the study of naturalistic behaviors. We describe the design and production of a modular behavioral training apparatus using CAD software and digital fabrication. We demonstrate that this apparatus permits voluntary behavioral training and data collection throughout the marmoset's waking hours with little experimenter intervention. Further we demonstrate the use of this apparatus to reconstruct the kinematics of the marmoset's upper limb movement during natural foraging behavior.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Pathway-specific protein domains are predictive for human diseases</title>

Protein domains are basic functional units of proteins. Many protein domains are pervasive among diverse biological processes, yet some are associated with specific pathways. Human complex diseases are generally viewed as pathway-level disorders. Therefore, we hypothesized that pathway-specific domains could be highly informative for human diseases. To test the hypothesis, we developed a network-based scoring scheme to quantify specificity of domain-pathway associations. We first generated domain profiles for human proteins, then constructed a co-pathway protein network based on the associations between domain profiles. Based on the score, we classified human protein domains into pathway-specific domains (PSDs) and non-specific domains (NSDs). We found that PSDs contained more pathogenic variants than NSDs. PSDs were also enriched for disease-associated mutations that disrupt protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and tend to have a moderate number of domain interactions. These results suggest that mutations in PSDs are likely to disrupt within-pathway PPIs, resulting in functional failure of pathways. Finally, we demonstrated the prediction capacity of PSDs for disease-associated genes with experimental validations in zebrafish. Taken together, the network-based quantitative method of modeling domain-pathway associations presented herein suggested underlying mechanisms of how protein domains associated with specific pathways influence mutational impacts on diseases via perturbations in within-pathway PPIs, and provided a novel genomic feature for interpreting genetic variants to facilitate the discovery of human disease genes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/W3UffL4_6BI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In crowding, perception of an object deteriorates in the presence of nearby elements. Although crowding is a ubiquitous phenomenon, since elements are rarely seen in isolation, to date there exists no consensus on how to model it. Previous experiments showed that the global configuration of the entire stimulus must be taken into account. These findings rule out simple pooling or substitution models and favor models sensitive to global spatial aspects. In order to investigate how to incorporate global aspects into models, we tested a large number of models with a database of forty stimuli tailored for the global aspects of crowding. Our results show that incorporating grouping like components strongly improves model performance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WoMUtJ14I_w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test whether systemic cytokine release is associated with CNS inflammatory responses and glial injury in immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)‐T cell therapy in children and young adults.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a prospective cohort study of clinical manifestations as well as imaging, pathology, CSF and blood biomarkers on 43 subjects age 1‐25 who received CD19‐directed CAR‐T cells for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurotoxicity occurred in 19 of 43 (44%) subjects. Nine subjects (21%) had CTCAE grade 3 or 4 neurologic symptoms, with no neurotoxicity‐related deaths. Reversible delirium, headache, decreased level of consciousness, tremor, and seizures were most commonly observed. Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD) scores ≥9 had 94% sensitivity and 33% specificity for grade ≥3 neurotoxicity, and 91% sensitivity and 72% specificity for grade ≥2 neurotoxicity. Neurotoxicity correlated with severity of cytokine release syndrome, abnormal prior brain MRI, and higher peak CAR‐T cell numbers in blood but not cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF levels of S100b and GFAP increased during neurotoxicity, indicating astrocyte injury. There were concomitant increases in CSF white blood cells, protein, interferon‐γ (IFNγ), IL‐6, IL‐10 and granzyme B (GzB), with concurrent elevation of serum IFNγ, IL‐10, Granzyme B, GM‐CSF, MIP‐1α and TNFα but not IL‐6. We did not find direct evidence of endothelial activation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data are most consistent with ICANS as a syndrome of systemic inflammation which affects the brain via compromise of the neurovascular unit and astrocyte injury.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>The essential roles of microglia in maintaining homeostasis in the healthy brain and contributing to neuropathology are well documented. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic modulation regulates microglial behavior in both physiological and pathological conditions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding epigenetic regulators that repress target gene expression mostly via binding to 3’-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of mRNA in a Dicer-dependent manner. Dysregulation of certain miRNAs can contribute to microglial hyper-activation, persistent neuroinflammation, and abnormal macrophage polarization in the brain. These abnormal conditions can support the pathogenesis of neurological disorders such as glioma, Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, ischemia, and spinal cord injury. However, the roles of miRNAs in microglia in health and neurological disease have not been systematically summarized. This review will firstly report the role of Dicer, a key endoribonulease that is responsible for most miRNA biogenesis in microglia. Secondly, we will focus on recent research about the function of miRNAs in activation, inflammation and polarization of microglia, respectively. In addition, potential crosstalk between microglia and glioma cells via miRNAs will be discussed in this part. Finally, the role of two essential miRNAs, miR-124, and miR-155, in microglia will be highlighted.</description>

	<description>Despite decades of research, current therapeutic interventions for Parkinson`s disease (PD) are insufficient as they fail to modify disease progression by ameliorating the underlying pathology. Cellular proteostasis (protein homeostasis) is an essential factor in maintaining a persistent environment for neuronal activity. Proteostasis is ensured by mechanisms including regulation of protein translation, chaperone-assisted protein folding and protein degradation pathways. It is generally accepted that deficits in proteostasis are linked to various neurodegenerative diseases including PD. While the proteasome fails to degrade large protein aggregates, particularly alpha-synuclein (α-SYN) in PD, drug-induced activation of autophagy can efficiently remove aggregates and prevent degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Therefore, maintenance of these mechanisms is essential to preserve all cellular functions relying on a correctly folded proteome. The correlations between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) that aims to restore proteostasis within the secretory pathway are well established. However, while mild insults increase the activity of chaperones, prolonged cell stress or insufficient adaptive response causes cell death. Modulating the activity of molecular chaperones, such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) which assists refolding and contributes to the removal of unfolded proteins, and their associated pathways may offer a new approach for disease-modifying treatment. Here, we summarize some of the key concepts and emerging ideas on the relation of protein aggregation and imbalanced proteostasis with an emphasis on PD as our area of main expertise. Furthermore, we discuss recent insights into the strategies for reducing the toxic effects of protein unfolding in PD by targeting the ER UPR pathway.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Cognitive Syndromes and C9orf72 Mutation Are Not Related to Cerebellar Degeneration in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>

	<description>Objective The notion that cerebellar pathology may contribute to cognitive impairment in ALS, especially in patients with C9orf72 repeated expansion, has been inconsistently reported. This study aimed exploring the relationship between cerebellar involvement, cognitive impairment and C9orf72repeated expansion of patients with ALS.
Methods Quantitative in-vivo assessment of cerebellar lobules has been investigated in 66 non-demented patients with ALS and 28 healthy controls. Pathologic C9orf72 repeated expansion was found in 13 patients. Mild cognitive and/or behavioral impairment was diagnosed in 22 C9orf72 negative ALS patients. Measures of cortical volume (CV) and cortical thickness (CT) of cerebellar lobules of all participants were used for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify clusters of lobular measures highly correlated with each other. PCA outcomes were used for between group comparisons and correlation analyses with neuropsychological and clinical features. 
Results Disease severity measured with ALS functional rating scale and index of disease progression rate significantly correlated with CV reduction of the second PCA cluster loading CV measures of anterior lobules. In all patients, cognitive impairment, measured with verbal fluency, was related to CV reduction of the third cluster comprising posterior lobules. No specific cortical thinning or volume reduction of cerebellar clustering patterns could be detected in ALS subgroups. 
Conclusion Our data show that specific patterns of subregional cerebellar involvement are associated with physical disability or cognitive impairment in ALS, in line with the topographic organization of the cerebellum. However, there was no specific correlation between cerebellar degeneration and cognitive syndromes or C9orf72 mutations.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Does Movement Matter? Prefrontal Cortex Activity During 2D vs. 3D Performance of the Tower of Hanoi Puzzle</title>

	<description>In the current study, we used functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to compare prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity in adults as they performed two conditions of the Tower of Hanoi (ToH) disk-transfer task that have equivalent executive function but different motor requirements. This study explored cognitive workload, here defined as the cognitive effort utilized while problem-solving by performance output. The first condition included a two-dimensional (2D) computerized ToH where participants completed trials using a computer mouse. In contrast, our second condition used a traditional, three-dimensional (3D) ToH that must be manually manipulated.  Our aim was to better understand the role of the prefrontal cortex in these two conditions to detect if prefrontal cortex activity increases as a function of motor planning. Twenty right-handed, neurotypical adults (10M/10F, x̅ = 24.6, SD ± 2.8 y.o.) participated in two blocks (one per condition) of three one-minute trials where they were asked to solve as many puzzles as possible.  These data were analyzed using a mixed effects ANOVA with participants nested within blocks for 2D vs 3D conditions, presentation order (leading block), individual participants, and regions and additional follow-up statistics. Results showed that changes in oxygenated hemoglobin, ΔHbO, were significantly higher for 3D compared to 2D condition (p=0.0211). Presentation order and condition interacted significantly (p=0.0015). Notably, a strong correlation between performance and ΔHbO existed between blocks 1 and 2 (r=-0.69, r2=0.473, p&amp;lt;0.01) when the 3D condition was initially performed, in contrast to the 2D condition where no significant correlation was seen. Findings also showed a significant decrease in ∆HbO between the first and second block (p=0.0015) while performance increased significantly for both 3D and 2D conditions (p&amp;lt;0.005). We plan to use this information in the future to narrow the potential points of impairment on the perception-cognition-action continuum in certain developmental disabilities.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Surface Acting or Deep Acting, Who Need More Effortful? A Study on Emotional Labor Using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>

	<description>Emotional labor is characterized by two main regulation strategies: surface acting and deep act-ing. However, which strategy consumes more energy? To explore this, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure changes in hemoglobin density while participants performed a task requiring them to make the opposite emotional facial expression of that pre-sented in a picture. We found that (1) neither surface nor deep acting led to a significant change in hemoglobin concentration in the prefrontal cortex; (2) making negative and positive facial ex-pressions activated the same left front and middle areas of the prefrontal cortex; and (3) making positive facial expressions activated the rear portion of the prefrontal cortex, but making negative facial expressions did not. Based on these findings and past work, we can infer that deep and surface acting may not significantly differ in terms of the activity in the prefrontal cortex energy consumed. Furthermore, engaging in positive and negative emotional labor appear to utilize some of the same neurological mechanisms, although they differ in others.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Meningeal Mast Cells Contribute to ATP-Induced Nociceptive Firing in Trigeminal Nerve Terminals: Direct and Indirect Purinergic Mechanisms Triggering Migraine Pain</title>

	<description>Peripheral mechanisms of primary headaches such as migraine remain unclear. Meningeal afferents surrounded by multiple mast cells have been suggested as a major source of migraine pain. Extracellular ATP, released during migraine attacks is a likely candidate for activating meningeal afferents via neuronal P2X receptors. Recently, we showed that ATP also increased degranulation of resident meningeal mast cells (Nurkhametova et al., 2019). However, the contribution of ATP-induced mast cell degranulation in aggravating the migraine pain remains unknown.
Here we explored the contribution of meningeal mast cells in the pro-nociceptive effects of extracellular ATP. The impact of mast cells on ATP mediated activation of peripheral branches of trigeminal nerves was measured electrophysiologically in the dura mater of adult wild type (WT) or mast cell deficient mice. We found that spontaneous spiking activity in meningeal afferents, at baseline level, was not different in two groups. However, in WT mice, meningeal application of ATP dramatically (24.6-fold) increased nociceptive firing peaking at frequencies around 10 Hz. In contrast, in mast cell deficient animals, ATP-induced excitation was significantly weaker (3.5-fold). Application of serotonin to meninges in WT induced strong spiking, analogous to ATP. Moreover, in WT mice, the 5-HT3 antagonist MDL-7222 inhibited the ATP induced nociceptive firing. 
Our data suggest that extracellular ATP activates nociceptive firing in meningeal trigeminal afferents via amplified degranulation of resident mast cells in addition to direct excitatory action on the nerve terminals. This highlights the importance of mast cell degranulation via extracellular ATP in aggravating the migraine pain.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Axonal Non-segregation of the Vesicular Glutamate Transporter VGLUT3 Within Serotonergic Projections in the Mouse Forebrain</title>

	<description>A subpopulation of raphe 5-HT neurons expresses the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 with the co-release of glutamate and serotonin proposed to play a pivotal role in encoding reward- and anxiety-related behaviors. Serotonin axons are identifiable by immunolabelling of either serotonin (5-HT) or the plasma membrane 5-HT transporter (SERT), with SERT labeling demonstrated to be only partially overlapping with 5-HT staining. Studies investigating the colocalization or segregation of VGLUT3 within SERT or 5-HT immunolabeled boutons have led to inconsistent results. Therefore, we combined immunohistochemistry, high resolution confocal imaging and 3D-reconstruction techniques to map and quantify the distribution of VGLUT3 immunoreactive boutons within 5-HT vs SERT- positive axons in various regions of the mouse forebrain, including the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens core and shell, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, dorsal striatum, lateral septum, basolateral and central amygdala and hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that about 90% of 5-HT boutons are colocalized with SERT in almost all the brain regions studied, which therefore reveals that VGLUT3 and SERT do not segregate. However, in the posterior part of the NAC shell, we confirmed the presence of a subtype of 5-HT immunoreactive axons that lack the SERT. Interestingly, about 90% of the 5-HT/VGLUT3 boutons were labelled for the SERT in this region, suggesting that VGLUT3 is preferentially located in SERT immunoreactive 5-HT boutons. This work demonstrate that VGLUT3 and SERT cannot be used as specific markers to classify the different subtypes of 5-HT axons.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: From Ganglion Cell to Photoreceptor Layer: Timeline of Deterioration in a Rat Ischemia/Reperfusion Model</title>

	<description>Neuronal damage and impaired vision in different retinal disorders are induced, among other factors, by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Since the mechanisms and the progression of ischemic injury are still not completely clarified, a timeline of this retinal degeneration is needed. In this study, we investigated protein and mRNA alterations at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours as well as 3 and 7 days after ischemia to determine the course of an ischemic insult through the whole retina. Moreover, functional analyses were performed at later stages. We detected a significant functional loss of cells in the inner nuclear layer and photoreceptors at 3 and 7 days. Additionally, the thickness of the whole retina was decreased at these points in time, indicating a severe degradation of all retinal layers. Immunohistological and qRT-PCR analyses of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), glial cells, AII amacrine, cone and rod bipolar as well as cone and rod photoreceptor cells confirmed this first assumption. Our results show that all investigated cell types were damaged by ischemia induction. Especially RGCs, cone bipolar cells, and photoreceptor cones are very sensitive to I/R, these cells were lost shortly after ischemia induction with a progressive course up to 7 days. In addition, Müller cell gliosis was observed over the entire period of time. These results provide evidence, that I/R induces damage of the whole retina already at early stages. This degeneration even increases over time. In conclusion, our study could demonstrate the intense impact of an ischemic injury. The ischemic defect spreads across the whole retina right up to the outer layers in the long-term and thus seems to impair the visual perception already during the stimulus processing. In addition, our findings indicate that the cone pathway seems to be particularly affected by this damage.</description>

	<description>The influence of astrocytic cell networks on neuronal network activity is an emerging issue in epilepsy. Among the various mechanisms by which astrocytes modulate neuronal function, synchronization of astrocytes via gap junction channels is widely considered to be a crucial mechanism in epileptic conditions, contributing to the synchronization of the neuronal cell networks, possibly inducing recurrent epileptiform activity. Here we explored whether modulation of astrocytic gap junctions could alter epileptic seizures in different types of epilepsy. Opening of gap junctions by trimethylamine intensifies seizure-like events in the low-[Mg2+] in vitro model of temporal lobe epilepsy, while alleviates seizures in the in vivo WAG/Rij rat model of absence epilepsy. In contrast, application of the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone prevents the appearance of seizure-like events in the low-[Mg2+] epilepsy model, but aggravates seizures in non-convulsive absence epilepsy, in vivo. Pharmacological dissection of neuronal vs. astrocytic connexins shows that astrocytic Cx43 contribute to seizure formation to a significantly higher extent than neuronal Cx36. We conclude that astrocytic gap junctions are key players in the formation of epileptiform activity and we provide a scheme for the different mode of action in the convulsive and non-convulsive epilepsy types.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Two-Chambered Chitosan Nerve Guides With Increased Bendability Support Recovery of Skilled Forelimb Reaching Similar to Autologous Nerve Grafts in the Rat 10 mm Median Nerve Injury and Repair Model</title>

	<description>Tension-free surgical reconstruction of transected digital nerves in humans is regularly performed using autologous nerve grafts (ANGs) or bioartificial nerve grafts. Nerve grafts with increased bendability are needed to protect regenerating nerves in highly mobile extremity parts. We have recently demonstrated increased bendability and regeneration supporting properties of chitosan nerve guides with a corrugated outer wall (corrCNGs) in the common rat sciatic nerve model (model of low-mobility). Here, we further modified the hollow corrCNGs into two-chambered nerve guides by inserting a perforated longitudinal chitosan-film (corrCNG[F]s) and comprehensively monitored functional recovery in the advanced rat median nerve model. In 16 adult female Lewis rats, we bilaterally reconstructed 10 mm median nerve gaps with either ANGs, standard chitosan nerve guides (CNGs), chitosan-film enhanced CNGs (CNG[F]s), or corrCNG[F]s (n = 8, per group). Over 16 weeks, functional recovery of each forelimb was separately surveyed using the grasping test (reflex-based motor task), the staircase test (skilled forelimb reaching task), and non-invasive electrophysiological recordings from the thenar muscles. Finally, regenerated tissue harvested from the distal part of the nerve grafts was paraffin-embedded and cross-sections were analyzed regarding the number of Neurofilament 200-immunopositive axons and the area of newly formed blood vessels. Nerve tissue harvested distal to the grafts was epon-embedded and semi-thin cross-sections underwent morphometrical analyses (e.g. number of myelinated axons, axon and fiber diameters, and myelin thicknesses).Functional recovery was fastest and most complete in the ANG group (100% recovery rate regarding all parameters), but corrCNG[F]s accelerated the recovery of all functions evaluated in comparison to the other nerve guides investigated. Furthermore, corrCNG[F]s supported recovery of reflex-based grasping (87.5 %) and skilled forelimb reaching (100%) to eventually significantly higher rates than the other nerve guides (grasping test: CNGs: 75%, CNG[F]s: 62.5%; staircase test: CNGs: 66.7%, CNG[F]s: 83.3%). Histological and nerve morphometrical evaluations, in accordance to the functional results, demonstrated best outcome the in ANG group and highest myelin thicknesses in the corrCNG[F] group as compared to the CNG and CNG[F] groups. We thus clearly demonstrate that corrCNG[F]s represent promising innovative nerve grafts for nerve repair in mobile body parts such as digits.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: The Effects of Amphetamine and Methamphetamine on the Release of Norepinephrine, Dopamine and Acetylcholine From the Brainstem Reticular Formation</title>

	<description>Amphetamine (AMPH) and methamphetamine (METH) are widely abused psychostimulants, which produce a variety of psychomotor, autonomic and neurotoxic effects. The behavioral and neurotoxic effects of both compounds (from now on defined as AMPHs) stem from a fair molecular and anatomical specificity for catecholamine-containing neurons, which are placed in the brainstem reticular formation. In fact, the structural cross-affinity joined with the presence of shared molecular targets between AMPHs and catecholamine provides the basis for a quite selective recruitment of brainstem catecholamine neurons following AMPHs administration. A great amount of investigations, commentary manuscripts and books reported a pivotal role of mesencephalic dopamine (DA)-containing neurons in producing behavioral and neurotoxic effects of AMPHs. Instead, the present review focuses on catecholamine reticular neurons of the low brainstem. In fact, these nuclei add on DA mesencephalic cells to mediate the effects of AMPHs. Among these, we also include two pontine cholinergic nuclei. Finally, we discuss the conundrum of a mixed neuronal population, which extends from the pons to the periaqueductal gray. In this way, a number of reticular nuclei beyond classic DA mesencephalic cells are considered to extend the scenario underlying the neurobiology of AMPHs abuse. The mechanistic approach followed here to describe the action of AMPHs within the reticular formation is rooted on the fine anatomy of this region of the brainstem. This is exemplified by a few medullary catecholamine neurons, which play a pivotal role compared with the bulk of peripheral sympathetic neurons in sustaining most of the cardiovascular effects induced by AMPHs.</description>

	<description>Background.  Increasingly favorable mortality prognosis in multiple sclerosis (MS) raises questions regarding MS-specific cognitive aging and the presence of comorbidities such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 
Objective.  To assess elderly with MS (EwMS) and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) using both MS- and AD-specific psychometrics.  
Methods.  EwMS (n=104) and 56 HCs were assessed on a broad spectrum of language, visual-spatial processing, memory, processing speed, and executive function tests.  Using logistic regression analysis, we examined cognitive performance differences between the EwMS and HC groups.  Cognitive impairment (CI) was defined using a -1.5 SD threshold relative to age and education years-matched HCs, in two cognitive domains. 
Results.  CI was observed in 47.1% of EwMS with differences most often seen on tests emphasizing cognitive processing speed as measured by Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) (d=0.9, p&amp;lt;0.001) and verbal fluency (both category-based d=0.87, p&amp;lt;0.001; letter-based d=0.67, p&amp;lt;0.001).  After adjusting for age, sex and years of education, MS/HC diagnosis was the best predicted (R2=0.27) by differences in category-based verbal fluency (Wald=9.935, p=0.002) and SDMT (Wald=13.937, p&amp;lt;0.001).  
Conclusion.  This study confirms the common hallmark of slowed cognitive processing speed in MS among elderly patients. Defective verbal fluency, less often observed in younger cohorts, may represent emerging cognitive pathology due to other etiologies.</description>

	<description>Loss of function of the active zone protein Piccolo has recently been linked to a disease, Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia type 3, which causes brain atrophy. Here, we address how Piccolo inactivation in rat neurons adversely affects synaptic function and thus may contribute to neuronal loss. Our analysis shows that Piccolo is critical for the recycling and maintenance of synaptic vesicles. We find that boutons lacking Piccolo have deficits in the Rab5/EEA1 dependent formation of early endosomes and thus the recycling of SVs. Mechanistically, impaired Rab5 function was caused by reduced synaptic recruitment of Pra1, known to interact selectively with the zinc finger domains of Piccolo. Importantly, over-expression of GTPase deficient Rab5 or the Znf1 domain of Piccolo restores the size and recycling of SV pools. These data provide a molecular link between the active zone and endosome sorting at synapses providing hints to how Piccolo contributes to developmental and psychiatric disorders.</description>

	<description>Appetite is driven by nutritional state, environmental cues, mood, and reward pathways. Environmental cues strongly influence feeding behavior, as they can dramatically induce or diminish the drive to consume food despite homeostatic state. Here, we have uncovered an excitatory neuronal population in the basal forebrain that is activated by food-odor related stimuli, and potently drives hypophagia. Notably, we found that the basal forebrain directly integrates environmental sensory cues to govern feeding behavior, and that basal forebrain signaling, mediated through projections to the lateral hypothalamus, promotes selective avoidance of food and food-related stimuli. Together, these findings reveal a novel role for the excitatory basal forebrain in regulating appetite suppression through food avoidance mechanisms, highlighting a key function for this structure as a potent integrator of sensory information towards governing consummatory behaviors.</description>

	<description>The restricted host tropism of hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains incompletely understood, especially post-entry, and has hindered developing an immunocompetent, small animal model. HCV replication in non-permissive species may be limited by incompatibilities between the viral replication machinery and orthologs of essential host factors, like cyclophilin A (CypA). We thus compared the ability of CypA from mouse, tree shrew, and seven non-human primate species to support HCV replication, finding that murine CypA only partially rescued viral replication in Huh7.5-shRNA CypA cells. We determined the specific amino acid differences responsible and generated mutants able to fully rescue replication. We expressed these mutants in engineered murine hepatoma cells and although we observed increases in HCV replication following infection, they remained far lower than those in highly permissive human hepatoma cells, and minimal infectious particle release was observed. Together, these data suggest additional co-factors remain unidentified. Future work to determine such factors will be critical for developing an immunocompetent mouse model supporting HCV replication.</description>

	<description>Long-term memories are believed to be stored in the synapses of cortical neuronal networks. However, recent experiments report continuous creation and removal of cortical synapses, which raises the question how memories can survive on such a variable substrate. Here, we study the formation and retention of associative memory in a computational model based on Hebbian cell assemblies in the presence of both synaptic and structural plasticity. During rest periods, such as may occur during sleep, the assemblies reactivate spontaneously, reinforcing memories against ongoing synapse removal and replacement. Brief daily reactivations during rest-periods suffice to not only maintain the assemblies, but even strengthen them, and improve pattern completion, consistent with offline memory gains observed experimentally. While the connectivity inside memory representations is strengthened during rest phases, connections in the rest of the network decay and vanish thus reconciling apparently conflicting hypotheses of the influence of sleep on cortical connectivity.</description>

	<description>Successful behaviour depends on the right balance between maximising reward and soliciting information about the world. Here, we show how different types of information-gain emerge when casting behaviour as surprise minimisation. We present two distinct mechanisms for goal-directed exploration that express separable profiles of active sampling to reduce uncertainty. ‘Hidden state’ exploration motivates agents to sample unambiguous observations to accurately infer the (hidden) state of the world. Conversely, ‘model parameter’ exploration, compels agents to sample outcomes associated with high uncertainty, if they are informative for their representation of the task structure. We illustrate the emergence of these types of information-gain, termed active inference and active learning, and show how these forms of exploration induce distinct patterns of ‘Bayes-optimal’ behaviour. Our findings provide a computational framework for understanding how distinct levels of uncertainty systematically affect the exploration-exploitation trade-off in decision-making.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The discrete logic of the Brain - Explicit modelling of Brain State durations in EEG and MEG</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/635300v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>We consider the detection and characterisation of brain state transitions, based on ongoing Magneto and Electroencephalography (M/EEG). Here a brain state represents a specific brain dynamical regime or mode of operation, which produces a characteristic quasi-stable pattern of activity at topography, sources or network levels. These states and their transitions over time can reflect fundamental computational properties of the brain, shaping human behaviour and brain function. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has emerged as a useful model-based approach for uncovering the hidden dynamics of brain state transitions based on observed data. However, the Geometric distribution of state duration (dwell time) implicit in HMM places highest probability on very short durations, which makes it inappropriate for the accurate modelling of brain states in M/EEG. We propose using Hidden Semi Markov Models (HSMM), a generalisation of HMM that models the brain state duration distribution explicitly. We present a Bayesian formulation of HSMM and use the Variational Bayes framework to efficiently estimate the HSMM parameters, the number of brain states and select among alternative brain state duration distributions. We assess HSMM performance against HMM on simulated data and demonstrate that the accurate modelling of state duration is paramount for accurately and robustly modelling non-Markovian EEG brain state features. Finally, we used actual resting-state EEG data to demonstrate the approach in practice and conclude that it provides a flexible parameterised framework that permits closer interrogation of possible generative mechanisms.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Building Functional Connectivity Neuromarkers of Behavioral Self-Regulation in Children with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/635292v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are known to struggle with behavioral self-regulation, which associates with greater daily-life challenges and an increased risk for psychiatric comorbidities. Despite these negative outcomes, little is known about the neural expression of behavioral regulation in children with and without ASD. Here, we examined whole-brain linear associations between brain functional correlations (FC) and behavioral regulation through connectome predictive modelling (CPM), a data-driven protocol for developing predictive models of brain-behavior relationships from data, assessing 'neuromarkers' using cross-validation. Using data from two sites of the ABIDE II dataset comprising 276 children with and without ASD (8-13 years), we identified functional brain networks whose FC predicted individual differences in two, of three, behavioral regulation subdomains. These distributed network models predicted novel individuals' inhibition and shifting from resting-state FC data both in a leave-one-out, as well as split halves, cross-validation. We observed commonalities and differences in the functional networks associating with these subdomains, with inhibition relying on more posterior networks, shifting relying on more anterior networks, and both involving regions of the DMN. Our findings present a substantial addition to our knowledge on the neural expressions of inhibition and shifting across the spectrum of children with and without ASD, demonstrating the utility of this trans-diagnostic modelling approach. Given the numerous cognitive and behavioral issues that can be quantified dimensionally in neurodevelopmental disorders, further refinement of whole-brain neuromarker techniques may thus pave a way for functional neuroimaging to meaningfully contribute to individualized medicine.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Aging-related hypometabolism in the anterior cingulate cortex mediates the relationship between age vs. executive function but not vs. memory in cognitively intact elders</title>

	<description>Elucidating the pathophysiology of cognitive decline during aging in those without overt neurodegeneration is a prerequisite to improved diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cognitive aging. We showed previously the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and adjacent medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are centers for aging-related metabolic dysfunction that correlate with age-associated cognitive decline in healthy volunteers. Here, we examine using the extensive and well-characterized ADNI dataset the hypothesis that ACC metabolism in healthy seniors functions as a mediator in the relationship between age and executive function. In agreement with our previous findings, highly significant correlations arose between age and metabolism; metabolism and fluency; and age and fluency. These observations motivated a mediation model in which ACC metabolism mediates the relationship between age and fluency score. Significance of the indirect effect was examined by Sobel testing and bootstrapping. In these cognitively intact seniors with typical aging, there was neither a correlation between age and memory scores nor between ACC metabolism and memory scores. The metabolism in a control region, the primary motor cortex, showed no correlation with age or ACC metabolism. These findings motivate further research into aging-related ACC dysfunction to prevent, diagnose, and treat the decline in executive function associated with aging in the absence of known neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cell numbers, distribution, shape, and regional variation throughout the murine hippocampal formation from the adult brain Allen Reference Atlas</title>

	<description>Quantifying the distribution of cells in every brain region is fundamental to attaining a comprehensive census of distinct neuronal and glial types. Until recently, estimating neuron numbers involved time-consuming procedures that were practically limited to stereological sampling. Progress in open-source image recognition software, growth in computing power, and unprecedented neuroinformatics developments now offer the potentially paradigm-shifting alternative of comprehensive cell-by-cell analysis in an entire brain region. The Allen Brain Atlas provides free digital access to complete series of raw Nissl-stained histological section images along with regional delineations. Automated cell segmentation of these data enables reliable and reproducible high-throughput quantification of regional variations in cell count, density, size, and shape at whole-system scale. While this strategy is directly applicable to any regions of the mouse brain, we first deploy it here on the closed-loop circuit of the hippocampal formation: the medial and lateral entorhinal cortices; dentate gyrus (DG); areas Cornu Ammonis 3 (CA3), CA2, and CA1; and dorsal and ventral subiculum. Using two independent image processing pipelines and the adult mouse reference atlas, we report the first cellular-level soma segmentation in every sub-region and layer of the left hippocampal formation through the full rostral-caudal extent, except for the (already well characterized) principal layers of CA and DG. The overall numbers (~600k cells in entorhinal cortex, ~200k in DG, ~430k in CA1-3, and ~290k in subiculum) are corroborated by traditional stereological sampling on a data subset and well match sparse published reports.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Separation of hemodynamic signals from GCaMP fluorescence measured with widefield imaging</title>

	<description>Widefield calcium imaging is often used to measure brain dynamics in behaving mice. With a large field of view and a high sampling rate, widefield imaging can monitor activity from several distant cortical areas simultaneously, revealing cortical interactions. Interpretation of widefield images is complicated, however, by the absorption of light by hemoglobin, which can substantially affect the measured fluorescence. One approach to separating hemodynamics and calcium signals is to use multi-wavelength backscatter recordings to measure light absorption by hemoglobin. Following this approach, we develop a spatially-detailed regression-based method to estimate hemodynamics. The spatially-detailed model is based on a linear form of the Beer-Lambert relationship, but is fit at every pixel in the image and does not rely on the estimation of physical parameters. In awake mice of three transgenic lines, the Spatial Model offers improved separation of hemodynamics and changes in GCaMP fluorescence. The improvement is pronounced near blood vessels and, in contrast with other models based on regression or the Beer-Lambert law, can remove vascular artifacts along the sagittal midline. Compared to other separation approaches, the spatially-detailed model permits more accurate fluorescence-based determination of neuronal activity across the cortex.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Frontal theta and beta oscillations during lower-limb movement in Parkinson\'s disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/634808v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/634808v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Motor function and aberrant cognition have been linked in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but it is unknown if these are distinct symptoms or if they are correlated outcomes of a single dysfunctional latent process. EEG theta and beta rhythms are reliably associated with cognitive and motor functions, respectably. We tested the hypothesis that PD patients with lower-limb abnormalities would exhibit abnormal beta and theta rhythms in the mid-frontal region during action initiation. Methods: We recruited thirty-nine subjects, including PD patients with FOG (PDFOG+; n=13) and without FOG (PDFOG-; n=13), and demographically-matched healthy subjects (n=13). Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were collected during a lower-limb pedaling motor task, which required intentional initiation and stopping of a motor movement. Results: FOG scores were correlated with disease severity and cognition. PDFOG+ patients pedaled with reduced speed and decreased acceleration compared to PDFOG- patients and to controls. PDFOG+ patients exhibited attenuated theta-band (4-8 Hz) power and increased beta-band (13-30 Hz) power at mid-frontal electrode Cz during pedaling. Frontal theta- and beta-band oscillations also correlated with lower-limb movement in PD patients. Conclusions: Frontal theta and beta oscillations are predictors of lower-limb motor symptoms in PD. These data provide insight into the mechanism of lower-limb dysfunction in PD, and could be used to design neuromodulation for PD-related lower-limb abnormalities.</description>

	<description>Introduction: Vestibular Myogenic Evoked Potential (VEMP) evaluates vestibulo-ocular and vestibulospinal reflexes associated with posture. Purpose: To compare cervical and ocular VEMP in individuals with HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (HAM) and with HTLV-1-asymptomatic infection. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study included 52 HTLV-1-infected individuals (26 HAM and 26 asymptomatic carriers) and 26 negative controls. The groups were similar regarding age and gender. Participants underwent ocular and cervical VEMP that were performed simultaneously. The stimulus used to generate VEMP was a sound, low-frequency toneburst, intensity of 120 decibels normalized hearing level (dB nHL), bandpass filter from 10 to 1,500 Hz, with 100 stimuli at 500 Hertz (Hz) and 50 milliseconds (ms) recording time. An alteration in the electrophysiological waves P13 and N23 for cervical VEMP and N10 and P15 waves for ocular VEMP was compared between groups. Results: Cervical VEMP was different among the groups for P13 (p=0.001) and N23 (p=0.003). Ocular VEMP was similar for N10 (p=0.375) and different for P15 (p=0.000). In the HTLV-1-asymptomatic group, 1(3.8%) individual presented changes in both ocular and cervical VEMP, while in HAM group, 16(61.5%) presented changes in both tests. Conclusion: Neurological impairment in HAM was not restricted to the spinal cord. The mesencephalic and thalamic connections, tested by ocular VEMP, were also altered. Damage of the oculomotor system, responsible for eye stabilization during head and body movements, may explain why dizziness is such a frequent complaint in HAM.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/634543v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: The trochozoan excitatory peptide (EP) and its ortholog, the arthropod CCHamide, are neuropeptides that are only investigated in very few animal species. Previous studies on different trochozoan species focused on their physiological effect in adult specimens, demonstrating a myo-excitatory effect, often on tissues of the digestive system. The function of EP in the planktonic larvae of trochozoans has not yet been studied. Results: We surveyed transcriptomes from species of various spiralian (Orthonectia, Nemertea, Brachiopoda, Entoprocta, Rotifera) and ecdysozoan taxa (Tardigrada, Onychophora, Priapulida, Loricifera, Nematomorpha) to investigate the evolution of EPs/CCHamides in protostomes. We found that the EPs of several pilidiophoran nemerteans show a characteristic difference in their C-terminus. Deorphanization of a pilidiophoran EP receptor showed, that the two isoforms of the nemertean Lineus longissimus EP activate a single receptor. We investigated the expression of EP in L. longissimus larvae and juveniles with customized antibodies and found that EP-positive nerves in larvae project from the apical organ to the ciliary band and that EP is expressed more broadly in juveniles in the neuropil and the prominent longitudinal nerve cords. While exposing juvenile L. longissimus specimens to synthetic excitatory peptides did not show any obvious effect, exposure of larvae to either of the two EPs increased the beat frequency of their locomotory cilia and shifted their vertical swimming distribution in a water column upwards. Conclusion: Our results show that EP/CCHamide peptides are broadly conserved in protostomes. We show that the EP increases the ciliary beat frequency of L. longissimus larvae, which shifts their vertical distribution in a water column upwards. Endogenous EP may be released at the ciliary band from the projections of apical organ EP-positive neurons to regulate ciliary beating. A locomotory function of EP in L. longissimus larvae, compared to the association of EP/CCHamides with the digestive system in other animals suggests a dynamic integration of orthologous neuropeptides into different functions during evolution.</description>

	<description>Recent studies have examined the feedback pathway from the amygdala to the auditory cortex in conjunction with the feedforward pathway from the auditory cortex to the amygdala. However, these connections have not been fully characterized. Here, to visualize the comprehensive connectivity between the auditory cortex and amygdala, we injected cholera toxin subunit b (CTB), a bidirectional tracer, into multiple subfields in the mouse auditory cortex after identifying the location of these subfields using flavoprotein fluorescence imaging. After injecting CTB into the secondary auditory field (A2), we found densely innervated CTB-positive axon terminals that were mainly located in the lateral amygdala (La), and slight innervations in other divisions such as the basal amygdala. Moreover, we found a large number of retrogradely-stained CTB-positive neurons in La after injecting CTB into A2. When injecting CTB into the primary auditory cortex (A1), a small number of CTB-positive neurons and axons were visualized in the amygdala. Finally, we found a near complete absence of connections between the other auditory cortical fields and the amygdala. These data suggest that reciprocal connections between A2 and La are main conduits for communication between the auditory cortex and amygdala in mice.</description>

	<description>Serotonin 2A receptors (5-HT2ARs) mediate the effects of hallucinogenic drugs and antipsychotic medications, and are reduced in schizophrenia patients' brains. However, how 5-HT2AR expression is regulated remains poorly understood. We show that 5-HT2ARs are rapidly upregulated in the mouse frontal cortex (FC) in response to an environmental stimulus, sleep deprivation. This induction requires the immediate early gene transcription factor early growth response 3 (Egr3). Further, EGR3 binds to the Htr2a promoter in the FC in vivo, and drives reporter construct expression in vitro via two Htr2a promoter binding sites. These findings suggest that EGR3 directly regulates FC Htr2a expression in response to physiologic stimuli, providing a mechanism by which environment rapidly alters levels of a brain receptor that mediates symptoms, and treatment, of mental illness.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Jumping To Conclusions, General Intelligence, And Psychosis Liability: Findings From The Multicentric EU-GEI Case-Control Study</title>

	<description>Background: The &quot;jumping to conclusions&quot; (JTC) data-gathering bias is associated with both psychosis and general cognition but their relationship is still unclear. In this study, we set out to clarify the relationship between IQ, JTC and psychosis by testing mediation models of IQ, JTC and First Episode Psychosis (FEP), and by examining relationships between polygenic liability to IQ, polygenic liability to schizophrenia and JTC. Methods: 817 FEP patients and 1294 population-based controls completed assessments of general intelligence (IQ), and JTC (assessed by the number of beads drawn on the probabilistic reasoning &quot;beads task&quot;), and provided blood or saliva samples from which we extracted DNA and computed polygenic risk scores for IQ and schizophrenia. Results: The estimated proportion of the total effect of case/control differences on JTC mediated by IQ was 79%. Schizophrenia Polygenic Risk Score (SZ PRS) was non-significantly associated with larger number of beads drawn (B= 0.47, 95% CI -0.21 to 1.16, p=0.17); whereas IQ PRS (B=0.51, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.76, p&amp;lt;0.001) significantly predicted the number of beads drawn, and was thus associated with reduced JTC bias. Conclusions: the JTC reasoning bias in psychosis is not a specific cognitive deficit but is rather a manifestation or consequence, of general cognitive impairment. The work has potential to inform interventions targeting cognitive biases in early psychosis.</description>

	<description>Clustering of functionally similar synapses in dendrites is thought to affect input-output transformation by inducing dendritic nonlinearities. However, neither the in vivo impact of synaptic clusters on somatic membrane potential (sVm), nor the rules of cluster formation are elucidated. We developed a computational approach to measure the effect of functional synaptic clusters on sVm response of biophysical model CA1 and L2/3 pyramidal neurons to behaviorally relevant in vivo-like inputs. Large-scale dendritic spatial inhomogeneities in synaptic tuning properties did influence sVm, but small synaptic clusters appearing randomly with unstructured connectivity did not. With structured connectivity, ~10-20 synapses per cluster was optimal for clustering-based tuning, but larger responses were achieved by 2-fold potentiation of the same synapses. We further show that without nonlinear amplification of the effect of random clusters, action potential-based, global plasticity rules can not generate functional clustering. Our results suggest that clusters likely form via local synaptic interactions, and have to be moderately large to impact sVm responses.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The effect of global signal regression on DCM estimates of noise and effective connectivity from resting state fMRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/634063v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The influence of the global BOLD signal on resting state functional connectivity in fMRI data remains a topic of debate, with little consensus. In this study, we assessed the effects of global signal regression (GSR) on effective connectivity within and between resting-state networks; as estimated with dynamic causal modelling (DCM) for resting state fMRI (rsfMRI). DCM incorporates a forward (generative) model that quantifies the contribution of different types of noise (including global measurement noise), effective connectivity, and (neuro)vascular processes to functional connectivity measurements. DCM analyses were applied to two different designs; namely, longitudinal and cross-sectional designs. In the modelling of longitudinal designs, we included four extensive longitudinal resting state fMRI datasets with a total number of 20 subjects. In the analysis of cross-sectional designs, we used rsfMRI data from 361 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. We hypothesized that (1) GSR would have no discernible impact on effective connectivity estimated with DCM, and (2) GSR would be reflected in the parameters representing global measurement noise. Additionally, we performed comparative analyses of the informative value of data with and without GSR. Our results showed negligible to small effects of GSR on connectivity within small (separately estimated) RSNs. For between-network connectivity, we found two important effects: the effect of GSR on between-network connectivity (averaged over all connections) was negligible to small, while the effect of GSR on individual connections was non-negligible. Contrary to our expectations, we found either no effect (in the longitudinal designs) or a non-specific (cross-sectional design) effect of GSR on parameters representing (global) measurement noise. Data without GSR were found to be more informative than data with GSR; however, in small resting state networks the precision of posterior estimates was greater using data after GSR. In conclusion, GSR is a minor concern in DCM studies; however, individual between-network connections (as opposed to average between-network connectivity) and noise parameters should be interpreted quantitatively with some caution. The Kullback-Leibler divergence of the posterior from the prior, together with the precision of posterior estimates, might offer a useful measure to assess the appropriateness of GSR, when nuancing data features in resting state fMRI.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Computational Analysis of Therapeutic Neuroadaptation to Chronic Antidepressant in a Model of the Monoaminergic Neurotransmitter, Stress Hormone, and Male Sex Hormone Systems</title>

	<description>Second-line depression treatment involves augmentation with one (rarely two) additional drugs, of chronic administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which is the first-line depression treatment. Unfortunately, many depressed patients still fail to respond even after months to years of searching to find an effective combination. To aid in the identification of potentially affective antidepressant combinations, we created a computational model of the monoaminergic neurotransmitter (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine), stress-hormone (cortisol), and male sex-hormone (testosterone) systems. The model was trained via machine learning to represent a broad set of empirical observations. Neuroadaptation to chronic drug administration was simulated through incremental adjustments in model parameters that corresponded to key regulatory components of the neurotransmitter and neurohormone systems. Analysis revealed that neuroadaptation in the model depended on all of the regulatory components in complicated ways, and did not reveal any one or a few specific components that could be targeted in the design of combination antidepressant treatment. We used large sets of neuroadapted states of the model to screen 74 different drug and hormone combinations and identified several combinations that could potentially be therapeutic for a higher proportion of male patients than SSRIs by themselves.</description>

	<description>The clinical practice of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) augmentation relies heavily on clinical judgment and trial-and-error. Unfortunately, the drug combinations prescribed today fail to provide relief for all treatment-resistant depressed patients. In order to identify potentially more effective treatments, we developed a computational model of the monoaminergic neurotransmitter and stress-steroid systems that neuroadapts to chronic administration of combinations of antidepressant drugs and hormones by adjusting the strengths of its transmitter-system components (TSCs). We used the model to screen 60 chronically administered drug/hormone pairs and triples, and identified as potentially therapeutic those combinations that raised the monoamines (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine) but lowered cortisol following neuroadaptation in the model. We also evaluated the contributions of individual and pairs of TSCs to therapeutic neuroadaptation with chronic SSRI using sensitivity, correlation, and linear temporal-logic analyses. All three approaches found that therapeutic neuroadaptation to chronic SSRI is an overdetermined process that depends on multiple TSCs, providing a potential explanation for the clinical finding that no single antidepressant regimen alleviates depressive symptoms in all patients.</description>

	<description>Gene and protein expressions are key determinants of cellular function. Neurons are the building blocks of brain circuits, yet the relationship between their molecular identity and the spatial distribution of their dendritic inputs and axonal outputs remain incompletely understood. The open-source knowledge base Hippocampome.org amasses such transcriptomic data from the scientific literature for morphologically defined neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation: dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, CA2, CA1, subiculum (SUB), and entorhinal cortex (EC). Positive, negative, or mixed expression reports were initially obtained from published articles directly connecting molecular evidence to neurons with known axonal and dendritic patterns across hippocampal layers. Here, we supplement this information by collating, formalizing, and leveraging relational expression inferences (REIs) that link a gene or protein expression or lack thereof to that of another molecule or to an anatomical location. With these additional interpretations, we freely release online a comprehensive human- and machine-readable molecular profile for the more than 100 neuron types in Hippocampome.org. Analysis of these data ascertains the ability to distinguish unequivocally most neuron types in each of the major subdivisions of the hippocampus based on currently known biochemical markers. Moreover, grouping neuron types by expression similarity reveals eight super-families characterized by a few defining molecules.</description>

	<description>The algorithmic and neural basis of concept learning remains poorly understood. In this paper, we articulate a novel, biologically plausible approach to concept learning based on active inference, and on the idea that a generative model can be equipped with extra (hidden state or cause) 'slots' that can be engaged when an agent learns about novel concepts. This can be combined with a Bayesian model reduction process, in which any concept learning - associated with these slots - can be reset in favor of a simpler model with higher model evidence. We use simulations to illustrate this model's ability to add new concepts to its state space, increase the granularity of the concepts it currently possesses, and accomplish a simple form of 'one-shot' generalization to new stimuli. Although deliberately simple, these results suggest that active inference may offer useful resources in developing neurocomputational models of concept learning.</description>

	<description>The 593 kbp 16p11.2 copy number variation (CNV) affects the gene dosage of 29 protein coding genes, with heterozygous 16p11.2 microduplication or microdeletion implicated in about 1% of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cases. The 16p11.2 CNV is frequently associated with macrocephaly or microcephaly indicating early defects of neurogenesis may contribute to subsequent ASD symptoms, but it is unknown which 16p11.2 transcripts are expressed in progenitors and whose levels are likely, therefore, to influence neurogenesis. Analysis of human fetal gene expression data revealed that of all the 16p11.2 transcripts only two, ALDOA and KIF22, are significantly enriched in progenitors. To investigate the role of ALDOA and KIF22 in human cerebral cortex development we used immunohistochemical staining to describe their expression in late first and early second trimester human cerebral cortex. KIF22 protein is restricted to proliferating cells with its levels increasing during the cell cycle and peaking at mitosis. ALDOA protein is expressed in all cell types and does not vary with cell-cycle phase. Our expression analysis suggests the hypothesis that the simultaneous changes in KIF22 and ALDOA dosage in cortical progenitors causes defects in neurogenesis that may contribute to ASD in 16p11.2 CNV patients.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Macroscopic phase resetting-curves determine oscillatory coherence and signal transfer in inter-coupled neural circuits</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Grégory Dumont, Boris Gutkin&lt;/p&gt;

Macroscopic oscillations of different brain regions show multiple phase relationships that are persistent across time and have been implicated in routing information. While multiple cellular mechanisms influence the network oscillatory dynamics and structure the macroscopic firing motifs, one of the key questions is to identify the biophysical neuronal and synaptic properties that permit such motifs to arise. A second important issue is how the different neural activity coherence states determine the communication between the neural circuits. Here we analyse the emergence of phase-locking within bidirectionally delayed-coupled spiking circuits in which global gamma band oscillations arise from synaptic coupling among largely excitable neurons. We consider both the interneuronal (ING) and the pyramidal-interneuronal (PING) population gamma rhythms and the inter coupling targeting the pyramidal or the inhibitory neurons. Using a mean-field approach together with an exact reduction method, we reduce each spiking network to a low dimensional nonlinear system and derive the macroscopic phase resetting-curves (mPRCs) that determine how the phase of the global oscillation responds to incoming perturbations. This is made possible by the use of the quadratic integrate-and-fire model together with a Lorentzian distribution of the bias current. Depending on the type of gamma (PING vs. ING), we show that incoming excitatory inputs can either speed up the macroscopic oscillation (phase advance; type I PRC) or induce both a phase advance and a delay (type II PRC). From there we determine the structure of macroscopic coherence states (phase-locking) of two weakly synaptically-coupled networks. To do so we derive a phase equation for the coupled system which links the synaptic mechanisms to the coherence states of the system. We show that a synaptic transmission delay is a necessary condition for symmetry breaking, i.e. a non-symmetric phase lag between the macroscopic oscillations. This potentially provides an explanation to the experimentally observed variety of gamma phase-locking modes. Our analysis further shows that symmetry-broken coherence states can lead to a preferred direction of signal transfer between the oscillatory networks where this directionality also depends on the timing of the signal. Hence we suggest a causal theory for oscillatory modulation of functional connectivity between cortical circuits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IMMSb02YOS4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Anti-TNF agents have been in the first line of treatment of various inflammatory diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis and Crohn’s Disease, with a number of different biologics being currently in use. A detailed analysis of their effect at transcriptome level has nevertheless been lacking. We herein present a concise analysis of an extended transcriptomics profiling of four different anti-TNF biologics upon treatment of the established hTNFTg (Tg197) mouse model of spontaneous inflammatory polyarthritis. We implement a series of computational analyses that include clustering of differentially expressed genes, functional analysis and random forest classification. Taking advantage of our detailed sample structure, we devise metrics of treatment efficiency that take into account changes in gene expression compared to both the healthy and the diseased state. Our results suggest considerable variability in the capacity of different biologics to modulate gene expression that can be attributed to treatment-specific functional pathways and differential preferences to restore over- or under-expressed genes. Early intervention appears to manage inflammation in a more efficient way but is accompanied by increased effects on a number of genes that are seemingly unrelated to the disease. Administration at an early stage is also lacking in capacity to restore healthy expression levels of under-expressed genes. We record quantifiable differences among anti-TNF biologics in their efficiency to modulate over-expressed genes related to immune and inflammatory pathways. More importantly, we find a subset of the tested substances to have quantitative advantages in addressing deregulation of under-expressed genes involved in pathways related to known RA comorbidities. Our study shows the potential of transcriptomic analyses to identify comprehensive and distinct treatment-specific gene signatures combining disease-related and unrelated genes and proposes a generalized framework for the assessment of drug efficacy, the search of biosimilars and the evaluation of the efficacy of TNF small molecule inhibitors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5Y_UHy_8nBA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Scientific data recording and reporting systems are of a great interest for endorsing reproducibility and transparency practices among the scientific community. Current research generates large datasets that can no longer be documented using paper lab notebooks (PLNs). In this regard, electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) could be a promising solution to replace PLNs and promote scientific reproducibility and transparency. We previously analyzed five ELNs and performed two survey-based studies to implement an ELN in a biomedical research institute. Among the ELNs tested, we found that Microsoft OneNote presents numerous features related to ELN best functionalities. In addition, both surveyed groups preferred OneNote over a scientifically designed ELN (PerkinElmer Elements). However, OneNote remains a general note-taking application and has not been designed for scientific purposes. We therefore provide a quick guide to adapt OneNote to an ELN workflow that can also be adjusted to other nonscientific ELNs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PzQPROKMCQU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

When listening to music, humans can easily identify and move to the beat. Numerous experimental studies have identified brain regions that may be involved with beat perception and representation. Several theoretical and algorithmic approaches have been proposed to account for this ability. Related to, but different from the issue of how we perceive a beat, is the question of how we learn to generate and hold a beat. In this paper, we introduce a neuronal framework for a beat generator that is capable of learning isochronous rhythms over a range of frequencies that are relevant to music and speech. Our approach combines ideas from error-correction and entrainment models to investigate the dynamics of how a biophysically-based neuronal network model synchronizes its period and phase to match that of an external stimulus. The model makes novel use of on-going faster gamma rhythms to form a set of discrete clocks that provide estimates, but not exact information, of how well the beat generator spike times match those of a stimulus sequence. The beat generator is endowed with plasticity allowing it to quickly learn and thereby adjust its spike times to achieve synchronization. Our model makes generalizable predictions about the existence of asymmetries in the synchronization process, as well as specific predictions about resynchronization times after changes in stimulus tempo or phase. Analysis of the model demonstrates that accurate rhythmic time keeping can be achieved over a range of frequencies relevant to music, in a manner that is robust to changes in parameters and to the presence of noise.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_hoJqGkSRLU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Context-Based Facilitation in Visual Word Recognition: Evidence for Visual and Lexical But Not Pre-Lexical Contributions</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Word familiarity and predictive context facilitate visual word processing, leading to faster recognition times and reduced neuronal responses. Previously, models with and without top-down connections, including lexical-semantic, pre-lexical (e.g., orthographic/phonological), and visual processing levels were successful in accounting for these facilitation effects. Here we systematically assessed context-based facilitation with a repetition priming task and explicitly dissociated pre-lexical and lexical processing levels using a pseudoword (PW) familiarization procedure. Experiment 1 investigated the temporal dynamics of neuronal facilitation effects with magnetoencephalography (MEG; &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 38 human participants), while experiment 2 assessed behavioral facilitation effects (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 24 human participants). Across all stimulus conditions, MEG demonstrated context-based facilitation across multiple time windows starting at 100 ms, in occipital brain areas. This finding indicates context-based facilitation at an early visual processing level. In both experiments, we furthermore found an interaction of context and lexical familiarity, such that stimuli with associated meaning showed the strongest context-dependent facilitation in brain activation and behavior. Using MEG, this facilitation effect could be localized to the left anterior temporal lobe at around 400 ms, indicating within-level (i.e., exclusively lexical-semantic) facilitation but no top-down effects on earlier processing stages. Increased pre-lexical familiarity (in PWs familiarized utilizing training) did not enhance or reduce context effects significantly. We conclude that context-based facilitation is achieved within visual and lexical processing levels. Finally, by testing alternative hypotheses derived from mechanistic accounts of repetition suppression, we suggest that the facilitatory context effects found here are implemented using a predictive coding mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: A multicentre retrospective study of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease type 4B (CMT4B) due to mutations in Myotubularin‐related proteins (MTMRs)</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease 4B1 and 4B2 (CMT4B1/B2) are characterized by recessive inheritance, early onset, severe course, slowed nerve conduction, and myelin outfoldings. CMT4B3 shows a more heterogeneous phenotype. All are associated with Myotubularin‐related proteins (MTMRs) mutations. We conducted a multicentre retrospective study to better characterize CMT4B.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We collected clinical and genetic data from CMT4B subjects in 18 centres using a predefined minimal dataset including MRC scores of nine muscle pairs and CMT Neuropathy Score.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 50 patients, 21 of whom never reported before, carrying 44 mutations, of which 21 novel and six representing novel disease associations of known rare variants. CMT4B1 patients had significantly more severe disease than CMT4B2, with earlier onset, more frequent motor milestones delay, wheelchair use and respiratory involvement as well as worse MRC scores and motor CMT Examination Score components despite younger age at examination. Vocal cord involvement was common in both subtypes, whereas glaucoma occurred in CMT4B2 only. Nerve conduction velocities were similarly slowed in both subtypes. Regression analyses showed that disease severity is significantly associated with age in CMT4B1. Slopes are steeper for CMT4B1, indicating faster disease progression. Almost none of the mutations in the &lt;i&gt;MTMR2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MTMR13&lt;/i&gt; genes, responsible for CMT4B1 and B2, respectively, influence the correlation between disease severity and age, in agreement with the hypothesis of a complete loss of function of MTMR2/13 proteins for such mutations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the largest CMT4B series ever reported, demonstrating that CMT4B1 is significantly more severe than CMT4B2, and allowing an estimate of prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Differential Regulation of Syngap1 Translation by FMRP Modulates eEF2 Mediated Response on NMDAR Activity</title>

	<description>SYNGAP1, a Synaptic Ras-GTPase activating protein, regulates synapse maturation during a critical developmental window. Heterozygous mutation in SYNGAP1 (SYNGAP1+/-) has been shown to cause Intellectual Disability (ID) in children. Recent studies have provided evidence for altered neuronal protein synthesis in a mouse model of Syngap1+/-. However, the molecular mechanism behind the same is unclear. Here, we report the reduced expression of a known translation regulator, FMRP, during a specific developmental period in Syngap1+/- mice. Our results demonstrated that FMRP interacts with and regulates the translation of Syngap1 mRNA. We further show that, during development, reduced translation, and subsequent decrease in FMRP level leads to a compensatory increase of Syngap1 translation in Syngap1+/-. These developmental changes are reflected in the altered response of eEF2 phosphorylation downstream of NMDA Receptor (NMDAR)-mediated signalling. In this study, we propose a cross-talk between FMRP and SYNGAP1-mediated signalling which can also explain the compensatory effect of impaired signalling observed in Syngap1+/- mice.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: The Role of Insulin Resistance and Protein O-GlcNAcylation in Neurodegeneration</title>

	<description>Metabolic syndrome including obesity and type 2 diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide. Similarly, there has been an increase in the cases of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) possibility due to increase in elderly population in the past few decades. Both, metabolic diseases and AD have one common feature that is insulin resistance.  Recent studies suggest a link between the regulatory functions of insulin in the brain and AD.  Hypoglycemia, a characteristic feature of AD may be a result of impaired insulin signaling in the affected regions of the brain. O-GlcNAcylation is a post-translational protein modification, the levels of which are dependent on the availability of glucose inside the cells. Hyperphosphorylation of Tau is a major molecular feature, which leads to its aggregation and neurotoxicity in AD.  In addition, impaired processing of Amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to toxic amyloid β (Aβ) aggregation is also implicated in the pathogenesis of AD.  Both APP and Tau are also found to be O-GlcNAcylated. Reduced O-GlcNAcylation of APP and Tau due to hypoglycemia is found to be associated with their pathological features in AD brain. Recent studies have also identified perturbed O-GlcNAcylation/phosphorylation of several other proteins important for normal neuronal function, which may be contributing to the neuropathological development in AD. Herein, we discuss about the uptake and distribution of insulin inside the brain, brain insulin signaling and insulin resistance as well as its relation to neurodegenerative diseases with a special focus on protein O-GlcNAcylation and its potential role in the treatment of AD.</description>

	<description>Background: The exact mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions are not fully known. The design of drugs that act on multiple targets represents a promising approach that should be explored for more effective clinical options for neurodegenerative disorders. B7C is s synthetic drug that has been studied for over 20 years and represents a promising multi-target drug for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD. 
Aims: The present systematic review, thus, aims at examining existing studies on the effect of B7C on different molecular targets and at discussing the relevance of B7C in neurological disorders.
Methods: A list of predefined search terms was used to retrieve relevant articles from the databases of Embase, Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The selection of articles was done by two independent authors, who were considering articles concerned primarily with the evaluation of the effect of B7C on neurological disorders. Only full-text articles written in English were included; whereas, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, book chapters, conference subtracts, and computational studies were excluded.   
Results: A total of 2266 articles were retrieved out of which 41 articles were included in the present systematic review. The effect of B7C on molecular targets, including AChE, BChE, BACE-1, NMDA receptor, GABA receptor, NOS, and Kv4.2 potassium channels was evaluated. Moreover, the studies that were included assessed the effect of B7C on biological processes, such as apoptosis, neuritogenesis, and amyloid beta aggregation. The animal studies examined in the review focused on the effect of B7C on cognition and memory. 
Conclusions: The beneficial effects observed on different molecular targets and biological processes relevant to neurological conditions confirm that B7C is a promising multi-target drug with the potential to treat neurological disorders.</description>

	<description>Decision-making is assumed to be supported by model-free and model-based systems: the model-free system is based purely on experience, while the model-based system uses a cognitive map of the environment and is more accurate. The recently developed multistep decision-making task and its computational model can dissociate the contributions of the two systems and have been used widely. This study used this task and model to understand our value-based learning process and tested alternative algorithms for the model-free and model-based learning systems. The task used in this study had a deterministic transition structure, and the degree of use of this structure in learning is estimated as the relative contribution of the model-based system to choices. We obtained data from 29 participants and fitted them with various computational models that differ in the model-free and model-based assumptions. The results of model comparison and parameter estimation showed that the participants update the value of action sequences and not each action. Additionally, the model fit was improved substantially by assuming that the learning mechanism includes a forgetting process, where the values of unselected options change to a certain default value over time. We also examined the relationships between the estimated parameters and psychopathology and other traits measured by self-reported questionnaires, and the results suggested that the difference in model assumptions can change the conclusion. In particular, inclusion of the forgetting process in the computational models had a strong impact on estimation of the weighting parameter of the model-free and model-based systems.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cortical Functional Domains Show Distinctive Oscillatory Dynamic in Bimanual and Mirror Visual Feedback Tasks</title>

	<description>It is believed that Mirror Visual Feedback (MVF) increases the interlimb transfer but the exact mechanism is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to compare between a bimanual task (BM) and a MVF task, within functionally rather than geometrically defined cortical domains. Measure Projection Analysis (MPA) approach was applied to compare the dynamic oscillatory activity (event-related synchronisation/desynchronisation ERS/ERD) between and within domains. EEG was recorded in 14 healthy participants performing a BM and an MVF task with the right hand. The MPA was applied on fitted equivalent current dipoles based on independent components to define domains containing functionally similar areas.  The measure of intradomain similarity was a “signed mutual information”, a parameter based on the coherence. Domain analysis was performed for joint tasks (BM and MVF) and for each task separately. MVF created 9 functional domains while MB task had only 4 functionally distinctive domains, two over the left hemispheres and two bilateraly. For all domains identified for BM task alone, similar domains could be identified in MVF and joint tasks analysis. In addition MVF had domains related to motor planning on the right hemisphere and to self-recognition of action. For joint tasks analysis, seven domains were identified, with similar functions for the left and the right hand with exception of a domain covering BA32 (self-recognition of action) of the left hand only.  In joint task domain analysis, the ERD/ERS showed a larger difference between domains than between tasks. All domains which involved the sensory cortex had a visible beta ERS at the onset of movement, and post movement beta ERS. The frequency of ERD varied between domains.  Largest difference between tasks existed in domains responsible for the awareness of action. In conclusion, functionally distinctive domains have different ERD/ERS patterns, similar for both tasks.  MVF activates contralateral hemisphere in similar manner to BM movements, while at the same time also activating the ipsilateral hemisphere. Significance: Following stroke cortical activation and interhemispheric inhibition from the contralesional side is reduced. MVF creates stronger ipsilateral activity than BM, which is highly relevant of neurorehabilitation of movements.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: GPR37 Signaling Modulates Migration of Olfactory Ensheathing Cells and Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Cells in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00200</guid>

	<description>Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, regulate reproduction. Prenatally, GnRH neurons migrate into the brain from the nasal placode along terminal nerve fibers, intermixed with olfactory sensory axons and olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs). An expression analysis from embryonic GnRH neurons identified the G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37 or PAEL-r). GPR37 has been linked to 1) juvenile Parkinson’s disease in humans, 2) oligodendrocyte differentiation, and 3) Wnt/β-catenin signaling during neurogenesis.  In this study, the role of GPR37 was investigated in the developing GnRH/olfactory system. PCR and immunocytochemistry confirmed expression of GPR37 in migrating GnRH neurons as well as in OECs. Inhibition of GPR37 signaling in nasal explants attenuated GnRH neuronal migration and OEC movement. Examination of GPR37 deficient mice revealed a decrease in the olfactory bulb nerve layer and attenuated/delayed maturation and migration of GnRH neurons into the brain. These data demonstrate a developmental role for GPR37 signaling in neural migration.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Stereotaxic Coordinates and Morphological Characterization of a Unique Nucleus (CSF-Contacting Nucleus) in Rat</title>

	<description>A unique nucleus, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting nucleus, has recently been recognized in the brain parenchyma. The outstanding feature of this nucleus is that the neural somas are located in the parenchyma, but their processes stretch into the CSF, implying that it may be a key structure bridging the nervous and body fluids-regulating systems and may play a pivotal role in modulating physiological activities. However, the true biological significance of this nucleus needs to be uncovered. The morphology of a nucleus is one of the most important parameters for neuroscience studies. For this reason, a common experimental animal, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, was chosen. The position, adjacent structures, neuronal distribution, size, three-dimensional reconstruction, and core coordinates of the CSF-contacting nucleus in SD rats of different weights (90-400 g) were illustrated for the first time. Furthermore, the formulas for calculating the core coordinates of the CSF-contacting nucleus in rats of different weights were revealed. Finally, the possible biological functions uncovered by past research are reviewed in this paper. This study provides an indispensable methodology and a significant reference for researchers interested in this unique nucleus.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Calcium Ions Stimulate the Hyperphosphorylation of Tau by Activating Microsomal Prostaglandin E Synthase 1</title>

	<description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is reportedly associated with the accumulation of calcium ions (Ca2+), and this accumulation is responsible for the phosphorylation of tau. Although several lines of evidence demonstrate the above phenomenon, the inherent mechanisms remain unknown. Using APP/PS1 Tg mice and neuroblastoma (N)2a cells as in vivo and in vitro experimental models, we observed that Ca2+ stimulated the phosphorylation of tau by activating microsomal PGE synthase 1 (mPGES1) in a prostaglandin (PG) E2-dependent EP receptor-activating manner. Specifically, the highly accumulated Ca2+ stimulated the expression of mPGES1 and the synthesis of PGE2. Treatment with the inhibitor of Ca2+ transporter, NMDAR, attenuated the expression of mPGES1 and the production of PGE2 were attenuated in S(+)-ketamine-treated APP/PS1 Tg mice. Elevated levels of PGE2 were responsible for the hyperphosphorylation of tau in an EP-1-, EP-2- and EP-3-dependent but not EP4-dependent cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 5-activating manner. Reciprocally, the knockdown of the expression of mPGES1 ameliorated the expected cognitive decline by inhibiting the phosphorylation of tau in APP/PS1 Tg mice. Moreover, CDK5 was found to be located downstream of EP1-3 to regulate the phosphorylation of tau though the cleavage of p35 to p25. Finally, the phosphorylation of tau by Ca2+ contributed to the cognitive decline of APP/PS1 Tg mice.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Multi-Ingredient Nutritional Supplement in Combination With Resistance Exercise and High-Intensity Interval Training Improves Cognitive Function and Increases N-3 Index in Healthy Older Men: A Randomized Controlled Trial</title>

	<description>We aimed to evaluate the effect of multi-ingredient nutritional supplementation, with and without exercise training, on cognitive function in healthy older men. Forty-nine sedentary men (age: 73±6years [mean±SD]; body mass index: 28.5±3.6kg/m2) were randomized to consume a supplement (SUPP n=25; 1500mg n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, 30g whey protein, 2.5g creatine, 500IU vitamin D, and 400mg calcium) or control beverage (CON n=24; 22g maltodextrin) twice daily for 20wk consisting of Phase 1: SUPP/CON followed by Phase 2: 12-wk resistance exercise training plus high-intensity interval training, while continuing to consume the study beverages (SUPP/CON+EX). At baseline, 6wk, and 19wk we assessed cognitive function (Montréal Cognitive Assessment [MOCA]), memory (word recall during the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test [RAVLT]), and executive functions (working memory inhibition control), and nutrient bioavailability. We did not observe changes to any aspect of cognitive function after Phase 1; however, significant improvements in the following cognitive function outcomes were detected following Phase 2: MOCA scores increased (6wk: 23.5±3.3 vs. 19wk: 24.4±2.5, p=0.013); number of words recalled during the RAVLT (6wk: 6.6±3.6 vs. 19wk: 7.6±3.8, p=0.047); and reaction time improved (6wk: 567±49ms vs. 19wk: 551±51ms, p=0.002). Although between-group differences in these outcomes were not significant, we observed within-group improvements in composite cognitive function scores over the course of the entire study only in the SUPP group (Δ = 0.58±0.62, p=0.004) but not in the CON group (Δ = 0.31±0.61, p=0.06). We observed a progressive increase in n-3 index, and a concomitant decrease in the ratio of arachidonic acid (ARA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) within erythrocyte plasma membranes, in the SUPP group only. At week 19, n-3 index (r=0.49, p=0.02) and the ARA:EPA ratio (r=-0.44, p=0.03) were significantly correlated with composite cognitive function scores. Our results show that 12 weeks of RET + HIIT resulted in improved MOCA scores, word recall, and reaction time during an executive functions task; and suggest that a multi-ingredient supplement combined with this exercise training program may improve composite cognitive function scores in older men possibly via supplementation-mediated alterations to n-3 PUFA bioavailability. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02281331).</description>

	<description>Temperature-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid (thermoTRPV) channels are activated by ligands and heat, and are involved in various physiological processes. ThermoTRPV channels possess a large cytoplasmic ring consisting of N-terminal ankyrin repeat domains (ARD) and C-terminal domains (CTD). The cytoplasmic inter-protomer interface is unique and consists of a CTD coiled around a b-sheet which makes contacts with the neighboring ARD. Despite much existing evidence that the cytoplasmic ring is important for thermoTRPV function, the mechanism by which this unique structure is involved in thermoTRPV gating has not been clear. Here we present cryo-EM and electrophysiological studies which demonstrate that TRPV3 gating involves large rearrangements at the cytoplasmic inter-protomer interface and that this motion triggers coupling between cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains, priming the channel for opening. Furthermore, our studies unveil the role of this interface in the distinct biophysical and physiological properties of individual thermoTRPV subtypes.</description>

	<description>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants associated with human diseases and traits. However, the majority of GWAS-implicated variants are in non-coding regions of the genome and require in depth follow-up to identify target genes and decipher biological mechanisms. Here, rather than focusing on causal variants, we have undertaken a pooled loss-of-function screen in primary hematopoietic cells to interrogate 389 candidate genes contained in 75 loci associated with red blood cell traits. Using this approach, we identify 77 genes at 38 GWAS loci, with most loci harboring 1-2 candidate genes. Importantly, the hit set was strongly enriched for genes validated through orthogonal genetic approaches. Genes identified by this approach are enriched in specific and relevant biological pathways, allowing regulators of human erythropoiesis and modifiers of blood diseases to be defined. More generally, this functional screen provides a paradigm for gene-centric follow up of GWAS for a variety of human diseases and traits.</description>

	<description>Oligodendrocyte maturation is necessary for functional regeneration in the CNS; however, the mechanisms by which the systemic environment regulates oligodendrocyte maturation is unclear. We found that Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, which is present in higher levels in the systemic environment, promotes oligodendrocyte maturation. Oligodendrocyte maturation was enhanced by adult mouse serum treatment via TGF-β type I receptor. Decrease in circulating TGF-β1 level prevented remyelination in the spinal cord after toxin-induced demyelination. TGF-β1 administration promoted remyelination and restored neurological function in a multiple sclerosis animal model. Furthermore, TGF-β1 treatment stimulated human oligodendrocyte maturation. These data provide the therapeutic possibility of TGF-β for demyelinating diseases.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Shifts of Spatial Attention in Visual and Tactile Working Memory are Controlled by Independent Modality-Specific Mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz088</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The question whether the attentional control of working memory (WM) is shared across sensory modalities remains controversial. Here, we investigated whether attention shifts in visual and tactile WM are regulated independently. Participants memorized visual and tactile targets in a first memory sample set (S1) before encoding targets in a second sample set (S2). Importantly, visual or tactile S2 targets could appear on the same side as the corresponding S1 targets, or on opposite sides, thus, requiring shifts of spatial attention in visual or tactile WM. The activation of WM representations in modality-specific visual and somatosensory areas was tracked by recording visual and tactile contralateral delay activity (CDA/tCDA). CDA/tCDA components emerged contralateral to the side of visual or tactile S1 targets, and reversed polarity when S2 targets in the same modality appeared on the opposite side. Critically, the visual CDA was unaffected by the presence versus absence of concurrent attention shifts in tactile WM, and the tactile CDA remained insensitive to visual attention shifts. Visual and tactile WM performance was also not modulated by attention shifts in the other modality. These results show that the dynamic control of visual and tactile WM activation processes operates in an independent modality-specific fashion.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: EAT-Rice: A predictive model for flanking gene expression of T-DNA insertion activation-tagged rice mutants by machine learning approaches</title>

T-DNA activation-tagging technology is widely used to study rice gene functions. When T-DNA inserts into genome, the flanking gene expression may be altered using CaMV 35S enhancer, but the affected genes still need to be validated by biological experiment. We have developed the EAT-Rice platform to predict the flanking gene expression of T-DNA insertion site in rice mutants. The three kinds of DNA sequences including UPS1K, DISTANCE, and MIDDLE were retrieved to encode and build a forecast model of two-layer machine learning. In the first-layer models, the features nucleotide context (N-gram), cis-regulatory elements (Motif), nucleotide physicochemical properties (NPC), and CG-island (CGI) were used to build SVM models by analysing the concealed information embedded within the three kinds of sequences. Logistic regression was used to estimate the probability of gene activation which as feature-encoding weighting within first-layer model. In the second-layer models, the NaiveBayesUpdateable algorithm was used to integrate these first layer-models, and the system performance was 88.33% on 5-fold cross-validation, and 79.17% on independent-testing finally. In the three kinds of sequences, the model constructed by Middle had the best contribution to the system for identifying the activated genes. The EAT-Rice system provided better performance and gene expression prediction at further distances when compared to the TRIM database. An online server based on EAT-rice is available at http://predictor.nchu.edu.tw/EAT-Rice.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xwx9ax-Glpw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Emerging and re-emerging pathogens exhibit very complex dynamics, are hard to model and difficult to predict. Their dynamics might appear intractable. However, new statistical approaches—rooted in dynamical systems and the theory of stochastic processes—have yielded insight into the dynamics of emerging and re-emerging pathogens. We argue that these approaches may lead to new methods for predicting epidemics. This perspective views pathogen emergence and re-emergence as a “critical transition,” and uses the concept of noisy dynamic bifurcation to understand the relationship between the system observables and the distance to this transition. Because the system dynamics exhibit characteristic fluctuations in response to perturbations for a system in the vicinity of a critical point, we propose this information may be harnessed to develop early warning signals. Specifically, the motion of perturbations slows as the system approaches the transition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/49JSU4ECyaM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Testosterone or Estradiol When Implanted in the Medial Preoptic Nucleus Trigger Short Low-Amplitude Songs in Female Canaries</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0502-18.2019?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In male songbirds, the motivation to sing is largely regulated by testosterone (T) action in the medial preoptic area, whereas T acts on song control nuclei to modulate aspects of song quality. Stereotaxic implantation of T in the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) of castrated male canaries activates a high rate of singing activity, albeit with a longer latency than after systemic T treatment. Systemic T also increases the occurrence of male-like song in female canaries. We hypothesized that this effect is also mediated by T action in the POM. Females were stereotaxically implanted with either T or with 17β-estradiol (E2) targeted at the POM and their singing activity was recorded daily during 2 h for 28 d until brains were collected for histological analyses. Following identification of implant localizations, three groups of subjects were constituted that had either T or E2 implanted in the POM or had an implant that had missed the POM (Out). T and E2 in POM significantly increased the number of songs produced and the percentage of time spent singing as compared with the Out group. The songs produced were in general of a short duration and of poor quality. This effect was not associated with an increase in HVC volume as observed in males, but T in POM enhanced neurogenesis in HVC, as reflected by an increased density of doublecortin-immunoreactive (DCX-ir) multipolar neurons. These data indicate that, in female canaries, T acting in the POM plays a significant role in hormone-induced increases in the motivation to sing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Mutations and copy number variants of the CUB and Sushi multiple domains 2 (&lt;i&gt;CSMD2&lt;/i&gt;) gene are associated with neuropsychiatric disease. &lt;i&gt;CSMD2&lt;/i&gt; encodes a single-pass transmembrane protein with a large extracellular domain comprising repeats of CUB and Sushi domains. High expression of &lt;i&gt;CSMD2&lt;/i&gt; in the developing and mature brain suggests possible roles in neuron development or function, but the cellular functions of CSMD2 are not known. In this study, we show that mouse &lt;i&gt;Csmd2&lt;/i&gt; is expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the forebrain. Csmd2 protein exhibits a somatodendritic localization in the neocortex and hippocampus, with smaller puncta localizing to the neuropil. Using immunohistochemical and biochemical methods, we demonstrate that Csmd2 localizes to dendritic spines and is enriched in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Accordingly, we show that the cytoplasmic tail domain of Csmd2 interacts with synaptic scaffolding proteins of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family. The association between Csmd2 and MAGUK member PSD-95 is dependent on a PDZ-binding domain on the Csmd2 tail, which is also required for synaptic targeting of Csmd2. Finally, we show that knock-down of &lt;i&gt;Csmd2&lt;/i&gt; expression in hippocampal neuron cultures results in reduced complexity of dendritic arbors and deficits in dendritic spine density. Knock-down of &lt;i&gt;Csmd2&lt;/i&gt; in immature developing neurons results in reduced filopodia density, whereas &lt;i&gt;Csmd2&lt;/i&gt; knock-down in mature neurons causes significant reductions in dendritic spine density and dendrite complexity. Together, these results point toward a function for Csmd2 in development and maintenance of dendrites and synapses, which may account for its association with certain psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Divergent Roles of Dietary Saturated and Monounsaturated Fatty Acids on Nerve Function in Murine Models of Obesity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuropathy is the most common complication of prediabetes and diabetes and presents as distal-to-proximal loss of peripheral nerve function in the lower extremities. Neuropathy progression and disease severity in prediabetes and diabetes correlates with dyslipidemia in man and murine models of disease. Dyslipidemia is characterized by elevated levels of circulating saturated fatty acids (SFAs) that associate with the progression of neuropathy. Increased intake of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-rich diets confers metabolic health benefits; however, the impact of fatty acid saturation in neuropathy is unknown. This study examines the differential effect of SFAs and MUFAs on the development of neuropathy and the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of the complication. Male mice &lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt; fed a high-fat diet rich in SFAs developed robust peripheral neuropathy. This neuropathy was completely reversed by switching the mice from the SFA-rich high-fat diet to a MUFA-rich high-fat diet; nerve conduction velocities and intraepidermal nerve fiber density were restored. A MUFA oleate also prevented the impairment of mitochondrial transport and protected mitochondrial membrane potential in cultured sensory neurons treated with mixtures of oleate and the SFA palmitate. Moreover, oleate also preserved intracellular ATP levels, prevented apoptosis induced by palmitate treatment, and promoted lipid droplet formation in sensory neurons, suggesting that lipid droplets protect sensory neurons from lipotoxicity. Together, these results suggest that MUFAs reverse the progression of neuropathy by protecting mitochondrial function and transport through the formation of intracellular lipid droplets in sensory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; There is a global epidemic of prediabetes and diabetes, disorders that represent a continuum of metabolic disturbances in lipid and glucose metabolism. In the United States, 80 million individuals have prediabetes and 30 million have diabetes. Neuropathy is the most common complication of both disorders, carries a high morbidity, and, despite its prevalence, has no treatments. We report that dietary intervention with monounsaturated fatty acids reverses the progression of neuropathy and restores nerve function in high-fat diet-fed murine models of peripheral neuropathy. Furthermore, the addition of the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate to sensory neurons cultured under diabetic conditions shows that oleate prevents impairment of mitochondrial transport and mitochondrial dysfunction through a mechanism involving formation of axonal lipid droplets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Translocator Protein Ligand Protects against Neurodegeneration in the MPTP Mouse Model of Parkinsonism</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, after Alzheimer's disease. Parkinson's disease is a movement disorder with characteristic motor features that arise due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra. Although symptomatic treatment by the dopamine precursor levodopa and dopamine agonists can improve motor symptoms, no disease-modifying therapy exists yet. Here, we show that Emapunil (AC-5216, XBD-173), a synthetic ligand of the translocator protein 18, ameliorates degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, preserves striatal dopamine metabolism, and prevents motor dysfunction in female mice treated with the MPTP, as a model of parkinsonism. We found that Emapunil modulates the inositol requiring kinase 1α (IRE α)/X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) unfolded protein response pathway and induces a shift from pro-inflammatory toward anti-inflammatory microglia activation. Previously, Emapunil was shown to cross the blood–brain barrier and to be safe and well tolerated in a Phase II clinical trial. Therefore, our data suggest that Emapunil may be a promising approach in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our study reveals a beneficial effect of Emapunil on dopaminergic neuron survival, dopamine metabolism, and motor phenotype in the MPTP mouse model of parkinsonism. In addition, our work uncovers molecular networks which mediate neuroprotective effects of Emapunil, including microglial activation state and unfolded protein response pathways. These findings not only contribute to our understanding of biological mechanisms of translocator protein 18 (TSPO) function but also indicate that translocator protein 18 may be a promising therapeutic target. We thus propose to further validate Emapunil in other Parkinson's disease mouse models and subsequently in clinical trials to treat Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Symmetrical Viewpoint Representations in Face-Selective Regions Convey an Advantage in the Perception and Recognition of Faces</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/19/3741?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning new identities is crucial for effective social interaction. A critical aspect of this process is the integration of different images from the same face into a view-invariant representation that can be used for recognition. The representation of symmetrical viewpoints has been proposed to be a key computational step in achieving view-invariance. The aim of this study was to determine whether the representation of symmetrical viewpoints in face-selective regions is directly linked to the perception and recognition of face identity. In Experiment 1, we measured fMRI responses while male and female human participants viewed images of real faces from different viewpoints (–90, –45, 0, 45, and 90° from full-face view). Within the face regions, patterns of neural response to symmetrical views (–45 and 45° or –90 and 90°) were more similar than responses to nonsymmetrical views in the fusiform face area and superior temporal sulcus, but not in the occipital face area. In Experiment 2, participants made perceptual similarity judgements to pairs of face images. Images with symmetrical viewpoints were reported as being more similar than nonsymmetric views. In Experiment 3, we asked whether symmetrical views also convey an advantage when learning new faces. We found that recognition was best when participants were tested with novel face images that were symmetrical to the learning viewpoint. Critically, the pattern of perceptual similarity and recognition across different viewpoints predicted the pattern of neural response in face-selective regions. Together, our results provide support for the functional value of symmetry as an intermediate step in generating view-invariant representations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The recognition of identity from faces is crucial for successful social interactions. A critical step in this process is the integration of different views into a unified, view-invariant representation. The representation of symmetrical views (e.g., left profile and right profile) has been proposed as an important intermediate step in computing view-invariant representations. We found view symmetric representations were specific to some face-selective regions, but not others. We also show that these neural representations influence the perception of faces. Symmetric views were perceived to be more similar and were recognized more accurately than nonsymmetric views. Moreover, the perception and recognition of faces at different viewpoints predicted patterns of response in those face regions with view symmetric representations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Working memory is our ability to select and temporarily hold information as needed for complex cognitive operations. The temporal dynamics of sustained and transient neural activity supporting the selection and holding of memory content is not known. To address this problem, we recorded magnetoencephalography in healthy participants performing a retro-cue working memory task in which the selection rule and the memory content varied independently. Multivariate decoding and source analyses showed that selecting the memory content relies on prefrontal and parieto-occipital persistent oscillatory neural activity. By contrast, the memory content was reactivated in a distributed occipitotemporal posterior network, preceding the working memory decision and in a different format than during the visual encoding. These results identify a neural signature of content selection and characterize differentiated spatiotemporal constraints for subprocesses of working memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our brain selects and maintains information during short time windows in a way that is essential to reasoning and learning. Recent advances in multivariate analysis of brain activity allowed the characterization of brain regions that stores the memory. We applied multivariate analysis to time-resolved brain signals to characterize the spatiotemporal signature underlying these subprocesses. The selection of information relies on sustained oscillatory activity in a network that includes the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex while memory content is transiently replayed in an occipitotemporal network that differs from encoding. Our results characterized differentiated spatiotemporal activity underlying encoding, selection, and maintenance of information during working memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Olfactory Navigation and the Receptor Nonlinearity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/19/3713?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/19/3713?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The demands on a sensory system depend not only on the statistics of its inputs but also on the task. In olfactory navigation, for example, the task is to find the plume source; allocation of sensory resources may therefore be driven by aspects of the plume that are informative about source location, rather than concentration per se. Here we explore the implications of this idea for encoding odor concentration. To formalize the notion that sensory resources are limited, we considered coding strategies that partitioned the odor concentration range into a set of discriminable intervals. We developed a dynamic programming algorithm that, given the distribution of odor concentrations at several locations, determines the partitioning that conveys the most information about location. We applied this analysis to planar laser-induced fluorescence measurements of spatiotemporal odor fields with realistic advection speeds (5–20 cm/s), with or without a nearby boundary or obstacle. Across all environments, the optimal coding strategy allocated more resources (i.e., more and finer discriminable intervals) to the upper end of the concentration range than would be expected from histogram equalization, the optimal strategy if the goal were to reconstruct the plume, rather than to navigate. Finally, we show that ligand binding, as captured by the Hill equation, transforms odorant concentration into response levels in a way that approximates information maximization for navigation. This behavior occurs when the Hill dissociation constant is near the mean odor concentration, an adaptive set-point that has been observed in the olfactory system of flies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The first step of olfactory processing is receptor binding, and the resulting relationship between odorant concentration and the bound receptor fraction is a saturating one. While this Hill nonlinearity can be viewed as a distortion that is imposed by the biophysics of receptor binding, here we show that it also plays an important information-processing role in olfactory navigation. Specifically, by combining a novel dynamic-programming algorithm with physical measurements of turbulent plumes, we determine the optimal strategy for encoding odor concentration when the goal is to determine location. This strategy is distinct from histogram equalization, the strategy that maximizes information about plume concentration, and is closely approximated by the Hill nonlinearity when the binding constant is near the ambient mean.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sequential Neural Activity in Primary Motor Cortex during Sleep</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sequential firing of neurons during sleep is thought to play a role in the consolidation of learning. However, direct evidence for such sequence replay is limited to only a few brain areas and sleep states mainly in rodents. Using a custom-designed wearable neural data logger and chronically implanted electrodes, we made long-term recordings of neural activity in the primary motor cortex of two female nonhuman primates during free behavior and natural sleep. We used the local field potential (LFP) spectrogram to characterize sleep cycles, and examined firing rates, correlations, and sequential firing of neurons at different frequency bands through the cycle. Slow-wave sleep (SWS) was characterized by low neural firing rates and high synchrony, reflecting slow oscillations between cortical down and up states. However, the order in which neurons entered up states was similar to the sequence of neural activity observed at low frequencies during waking behavior. In addition, we found evidence of brief bursts of theta oscillation, associated with non-SWS states, during which neurons fired in strikingly regular sequential order phase-locked to the LFP. Theta sequences were preserved between waking and sleep, but appeared not to resemble the order of neural activity observed at lower frequencies. The sequential firing of neurons during slow oscillations and theta bursts may contribute to the consolidation of procedural memories during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Replay of sequential neural activity during sleep is believed to support consolidation of daytime learning. Despite a wealth of studies investigating sequential replay in association with episodic and spatial memory, it is unknown whether similar sequences occur in motor areas during sleep. Within long-term neural recordings from monkey motor cortex, we found two distinct patterns of sequential activity during different phases of the natural sleep cycle. Slow-wave sleep was associated with delta-band sequences that resembled low-frequency activity during movement, while occasional brief bursts of theta oscillation were associated with a different order of sequential firing. Our results are the first report of sequential sleep replay in the motor cortex, which may play an important role in consolidation of procedural learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learned behavioral responses to sounds depend largely on the expected outcomes associated with each potential choice. Where and how the nervous system integrates expectations about reward with auditory sensory information to drive appropriate decisions is not fully understood. Using a two-alternative choice task in which the expected reward associated with each sound varied over time, we investigated potential sites along the corticostriatal pathway for the integration of sound signals, behavioral choice, and reward information in male mice. We found that auditory cortical neurons encode not only sound identity, but also the animal's choice and the expected size of reward. This influence of reward expectation on sound- and choice-related activity was further enhanced in the major striatal target of the auditory cortex: the posterior tail of the dorsal striatum. These results indicate that choice-specific information is integrated with reward signals throughout the corticostriatal pathway, potentially contributing to adaptation in sound-driven behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Learning and maintenance of sensory-motor associations require that neural circuits keep track of sensory stimuli, choices, and outcomes. It is not clear at what stages along the auditory sensorimotor pathway these signals are integrated to influence future behavior in response to sounds. Our results show that the activity of auditory cortical neurons and of their striatal targets encodes the animals' choices and expectation of reward, in addition to stimulus identity. These results challenge previous views of the influence of motor signals on auditory circuits and identifies potential loci for integration of task-related information necessary for updating auditory decisions in changing environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Resting-State Neural Firing Rate Is Linked to Cardiac-Cycle Duration in the Human Cingulate and Parahippocampal Cortices</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stimulation and functional imaging studies have revealed the existence of a large network of cortical regions involved in the regulation of heart rate. However, very little is known about the link between cortical neural firing and cardiac-cycle duration (CCD). Here, we analyze single-unit and multiunit data obtained in humans at rest, and show that firing rate covaries with CCD in 16.7% of the sample (25 of 150). The link between firing rate and CCD was most prevalent in the anterior medial temporal lobe (entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, anterior hippocampus, and amygdala), where 36% (18 of 50) of the units show the effect, and to a lesser extent in the mid-to-anterior cingulate cortex (11.1%, 5 of 45). The variance in firing rate explained by CCD ranged from 0.5 to 11%. Several lines of analysis indicate that neural firing influences CCD, rather than the other way around, and that neural firing affects CCD through vagally mediated mechanisms in most cases. These results show that part of the spontaneous fluctuations in firing rate can be attributed to the cortical control of the cardiac cycle. The fine tuning of the regulation of CCD represents a novel physiological factor accounting for spontaneous variance in firing rate. It remains to be determined whether the &quot;noise&quot; introduced in firing rate by the regulation of CCD is detrimental or beneficial to the cognitive information processing carried out in the parahippocampal and cingulate regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Fluctuations in heart rate are known to be under the control of cortical structures, but spontaneous fluctuations in cortical firing rate, or &quot;noise,&quot; have seldom been related to heart rate. Here, we analyze unit activity in humans at rest and show that spontaneous fluctuations in neural firing in the medial temporal lobe, as well as in the mid-to-anterior cingulate cortex, influence heart rate. This phenomenon was particularly pronounced in the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, where it could be observed in one of three neurons. Our results show that part of spontaneous firing rate variability in regions best known for their cognitive role in spatial navigation and memory corresponds to precise physiological regulations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multisensory Neurons in the Primate Amygdala</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/19/3663?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animals identify, interpret, and respond to complex, natural signals that are often multisensory. The ability to integrate signals across sensory modalities depends on the convergence of sensory inputs at the level of single neurons. Neurons in the amygdala are expected to be multisensory because they respond to complex, natural stimuli, and the amygdala receives inputs from multiple sensory areas. We recorded activity from the amygdala of 2 male monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) in response to visual, tactile, and auditory stimuli. Although the stimuli were devoid of inherent emotional or social significance and were not paired with rewards or punishments, the majority of neurons that responded to these stimuli were multisensory. Selectivity for sensory modality was stronger and emerged earlier than selectivity for individual items within a sensory modality. Modality and item selectivity were expressed via three main spike-train metrics: (1) response magnitude, (2) response polarity, and (3) response duration. None of these metrics were unique to a particular sensory modality; rather, each neuron responded with distinct combinations of spike-train metrics to discriminate sensory modalities and items within a modality. The relative proportion of multisensory neurons was similar across the nuclei of the amygdala. The convergence of inputs of multiple sensory modalities at the level of single neurons in the amygdala rests at the foundation for multisensory integration. The integration of visual, auditory, and tactile inputs in the amygdala may serve social communication by binding together social signals carried by facial expressions, vocalizations, and social grooming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our brain continuously decodes information detected by multiple sensory systems. The emotional and social significance of the incoming signals is likely extracted by the amygdala, which receives input from all sensory domains. Here we show that a large portion of neurons in the amygdala respond to stimuli from two or more sensory modalities. The convergence of visual, tactile, and auditory signals at the level of individual neurons in the amygdala establishes a foundation for multisensory integration within this structure. The ability to integrate signals across sensory modalities is critical for social communication and other high-level cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Burst Firing and Spatial Coding in Subicular Principal Cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The subiculum is the major output structure of the hippocampal formation and is involved in learning and memory as well as in spatial navigation. Little is known about how neuronal diversity contributes to function in the subiculum. Previously, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies have identified distinct bursting patterns in the subiculum. Here, we asked how burst firing is related to spatial coding &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Using juxtacellular recordings in freely moving male rats, we studied the bursting behavior of 102 subicular principal neurons and distinguished two populations: sparsely bursting (~80%) and dominantly bursting neurons (~20%). These bursting behaviors were not linked to anatomy: both cell types were found all along the proximodistal and radial axes of the subiculum and all identified cells were pyramidal neurons. However, the distinct burst firing patterns were related to functional differences: the activity of sparsely bursting cells showed a stronger spatial modulation than the activity of dominantly bursting neurons. In addition, all cells classified as boundary cells were sparsely bursting cells. In most sparsely bursting cells, bursts defined sharper firing fields and carried more spatial information than isolated spikes. We conclude that burst firing is functionally relevant to subicular spatially tuned neurons, possibly by serving as a mechanism to transmit spatial information to downstream structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The subiculum is the major output structure of the hippocampal formation and is involved in spatial navigation. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, subicular cells can be distinguished by their ability to initiate bursts as brief sequences of spikes fired at high frequencies. Little is known about the relationship between cellular diversity and spatial coding in the subiculum. We performed high-resolution juxtacellular recordings in freely moving rats and found that bursting behavior predicts functional differences between subicular neurons. Specifically, sparsely bursting cells have lower firing rates and carry more spatial information than dominantly bursting cells. Additionally, bursts fired by sparsely bursting cells encoded spatial information better than isolated spikes, indicating that bursts act as a unit of information dedicated to spatial coding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Resting-State Functional MR Imaging and Spectroscopy Study of the Dorsal Hippocampus in the Chronic Unpredictable Stress Rat Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to chronic stress leads to an array of anatomical, functional, and metabolic changes in the brain that play a key role in triggering psychiatric disorders such as depression. The hippocampus is particularly well known as a target of maladaptive responses to stress. To capture stress-induced changes in metabolic and functional connectivity in the hippocampus, stress-resistant (low-responders) or -susceptible (high-responders) rats exposed to a chronic unpredictable stress paradigm (categorized according to their hormonal and behavioral responses) were assessed by multimodal neuroimaging; the latter was achieved by using localized &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H MR spectroscopy and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) at 11,7T data from stressed (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 25) but also control (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15) male Wistar rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susceptible animals displayed increased GABA–glutamine (+19%) and glutamate–glutamine (+17%) ratios and decreased levels of macromolecules (–11%); these changes were positively correlated with plasma corticosterone levels. In addition, the neurotransmitter levels showed differential associations with functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the amygdala, the piriform cortex and thalamus between stress-resistant and -susceptible animals. Our observations are consistent with previously reported stress-induced metabolomic changes that suggest overall neurotransmitter dysfunction in the hippocampus. Their association with the fMRI data in this study reveals how local adjustments in neurochemistry relate to changes in the neurocircuitry of the hippocampus, with implications for its stress-associated dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Chronic stress disrupts brain homeostasis, which may increase the vulnerability of susceptible individuals to neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression. Characterization of the differences between stress-resistant and -susceptible individuals on the basis of noninvasive imaging tools, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contributes to improved understanding of the mechanisms underpinning individual differences in vulnerability and can facilitate the design of new diagnostic and intervention strategies. Using a combined functional MRI/MRS approach, our results demonstrate that susceptible- and non-susceptible subjects show differential alterations in hippocampal GABA and glutamate metabolism that, in turn, associate with changes in functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Human Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex: Sulcal Morphology and Its Influence on Functional Organization</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which comprises several distinct cytoarchitectonic areas, is a key brain region supporting decision-making processes, and it has been shown to be one of the main hubs of the Default Mode Network, a network classically activated during resting state. We here examined the interindividual variability in the vmPFC sulcal morphology in 57 humans (37 females) and demonstrated that the presence/absence of the inferior rostral sulcus and the subgenual intralimbic sulcus influences significantly the sulcal organization of this region. Furthermore, the sulcal organization influences the location of the vmPFC peak of the Default Mode Network, demonstrating that the location of functional activity can be affected by local sulcal patterns. These results are critical for the investigation of the function of the vmPFC and show that taking into account the sulcal variability might be essential to guide the interpretation of neuroimaging studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is one of the main hubs of the Default Mode Network and plays a central role in value coding and decision-making. The present study provides a complete description of the interindividual variability of anatomical morphology of this large portion of prefrontal cortex and its relation to functional organization. We have shown that two supplementary medial sulci predominantly determine the organization of the vmPFC, which in turn affects the location of the functional peak of activity in this region. Those results show that taking into account the variability in sulcal patterns might be essential to guide the interpretation of neuroimaging studies of the human brain and of the vmPFC in particular.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Tonic Activation of GluN2C/GluN2D-Containing NMDA Receptors by Ambient Glutamate Facilitates Cortical Interneuron Maturation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Developing cortical GABAergic interneurons rely on genetic programs, neuronal activity, and environmental cues to construct inhibitory circuits during early postnatal development. Disruption of these events can cause long-term changes in cortical inhibition and may be involved in neurological disorders associated with inhibitory circuit dysfunction. We hypothesized that tonic glutamate signaling in the neonatal cortex contributes to, and is necessary for, the maturation of cortical interneurons. To test this hypothesis, we used mice of both sexes to quantify extracellular glutamate concentrations in the cortex during development, measure ambient glutamate-mediated activation of developing cortical interneurons, and manipulate tonic glutamate signaling using subtype-specific NMDA receptor antagonists &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We report that ambient glutamate levels are high (100 nm) in the neonatal cortex and decrease (to 50 nm) during the first weeks of life, coincident with increases in astrocytic glutamate uptake. Consistent with elevated ambient glutamate, putative parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the cortex (identified using &lt;i&gt;G42:GAD1-eGFP&lt;/i&gt; reporter mice) exhibit a transient, tonic NMDA current at the end of the first postnatal week. GluN2C/GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors mediate the majority of this current and contribute to the resting membrane potential and intrinsic properties of developing putative parvalbumin interneurons. Pharmacological blockade of GluN2C/GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; during the period of tonic interneuron activation, but not later, leads to lasting decreases in interneuron morphological complexity and causes deficits in cortical inhibition later in life. These results demonstrate that dynamic ambient glutamate signaling contributes to cortical interneuron maturation via tonic activation of GluN2C/GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Inhibitory GABAergic interneurons make up 20% of cortical neurons and are critical to controlling cortical network activity. Dysfunction of cortical inhibition is associated with multiple neurological disorders, including epilepsy. Establishing inhibitory cortical networks requires &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; proliferation, differentiation, and migration of immature GABAergic interneurons, and subsequent postnatal morphological maturation and circuit integration. Here, we demonstrate that ambient glutamate provides tonic activation of immature, putative parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons in the neonatal cortex via high-affinity NMDA receptors. When this activation is blocked, GABAergic interneuron maturation is disrupted, and cortical networks exhibit lasting abnormal hyperexcitability. We conclude that temporally precise activation of developing cortical interneurons by ambient glutamate is critically important for establishing normal cortical inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: GIRK Channel Activity in Dopamine Neurons of the Ventral Tegmental Area Bidirectionally Regulates Behavioral Sensitivity to Cocaine</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/19/3600?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine (DA) neurons of the VTA have been widely implicated in the cellular and behavioral responses to drugs of abuse. Inhibitory G protein signaling mediated by GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; DA receptors (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) regulates the excitability of VTA DA neurons, DA neurotransmission, and behaviors modulated by DA. Most of the somatodendritic inhibitory effect of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R activation on DA neurons reflects the activation of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (GIRK) channels. Furthermore, GIRK-dependent signaling in VTA DA neurons can be weakened by exposure to psychostimulants and strengthened by phasic DA neuron firing. The objective of this study was to determine how the strength of GIRK channel activity in VTA DA neurons influences sensitivity to cocaine. We used a Cre-dependent viral strategy to overexpress the individual GIRK channel subunits in VTA DA neurons of male and female adult mice, leading to enhancement (GIRK2) or suppression (GIRK3) of GIRK channel activity. Overexpression of GIRK3 decreased somatodendritic GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R- and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R-dependent signaling and increased cocaine-induced locomotor activity, whereas overexpression of GIRK2 increased GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R-dependent signaling and decreased cocaine-induced locomotion. Neither manipulation impacted anxiety- or depression-related behavior, despite the link between such behaviors and DA signaling. Together, these data show that behavioral sensitivity to cocaine in mice is inversely proportional to the strength of GIRK channel activity in VTA DA neurons and suggest that direct activators of the unique VTA DA neuron GIRK channel subtype (GIRK2/GIRK3 heteromer) could represent a promising therapeutic target for treatment of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Inhibitory G protein signaling in dopamine (DA) neurons, including that mediated by G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (GIRK) channels, has been implicated in behavioral sensitivity to cocaine. Here, we used a viral approach to bidirectionally manipulate GIRK channel activity in DA neurons of the VTA. We found that decreasing GIRK channel activity in VTA DA neurons increased behavioral sensitivity to cocaine, whereas increasing GIRK channel activity decreased behavioral sensitivity to cocaine. These manipulations did not alter anxiety- or depression-related behaviors. These data highlight the unique GIRK channel subtype in VTA DA neurons as a possible therapeutic target for addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Genetic risk of dementia risk mitigated by cognitive reserve: a cohort study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25501?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25501?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated if cognitive reserve modifies the risk of dementia attributable to Apolipoprotein‐ε4 (&lt;i&gt;APOE‐&lt;/i&gt;ε4), a well‐known genetic risk factor for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed 2556 cognitively intact participants aged ≥60 years from the ongoing prospective community‐based Swedish National Study on Aging and Care Kungsholmen (SNAC‐K). Dementia was ascertained through clinical and neuropsychological assessments and diagnosed according to DSM‐IV criteria. Structural equation modelling was used to generate a cognitive reserve indicator from four previously validated contributors: early‐life education, mid‐life substantive work complexity, late‐life leisure activities, and late‐life social networks. Cox proportional hazard models estimated dementia risk in relation to cognitive reserve indicator. The interaction between the cognitive reserve indicator and &lt;i&gt;APOE‐&lt;/i&gt;ε4 was assessed on multiplicative and additive scales.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an average of 6.3 years (range 2.1‐10.7 years) of follow‐up, 232 dementia cases were ascertained. Relative to individuals in the lowest tertile of cognitive reserve indicator, those with moderate and high reserve were at a reduced risk of dementia. There was no multiplicative interaction between &lt;i&gt;APOE‐&lt;/i&gt;ε4 status and cognitive reserve indicator (p=0.113). Additive interaction was statistically significant. Relative to &lt;i&gt;APOE‐&lt;/i&gt;ε4 carriers with low cognitive reserve, ε4‐carriers with high reserve had a reduced risk of dementia (HR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.13‐0.59). The magnitude of risk reduction was similar in ε4‐noncarriers with a high cognitive reserve indicator (HR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.15‐0.40).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifelong engagement in reserve‐enhancing activities attenuates the risk of dementia attributable to &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;‐ε4. Promoting cognitive reserve might be especially effective in subpopulations with high genetic risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory suggests that the brain uses a
'neocortical' and a 'hippocampal' learning system to achieve complex behavior.
These two systems are complementary in that the 'neocortical' system relies on
slow learning of distributed representations while the 'hippocampal' system
relies on fast learning of pattern-separated representations. Both of these
systems project to the striatum, which is a key neural structure in the brain's
implementation of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Current deep RL approaches share
similarities with a 'neocortical' system because they slowly learn distributed
representations through backpropagation in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). An
ongoing criticism of such approaches is that they are data inefficient and lack
flexibility. CLS theory suggests that the addition of a 'hippocampal' system
could address these criticisms. In the present study we propose a novel
algorithm known as Complementary Temporal Difference Learning (CTDL), which
combines a DNN with a Self-Organising Map (SOM) to obtain the benefits of both
a 'neocortical' and a 'hippocampal' system. Key features of CTDL include the
use of Temporal Difference (TD) error to update a SOM and the combination of a
SOM and DNN to calculate action values. We evaluate CTDL on grid worlds and the
Cart-Pole environment, and show several benefits over the classic Deep
Q-Network (DQN) approach. These results demonstrate (1) the utility of
complementary learning systems for the evaluation of actions, (2) that the TD
error signal is a useful form of communication between the two systems and (3)
the biological plausibility of the proposed approach.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inter-personal touch is a powerful aspect of social interaction that we
expect to be particularly important for emotional communication. We studied the
capacity of closely acquainted humans to signal the meaning of several word
cues (e.g. gratitude, sadness) using touch sensation alone. Participants
communicated all cues with above chance performance. We show that emotionally
close people can accurately signal the meaning of different words through
touch, and that performance is affected by the amount of contextual information
available. Even with minimal context and feedback, both attention-getting and
love were communicated surprisingly well. Neither the type of close
relationship, nor self-reported comfort with touch significantly affected
performance.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Abnormal cortical folding patterns may be related to neurodevelopmental
disorders such as lissencephaly and polymicrogyria. In this context,
computational modeling is a powerful tool to provide a better understanding of
the early brain folding process. Recent studies based on biomechanical modeling
have shown that mechanical forces play a crucial role in the formation of
cortical convolutions. However, the correlation between simulation results and
biological facts, and the effect of physical parameters in these models remain
unclear. In this paper, we propose a new brain longitudinal length growth model
to improve brain model growth. In addition, we investigate the effect of the
initial cortical thickness on folding patterns, quantifying the folds by the
surface-based three-dimensional gyrification index and a spectral analysis of
gyrification. The results tend to show that the use of such biomechanical
models could highlight the links between neurodevelopmental diseases and
physical parameters.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain as a neuronal system has very complex structure with large
diversity of neuronal types. The most basic complexity is seen from the
structure of neuronal morphology, which usually has a complex tree-like
structure with dendritic spines distributed in branches. For simulating a
large-scale network with spiking neurons, the simple point neuron, such as
integrate-and-fire neuron, is often used. However, recent experimental evidence
suggests that the computational ability of a single neuron is largely enhanced
by its morphological structure, in particular, by various types of dendritic
dynamics. As morphology reduction of detailed biophysical models is one of
classic questions for systems neuroscience, much effort has been taken to
simulate a neuron with a few compartments to include the interaction between
soma and dendritic spines. Yet, novel reduction methods are still needed to
deal with complex dendritic tree. Here by using ten individual Purkinje cells
of the cerebellum from three species of guinea-pig, mouse and rat, we consider
four types of reduction methods and study their effects on the coding capacity
of Purkinje cells in terms of firing rate, timing coding, spiking pattern, and
modulated firing under different stimulation protocols. We find that there is a
variation of reduction performance depending on individual cells and species,
however, all reduction methods can preserve, to some degree, firing activity of
the full model of Purkinje cell. Therefore, when stimulating large-scale
network of neurons, one has to choose a proper type of reduced neuronal model
depending on the questions addressed.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The recent success of brain-inspired deep neural networks (DNNs) in solving
complex, high-level visual tasks has led to rising expectations for their
potential to match the human visual system. However, DNNs exhibit
idiosyncrasies that suggest their visual representation and processing might be
substantially different from human vision. One limitation of DNNs is that they
are vulnerable to adversarial examples, input images on which subtle, carefully
designed noises are added to fool a machine classifier. The robustness of the
human visual system against adversarial examples is potentially of great
importance as it could uncover a key mechanistic feature that machine vision is
yet to incorporate. In this study, we compare the visual representations of
white- and black-box adversarial examples in DNNs and humans by leveraging
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We find a small but significant
difference in representation patterns for different (i.e. white- versus black-
box) types of adversarial examples for both humans and DNNs. However, human
performance on categorical judgment is not degraded by noise regardless of the
type unlike DNN. These results suggest that adversarial examples may be
differentially represented in the human visual system, but unable to affect the
perceptual experience.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Between 1 to 5 out of 100 people worldwide has never experienced normotypic
vision due to a condition called amblyopia, and about 1 out of 4000 suffer from
inherited retinal dystrophies that progressively lead them to blindness. While
a wide range of technologies and therapies are being developed to restore
vision, a fundamental question still remains unanswered: would the adult visual
brain retain a sufficient plastic potential to learn how to see after a
prolonged period of abnormal visual experience? In this review we summarize
studies showing that the visual brain of sighted adults retains a type of
developmental plasticity, called homeostatic plasticity, and this property has
been recently exploited successfully for adult amblyopia recover. Next, we
discuss how the brain circuits reorganizes when visual stimulation is partially
restored by means of a bionic eye in late blinds with Retinitis Pigmentosa. The
primary visual cortex in these patients slowly became activated by the
artificial visual stimulation, indicating that sight restoration therapies can
rely on a considerable degree of spared plasticity in adulthood.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Free recall of random lists of words is a standard paradigm used to probe
human memory. We proposed an associative search process that can be reduced to
a deterministic walk on random graphs defined by the structure of memory
representations. This model makes a parameter-free prediction for the average
number of memory items recalled ($RC$) out of $M$ items in memory: $RC =
\sqrt{3\pi M/2}$. This prediction was verified in a large-scale crowd-sourced
free recall and recognition experiment. We uncovered a novel law of memory
recall, indicating that recall operates according to a stereotyped search
process common to all people.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Domain-specific languages (DSLs) play an increasingly important role in the
generation of high performing software. They allow the user to exploit specific
knowledge encoded in the constructs for the generation of code adapted to a
particular hardware architecture; at the same time, they make it easier to
generate optimized code for a multitude of platforms as the transformation has
to be encoded only once. Here, we describe a new code generation framework
(NMODL) for an existing DSL in the NEURON framework, a widely used software for
massively parallel simulation of biophysically detailed brain tissue models.
Existing NMODL DSL transpilers lack either essential features to generate
optimized code or capability to parse the diversity of existing models in the
user community. Our NMODL framework has been tested against a large number of
previously published user models and offers high-level domain-specific
optimizations and symbolic algebraic simplifications before target code
generation. Furthermore, rich analysis tools are provided allowing the
scientist to introspect models. NMODL implements multiple SIMD and SPMD targets
optimized for modern hardware. Benchmarks were performed on Intel Skylake,
Intel KNL and AMD Naples platforms. When comparing NMODL-generated kernels with
NEURON we observe a speedup of up to 20x, resulting into overall speedups of
two different production simulations by $\sim$10x. When compared to a
previously published SIMD optimized version that heavily relied on
auto-vectorization by the compiler still a speedup of up to $\sim$2x is
observed.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Coherence of Visual-Evoked Gamma Oscillations Is Disrupted by Propofol but Preserved Under Equipotent Doses of Isoflurane</title>

	<description>Previous research demonstrates that the underlying state of the brain influences how sensory stimuli are processed. Canonically, the state of the brain has been defined by quantifying the spectral characteristics of spontaneous fluctuations in local field potentials (LFP). Here, we utilized isoflurane and propofol anesthesia to parametrically alter the spectral state of the murine brain. With either drug, we produce slow wave delta dominant (1- 4Hz) activity, with low anesthetic doses, or burst suppression, with higher doses. We find that while spontaneous LFP oscillations were similar, the average visual-evoked potential (VEP) was always smaller in amplitude and shorter in duration under propofol than under comparable doses of isoflurane. This diminished average VEP results from increased trial-to-trial variability in VEPs under propofol.  One feature of single trial VEPs that was consistent in all animals was visual-evoked gamma band oscillation (20-60Hz). This gamma band oscillation was coherent between trials in the early phase (&amp;lt;250 ms) of the visual evoked potential under isoflurane. Inter trial phase coherence (ITPC) of gamma oscillations was dramatically attenuated in the same propofol anesthetized mice despite similar spontaneous oscillations in the LFP. This suggests that while both anesthetics lead to loss of consciousness, elicit slow oscillations and burst suppression, only the isoflurane permits phase resetting of gamma oscillations by visual stimuli. These results demonstrate that accurate characterization of a brain state must include both spontaneous as well as stimulus-induced perturbations of brain activity.</description>

	<description>The well documented precision of the cerebellar sagittal organization is commonly used to compose a comprehensive view on principles of cerebellar function. However, the physiological manifestation of this organization is either limited to information derived from single unit recordings or from imaging of a small group of closely located neurons. Here we used large scale imaging to monitor calcium concentration changes in the entire vermal area of folia V and VI in anesthetize mice. We found that the response to a strong auditory input or electrical shock to the tail area is composed of an early and a late component that differ in their spatiotemporal properties. The early component occurs throughout the scanned area whereas the late component reflects synchronous activation of Purkinje cells located along symmetric parasagittal bands that correspond well to sagittal band 2+ (Sugihara and Shinoda, 2004).  Similar organization was found in the rigorously disorganized cerebellum of Cxcr4 KO mice, suggesting that the sagittal organization is determined by the climbing fibers input to the cerebellar cortex. The responses for both stimuli are followed by prolonged recovery period but the rate of recovery from auditory stimulus is much longer reflecting different site of adapting process. We suggest that these sensory inputs, which are commonly used to evoke startle response, activate two sets of climbing fiber inputs that differ in their spatiotemporal properties and contribute to the motor organization and habituation of the startle response.</description>

	<description>Major depressive disorder is a debilitating condition that affects approximately 15 % of the U.S. population.  Though the neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie this disorder are not completely understood, both human and rodent studies suggest that excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance is reduced with the depressive phenotype. In contrast, antidepressant efficacy in responsive individuals correlates with increased excitatory neurotransmission in select brain regions, suggesting that the restoration of E/I balance may improve mood.
Enhanced excitatory transmission can occur through mechanisms including increased dendritic arborization and synapse formation in pyramidal neurons. Reduced activity of inhibitory neurons may also contribute to antidepressant efficacy.  Consistent with this possibility, the fast-acting antidepressant ketamine may act by selective inhibition of glutamatergic input to GABA releasing parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons. Recent work has also shown that a negative allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor  subunit can improve depression-related behavior. PV-expressing interneurons are thought to represent critical pacemakers for synchronous network events. These neurons also represent the predominant GABAergic neuronal population that is enveloped by the perineuronal net (PNN), a lattice-like structure that is thought to stabilize glutamatergic input to this cell type. Disruption of the PNN reduces PV excitability and increases pyramidal cell excitability. 
Various antidepressant medications increase the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that can increase pyramidal cell dendritic arborization and spine formation. MMPs can also cleave PNN proteins to reduce PV neuron-mediated inhibition. The present review will focus on mechanisms that may underlie antidepressant efficacy, with a focus on monoamines as facilitators of increased matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression and activation. Discussion will include MMP-dependent effects on pyramidal cell structure and function, as well as MMP-dependent effects on PV expressing interneurons. We conclude with discussion of antidepressant use for those at risk for Alzheimer’s disease, and we also highlight areas for further study.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Overexpression of CX3CR1 in Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Promotes Cell Migration and Functional Recovery After Experimental Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>

	<description>Stem cell therapy has emerged as a new promising therapeutic strategy for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, the efficiency of stem cell therapy is partially limited by low retention and engraftment of the delivered cells. Therefore, it’s necessary to improve the migration ability of stem cells to the injured area in order to save the costs and duration of cell preparation. This study aimed to investigate whether overexpression of CX3CR1, the specific receptor of chemokine fractalkine (FKN), in adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) can stimulate the cell migration to the injured area in the brain, improve functional recovery and protect against cell death following experimental ICH. ADSCs were isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissues of rats. ICH was induced by means of an injection of collagenase type VII. ELISA showed that the expression levels of fractalkine/FKN were increased at early time points, with a peak at day 3 after ICH. And it was found that different passages of ADSCs could express the chemokine receptor CX3CR1. Besides, the chemotactic movements of ADSCs towards fractalkine have been verified by transwell migration assay. ADSCs overexpressing CX3CR1 were established through lentivirus transfection. We found that after overexpression of CX3CR1 receptor, the migration ability of ADSCs was increased both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, reduced cell death and improved sensory and motor functions were seen in the mice ICH model. Thus, ADSCs overexpression CX3CR1 might be taken as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ICH.</description>

	<description>The recent recognition that Alzheimer disease-like pathology may be found in  chronic traumatic encephalopathy even after mild acute traumatic brain injury has increased the urgency of elucidating mechanisms, identifying biomarkers predictive of high risk of development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and establishing biomarker profiles indicative of impactful effects of treatments. Of the many proteins that are loaded into neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs) from damaged neurons after acute traumatic brain injury, the levels of prion cellular protein, coagulation factor XIII, synaptogyrin-3, IL-6 and aquaporins remain elevated for months. Prolonged heightened expression of aquaporins and IL-6 may account for the persistent CNS edema and inflammation of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Prion cellular protein, coagulation factor XIII and synaptogyrin-3 bind and concentrate neurotoxic forms of oligomeric Aβ peptide or P-tau for delivery to neurons at or distant from the site of trauma. Our progression factor hypothesis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy asserts that physiological neuronal proteins, such as prion cellular protein, coagulation factor XIII, synaptogyrin-3, IL-6 and aquaporins, that increase in concentration in neurons and NDEs for months after acute traumatic brain injury, are etiological contributors to chronic traumatic encephalopathy by either direct actions or by mobilizing neurotoxic forms of Aβ peptides or P-tau. Such progression factors also may be useful new targets for development of drugs to prevent chronic traumatic encephalopathy.</description>

	<description>Recent neuroimaging studies have indicated that abnormalities in brain structure and function may play an important role in the etiology of lifelong premature ejaculation (LPE). LPE patients have exhibited aberrant cortical structure, altered brain network function and abnormal brain activation in response to erotic pictures. However, it remains unclear whether resting-state whole brain functional connectivity (FC) is altered in LPE patients. Machine learning analysis has the advantage of screening the best classification features from high-throughput data (such as FC), which has the potential to identify the pathophysiological targets of disease by establishing classification indicators for patients and healthy controls (HCs). Therefore, the supported vector machine based classification model using FC as features was used in the present study to confirm the most specific FCs that distinguish LPE patients from healthy controls. After feature selection, the remained features were used to build the classification model, with an accuracy 0.85 ± 0.14, sensitivity of 0.92 ± 0.18, specificity of 0.72 ± 0.30, and recall index of 0.85 ± 0.17 across 1000 testing groups (100 times 10-folds cross validation). After that, two-sample t tests with family-wise error correction were used to compare these features that occurring more than 500 times during training steps between LPE patients and HCs. Four FCs, 1) between left medial part of orbital frontal cortex (mOFC) and right mOFC, 2) between the left rectus and right post-central gyrus, 3) between the right insula and left pallidum and 4) between the right middle part of temporal pole and right inferior part of temporal gyrus showed significant group difference. These results demonstrate that resting-state brain FC might be a discriminating feathers to distinguish LPE patients from HCs. These classification features, especially the FC between bilateral mOFC, provide underlying abnormal central functional targets in LPE etiology, which offers a novel alternative target for future intervention in LPE treatment.</description>

	<description>EEG recordings are generally affected by interference from physiological and non physiological sources which may obscure underlying brain activity and hinder effective EEG analysis. In particular, cardiac interference can be caused by the electrical activity of the heart and/or cardiovascular activity related to blood flow. Successful EEG application in sports science settings requires a method for artifact removal that is automatic and flexible enough to be applied in a variety of acquisition conditions without requiring simultaneous ECG recordings that could restrict movement.

We developed an automatic method for classifying and removing both electrical cardiac and cardiovascular artifacts (ARCI) that does not require additional ECG recording. Our method employs independent component analysis (ICA) to isolate data independent components (ICs) and identifies the artifactual ICs by evaluating specific IC features in the time and frequency domains. We applied ARCI to EEG datasets with cued artifacts and acquired during an eyes-closed condition. Data were recorded using a standard EEG wet cap with either 128 or 64 electrodes and using a novel dry electrode cap with either 97 or 64 dry electrodes. All data were decomposed into different numbers of components to evaluate the effect of ICA decomposition level on effective cardiac artifact detection. ARCI performance was evaluated by comparing automatic ICs classifications with classifications performed by experienced investigators. Automatic and investigator classifications were highly consistent resulting in an overall accuracy greater than 99% in all datasets and decomposition levels, and an average sensitivity greater than 90%. Best results were attained when data were decomposed into a fewer number of components where the method achieved perfect sensitivity (100%). Performance was also evaluated by comparing automatic component classification with externally recorded ECG. Results showed that ICs automatically classified as artifactual were significantly correlated with ECG activity whereas the other ICs were not. We also assessed that the interference affecting EEG signals was reduced by more than 82% after automatic artifact removal.

Overall, ARCI represents a significant step in the detection and removal of cardiac-related EEG artifacts and can be applied in a variety of acquisition settings making it ideal for sports science applications.</description>

	<description>Developing technologies for coupling neural activity and artificial neural components, is key for advancing neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics. We present a biohybrid experimental setting, where the activity of a biological neural network is coupled to a biomimetic hardware network. The implementation of the hardware network (denoted NeuroSoC) exhibits complex dynamics with a multiplicity of time-scales, emulating 2880 neurons and 12.7M synapses, designed on a VLSI chip. This network is coupled to a neural network in-vitro, where the activities of both the biological and the hardware networks can be recorded, processed and integrated bidirectionally in real-time. This experimental setup enables an adjustable and well-monitored coupling, while at the same time providing access to the key functional features of neural networks. We demonstrate the feasibility to functionally couple the two networks and of implementing control circuits to modify the biohybrid activity. Overall, we provide an experimental model for neuromorphic-neural interfaces, hopefully to advance the capability to interface with neural activity, and with its irregularities in pathology</description>

	<description>Electrical stimulation of the cervical vagus nerve is an emerging treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, cervical vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) can produce unwanted side effects. Here, we investigated whether stimulating the vagus nerve closer to the end organ has fewer off-target effects, while reducing intestinal inflammation. An electrode array was developed to stimulate and record vagal neural responses in rats. Acute VNS off-target experiment: The cervical and abdominal vagus nerves of anaesthetised rats (n=5) were acutely implanted with an electrode array, stimulation delivered (10 Hz; symmetric biphasic current pulse; 320 nC per phase) and changes to heart rate, respiration and blood pressure assessed. Chronic VNS efficacy experiment: The abdominal vagus nerve was chronically implanted with an electrode array. After 2 weeks, the intestine was inflamed with TNBS (2.5% 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid), an established method for rodent models of IBD. Rats were randomly selected to receive therapeutic VNS (n=7; 10 Hz; symmetric biphasic current pulse; 320 nC per phase; 3 hours/day) or no stimulation (n=8) for 5 days. Stool quality, C-reactive protein in blood and histology of the inflamed intestine were assessed. VNS off-target experiment: Abdominal VNS had no effect (two-way RM-ANOVA: P&amp;gt;0.05) on cardiac, respiratory and blood pressure parameters. However, during cervical VNS heart rate decreased by 31 ± 9 beats/minute (P&amp;gt;0.05), respiration was inhibited and blood pressure decreased. VNS efficacy experiment: During the implantation period, electrically-evoked neural response thresholds remained stable (one-way RM ANOVA: P&amp;gt;0.05), and were below stimulation levels. VNS rats, compared to unstimulated rats, had improved stool quality (two-way RM ANOVA: P&amp;lt;0.0001), no blood in faeces (P&amp;lt;0.0001), reduced plasma C-reactive protein (two-way RM ANOVA: P&amp;lt;0.05) and a reduction in resident inflammatory cell populations within the intestine (Kruskal-Wallis: P&amp;lt;0.05). Abdominal VNS did not evoke off-target effects, is an effective treatment of TNBS-induced inflammation, and may be an effective treatment of IBD in humans.</description>

	<description>F-wave test allows the non-invasive assessment of spinal motoneuron excitability. We investigated the difference in spinal motoneuron dysfunction between the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digit minimi (ADM) muscles by investigating F-waves and to assess the contribution of spinal mechanisms to split-hand syndrome in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Sixty-five consecutive ALS patients and twenty age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. Motor nerve conduction studies (NCSs) and F-waves were performed bilaterally on median and ulnar nerves in all subjects. HCs revealed prominently longer F-wave latencies, lower chronodispersion, mean F-wave amplitude, mean and maximal F/M amplitude ratio (P &amp;lt; 0.001) in the FDI compared to the ADM. However, no significant differences in almost all F-wave parameters between the FDI and ADM were observed in ALS patients with affected hands except the minimal and mean F-wave latency. These data suggest that excitability is greatly changed in the spinal motoneurons innervating the FDI. Furthermore, the mean F-wave amplitude (r = 0.454, P = 0.002) of the FDI was significantly correlated with the FDI/ADM CMAP amplitude ratio in ALS patients with affected hands but not of the ADM. Our findings suggested that the dysfunction of spinal motoneurons between the FDI and ADM was different in ALS, and spinal motoneuron dysfunction was associated with development of the split-hand phenomenon.</description>

	<description>Big Data promises to advance science through data-driven discovery. However, many standard lab protocols rely on manual examination, which is not feasible for large-scale datasets. Meanwhile, automated approaches lack the accuracy of expert examination. We propose to 1) start with expertly labelled data, 2) amplify labels through web applications that engage citizen scientists, and 3) train machine learning on amplified labels, to emulate the experts. Demonstrating this, we developed a system to quality control brain magnetic resonance images. Expert-labeled data were amplified by citizen scientists through a simple web interface. A deep learning algorithm was then trained to predict data quality, based on citizen scientist labels. Deep learning performed as well as specialized algorithms for quality control (AUC=0.99). Combining citizen science and deep learning can generalize and scale expert decision making; this is particularly important in disciplines where specialized, automated tools do not yet exist.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: White Matter Plasticity in Reading-Related Pathways Differs in Children Born Preterm and at Term: A Longitudinal Analysis</title>

	<description>Children born preterm (PT) are at risk for white matter injuries based on complications of prematurity. They learn to read but on average perform below peers born full term (FT). Studies have yet to establish whether properties of white matter pathways at the onset of learning to read are associated with individual variation later in reading development in PT children. Here, we asked whether fractional anisotropy (FA) at age 6y is associated with reading outcome at age 8y in PT children in the same pathways as we previously demonstrated in a sample of FT children (Borchers et al., 2018).

PT (n = 34, mean gestational age = 29.5 weeks) and FT children (n = 37) completed diffusion MRI and standardized measures of non-verbal IQ, language, and phonological awareness at age 6y. Reading skills were assessed at age 8y. Mean tract-FA was extracted from pathways that predicted reading outcome in children born FT: left arcuate fasciculus (Arc), bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and left inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP). We explored associations in additional pathways in the PT children: bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and uncinate fasciculus (UF). Linear regression models examined whether the prediction of reading outcome at age 8y from mean tract-FA at age 6y was moderated by birth group.

Children born PT and FT did not differ significantly in tract-FA at age 6y or in reading at age 8y. Sex, socioeconomic status and non-verbal IQ at age 6y were associated with reading outcome and were included as covariates in all models. Birth group status significantly moderated associations between reading outcome and mean tract-FA only in the left Arc, right SLF, and left ICP, before and after consideration of pre-literacy skills.

Microstructural properties of these cerebral and cerebellar pathways predicted later reading outcome in FT but not in PT children. Children born PT may rely on alternative pathways to achieve fluent reading. These findings have implications for plasticity of neural organization after early white matter injury.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Theoretical Framework to Derive Simple, Firing-Rate-Dependent Mathematical Models of Synaptic Plasticity</title>

	<description>Synaptic plasticity serves as an essential mechanism underlying cognitive processes as learning and memory. For a better understanding detailed theoretical models combine experimental underpinnings of synaptic plasticity and match experimental results. However, these models are mathematically complex impeding the comprehensive investigation of their link to cognitive processes generally executed on the neuronal network level. Here, we derive a mathematical framework enabling the simplification of such detailed models of synaptic plasticity facilitating further mathematical analyses. By this framework we obtain a compact, firing-rate-dependent mathematical formulation, which includes the essential dynamics of the detailed model and, thus, of experimentally verified properties of synaptic plasticity. Amongst others, by testing our framework by abstracting the dynamics of two well-established calcium-dependent synaptic plasticity models, we derived that the synaptic changes depend on the square of the presynaptic firing rate, which is in contrast to previous assumptions. Thus, the here-presented framework enables the derivation of biologically plausible but simple mathematical models of synaptic plasticity allowing to analyze the underlying dependencies of synaptic dynamics from neuronal properties such as the firing rate and to investigate their implications in complex neuronal networks.</description>

	<description>Histological studies of myelin-stained sectioned cadaver brain and in-vivo myelin-weighted magnetic resonance imaging show that the cerebral cortex is organized into cortical areas with generally well-defined boundaries, which have consistent internal patterns of myelination. The process of myelination is largely driven by neural experience, in which the axonal passage of action potentials stimulates neighbouring oligodendrocytes to perform their task. This bootstrapping process, such that the traffic of action potentials facilitates increased traffic, suggests the hypothesis that the specific pattern of myelination (myeloarchitecture) in each cortical area reveals the principal cortical microcircuits required for the function of that area. If this idea is correct, the observable sequential maturation of specific brain areas can provide evidence for models of the stages of cognitive development.</description>

	<description>Parental migration has caused millions of children left behind, especially in China and India. Left behind children (LBC) have a high risk of mental disorders and may present negative life outcomes in the future. However, little is known whether there are cerebral structural alterations in LBC in relative to those with parents. This study is to explore the effect of parental migration on brain maturation by comparing gray matter volume (GMV) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of LBC with well-matched non-LBC. Thirty-eight LBC (21 boys, age=9.60±1.8yrs) and 30 non-LBC (19 boys, age=10.00±1.95yrs) were recruited and underwent brain scans in 3.0 T MR. IQ and other factors including family income, guardians’ educational level and separation time et al., were also acquired. Gray matter volume (GMV) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured for each participant and compared between groups using 2-sample t-tests with atlas-based analysis. Compared to non-LBC, LBC exhibited greater GMV in emotional and cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, and altered FA in bilateral superior occipitofrontal fasciculi and right medial lemniscus (P&amp;lt;0.05, Cohen's d&amp;gt;0.89, corrected for false-discovery rate). The increased GMV in bilateral parahippocampi was negatively correlated with IQ. Other factors including family income, guardians’ educational level and separation time were not associated with these brain changes. Our study provides empirical evidence of altered brain structure in LBC compared to non-LBC, responsible for emotion regulation and processing, which may account for mental disorders and negative life outcome of LBC. Our study suggests that absence of direct biological parental care may impact children's brain development. Therefore, public health efforts may be needed to provide additional academic and social/emotional supports to LBC when their parents migrate to seeking better economic circumstances, which has become increasingly common in developing countries.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Synaptic Failure Differentially Affects Pattern Formation in Heterogenous Networks</title>

	<description>The communication of the neurons is maintained by synapses, which play a crucial role in the functioning of the nervous system. Therefore, synaptic failure may impair information processing in the brain, to the extent of the loss of consciousness, as well as may underlie many neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, a number of studies suggested that anesthetics regulate conscious state by affecting synaptic transmission primarily of network hubs and subsequently reducing the coherence in the network activity. Here, we studied network-wide spatio-temporal patterning in scale-free networks with two types of synaptic failure: activity-dependent and activity-independent. Further, we defined scale-free network structures based on the dominating direction of the connections at the hub neurons: incoming and outgoing. We found that the two structures have significantly different dynamical properties. Moreover, synaptic failure may not only lead to the loss of coherence but, under some conditions, also can facilitate its emergence unintuitively. We showed that this is because activity-dependent synaptic failure homogenizes the activity levels in the network creating a dynamical substrate for the observed coherence increase. Our results indicate that coherence breakdown due to the synaptic failure may not be enough to explain the loss of consciousness, but at the same time can lead to such pathologies as epilepsy.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Large-Area Fluorescence and Electron Microscopic Correlative Imaging With Multibeam Scanning Electron Microscopy</title>

	<description>Recent improvements in correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) technology have led to dramatic improvements in the ability to observe tissues and cells. Fluorescence labeling has been used to visualize the localization of molecules of interest through immunostaining or genetic modification strategies for the identification of the molecular signatures of biological specimens. Newer technologies such as tissue clearing have expanded the field of observation available for fluorescence labeling; however, the area of correlative observation available for electron microscopy remains restricted.
In this study, we developed a large-area CLEM imaging procedure to show specific molecular localization in large-scale electron microscopy (EM) sections of mouse and marmoset brain. Target molecules were labeled with antibodies and sequentially visualized in cryostat sections using fluorescence and gold particles. Fluorescence images were obtained by light microscopy immediately after antibody staining. Immunostained sections were postfixed for EM, and silver-enhanced sections were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in resin. Ultrathin sections for EM were prepared from fully polymerized resin blocks, collected on silicon wafers, and observed by multibeam scanning electron microscopy. Multibeam scanning electron microscopy has made rapid, large-area observation at high resolution possible, paving the way for the analysis of detailed structures using the CLEM approach. Here, we describe detailed methods for large-area CLEM in various tissues of both rodents and primates.</description>

	<description>To improve the outcome after autologous nerve grafting in the clinic, it is important to understand the limiting variables such as distinct phenotypes of motor and sensory Schwann cells. This study investigated the properties of phenotypically different autografts in a 6 mm femoral nerve defect model in the rat, where the respective femoral branches distally of the inguinal bifurcation served as homotopic or heterotopic autografts. Axonal regeneration and target reinnervation was analysed by gait analysis, electrophysiology and wet muscle mass analysis. We evaluated regeneration-associated gene expression between 5 days and 10 weeks after repair, in the autografts as well as the proximal and distal segments of the femoral nerve using qRT-PCR. Furthermore we investigated expression patterns of phenotypically pure ventral and dorsal roots. We identified highly significant differences in gene expression of a variety of regeneration-associated genes along the central – peripheral axis in healthy femoral nerves. Phenotypically mismatched grafting resulted in altered spatiotemporal expression of neurotrophic factor BDNF, GDNF receptor GFRα1, cell adhesion molecules Cadm3, Cadm4, L1CAM and proliferation associated Ki67. Although significantly higher quadriceps muscle mass following homotopic nerve grafting was measured, we did not observe differences in gait analysis and electrophysiological parameters between treatment paradigms. Our study provides evidence for phenotypic commitment of autologous nerve grafts after injury and gives a conclusive overview of temporal expression of several important regeneration-associated genes after repair with sensory or motor graft.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Brain Histamine Modulates the Antidepressant-Like Effect of the 3-Iodothyroacetic Acid (TA1)</title>

	<description>3-iodothyroacetic acid (TA1), an end metabolite of thyroid hormone, has been shown to induce behavioral effects in mice depending on brain histamine. We now aim to verify whether pharmacologically administered TA1 has brain bioavailability and it is able to induce histamine-dependent antidepressant-like behaviors. 
TA1 brain, liver and plasma levels were measured by LC/MS-MS in male CD1 mice, sacrificed 15 min after receiving  a high TA1 dose (330 microgkg-1 ) The hypothalamic mTOR/AKT/GSK-beta cascade activation was evaluated in mice treated with 0.4, 1.32, 4 microgkg-1 TA1 by Western-blot. Mast cells were visualized by immuno-histochemistry in brain slices obtained from mice treated with 4 microgkg-1 TA1. Histamine release triggered by TA1 (20-1000 nM) was also evaluated in mouse peritoneal mast cells.
After receiving TA1 (1.32, 4 or 11 µgkg-1; i.p.) CD1 male mice were subjected to the forced swim (FST) and the tail suspension tests (TST). Spontaneous locomotor and exploratory activities, motor incoordination, and anxiolytic or anxiogenic effects, were evaluated. Parallel behavioral tests were also carried out in mice that, prior to receiving TA1, were pre-treated with pyrilamine (10 mgkg-1; PYR) or zolantidine (5 mgkg-1; ZOL), or with p-cloro-phenylalanine (100 mgkg-1; PCPA).
TA1 given i.p. to mice rapidly distributes in the brain, activates the hypothalamic mTOR/AKT and GSK-3 cascade and triggers mast cells degranulation. Furthermore, TA1 induces antidepressant effects and stimulates locomotion depending on the histaminergic system . 
TA1 antidepressant effect depends on brain histamine, thus highlithing a relationship between the immune system, brain inflammation and the thyroid</description>

	<description>Long perceived as a primitive and poorly differentiated brain structure, the primate insular cortex recently emerged as a highly evolved, organized and richly connected cortical hub interfacing bodily states with sensorimotor, environmental and limbic activities. This insular interface likely substantiates emotional embodiment and has the potential to have a key role in the interoceptive shaping of cognitive processes, including perceptual awareness. In the present review, we present a novel working model of the insular cortex, based on an accumulation of neuroanatomical and functional evidence obtained essentially in the macaque monkey. This model proposes that interoceptive afferents that represent the ongoing physiological status of all the organs of the body are first being received in the granular dorsal fundus of the insula or “primary interoceptive cortex”, then processed through a series of dysgranular poly-modal “insular stripes”, and finally integrated in anterior agranular areas that serve as an additional sensory platform for visceral functions and as an output stage for efferent autonomic regulation. One of the agranular areas hosts the specialized von Economo and Fork neurons, which could provide a decisive evolutionary advantage for the role of the anterior insula in the autonomic and emotional binding inherent to subjective awareness.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Does Acupuncture Protect Dopamine Neurons in Parkinson's Disease Rodent Model?: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00102</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00102</link>
	<description>Background Acupuncture has been reported to have significant effects in not only alleviating motor function, but also rescuing dopamine neuron deficit of Parkinson’s disease (PD) rodent model. However, systemic analysis of these beneficial effects has yet to be evaluated.
Objective To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of acupuncture in animal models of PD
Methods A literature search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CNKI, RISS, and JJSAM to collect studies that investigated effects of acupuncture on PD. Study quality of each included article was evaluated based on the 10-item checklist modified from CAMARADES. The software RevMan 5.3 was used for the meta-analysis.
Results 42 studies were included and the included studies scored between 2 and 7 points, with a mean of 4.6. Outcome measures include TH level and dopamine content. The result of meta-analysis showed significance of acupuncture for increasing both TH level (33.97, 95% CI: 33.15 ~ 34.79; p &amp;lt; 0.00001) and dopamine content (4.23, 95% CI: 3.53 ~ 4.92; p &amp;lt; 0.00001) compared with the PD control groups. In addition, motor dysfunctions showed in PD animal were also mitigated as a result of acupuncture treatment. 
Conclusions While there are limitations in number and quality of included studies, this study suggests that acupuncture shows the effect of dopamine neuron protection in PD rodent models.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Generation of endogenous pH-sensitive EGF receptor and its application in high-throughput screening for proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis</title>

	<description>Previously we used gene-editing to label endogenous EGF receptor (EGFR) with GFP and demonstrate that picomolar concentrations of EGFR ligand drive signaling and endocytosis of EGFR in tumors &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;(Pinilla-Macua et al, 2017). We now use gene-editing to insert a fluorogen activating protein (FAP) in the EGFR extracellular domain. Binding of the tandem dye pair MG-Bis-SA to FAP-EGFR provides a ratiometric pH-sensitive model with dual fluorescence excitation and a single far-red emission. The excitation ratio of fluorescence intensities was demonstrated to faithfully report the fraction of FAP-EGFR located in acidic endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Coupling native FAP-EGFR expression with the high method sensitivity has allowed development of a high-throughput assay to measure the rates of clathrin-mediated FAP-EGFR endocytosis stimulated with physiological EGF concentrations. The assay was utilized to screen a phosphatase siRNA library. These studies highlight the utility of endogenous pH-sensitive FAP-receptor chimeras in high-throughput analysis of endocytosis.</description>

	<description>During the asymmetric divisions of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;neuroblasts, the Par polarity complex cycles between the cytoplasm and an apical cortical domain that restricts differentiation factors to the basal cortex. We used rapid imaging of the full cell volume to uncover the dynamic steps that underlie transitions between neuroblast polarity states. Initially the Par proteins aPKC and Bazooka form discrete foci at the apical cortex. Foci grow into patches that together comprise a discontinuous, unorganized structure. Coordinated cortical flows that begin near metaphase and are dependent on the actin cytoskeleton rapidly transform the patches into a highly organized apical cap. At anaphase onset, the cap disassembles as the cortical flow reverses direction towards the emerging cleavage furrow. Following division, cortical patches dissipate into the cytoplasm allowing the neuroblast polarity cycle to begin again. Our work demonstrates how neuroblasts use asymmetric recruitment and cortical flows to dynamically polarize during asymmetric division cycles.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Dlg1 activates beta-catenin signaling to regulate retinal angiogenesis and the blood-retina and blood-brain barriers</title>

	<description>Beta-catenin (i.e., canonical Wnt) signaling controls CNS angiogenesis and the blood-brain and blood-retina barriers. To explore the role of the Discs large/membrane-associated guanylate kinase (Dlg/MAGUK) family of scaffolding proteins in beta-catenin signaling, we studied vascular endothelial cell (EC)-specific knockout of Dlg1/SAP97. EC-specific loss of Dlg1 produces a retinal vascular phenotype that closely matches the phenotype associated with reduced beta-catenin signaling, synergizes with genetically-directed reductions in beta-catenin signaling components, and can be rescued by stabilizing beta-catenin in ECs. In reporter cells with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated inactivation of Dlg1, transfection of Dlg1 enhances beta-catenin signaling ~4 fold. Surprisingly, Frizzled4, which contains a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif that can bind to Dlg1 PDZ domains, appears to function independently of Dlg1 in vivo. These data expand the repertoire of Dlg/MAGUK family functions to include a role in beta-catenin signaling, and they suggest that proteins other than Frizzled receptors interact with Dlg1 to enhance beta-catenin signaling.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The relationship between spatial configuration and functional connectivity of brain regions revisited</title>

	<description>In our previous paper (Bijsterbosch et al., 2018), we showed that network-based modelling of brain connectivity interacts strongly with the shape and exact location of brain regions, such that cross-subject variations in the spatial configuration of functional brain regions are being interpreted as changes in functional connectivity. Here we show that these spatial effects on connectivity estimates actually occur as a result of spatial overlap between brain networks. This is shown to systematically bias connectivity estimates obtained from group spatial ICA followed by dual regression. We introduce an extended method that addresses the bias and achieves more accurate connectivity estimates.</description>

	<description>To understand how chromosomes are segregated, it is necessary to explain the precise spatiotemporal organization of microtubules (MTs) in the mitotic spindle. We use &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; egg extracts to study the nucleation and dynamics of MTs in branched networks, a process that is critical for spindle assembly. Surprisingly, new branched MTs preferentially originate near the minus-ends of pre-existing MTs. A sequential reaction model, consisting of deposition of nucleation sites on an existing MT, followed by rate-limiting nucleation of branches, reproduces the measured spatial profile of nucleation, the distribution of MT plus-ends and tubulin intensity. By regulating the availability of the branching effectors TPX2, augmin and γ-TuRC, combined with single-molecule observations, we show that first TPX2 is deposited on pre-existing MTs, followed by binding of augmin/γ-TuRC to result in the nucleation of branched MTs. In sum, regulating the localization and kinetics of nucleation effectors governs the architecture of branched MT networks</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Structural Covariance Reveals Alterations in Control and Salience Network Integrity in Chronic Schizophrenia</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Schizophrenia (SCZ) is recognized as a disorder of distributed brain dysconnectivity. While progress has been made delineating large-scale functional networks in SCZ, little is known about alterations in grey matter integrity of these networks. We used a multivariate approach to identify the structural covariance of the salience, default, motor, visual, fronto-parietal control, and dorsal attention networks: salience, default, motor, visual, fronto-parietal control, and dorsal attention networks. We derived individual scores reflecting covariance in each structural image for a given network. Seed-based multivariate analyses were conducted on structural images in a discovery (n = 90) and replication (n = 74) sample of SCZ patients and healthy controls. We first validated patterns across all networks, consistent with well-established functional connectivity reports. Next, across two SCZ samples, we found reliable and robust reductions in structural integrity of the fronto-parietal control and salience networks, but not default, dorsal attention, motor and sensory networks. Well-powered exploratory analyses failed to identify relationships with symptoms. These findings provide evidence of selective structural decline in associative networks in SCZ. Such decline may be linked with recently identified functional disturbances in associative networks, providing more sensitive multi-modal network-level probes in SCZ. Absence of symptom effects suggests that identified disturbances may underlie a trait-type marker in SCZ.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>We propose a mechanism for myelin plasticity that would complement synaptic plasticity by adjusting conduction velocity for optimal spike-time arrival. In the proposed treadmilling model, myelin sheath thickness is a dynamic balance between the rates of new myelin deposited adjacent to the axon and removal of the outermost layer.</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Predictive Coding with Neural Transmission Delays: A Real-Time Temporal Alignment Hypothesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0412-18.2019?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0412-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical predictive coding is an influential model of cortical organization, in which sequential hierarchical levels are connected by backward connections carrying predictions, as well as forward connections carrying prediction errors. To date, however, predictive coding models have largely neglected to take into account that neural transmission itself takes time. For a time-varying stimulus, such as a moving object, this means that backward predictions become misaligned with new sensory input. We present an extended model implementing both forward and backward extrapolation mechanisms that realigns backward predictions to minimize prediction error. This realignment has the consequence that neural representations across all hierarchical levels become aligned in real time. Using visual motion as an example, we show that the model is neurally plausible, that it is consistent with evidence of extrapolation mechanisms throughout the visual hierarchy, that it predicts several known motion–position illusions in human observers, and that it provides a solution to the temporal binding problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: OTX2 Signals from the Choroid Plexus to Regulate Adult Neurogenesis</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Proliferation and migration during adult neurogenesis are regulated by a microenvironment of signaling molecules originating from local vasculature, from CSF produced by the choroid plexus, and from local supporting cells including astrocytes. Here, we focus on the function of OTX2 homeoprotein transcription factor in the mouse adult ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), which generates olfactory bulb neurons. We find that OTX2 secreted by choroid plexus is transferred to the supporting cells of the V-SVZ and rostral migratory stream. Deletion of &lt;i&gt;Otx2&lt;/i&gt; in choroid plexus affects neuroblast migration and reduces the number of olfactory bulb newborn neurons. Adult neurogenesis was also decreased by expressing secreted single-chain antibodies to sequester OTX2 in the CSF, demonstrating the importance of non-cell-autonomous OTX2. We show that OTX2 activity modifies extracellular matrix components and signaling molecules produced by supporting astrocytes. Thus, we reveal a multilevel and non-cell-autonomous role of a homeoprotein and reinforce the choroid plexus and astrocytes as key niche compartments affecting adult neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: New Insights from 22-kHz Ultrasonic Vocalizations to Characterize Fear Responses: Relationship with Respiration and Brain Oscillatory Dynamics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0065-19.2019?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fear behavior depends on interactions between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and the expression of fear involves synchronized activity in  and  oscillatory activities. In addition, freezing, the most classical measure of fear response in rodents, temporally coincides with the development of sustained 4-Hz oscillations in prefrontal-amygdala circuits. Interestingly, these oscillations were recently shown to depend on the animal’s respiratory rhythm, supporting the growing body of evidence pinpointing the influence of nasal breathing on brain rhythms. During fearful states, rats also emit 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) which drastically affect respiratory rhythm. However, the relationship between 22-kHz USV, respiration, and brain oscillatory activities is still unknown. Yet such information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of how the different components of fear response collectively modulate rat’s brain neural dynamics. Here, we trained male rats in an odor fear conditioning task, while recording simultaneously local field potentials (LFPs) in BLA, mPFC, and olfactory piriform cortex (PIR), together with USV calls and respiration. We show that USV calls coincide with an increase in delta and gamma power and a decrease in theta power. In addition, during USV emission in contrast to silent freezing, there is no coupling between respiratory rate and delta frequency, and the modulation of fast oscillations amplitude relative to the phase of respiration is modified. We propose that sequences of USV calls could result in a differential gating of information within the network of structures sustaining fear behavior, thus potentially modulating fear expression/memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Injury-induced axon degeneration is also observed within the well-studied process of Wallerian degeneration, a complex phenomenon triggered by axon injury to peripheral nerves in mammals. Recent studies have led to the identification of key molecular components of injury-induced axon degeneration. Axon survival factors, such as NMNAT2, act to protect injured axons from degeneration. By contrast, factors such as SARM1, MAPK, and PHR1 act to promote degeneration. The coordinated activity of these factors determines axon fate after injury. Since axon loss is an early feature of neurodegenerative diseases, it is possible that understanding the molecular mechanism of injury-induced degeneration will lead to new treatments for axon loss in neurodegenerative disease. Here, we discuss the critical pathways for injury-induced axon degeneration across species with an emphasis on their interactions in an integrated signaling network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The histological features of thrombus in stroke patients with cancer are not well known. Using immunohistochemical staining of thrombi retrieved during mechanical thrombectomy in stroke patients, thrombus compositions were compared between 16 patients with active cancer, 16 patients with inactive cancer, and 16 patients without any history of cancer. The active cancer group showed higher platelet and lower erythrocyte fractions than the inactive cancer or the control group. Four patients with vegetation showed very high platelet and low erythrocyte fractions. Patients with cryptogenic etiology in the active cancer group showed a similar pattern to those with vegetation. These findings may aid the determination of treatment strategies in cancer‐associated stroke. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human memory -- the learning of new information involves changes at the
synaptic level between neurons dedicated for storage of in-formation.
Generally, memory is classified as Long-Term Memory and Short-Term Memory. The
various types of the memory and their disorder are widely studied using
neuroimaging techniques like Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Brain is effectively occupied with the
capabilities of learning, retention and recall. The brain regions (pre-frontal
cortex, associated hippocampus cortices and their interactions with other
lobes) involved in memory recall tasks focuses on understanding the memory
retention and recall processes. However, due to highly complicated and dynamic
mechanisms of brain, the specific regions where information may reside are not
completely explored. In this research paper, recent memory literature using EEG
and fMRI studies is reviewed to understand the memory retention and recall
processes as well as the various brain regions associated with these processes.
A number of stimuli which are reported in previous studies are evaluated and
discussed. Furthermore, the challenges which are being faced by researchers in
EEG and fMRI methodologies are also presented. Recommendations for the future
research related to memory retention and recall are also discussed at the end.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many systems neuroscientists want to understand neurons in terms of
mediation; we want to understand how neurons are involved in the causal chain
from stimulus to behavior. Unfortunately, most tools are inappropriate for that
while our language takes mediation for granted. Here we discuss the contrast
between our conceptual drive towards mediation and the difficulty of obtaining
meaningful evidence.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Axons functionally link the somato-dendritic compartment to synaptic
terminals. Structurally and functionally diverse, they accomplish a central
role in determining the delays and reliability with which neuronal ensembles
communicate. By combining their active and passive biophysical properties, they
ensure a plethora of physiological computations. In this review, we revisit the
biophysics of generation and propagation of electrical signals in the axon,
their complex interplay, and their rich dynamics. We further place the
computational abilities of axons in the context of intracellular and
intercellular coupling. We discuss how, by means of sophisticated biophysical
mechanisms, axons expand the repertoire of axonal computation, and thereby, of
neural computation.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01933</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01933</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A good understanding of how neurons use electrical pulses (i.e, spikes) to
encode the signal information remains elusive. Analyzing spike sequences
generated by individual neurons and by two coupled neurons (using the
stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo model), recent theoretical studies have found that
the relative timing of the spikes can encode the signal information. Using a
symbolic method to analyze the spike sequence, preferred and infrequent spike
patterns were detected, whose probabilities vary with both, the amplitude and
the frequency of the signal. To investigate if this encoding mechanism is
plausible also for neuronal ensembles, here we analyze the activity of a group
of neurons, when they all perceive a weak periodic signal. We find that, as in
the case of one or two coupled neurons, the probabilities of the spike
patterns, now computed from the spike sequences of all the neurons, depend on
the signal's amplitude and period, and thus, the patterns' probabilities encode
the information of the signal. We also find that the resonances with the period
of the signal or with the noise level are more pronounced when a group of
neurons perceive the signal, in comparison with when only one or two coupled
neurons perceive it. Neuronal coupling is beneficial for signal encoding as a
group of neurons is able to encode a small-amplitude signal, which could not be
encoded when it is perceived by just one or two coupled neurons. Interestingly,
we find that for a group of neurons, just a few connections with one another
can significantly improve the encoding of small-amplitude signals. Our findings
indicate that information encoding in preferred and infrequent spike patterns
is a plausible mechanism that can be employed by neuronal populations to encode
weak periodic inputs, exploiting the presence of neural noise.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chemical and electrical synapses shape the dynamics of neuronal networks.
Numerous theoretical studies have investigated how each of these types of
synapses contributes to the generation of neuronal oscillations, but their
combined effect is less understood. This limitation is further magnified by the
impossibility of traditional neuronal mean-field models ---also known as firing
rate models, or firing rate equations--- to account for electrical synapses.
Here we analyze the dynamics of heterogeneous populations of quadratic
integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons with both chemical and electrical coupling. To
this aim, we derive an exact firing rate model that describes the collective
dynamics of the QIF network in a unified framework valid for both electrical
and chemical coupling. Networks with instantaneous chemical synapses display a
well-known bifurcation scenario characterized by a codimension-2 Cusp point
and, thus, by the presence of persistent asynchronous states for strong
excitatory coupling. The inclusion of electrical coupling generally implies the
emergence of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation and, hence, neuronal synchrony.
This dramatically transforms the Cusp scenario into a bifurcation scenario
characterized by three codimension-2 points (Cusp, Takens-Bogdanov, and
Saddle-Node Separatrix Loop), which is generic for the dynamics of
heterogeneous QIF networks with both chemical and electrical coupling.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We study the statistical physics of a surprising phenomenon arising in large
networks of excitable elements in response to noise: while at low noise,
solutions remain in the vicinity of the resting state and large-noise solutions
show asynchronous activity, the network displays orderly, perfectly
synchronized periodic responses at intermediate level of noise. We show that
this phenomenon is fundamentally stochastic and collective in nature. Indeed,
for noise and coupling within specific ranges, an asymmetry in the transition
rates between a resting and an excited regime progressively builds up, leading
to an increase in the fraction of excited neurons eventually triggering a chain
reaction associated with a macroscopic synchronized excursion and a collective
return to rest where this process starts afresh, thus yielding the observed
periodic synchronized oscillations. We further uncover a novel anti-resonance
phenomenon: noise-induced synchronized oscillations disappear when the system
is driven by periodic stimulation with frequency within a specific range. In
that anti-resonance regime, the system is optimal for measures of information
capacity. This observation provides a new hypothesis accounting for the
efficiency of Deep Brain Stimulation therapies in Parkinson's disease, a
neurodegenerative disease characterized by an increased synchronization of
brain motor circuits. We further discuss the universality of these phenomena in
the class of stochastic networks of excitable elements with confining coupling,
and illustrate this universality by analyzing various classical models of
neuronal networks. Altogether, these results uncover some universal mechanisms
supporting a regularizing impact of noise in excitable systems, reveal a novel
anti-resonance phenomenon in these systems, and propose a new hypothesis for
the efficiency of high-frequency stimulation in Parkinson's disease.

	<description>Detailed behavioral analysis is key to understanding the brain-behavior relationship. Here, we present deep learning-based methods for analysis of behavior imaging data in mice and humans. Specifically, we use three different convolutional neural network architectures and five different behavior tasks in mice and humans and provide detailed instructions for rapid implementation of these methods for the neuroscience community. We provide examples of three dimensional (3D) kinematic analysis in the food pellet reaching task in mice, social behavior analysis in freely moving mice with simultaneous miniscope calcium imaging, and 3D kinematic analysis of reaching and fine hand movements in humans. We demonstrate that the transfer learning approach accelerates the training of the network when using images from these types of behavior video recordings. We also provide code for post-processing of the data after initial analysis with deep learning. Our methods expand the repertoire of available tools using deep learning for behavior analysis by providing detailed instruction on implementation, applications in several behavior tests, and post-processing methods and annotated code for detailed behavior analysis. Moreover, our methods in human motor behavior can be used in the clinic to assess motor function during recovery after an injury such as stroke.</description>

	<description>Unraveling the alterations of the underlying circuits in neurobiological disorders is with no doubt one of the most interesting applications of studying brain oscillatory activity. Sleep and brain oscillatory activity in Down syndrome (DS) is a particularly explored field of study, with early findings in sleep alterations in DS patients. Nowadays it is well accepted the relationship of sleep with cognitive function, due to its implication in processes such as memory consolidation. As well, rhythmic activity of neural networks such as alpha or gamma waves has been related widely to cognition in the last decades. Both sleep and oscillatory activity are tightly related, as the major oscillatory feature of sleep -the slow oscillation (∼1Hz)- shows an exquisite interplay of different forms of rhythmic neuronal activity. Sleep and oscillatory activity in DS has been studied from the mid 20th century, but literature has appeared sporadically in the last decades. From the early descriptive studies, few works reported the differential features of sleep in DS individuals, showing a wide diversity of results. Some studies, addressed network oscillatory activity emerging from external brain circuits of DS individuals, with results related to different frequency bands of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. Even fewer studies have been published in models, but interestingly, some of them focused in the network mechanisms that may explain intellectual disability and cognitive deficits observed in DS. Here, a review is presented that aims to gather the work performed in the field and provide a wide and global view about the diversity of published studies. We aim to highlight the importance of studying network oscillatory activity in mouse models to infer alterations in the underlying circuits related to cognition, such as in intellectual disability. In this direction, we claim alpha and gamma rhythms generated by the cerebral cortex as a tool for evaluating an unbalance between excitation and inhibition in DS, which points out toward an over-inhibited network. Finally, we also aim to situate oscillatory activity as a key phenomenon that may be used as a biomarker for monitoring as well the effect of novel therapeutic strategies.</description>

	<description>The view that different kinds of memory are mediated by dissociable neural systems has received extensive experimental support.  Dissociations between memory systems are usually observed during initial acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval of memory, however increasing evidence also indicates a role for multiple memory systems in extinction behavior.  The present paper reviews a recent series of maze learning experiments that provide evidence for a multiple memory systems approach to extinction learning and memory. Evidence is described indicating that (1) the hippocampus and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) mediate different kinds of extinction learning, (2) the effectiveness of different extinction protocols depends on the kind of memory being extinguished, and (3) whether a neural system is involved in extinction is also determined by the extinction protocol and kind of memory undergoing extinction.  Based on these findings, a novel hypothetical model regarding the role of multiple memory systems in extinction is presented.  In addition, the relevance of this multiple memory systems approach to other learning paradigms involving extinction (i.e. extinction of conditioned fear) and for treating human psychopathologies characterized by maladaptive memories (e.g. drug addiction and relapse) is briefly considered.</description>

	<description>GABAergic interneuron diversity is a key feature in the brain that helps to create different brain activity patterns and behavioral states. Cell type classification schemes—based on anatomical, physiological and molecular features—have provided us with a detailed understanding of the distinct types that constitute this diversity and their contribution to brain function. Over recent years, the utility of single-cell RNAseq has majorly complemented this existing framework, vastly expanding our knowledge base, particularly regarding molecular features. Single-cell gene-expression profiles of tens of thousands of GABAergic cells from many different types are now available. The analysis of these data has shed new lights onto previous classification principles and illuminates a path towards a deeper understanding of molecular hallmarks behind interneuron diversity. A large part of such molecular features are synapse-related. These include ion channels and receptors, as well as key synaptic organizers and trans-synaptic signaling molecules. Increasing evidence suggest that transcriptional and post-transcriptional modifications further diversify these molecules and generate cell type-specific features. Thus, unraveling the cell type-specific nature of gene-isoform expression will be a key in cell type classification. This review discusses progress in the transcriptomic survey of interneurons and insights that have begun to manifest from isoform-level analyses.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Decreased Glycogenolysis by miR-338-3p Promotes Regional Glycogen Accumulation Within the Spinal Cord of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Mice</title>

	<description>Metabolic dysfunction is a hallmark of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). But the crosstalk between metabolic alteration and disease progression in ALS is still largely unknown. Glycogen, a branched polymer of glucose residues, is identified as the energy reserve of central nervous system (CNS), where its aberrant accumulation leads to neurodegeneration. Glycogen was reported to be accumulated in both CNS and visceral organs of SOD1G93A mice, a well-known ALS model, and contributes to pathological process of ALS. However, the accumulative patterns and mechanisms are not well elucidated. Here, we provide extensive evidence to show that glycogen accumulated in the lumbar spinal cord of ALS mice along with the disease progression, but not in the motor cortex. This regional accumulation of glycogen was caused by deteriorated glycogenolysis, which was triggered by decreased PYGB (glycogen phosphorylase, brain form). Moreover, miR-338-3p, an elevated miRNA in the spinal cord of SOD1G93A mice, directly targeted PYGB and was responsible for the decreased glycogenolysis and subsequent glycogen accumulation. Our work is helpful for better understanding of metabolic dysfunctions in ALS and provides novel targets for the therapeutic intervention in the future.</description>

	<description>Alzheimer disease (AD) represents an oncoming epidemic that without an effective treatment promises to exact extraordinary financial and emotional burdens. Studies of pathogenesis are essential for defining critical molecular and cellular events and for discovering therapies to prevent or mitigate their effects. Through studies of neuropathology, genetic and cellular and molecular biology recent decades have provided many important insights. Several hypotheses have been suggested. Documentation in the 1980s of selective loss of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, followed by clinical improvement in those treated with inhibitors of acetylycholinesterase, supported the “cholinergic hypothesis of age-related cognitive dysfunction”. A second hypothesis, prompted by the selective loss of cholinergic neurons and the discovery of central nervous system (CNS) neurotrophic factors, including NGF, prompted the “deficient neurotrophic hypothesis”. The most persuasive hypothesis, the amyloid cascade hypothesis first proposed more than 25 years ago, is supported by a wealth of observations. Genetic studies were exceptionally important, pointing to increased dose of the gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in Down syndrome (DS) and a familial AD (FAD) due to duplication of APP and to mutations in APP and in the genes for Presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1, 2), which encode the γ-secretase enzyme that processes APP. The “tau hypothesis” noted the prominence of tau-related pathology and its correlation with dementia. Recent interest in induction of microglial activation in the AD brain, as well as other manifestations of inflammation, supports the ‘inflammatory hypothesis” . We place these findings in the context of the selective, but by no means unique, involvement of BFCNs and their trophic dependence on NGF signaling and speculate as to how pathogenesis in these neurons is initiated, amplified and ultimately results in their dysfunction and death. In so doing we attempt to show how the different hypotheses for AD may interact and reinforce one another. Finally, we address current attempts to prevent and/or treat AD in light of advances in understanding pathogenetic mechanisms and suggest that studies in the Down syndrome population may provide unique insights into AD pathogenesis and treatment.</description>

	<description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with main symptoms of chronic primary memory loss and cognitive impairment. The study aim is to investigate the correlation between hippocampal functional connectivity (FC) and MRI radiomic features in AD. A total of 67 AD patients and 44 normal controls (NC) were enrolled in this study. Using one method of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), the whole-brain FC with bilateral hippocampus as seed was performed, and the FC values were extracted from the bilateral hippocampus respectively. We observed that AD patients demonstrated disruptive FC in some brain regions in the left hippocampal functional network, including right gyrus rectus, right anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri, bilateral precuneus, bilateral angular gyrus, and bilateral middle occipital gyrus. In addition, decreased FC was witnessed in some brain regions in the right hippocampal functional network, including bilateral anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri, right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus, and right precentral gyrus. Bilateral hippocampal radiomics features were calculated and selected respectively using A.K software.  Pearson correlation analysis suggested that two gray level run-length matrix (RLM) radiomic features and one gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) radiomic features weakly associated with FC values in the left hippocampus. However, there were no significant correlations between radiomic features and FC values in the right hippocampus. Compared with the NC group, the AD group showed abnormalities of FC level in the bilateral hippocampal functional network. This is a prospective study revealed the correlation between the MRI radiomic features and the rs-fMRI in AD patients.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Cerebral Autoregulation Evidenced by Synchronized Low Frequency Oscillations in Blood Pressure and Resting-State fMRI</title>

	<description>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a widely used technique for mapping the brain’s functional architecture, so delineating the main sources of variance comprising the signal is crucial. Low frequency oscillations (LFO) that are not of neural origin, but which are driven by mechanisms related to cerebral autoregulation (CA), are present in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal within the rs-fMRI frequency band. In this study we use a MR compatible device (Caretaker, Biopac) to obtain a non-invasive estimate of beat-to-beat mean arterial pressure (MAP) fluctuations concurrently with rs-fMRI at 3T. Healthy adult subjects (n=9; 5 male) completed two 20-minute rs-fMRI scans. MAP fluctuations were decomposed into different frequency scales using a discrete wavelet transform, and oscillations at approximately 0.1Hz show a high degree of spatially structured correlations with matched frequency fMRI fluctuations. On average across subjects, MAP fluctuations at this scale of the wavelet decomposition explain ~ 2.2% of matched frequency fMRI signal variance. Additionally, a simultaneous multi-slice multi-echo acquisition was used to collect 10-minute rs-fMRI at three echo times at 7T in a separate group of healthy adults (n=5; 5 male). Multiple echo times were used to estimate the R2* decay at every time point, and MAP was shown to strongly correlate with this signal, which suggests a purely BOLD (i.e. blood flow related) origin. This study demonstrates that there is a significant component of the BOLD signal that has a systemic physiological origin, and highlights the fact that not all localized BOLD signal changes necessarily reflect blood flow supporting local neural activity. Instead, these data show that a proportion of BOLD signal fluctuations in rs-fMRI are due to localized control of blood flow that is independent of local neural activity, most likely reflecting more general systemic autoregulatory processes. Thus, fMRI is a promising tool for studying flow changes associated with cerebral autoregulation with high spatial resolution.</description>

	<description>Two-photon imaging of fluorescently labelled microglia in vivo provides a direct approach to measure motility of microglial processes as a readout of microglial function that is crucial in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as to understand the neuroinflammatory response to implanted substrates and brain-computer interfaces. In this longitudinal study, we quantified surveilling and photodamage-directed microglial processes motility in both acute and chronic cranial window preparations and compared the motility under isoflurane and ketamine anesthesia to awake condition in the same animal. The isoflurane anesthesia increased the length of surveilling microglial processes in both acute and chronic preparations, while ketamine increased the number of microglial branches in acute preparation only. In chronic (but not acute) preparation, the extension of microglial processes towards the laser-ablated microglial cell was faster under isoflurane (but not ketamine) anesthesia than in awake mice, indicating distinct effects of anesthetics and of preparation type. These data reveal potentiating effects of isoflurane on microglial response to damage, and provide a framework for comparison and optimal selection of experimental conditions for quantitative analysis of microglial function using two-photon microscopy in vivo.</description>

	<description>Our knowledge of the brain has evolved over millennia in philosophical, experimental and theoretical phases. We suggest that the next phase is simulation neuroscience. The main drivers of simulation neuroscience are big data generated at multiple levels of brain organization and the need to integrate these data to trace the causal chain of interactions within and across all these levels. Simulation neuroscience is currently the only methodology for systematically approaching the multiscale brain. In this review, we attempt to reconstruct the deep historical paths leading to simulation neuroscience, from the first observations of the nerve cell to modern efforts to digitally reconstruct and simulate the brain. Neuroscience began with the identification of the neuron as the fundamental unit of brain structure and function and has evolved towards understanding the role of each cell type in the brain, how brain cells are connected to each other, and how the seemingly infinite networks they form give rise to the vast diversity of brain functions. Neuronal mapping is evolving from subjective descriptions of cell types towards objective classes, subclasses and types. Connectivity mapping is evolving from loose topographic maps between brain regions towards dense anatomical and physiological maps of connections between individual genetically distinct neurons. Functional mapping is evolving from psychological and behavioral stereotypes towards a map of behaviors emerging from structural and functional connectomes. We show how industrialization of neuroscience and the resulting large disconnected datasets are generating demand for integrative neuroscience, how the scale of neuronal and connectivity maps is driving digital atlasing and digital reconstruction to piece together the multiple levels of brain organization, and how the complexity of the interactions between molecules, neurons, microcircuits and brain regions is driving brain simulation to understand the interactions in the multiscale brain.</description>

	<description>The chronic consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) may contribute to the increased risk for early cognitive decline and dementia, primarily due to the diffusion axonal injury. Previous studies in mild (mTBI) have been controversy in describing the white matter tracts integrity changes occurring at acute and sub-acute post-injury. In the prospective longitudinal study, we aim to investigate the longitudinal changes of white matter using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and their correlations with neuropsychological tests. Thirty-three patients with sub-acute mTBI, 31 matched healthy controls were studied with an extensive imaging and clinical battery. Neuroimaging was obtained within 7 days post-injury for acute scans and repeated at 1 month and 3 month post-injury. Using a region-of-interest-based approach, Tract-Based Spatial Statistics was used to conduct voxel-wise analysis on diffusion changes in mTBI and was compared to those of healthy matched controls, scanned during the same time period and rescanned with a similar interval as that of patients. We found decreased FA values in the left anterior limb of internal capsule (ALIC) and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) during the 7 days post-injury, which showed longitudinal evidence of recovery following one-month post-injury. Increased FA values in these two tracts at 1 month post-injury was positively associated with better performance on cognitive information processing speed at initial assessment. By contrast, there were also some tracts (right anterior corona radiata, forceps major and body of corpus callosum) exhibiting the continuing loss of integrity sustaining even beyond 3 months, which can predict the persisting post-concussion syndromes. Continuing loss of structural integrity in some tracts may contribute to the persistent post-concussion syndromes in mTBI patients, suggesting certain tracts providing an objective biomarker for tracking the pathological recovery process following mTBI.</description>

	<description>Hyperforin has been shown to be capable of promoting angiogenesis and functional recovery after ischemic stroke in our previous study. However, the exact mechanisms involved are not fully elucidated. In this study, adult male mice were subjected to 60-min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion for 28 days. Hyperforin was administrated to MCAO mice every 24 hours for 2 weeks starting at 14 days post-ischemia (dpi). Then flow cytometry, quantitative Real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and functional assays were performed to explore the molecular mechanisms in vivo and in vitro. Our data showed that hyperforin increased astrocytic interleukin (IL)-6 in the ischemic hemisphere via TLR4 at 28dpi. The astrocytic IL-6 was essential to the promoting effects of hyperforin on the neural precursor cells (NPCs) proliferation, neuronal differentiation, angiogenesis and functional recovery after stroke. Furthermore, hyperforin promoted the infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to the ischemic hemisphere and increased Tregs-derived cytokine IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in a manner that was dependent on astrocytic IL-6. Astrocytic IL-6 was critical to the role of hyperforin in promoting the infiltration of T-helper (Th) type 2 cells to the ischemic hemisphere and Th2-derived cytokine IL-4, relative to Th1 and Th1-derived cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which decreased during stroke recovery. After depletion of CD25+ Tregs, the promoting effects of hyperforin on post-stroke neurogenesis was attenuated. Moreover, blockade of IL-4 and TGF-β abrogated the promoting role of hyperforin in post-stroke neurogenesis, angiogenesis and functional recovery. Our results reveal a previously uncharacterized role of astrocytic IL-6-mediated negative immune regulation in the promoting effects of hyperforin on post-stroke neurovascular regeneration and functional recovery.</description>

	<description>Previous studies have demonstrated that T cells and microglia could fight against cerebral Listeria monocytogenes (Listeria); however, their synergistic anti-Listeria mechanisms remain unknown. Following Listeria infection in a culture system, we found that microglia, but not nerve cells, could release extracellular traps (ETs) which originated from microglial vesicles. Specific inhibitor analysis showed that extracellular DNA (eDNA), matrix metallopeptidases (MMP9 and MMP12), citrullinated histone H3, and peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 were the major components of microglial ETs (MiETs) and were also the components of vesicles. Systematic analysis indicated that Listeria-induced MiETs were cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS)- and NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependent and involved ERK. MiETs were exhibited in Listeria-infected mouse brain and protected against Listeria infection via bacterial killing in a mouse meningitis model, and MiETs existed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from Listeria meningitis patients in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, interferon-γ could induce MiET formation in Listeria-infected microglia in vitro that was mediated by NOX, and there was a positive relationship between the elevated level of IFN-γ and eDNA and nucleosomes in the brain homogenates and CSF of Listeria meningitis model mice and in the CSF before treatment in clinical Listeria meningitis patients. Together, this is the first report of MiET formation, these findings pave the way for deeper exploration of the innate immune response to pathogens in CNS.</description>

	<description>The mechanisms that coordinately regulate lipid synthesis in the nervous system together with the high rates of membrane biogenesis needed to support cell growth are largely unknown as are their subcellular site of synthesis. c-Fos, a well-known AP-1 transcription factor, has emerged as a unique protein with the capacity to associate to specific enzymes of the pathway of synthesis of phospholipids at the endoplasmic reticulum and activate their synthesis to accompany genomic decisions of growth. Herein, we discuss this effect of c-Fos in the context of neuronal differentiation and also with respect to pathologies of the nervous system such as the development and growth of tumors. We also provide insights into the sub-cellular sites where this regulation occurs at the endoplasmic reticulum membranes and the molecular mechanism by which c-Fos exerts this activity.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Chronic Stress Modulates Interneuronal Plasticity: Effects on PSA-NCAM and Perineuronal Nets in Cortical and Extracortical Regions</title>

	<description>Chronic stress has an important impact on the adult brain. However, most of the knowledge on its effects is focused on principal neurons and less on inhibitory neurons. Consequently, recent reports have begun to describe stress-induced alterations in the structure, connectivity and neurochemistry of interneurons. Some of these changes appear to be mediated by certain molecules particularly associated to interneurons, such as the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) and components of the perineuronal nets (PNN), specialized regions of the extracellular matrix. These plasticity-related molecules modulate interneuronal structure and connectivity, particularly of parvalbumin expressing basket interneurons, both during development and adult life. These inhibitory neurons are specially affected after chronic stress and in some stress-related disorders, in which the expression of PSA-NCAM and certain components of PNN are also altered. For these reasons we have decided to study PSA-NCAM, PNN and parvalbumin expressing interneurons after 10 days of chronic restraint stress, a time point in which its behavioral consequences are starting to appear. We have focused initially on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA) and hippocampus, regions affected by stress and stress-related psychiatric diseases, but we have also explored the habenula and the thalamic reticular nucleus due to the important presence of PNN and their relationship with certain disorders. PSA-NCAM expression was increased by stress in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA1. Increases in parvalbumin immunoreactive cells were detected in the mPFC and the BLA, but were not accompanied by increases in the number of parvalbumin expressing perisomatic puncta on the somata of principal neurons. The number of PNN was also increased in the mPFC and the habenula, although habenular PNN were not associated to parvalbumin cells. Increased expression of parvalbumin and components of PNN were also detected in the thalamic reticular nucleus after chronic restraint stress, revealing for the first time substantial effects on this region. Our study shows that, even a short chronic stress protocol, can induce consistent changes in interneuronal plasticity-related molecules in cortical and extracortical regions, which may represent initial responses of inhibitory circuits to counteract the effects of this aversive experience.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Spontaneous and Acetylcholine Evoked Calcium Transients in the Developing Mouse Utricle</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00186</guid>

	<description>Spontaneous calcium transients are present during early postnatal development in the mouse retina and cochlea, and play an important role in maturation of the sensory organs and neural circuits in the central nervous system (CNS).  It is not known whether similar calcium transients occur during postnatal development in the vestibular sensory organs.   Here we demonstrate spontaneous intracellular calcium transients in sensory hair cells (HCs) and supporting cells (SCs) in the murine utricular macula during the first two postnatal weeks.  Calcium transients were monitored using a genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP5G (G5), at 100ms-frame-1 in excised utricle sensory epithelia, including HCs, SCs and neurons.  The reporter line expressed G5 and tdTomato (tdT) in a Gad2-Cre dependent manner within a subset of utricular HCs, SCs and neurons.  Kinetics of the G5 reporter limited temporal resolution to calcium events lasting longer than 200ms.  Spontaneous calcium transients lasting 1-2 s were observed in the expressing population of HCs at birth and slower spontaneous transients lasting 10-30 s appeared in SCs by P3.   Beginning at P5, calcium transients could be modulated by application of the efferent neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh).  In mature mice, calcium transients in the utricular macula occurred spontaneously, had a duration 1-2 s, and could be modulated by the exogenous application of acetylcholine (ACh) or muscarine.  Long-lasting calcium transients evoked by ACh in mature mice were blocked by atropine, consistent with previous reports describing the role of muscarinic receptors expressed in calyx bearing afferents in efferent control of vestibular sensation.  Large spontaneous and ACh evoked transients were reversibly blocked by the inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) antagonist aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB).  Results demonstrate long-lasting calcium transients are present in the utricular macula during the first postnatal week, and that responses to ACh mature over this same time period.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Calcium Microdomain Formation at the Perisynaptic Cradle Due to NCX Reversal: A Computational Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00185</guid>

	<description>It has recently been proposed using a multi-compartmental mathematical model that negatively fixed charged membrane-associated sites constrain the flow of cations in perisynaptic astroglial processes. This restricted movement of ions between the perisynaptic cradle (PsC), principal astroglial processes and the astrocyte soma gives rise to potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) microdomains at the PsC. The present paper extends the above model to demonstrate that the formation of an Na+ microdomain can reverse the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) thus providing an additional source of calcium (Ca2+) at the PsC. Results presented clearly show that reversal of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is instigated by a glutamate transporter coupled increase in concentration of cytoplasmic [Na+]i at the PsC, which and instigates Ca2+ influx through the NCX. As the flow of Ca2+ along the astrocyte process and away from the PsC is also constrained by Ca2+ binding proteins, then a Ca2+ microdomain forms at the PsC. The paper also serves to demonstrate that the EAAT, NKA and NCX represent the minimal requirement necessary and sufficient for the development of a Ca2+ microdomain and that these mechanisms directly link neuronal activity and glutamate release to the formation of localised Na+ and Ca2+ microdomains signals at the PsC. This local source of Ca2+ can provide a previously underexplored form of astroglial Ca2+ signaling.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Oxytocin Increases Phasic and Tonic GABAergic Transmission in CA1 Region of Mouse Hippocampus</title>

	<description>Oxytocin is a neuropeptide that plays important peripheral and central neuromodulatory functions. Our data show that, following activation of oxytocin receptors (OtR) with the selective agonist TGOT, a significant increase in frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC) occurred in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (PYR) in mice. TGOT affected also sIPSC deactivation kinetics, suggesting the involvement of perisynaptic GABAA receptors (GABAAR) as well. By contrast, TGOT did not cause significant changes in frequency, amplitude or deactivation kinetics of miniature IPSC, suggesting that the effects elicited by the agonist are strictly dependent on the firing activity of presynaptic neurons. Moreover, TGOT was able to modulate tonic GABAergic current mediated by extrasynaptic GABAARs expressed by PYRs. Consistently, at spike threshold TGOT induced in most PYRs a significant membrane hyperpolarization and a decrease in firing rate. The source of increased inhibition onto PYRs was represented by stuttering fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons (IN) that directly respond to TGOT with a depolarization and an increase in their firing rate. One putative ionic mechanism underlying this effect could be represented by OtR-induced up-modulation of L-type Ca2+ channels. In conclusion, our results indicate that oxytocin can influence the activity of a subclass of hippocampal GABAergic interneurons and therefore regulate the operational modes of the downstream PYRs by increasing phasic and tonic GABAergic transmission in CA1 region of mouse hippocampus.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Direct Measurements of Abdominal Visceral Fat and Cognitive Impairment in Late Life: Findings From an Autopsy Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00109</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00109</link>
	<description>Background: The relationship between cognitive impairment and abdominal visceral is controversial. Moreover, all studies so far used imaging studies to evaluate visceral fat and this association has not been described yet using autopsy material, which allows the direct quantification of abdominal fat. We aimed to investigate the association between direct measurements of abdominal visceral fat and cognitive impairment in an autopsy study. 
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we collected information on sociodemographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and cognitive status from subjects aged 50 or older at time of death in a general autopsy service in Brazil. Abdominal visceral fat was obtained in natura by the dissection of perirenal, mesenteric, omental, and mesocolon fat. The associations of total abdominal visceral fat with cognitive impairment [Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score ≥0.5) and CDR-sum of boxes (CDR-SB) were evaluated using logistic regression and negative binomial regression models, respectively. All analyses were adjusted for height, age, sex, education, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, smoking, alcohol use, and physical inactivity. In addition, we compared the discrimination of visceral fat, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC) measurements in predicting cognitive impairment.
Results: We evaluated 234 participants (mean age=71.2±12.9 years old, 59% male). Abdominal visceral fat was inversely associated with cognitive impairment (OR=0.46, CI=0.30; 0.70, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and with CDR-SB scores (β=-0.85, 95% CI=-1.28; -0.43, p&amp;lt;0.0001). When we compared the area under the ROC curve (AUC), visceral fat (AUC=0.754), BMI (AUC=0.729), and WC (AUC=0.720) showed similar discrimination in predicting cognitive impairment (p=0.38).
Conclusion: In an autopsy study, larger amount of directly measured abdominal visceral fat was associated with lower odds of cognitive impairment in older adults.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Transcriptional Dysregulation Study Reveals a Core Network Involving the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00101</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00101</link>
	<description>Background: The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is associated with dysregulation at different levels from transcriptome to cellular functioning. Such complexity necessitates investigations of disease etiology to be carried out considering multiple aspects of the disease and the use of independent strategies. The established works more emphasized on the structural organization of gene regulatory network while neglecting the internal regulation changes.

Methods: Applying a strategy different from popularly used co-expression network analysis, this study investigated the transcriptional dysregulations during the transition from normal to disease states. 

Results: 97 genes were predicted as dysregulated genes, which were also associated with clinical outcomes of Alzheimer's disease. Both the co-expression and differential co-expression analysis suggested these genes to be interconnected as a core network and that their regulations were strengthened during the transition to disease states. Functional studies suggested the dysregulated genes to be associated with aging and synaptic function. Further, we checked the evolutionary conservation of the gene co-expression and found that human and mouse brain might have divergent transcriptional co-regulation even when they had conserved gene expression profiles.

Conclusion: Overall, our study reveals a core network of transcriptional dysregulation associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease by affecting the aging and synaptic functions related genes; the gene regulation  is not conserved in the human and mouse brains.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Non-fasting High-Density Lipoprotein Is Associated With White Matter Microstructure in Healthy Older Adults</title>

	<description>A growing body of evidence indicates that biomarkers of cardiovascular risk may be related to cerebral health. However, little is known about the role non-fasting lipoprotein play in assessing age-related declines in a cerebral biomarker sensitive to vascular compromise, white matter (WM) microstructure. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is atheroprotective and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major atherogenic lipoprotein. This study explored the relationships between non-fasting levels of cholesterol and WM microstructure in healthy older adults. A voxelwise and region of interest approach was used to determine the relationship between cholesterol and fractional anisotropy (FA). Participants were 87 older adults between the ages of 59 and 77 (mean age = 65.5 years, SD = 3.9). Results indicated that higher HDL-C was associated with higher FA in diffuse regions of the brain when controlling for age, sex, and body mass index. HDL-C was also positively associated with FA in the corpus callosum and fornix. No relationship was observed between LDL-C and FA. Findings suggest that a modifiable lifestyle variable associated with cardiovascular health may help to preserve cerebral WM.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Newly Developed TV-Based Cognitive Training Games Improve Car Driving Skills, Cognitive Functions, and Mood in Healthy Older Adults: Evidence From a Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00099</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00099</link>
	<description>Background
Cognitive training at a laboratory improves car driving skills of older car drivers. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether cognitive training of other types undertaken at home has beneficial effects on driving skills. Using our developed cognitive training games that work on a TV with a set-top box in a person’s home, we investigated effects of 6-week cognitive training on driving skills which assessed with on-road evaluation (primary outcome) and also check the benefit on cognitive functions and emotional states (secondary outcome) in older people.
Methods
For this double-blinded randomized control trial (RCT), 60 older licensed drivers were assigned randomly to two groups: a cognitive training game for car driving (CTCD) group and an active control cognitive training game (ACT) group. The CTCD, participants played CTCD (processing speed, dual attention, and speed prediction) for 20 min during 5 sessions per week for 6 weeks. The ACT group participants played ACT (select large number, select number from largest to smallest, rock–paper–scissors) for 20 min during 5 sessions per week for 6 weeks. We measured driving skills, several cognitive functions, and emotional states before and after the 6 week intervention period.
Results
Our main results demonstrated that, compared to ACT, CTCD improved driving skills (adjusted p = 0.034). Moreover, compared to ACT, CTCD improved inhibition (stroop, adjusted p = 0.042: reverse Stroop, adjusted p = 0.043) and processing speed performance (symbol search, adjusted p = 0.049; digit symbol coding, (adjusted p = 0.047). It increased vigor–activity mood scores (adjusted p = 0.041) as measured using the Profile of Mood State.
Discussion
This randomized controlled trial first provided scientific evidence related to benefits of 6-week CTCD on driving skills, cognitive functions such as processing speed, inhibition, and vigor–activity mood in healthy older people. Our results suggested cognitive training as a useful tool for improving driving skills of older adults.

	<description>The extensive use of mollusc shell as a versatile raw material is testament to                    its importance in prehistoric times. The consistent choice of certain species                    for different purposes, including the making of ornaments, is a direct                    representation of how humans viewed and exploited their environment. The                    necessary taxonomic information, however, is often impossible to obtain from                    objects that are small, heavily worked or degraded. Here we propose a novel                    biogeochemical approach to track the biological origin of prehistoric mollusc                    shell. We conducted an in-depth study of archaeological ornaments using                    microstructural, geochemical and biomolecular analyses, including                    'palaeoshellomics', the first application of palaeoproteomics to mollusc shells                    (and indeed to any invertebrate calcified tissue). We reveal the consistent use                    of locally-sourced freshwater mother-of-pearl for the standardized manufacture                    of 'double-buttons'. This craft is found throughout Europe between 4200 - 3800                    BCE, highlighting the ornament-makers' profound knowledge of the biogeosphere                    and the existence of cross-cultural traditions.</description>

	<description>Organismal phenotypes frequently involve multiple organ systems. Histology is a powerful way to detect cellular and tissue phenotypes, but is largely descriptive and subjective. To determine how synchrotron-based X-ray micro-tomography (micro-CT) can yield 3-dimensional whole-organism images suitable for quantitative histological phenotyping, we scanned whole zebrafish, a small vertebrate model with diverse tissues, at ~1-micron voxel resolutions. Using micro-CT optimized for cellular characterization (histotomography), brain nuclei were computationally segmented and assigned to brain regions. Shape and volume were computed for populations of nuclei such as those of motor neurons and red blood cells. Striking individual phenotypic variation was apparent from color maps of computed cell density. Unlike histology, histotomography allows the detection of phenotypes that require millimeter scale context in multiple planes. We expect the computational and visual insights into 3D tissue architecture provided by histotomography to be useful for reference atlases, hypothesis generation, comprehensive organismal screens, and diagnostics.</description>

	<description>Oligodendrocytes (OLs) support neurons and signal transmission in the central nervous system (CNS) by enwrapping axons with myelin, a lipid-rich membrane structure. We addressed the significance of fatty acid (FA) synthesis in OLs by depleting FA synthase (FASN) from OL progenitor cells (OPCs) in transgenic mice. While we detected no effects in proliferation and differentiation along the postnatal OL lineage, we found that FASN is essential for accurate myelination, including myelin growth. Increasing dietary lipid intake could partially compensate for the FASN deficiency. Furthermore, FASN contributes to correct myelin lipid composition and stability of myelinated axons. Moreover, we depleted FASN specifically in adult OPCs to examine its relevance for remyelination. Applying lysolecithin-induced focal demyelinating spinal cord lesions, we found that FA synthesis is essential to sustain adult OPC-derived OLs and efficient remyelination. We conclude that FA synthesis in OLs plays key roles in CNS myelination and remyelination.</description>

	<description>The extent and dynamics of animal cell biomass accumulation during mitosis are unknown, primarily because growth has not been quantified with sufficient precision and temporal resolution. Using the suspended microchannel resonator and protein synthesis assays, we quantify mass accumulation and translation rates between mitotic stages on a single-cell level. For various animal cell types, growth rates in prophase are commensurate with or higher than interphase growth rates. Growth is only stopped as cells approach metaphase-to-anaphase transition and growth resumes in late cytokinesis. Mitotic arrests stop growth independently of arresting mechanism. For mouse lymphoblast cells, growth in prophase is promoted by CDK1 through increased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and cap-dependent protein synthesis. Inhibition of CDK1-driven mitotic translation reduces daughter cell growth. Overall, our measurements counter the traditional dogma that growth during mitosis is negligible and provide insight into antimitotic cancer chemotherapies.</description>

	<description>Recent developments in human neuroimaging make it possible to non-invasively measure neural activity from different cortical layers. This can potentially reveal not only which brain areas are engaged by a task, but also how. Specifically, bottom-up and top-down responses are associated with distinct laminar profiles. Here, we measured lamina-resolved fMRI responses during a visual task designed to induce concurrent bottom-up and top-down modulations via orthogonal manipulations of stimulus contrast and feature-based attention. BOLD responses were modulated by both stimulus contrast (bottom-up) and by engaging feature-based attention (top-down). Crucially, these effects operated at different cortical depths: Bottom-up modulations were strongest in the middle cortical layer and weaker in deep and superficial layers, while top-down modulations were strongest in the superficial layers. As such, we demonstrate that laminar activity profiles can discriminate between concurrent top-down and bottom-up processing, and are diagnostic of how a brain region is activated.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Disruption of the Prefrontal Cortex Improves Implicit Contextual Memory-Guided Attention: Combined Behavioral and Electrophysiological Evidence</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Many studies have shown that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays an important role in top-down cognitive control over intentional and deliberate behavior. However, recent studies have reported that DLPFC-mediated top-down control interferes with implicit forms of learning. Here we used continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) combined with electroencephalography to investigate the causal role of DLPFC in implicit contextual memory-guided attention. We aimed to test whether transient disruption of the DLPFC would interfere with implicit learning performance and related electrical brain activity. We applied neuronavigation-guided cTBS to the DLPFC or to the vertex as a control region prior to the performance of an implicit contextual learning task. We found that cTBS applied over the DLPFC significantly improved performance during implicit contextual learning. We also noted that beta-band (13–19 Hz) oscillatory power was reduced at fronto-central channels about 140 to 370 ms after visual stimulus onset in cTBS DLPFC compared with cTBS vertex. Taken together, our results provide evidence that DLPFC-mediated top-down control interferes with contextual memory-guided attention and beta-band oscillatory activity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) networks are critical for adaptive decision-making, yet how changes to circuit-level properties impact cognitive algorithms remains unclear. Here we explore how dopaminergic plasticity at corticostriatal synapses alters competition between striatal pathways, impacting the evidence accumulation process during decision-making. Spike-timing dependent plasticity simulations showed that dopaminergic feedback based on rewards modified the ratio of direct and indirect corticostriatal weights within opposing action channels. Using the learned weight ratios in a full spiking CBGT network model, we simulated neural dynamics and decision outcomes in a reward-driven decision task and fit them with a drift diffusion model. Fits revealed that the rate of evidence accumulation varied with inter-channel differences in direct pathway activity while boundary height varied with overall indirect pathway activity. This multi-level modeling approach demonstrates how complementary learning and decision computations can emerge from corticostriatal plasticity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aJKmYhBIb1c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Fast and robust deconvolution of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte from expression profiles using least trimmed squares</title>

Gene-expression deconvolution is used to quantify different types of cells in a mixed population. It provides a highly promising solution to rapidly characterize the tumor-infiltrating immune landscape and identify cold cancers. However, a major challenge is that gene-expression data are frequently contaminated by many outliers that decrease the estimation accuracy. Thus, it is imperative to develop a robust deconvolution method that automatically decontaminates data by reliably detecting and removing outliers. We developed a new machine learning tool, Fast And Robust DEconvolution of Expression Profiles (FARDEEP), to enumerate immune cell subsets from whole tumor tissue samples. To reduce noise in the tumor gene expression datasets, FARDEEP utilizes an adaptive least trimmed square to automatically detect and remove outliers before estimating the cell compositions. We show that FARDEEP is less susceptible to outliers and returns a better estimation of coefficients than the existing methods with both numerical simulations and real datasets. FARDEEP provides an estimate related to the absolute quantity of each immune cell subset in addition to relative percentages. Hence, FARDEEP represents a novel robust algorithm to complement the existing toolkit for the characterization of tissue-infiltrating immune cell landscape. The source code for FARDEEP is implemented in R and available for download at https://github.com/YuningHao/FARDEEP.git.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ch_oucou2P4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A dynamic network model of temporal receptive fields in primary auditory cortex</title>

Auditory neurons encode stimulus history, which is often modelled using a span of time-delays in a spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF). We propose an alternative model for the encoding of stimulus history, which we apply to extracellular recordings of neurons in the primary auditory cortex of anaesthetized ferrets. For a linear-non-linear STRF model (LN model) to achieve a high level of performance in predicting single unit neural responses to natural sounds in the primary auditory cortex, we found that it is necessary to include time delays going back at least 200 ms in the past. This is an unrealistic time span for biological delay lines. We therefore asked how much of this dependence on stimulus history can instead be explained by dynamical aspects of neurons. We constructed a neural-network model whose output is the weighted sum of units whose responses are determined by a dynamic firing-rate equation. The dynamic aspect performs low-pass filtering on each unit’s response, providing an exponentially decaying memory whose time constant is individual to each unit. We find that this dynamic network (DNet) model, when fitted to the neural data using STRFs of only 25 ms duration, can achieve prediction performance on a held-out dataset comparable to the best performing LN model with STRFs of 200 ms duration. These findings suggest that integration due to the membrane time constants or other exponentially-decaying memory processes may underlie linear temporal receptive fields of neurons beyond 25 ms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RE63FYO0E5Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Inferior olivary activity causes both short-term and long-term changes in cerebellar output underlying motor performance and motor learning. Many of its neurons engage in coherent subthreshold oscillations and are extensively coupled via gap junctions. Studies in reduced preparations suggest that these properties promote rhythmic, synchronized output. However, the interaction of these properties with torrential synaptic inputs in awake behaving animals is not well understood. Here we combine electrophysiological recordings in awake mice with a realistic tissue-scale computational model of the inferior olive to study the relative impact of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms governing its activity. Our data and model suggest that if subthreshold oscillations are present in the awake state, the period of these oscillations will be transient and variable. Accordingly, by using different temporal patterns of sensory stimulation, we found that complex spike rhythmicity was readily evoked but limited to short intervals of no more than a few hundred milliseconds and that the periodicity of this rhythmic activity was not fixed but dynamically related to the synaptic input to the inferior olive as well as to motor output. In contrast, in the long-term, the average olivary spiking activity was not affected by the strength and duration of the sensory stimulation, while the level of gap junctional coupling determined the stiffness of the rhythmic activity in the olivary network during its dynamic response to sensory modulation. Thus, interactions between intrinsic properties and extrinsic inputs can explain the variations of spiking activity of olivary neurons, providing a temporal framework for the creation of both the short-term and long-term changes in cerebellar output.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XmkFrsWZKic&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Multiplane calcium imaging reveals disrupted development of network topology in zebrafish pcdh19 mutants</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Functional brain networks self-assemble during development, although the molecular basis of network assembly is poorly understood. &lt;i&gt;Protocadherin-19&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;pcdh19&lt;/i&gt;) is a homophilic cell adhesion molecule that is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, and influences multiple cellular and developmental events in zebrafish. Although loss of &lt;i&gt;PCDH19&lt;/i&gt; in humans and model organisms leads to functional deficits, the underlying network defects remain unknown. Here, we employ multiplane, resonant-scanning &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon calcium imaging of developing zebrafish, and use graph theory to characterize the development of resting state functional networks in both wild type and &lt;i&gt;pcdh19&lt;/i&gt; mutant larvae. We find that the brain networks of &lt;i&gt;pcdh19&lt;/i&gt; mutants display enhanced clustering and an altered developmental trajectory of network assembly. Our results show that functional imaging and network analysis in zebrafish larvae is an effective approach for characterizing the developmental impact of lesions in genes of clinical interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Non-clustered protocadherins are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders that include microcephaly, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy. In humans, mutations in &lt;i&gt;PCDH19&lt;/i&gt; cause a female limited form of infantile epileptic encephalopathy and are associated with an increased incidence of schizophrenia and autism. In this study, we use large-scale calcium imaging to reveal that mutations in zebrafish &lt;i&gt;pcdh19&lt;/i&gt; alter the development of brain network topology. This work is the first to use functional imaging to explore the effects of a clinically relevant mutation on brain-wide network assembly &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We show that graph analysis of spontaneous network activity is a sensitive method for revealing subtle changes to network architecture in response to genetic perturbations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Optimal interplay between synaptic strengths and network structure enhances activity fluctuations and information propagation in hierarchical modular networks. (arXiv:1905.01181v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In network models of spiking neurons, the coupled impact of network structure
and synaptic parameters on activity propagation is still an open problem. For
spiking networks with hierarchical modular topology, we show that slow
spike-train fluctuations emerge due to the increase of either the global
synaptic strength parameter or the network hierarchical level, while the
network size remains constant. Through an information-theoretical approach we
show that information propagation of activity among adjacent modules is
enhanced as the number of modules increases until an optimal value is reached
and then decreases. This suggests that there is an optimal interplay between
hierarchical level and synaptic strengths for information propagation among
modules, but we also found that information transfer measured from the
spike-trains differs from this one indicating that modular organization
restructures information communicated in the mesoscopic level. By examining the
increase of synaptic strengths and number of modules we find that the network
behavior changes following different mechanisms: (1) increase of
autocorrelations among individual neurons, and (2) increase of
cross-correlations among pairs of neurons, respectively. The latter being
better for information propagation. Our results have important implications and
suggest roles that link topological features and synaptic levels to the
transmission of information in cortical networks.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01173</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present a novel method for analysis and segmentation of
laminar structure of the cortex based on tissue characteristics whose change
across the gray matter facilitates distinction between cortical layers. We
develop and analyze features of individual neurons to investigate changes in
architectonic differentiation and present a novel high-performance, automated
tree-ensemble method trained on data manually labeled by three human
investigators. From the location and basic measures of neurons, more complex
features are developed and used in machine learning models for automatic
segmentation of cortical layers. Tree ensembles are used on data manually
labeled by three human experts. The most accurate classification results were
obtained by training three models separately and creating another ensemble by
combining probability outputs for final neuron layer classification.
Measurement of importances of developed neuron features on both global model
level and individual prediction level are obtained.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Stronger Functional Connectivity in the Default Mode and Salience Networks Is Associated With Youthful Memory in Superaging</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;“Superagers” are older adults who, despite their advanced age, maintain youthful memory. Previous morphometry studies revealed multiple default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) regions whose cortical thickness is greater in superagers and correlates with memory performance. In this study, we examined the intrinsic functional connectivity within DMN and SN in 41 young (24.5 ± 3.6 years old) and 40 older adults (66.9 ± 5.5 years old). Superaging was defined as youthful performance on a memory recall task, the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Participants underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan and performed a separate visual–verbal recognition memory task. As predicted, within both DMN and SN, superagers had stronger connectivity compared with typical older adults and similar connectivity compared with young adults. Superagers also performed similarly to young adults and better than typical older adults on the recognition task, demonstrating youthful episodic memory that generalized across memory tasks. Stronger connectivity within each network independently predicted better performance on both the CVLT and recognition task in older adults. Variation in intrinsic connectivity explained unique variance in memory performance, above and beyond youthful neuroanatomy. These results extend our understanding of the neural basis of superaging as a model of successful aging.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Immunoglobulin A is a class of antibodies produced by the adaptive immune system and secreted into the gut lumen to fight pathogenic bacteria. We recently demonstrated that the main physical effect of these antibodies is to enchain daughter bacteria, i.e. to cross-link bacteria into clusters as they divide, preventing them from interacting with epithelial cells, thus protecting the host. These links between bacteria may break over time. We study several models using analytical and numerical calculations. We obtain the resulting distribution of chain sizes, that we compare with experimental data. We study the rate of increase in the number of free bacteria as a function of the replication rate of bacteria. Our models show robustly that at higher replication rates, bacteria replicate before the link between daughter bacteria breaks, leading to growing cluster sizes. On the contrary at low growth rates two daughter bacteria have a high probability to break apart. Thus the gut could produce IgA against all the bacteria it has encountered, but the most affected bacteria would be the fast replicating ones, that are more likely to destabilize the microbiota. Linking the effect of the immune effectors (here the clustering) with a property directly relevant to the potential bacterial pathogeneicity (here the replication rate) could avoid to make complex decisions about which bacteria to produce effectors against.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CPWkFKxDiJw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Amplitude cancellation influences the association between frequency components in the neural drive to muscle and the rectified EMG signal</title>

The rectified surface EMG signal is commonly used as an estimator of the neural drive to muscles and therefore to infer sources of synaptic input to motor neurons. Loss of EMG amplitude due to the overlap of motor unit action potentials (amplitude cancellation), however, may distort the spectrum of the rectified EMG and thereby its correlation with the neural drive. In this study, we investigated the impact of amplitude cancelation on this correlation using analytical derivations and a computational model of motor neuron activity, force, and the EMG signal. First, we demonstrated analytically that an ideal rectified EMG signal without amplitude cancellation (EMG&lt;sub&gt;nc&lt;/sub&gt;) is superior to the actual rectified EMG signal as estimator of the neural drive to muscle. This observation was confirmed by the simulations, as the average coefficient of determination (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) between the neural drive in the 1–30 Hz band and EMG&lt;sub&gt;nc&lt;/sub&gt; (0.59±0.08) was matched by the correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive only when the level of amplitude cancellation was low (&amp;lt;40%) at low contraction levels (&amp;lt;5% of maximum voluntary contraction force; MVC). This correlation, however, decreased linearly with amplitude cancellation (r = -0.83) to values of r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;lt;0.2 at amplitude cancellation levels &amp;gt;60% (contraction levels &amp;gt;15% MVC). Moreover, the simulations showed that a stronger (i.e. more variable) neural drive implied a stronger correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive and that amplitude cancellation distorted this correlation mainly for low-frequency components (&amp;lt;5 Hz) of the neural drive. In conclusion, the results indicate that amplitude cancellation distorts the spectrum of the rectified EMG signal. This implies that valid use of the rectified EMG as an estimator of the neural drive requires low contraction levels and/or strong common synaptic input to the motor neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jQRqrSKduuY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genome-scale metabolic models have become a fundamental tool for examining metabolic principles. However, metabolism is not solely characterized by the underlying biochemical reactions and catalyzing enzymes, but also affected by regulatory events. Since the pioneering work of Covert and co-workers as well as Shlomi and co-workers it is debated, how regulation and metabolism synergistically characterize a coherent cellular state. The first approaches started from metabolic models, which were extended by the regulation of the encoding genes of the catalyzing enzymes. By now, bioinformatics databases in principle allow addressing the challenge of integrating regulation and metabolism on a system-wide level. Collecting information from several databases we provide a network representation of the integrated gene regulatory and metabolic system for &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, including major cellular processes, from metabolic processes via protein modification to a variety of regulatory events. Besides transcriptional regulation, we also take into account regulation of translation, enzyme activities and reactions. Our network model provides novel topological characterizations of system components based on their positions in the network. We show that network characteristics suggest a representation of the integrated system as three network domains (regulatory, metabolic and interface networks) instead of two. This new three-domain representation reveals the structural centrality of components with known high functional relevance. This integrated network can serve as a platform for understanding coherent cellular states as active subnetworks and to elucidate crossover effects between metabolism and gene regulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2aPbvpghPPY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: How Dendrites Affect Online Recognition Memory</title>

In order to record the stream of autobiographical information that defines our unique personal history, our brains must form durable memories from single brief exposures to the patterned stimuli that impinge on them continuously throughout life. However, little is known about the computational strategies or neural mechanisms that underlie the brain's ability to perform this type of &quot;online&quot; learning. Based on increasing evidence that dendrites act as both signaling and learning units in the brain, we developed an analytical model that relates online recognition memory capacity to roughly a dozen dendritic, network, pattern, and task-related parameters. We used the model to determine what dendrite size maximizes storage capacity under varying assumptions about pattern density and noise level. We show that over a several-fold range of both of these parameters, and over multiple orders-of-magnitude of memory size, capacity is maximized when dendrites contain a few hundred synapses—roughly the natural number found in memory-related areas of the brain. Thus, in comparison to entire neurons, dendrites increase storage capacity by providing a larger number of better-sized learning units. Our model provides the first normative theory that explains how dendrites increase the brain’s capacity for online learning; predicts which combinations of parameter settings we should expect to find in the brain under normal operating conditions; leads to novel interpretations of an array of existing experimental results; and provides a tool for understanding which changes associated with neurological disorders, aging, or stress are most likely to produce memory deficits—knowledge that could eventually help in the design of improved clinical treatments for memory loss.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x35HjJZIH_M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Midbrain dopamine seems to play an outsized role in motivated behavior and learning. Widely associated with mediating reward-related behavior, decision making, and learning, dopamine continues to generate controversies in the field. While many studies and theories focus on what dopamine cells encode, the question of how the midbrain derives the information it encodes is poorly understood and comparatively less addressed. Recent anatomical studies suggest greater diversity and complexity of afferent inputs than previously appreciated, requiring rethinking of prior models. Here, we elaborate a hypothesis that construes midbrain dopamine as implementing a Bayesian selector in which individual dopamine cells sample afferent activity across distributed brain substrates, comprising evidence to be evaluated on the extent to which stimuli in the on-going sensorimotor stream organizes distributed, parallel processing, reflecting implicit value. To effectively generate a temporally resolved phasic signal, a population of dopamine cells must exhibit synchronous activity. We argue that synchronous activity across a population of dopamine cells signals consensus across distributed afferent substrates, invigorating responding to recognized opportunities and facilitating further learning. In framing our hypothesis, we shift from the question of how value is computed to the broader question of how the brain achieves coordination across distributed, parallel processing. We posit the midbrain is part of an &quot;axis of agency&quot; in which the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basal ganglia (BGS), and midbrain form an axis mediating control, coordination, and consensus, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Identification of immediate early genes in the nervous system of snail Helix lucorum</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Immediate early genes (IEGs) are useful markers of neuronal activation and essential components of neuronal response. While studies of gastropods have provided many insights into the basic learning and memory mechanisms, the genome-wide assessment of IEGs has been mainly restricted to vertebrates. In this study we identified IEGs in the terrestrial snail &lt;i&gt;Helix lucorum&lt;/i&gt;. In the absence of the genome, we conducted &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome assembly using reads with short and intermediate lengths cumulatively covering more than 98 billion nucleotides. Based on this assembly, we identified 37 proteins corresponding to contigs differentially expressed in either the parietal ganglia or two giant interneurons located within the parietal ganglia of the snail in response to the neuronal stimulation. These proteins included homologues of well-known mammalian IEGs, such as &lt;i&gt;c-jun/jund&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C/EBP&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;c-fos/fosl2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Egr1&lt;/i&gt;, as well as homologues of genes not yet implicated in the neuronal response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Gastropods, which include snails and slugs, are widely used in studies of basic neuronal activity mechanisms. The first step of the transcriptional response to neuronal stimulation requires the activation of immediate early genes (IEGs). The identification of IEGs is important for the understanding of neuronal response mechanisms and for the visualization of activated neurons. However, genome-wide studies of IEGs have thus far been mainly restricted to vertebrates. Furthermore, a study of activity-regulated genes, a gene group that includes IEGs, conducted in fruit flies did not reveal a clear overlap with vertebrate IEGs. In this study we present a transcriptome-wide study of snail IEGs, which reveals multiple homologues of well-known mammalian IEGs, as well as a number of novel IEG candidates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25488?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X‐linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder caused by a single mutation: SINE‐VNTR‐Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion in &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt;. Recently, a (CCCTCT)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; repeat within the SVA insertion has been reported as an age‐at‐onset (AAO) modifier in XDP. Here we investigate the role of this hexanucleotide repeat in modifying expressivity of XDP.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We genotyped the hexanucleotide repeat in 355 XDP patients and correlated the repeat number (RN) with AAO (n = 295), initial clinical manifestation (n = 294), site of dystonia onset (n = 238), disease severity (n = 28), and cognitive function (n = 15). Furthermore, we investigated i) repeat instability by segregation analysis and Southern blotting using postmortem brain samples from two affected individuals and ii) relative &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; expression in blood RNA from 31 XDP patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RN showed significant inverse correlations with AAO and with &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; expression and a positive correlation with disease severity and cognitive dysfunction. Importantly, AAO (and not RN) was directly associated with whether dystonia or parkinsonism will manifest at onset. RN was lower in patients affected by mouth/tongue dystonia compared with blepharospasm. RN was unstable across germline transmissions with an overall tendency to increase in length and exhibited somatic mosaicism in brain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hexanucleotide repeat within the SVA insertion acts as a genetic modifier of disease expressivity in XDP. RN‐dependent &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; repression and subsequent differences in &lt;i&gt;TAF1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA levels in patients may be potentiated in the brain through somatic variability leading to the neurological phenotype.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Extraciliary roles of the ciliopathy protein JBTS17 in mitosis and neurogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25491?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;JBTS17&lt;/i&gt; is a major gene mutated in ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome and oral–facial–digital syndrome type VI. Most patients with loss of function mutations in &lt;i&gt;JBTS17&lt;/i&gt; exhibit cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and brainstem malformation. However, some patients with &lt;i&gt;JBTS17&lt;/i&gt; mutations show microcephaly and abnormal gyration. We examined potential roles of JBTS17 in neurogenesis to understand the pathological mechanism of JBTS17‐related cortical abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We examined subcellular localization and cell‐cycle–dependent expression of JBTS17 proteins using anti‐JBTS17 antibodies and JBTS17 expression vectors. We also performed knockdown experiments to determined roles of JBTS17 in human cells, and demonstrated mitotic functions of JBTS17 using immunostaining and live imaging. We examined the involvement of JBTS17 in cortical neurogenesis using a mouse in utero electroporation technique.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that JBTS17 localizes to the kinetochore and the level of JBTS17 is regulated by cell‐cycle–dependent proteolysis. Depletion of JBTS17 disrupts chromosome alignment and spindle pole orientation, resulting in mitotic delay. JBTS17 interacts with LIS1 and influences LIS1 localization. Depletion of Jbts17 in the developing mouse cortex interferes with the mitotic progression of neural progenitors and the migration of postmitotic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LIS1 is implicated in lissencephaly, but altered dosage of LIS1 has been also associated with microcephaly syndromes. Our results suggest that JBTS17 contributes to mitotic progression by interacting with LIS1, and abnormal mitosis is an underlying mechanism of the microcephaly phenotype in JBTS17‐related ciliopathies. We propose that understanding extraciliary roles of ciliopathy proteins is important to elucidate pathological mechanisms underlying diverse ciliopathy phenotypes.

	<description>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) causes severe distress and is therefore counted by the WHO as one of the ten most impairing illnesses. There is evidence for a strong genetic under-pinning especially in early onset OCD. Though several genes involved in neurotransmission have been reported as candidates there is still need to identify new pathways. In this study, we focussed on genetic variants of the Neuropetide Y (NPY) system. NPY is one of the most abundant neuropeptides in the human brain with emerging evidence of capacity to modulate stress response, which is of high relevance in OCD. We focussed on tag-SNPs of NPY and its receptor gene NPY1R in a family-based approach. The sample comprised 86 patients (children and adolescents) with early onset OCD with both their biological parents. However, this first study on genetic variants of the NPY-system could not confirm association between the investi-gated SNPs and early onset OCD.</description>

	<description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive mental illness characterized by memory loss and multiple cognitive impairments. In the last several decades, significant progress has been made in understanding basic biology, molecular mechanisms, and development of biomarkers and therapeutic drugs. Multiple cellular changes are implicated in the disease process including amyloid beta and phosphorylation of tau synaptic damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. Among these, amyloid beta is considered a major player in the disease process. Recent advancements in molecular biology revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) are considered potential biomarkers in AD with a focus on amyloid beta.  In this article we discussed several aspects of AD including its prevalence, classifications, risk factors, and amyloid species &amp;amp; their accumulation in subcellular compartments. This article also discusses the discovery and biogenesis of miRNAs and their relevance to AD. Today’s research continues to add to the wealth of miRNA data that has been accumulated, however, there still lacks clear-cut understanding of the physiological relevance of miRNAs to AD. MiRNAs appear to regulate translation of gene products in AD and other human diseases. However, the mechanism of how many of these miRNAs regulate both the 5’ and 3’UTR of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing is still being extrapolated. Hence, we still need more research on miRNAs and APP/amyloid beta formation in the progression and pathogenesis of AD.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Association Between Connectivity of Hippocampal Sub-Regions and Auditory Verbal Hallucinations in Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00424</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00424</link>
	<description>Background: Hippocampal dysconnectivity has been detected in schizophrenia patients with auditory verbal hallucinations. Neuroanatomical evidence has indicated distinct sub-regions in the hippocampus, but which sub-regions within the hippocampus may emerge dysfunction in the brain network, and the relationship between connection strength and the severity of this debilitating disease have yet to be revealed. Masked independent component analysis (mICA), i.e., ICA restricted to a defined region of interest, can provide insight into observing local functional connectivity in a particular brain region. We aim to map out the sub-regions in the hippocampus with dysconnectivity linked to auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia.
Methods: In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study of schizophrenia patients with (n = 57) and without (n = 83) auditory verbal hallucinations, and 71 healthy controls, we first examined hippocampal connectivity using mICA, and then the correlation between connection metric and clinical severity was generated.
Results: As compared with patients without auditory verbal hallucinations, mICA showed a group of hyper-connections for the left middle part, as well as another group of hypo-connections for the bilateral antero-lateral and right antero-medial parts in patients with auditory verbal hallucinations. Connectivity was linked to the clinical symptoms scores in the sample of patients with auditory verbal hallucinations.
Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the left middle part is more densely connected, but the bilateral antero-lateral and right antero-medial parts are more sparsely connected in schizophrenia patients with auditory verbal hallucinations. The findings in the present study show proof of precious location in the hippocampus mediating the neural mechanism behind auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Unraveling Diagnostic Biomarkers of Schizophrenia Through Structure-Revealing Fusion of Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Data</title>

	<description>Fusing complementary information from different modalities can lead to the discovery of more accurate diagnostic biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. However, biomarker discovery through data fusion is challenging since it requires extracting interpretable and reproducible patterns from data sets, consisting of shared/unshared patterns and of different orders. For example, multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals from multiple subjects can be represented as a third-order tensor with modes: subject, time, and channel, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data may be in the form of subject by voxel matrices. Traditional data fusion methods rearrange higher-order tensors, such as EEG, as matrices to use matrix factorization-based approaches. In contrast, fusion methods based on coupled matrix and tensor factorizations (CMTF) exploit the potential multi-way structure of higher-order tensors. The CMTF approach has been shown to capture underlying patterns more accurately without imposing strong constraints on the latent neural patterns, i.e., biomarkers. In this paper, EEG, fMRI and structural MRI (sMRI) data collected during an auditory oddball task (AOD) from a group of subjects consisting of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, are arranged as matrices and higher-order tensors coupled along the subject mode, and jointly analyzed using structure-revealing CMTF methods (also known as advanced CMTF (ACMTF)) focusing on unique identification of underlying patterns in the presence of shared/unshared patterns. We demonstrate that joint analysis of the EEG tensor and fMRI matrix using ACMTF reveals significant and biologically meaningful components in terms of differentiating between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls while also providing spatial patterns with high resolution and improving the clustering performance compared to the analysis of only the EEG tensor. We also show that these patterns are reproducible, and study reproducibility for different model parameters. In comparison to the joint independent component analysis (jICA) data fusion approach, ACMTF provides easier interpretation of EEG data by revealing a single summary map of the topography for each component. Furthermore, fusion of sMRI data with EEG and fMRI through an ACMTF model provides structural patterns; however, we also show that when fusing data sets from multiple modalities, hence of very different nature, preprocessing plays a crucial role.</description>

	<description>There have always been practical demands for objective and accurate assessment of muscle spasticity beyond its clinical routine. A novel regression-based framework for quantitative assessment of muscle spasticity is proposed in this paper using wearable surface electromyogram (EMG) and inertial sensors combined with a simple examination procedure. Sixteen subjects with elbow flexor or extensor (i.e., biceps brachii muscle or triceps brachii muscle) spasticity and eight healthy subjects were recruited for the study. The sEMG and inertial data were recorded from each subject when a series of passive elbow stretches with different stretch velocities were conducted. In the proposed framework, both lambda model and kinematic model were constructed from the recorded data, and biomarkers were extracted respectively from the two models to describe the neurogenic component and biomechanical component of the muscle spasticity, respectively. Subsequently, three evaluation methods using supervised machine learning algorithms including single-/multi-variable linear regression and support vector regression (SVR) were applied to calibrate biomarkers from each single model or combination of two models into evaluation scores. Each of these evaluation scores can be regarded as a prediction of the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) grades for spasticity assessment with the same meaning and clinical interpretation. In order to validate performance of three proposed methods within the framework, a 24-fold leave-one-out cross validation was conducted for each of all subjects. Both methods with each individual model achieved satisfactory performance, with low mean square error (MSE, 0.14 and 0.47) between the resultant evaluation score and the MAS. By contrast, the method using SVR to fuse biomarkers from both models outperformed other two methods with the lowest MSE at 0.059. The experimental results demonstrated the usability and feasibility of the proposed framework, and it provides an objective, quantitative and convenient solution to spasticity assessment, suitable for clinical, community and home-based rehabilitation.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Stabilization of Brain Mast Cells Alleviates LPS-Induced Neuroinflammation by Inhibiting Microglia Activation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00191</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00191</link>
	<description>Background
The functional aspects of mast cell-microglia interactions are important in neuroinflammation. We have previously found that mast cell degranulation could directly induce microglia activation. However, the role of mast cell in LPS-induced microglia activation, neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment has not been clarified.
Methods
We studied brain microglia and mast cells interaction by site-directed injection of cromolyn in rat right hypothalamus using stereotaxic techniques. TFC and Y maze were used to assess cognitive function. Mast cells were stained by toluidine blue and calculated with Cell D software. Microglia activation was assessed by Iba1 immunohistochemistry. Conditioned medium from activated P815 cells induces microglial activation. The levels of cytokines were measured with Milliplex kit. Cell signalling was analysed by Western blotting.
Results
We find that “Mast cell stabilizer” cromolyn can ameliorate LPS-induced mast cells degranulation and cognitive dysfunction, and stabilization of mast cell is able to inhibit LPS-induced microglia activation, inflammatory factors release and MAPK, AKT and NF-κB signaling pathway activation in vivo and in vitro. Further LPS IP injection for 24 h induces significant microglia activation in the hypothalamus of the WT mice but has little effect on the microglia activation in KitW-sh/W-sh mice. We also find that LPS selectively provokes upregulation of expressions of H1R, H4R, PAR2, and TLR4, but deregulation of H2R and H3R expressions in the ipsilateral hypothalamus microglia, which was partially inhibits by cromolyn.
Conclusions
Taken together, our study provides evidence that stabilization of mast cells can inhibit LPS-induced neuroinflammation and memory impairment. Investigating the role of mast cell activation in neuroinflammation is an emerging new area to understand and effectively treat neuroinflammation-related diseases.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Is Involved in Stress-Induced Hypothalamic Neuronal Injury in Rats via the PERK-ATF4-CHOP and IRE1-ASK1-JNK Pathways</title>

	<description>Objective: As a high-level nerve center that regulates visceral and endocrine activity, the hypothalamus plays an important role in regulating the body’s stress response. Previous studies have shown that stress can cause damage to hypothalamic neurons. The present study aimed to further clarify the mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum stress involvement in hypothalamic neuronal injury.
Methods: A 7-day stressed rat model was established with daily restraining for 8 h and forced ice-water swimming for 5 min. The rats were randomly divided into control, stress, stress + GSK2606414 (PERK phosphorylation inhibitor), stress + KIRA6 (IRE1 phosphokinase activity inhibitor), GSK2606414 and KIRA6 groups. The pathological changes of hypothalamic neurons were observed by thionine staining. Expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress proteins GRP78, ATF4, ASK1, JNK and CHOP in the hypothalamic neurons were observed by immunohistochemical staining. The expression of JNK and CHOP mRNA in the hypothalamic neurons were observed by RNA in situ hybridization (RNA Scope), and the expression of related proteins and mRNA was semiquantitatively analyzed by microscopy-based multicolor tissue cytometry (MMTC).
Results: Thionine staining revealed that stress exposure resulted in edema, a lack of Nissl bodies, and pyknosis in hypothalamic neurons. Immunohistochemistry and RNA Scope showed that stress exposure significantly increased the expression of GRP78, ATF4, ASK1, CHOP, JNK, JNK mRNA and CHOP mRNA. Treatment with PERK and IRE1 inhibitors attenuated pathological damage and downregulated the expression of ATF4, ASK1, JNK, CHOP, JNK mRNA and CHOP mRNA.
Conclusion: Stress caused pathological changes in rat hypothalamic neurons. Endoplasmic reticulum stress PERK-ATF4-CHOP and IRE1-ASK1-JNK pathways were involved in the injury process.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Combined Effect of Fatty Diet and Cognitive Decline on Brain Metabolism, Food Intake, Body Weight, and Counteraction by Intranasal Insulin Therapy in 3×Tg Mice</title>

	<description>Obesity and cognitive decline can occur in association. Brain dysmetabolism and insulin resistance might be common underlying traits. We aimed to examine the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on cognitive decline, and of cognitive impairment on food intake and body-weight, and explore efficacy of chronic intranasal insulin (INI) therapy.
We used control (C) and triple transgenic mice (3xTg, a model of Alzheimers’ pathology) to measure cerebral mass, glucose metabolism, and the metabolic response to acute intranasal insulin administration (cerebral insulin sensitivity). Y-Maze, positron emission-computed tomography, and histology were employed in 8 and 14-month-old mice, receiving normal diet (ND) or HFD. Chronic INI therapy was tested in an additional 3xTg-HFD group.
The 3xTg groups overate, and had lower body-weight, but similar BMI, than diet-matched controls. Cognitive decline was progressive from HFD to 3xTg-ND to 3xTg-HFD. At 8 months, brain fasting glucose uptake was increased by C-HFD, and this effect was blunted in 3xTg-HFD mice, also showing brain insulin resistance. Brain mass was reduced in 3xTg mice at 14 months. Dentate gyrus dimensions paralleled cognitive findings. Chronic INI preserved cognition, dentate gyrus and metabolism, reducing food intake and body weight in 3xTg-HFD mice. Peripherally, leptin was suppressed and PAI-1 elevated in 3xTg mice, correlating inversely with cerebral glucose uptake.
In conclusion, 3xTg background and HFD exert additive (genes*lifestyle) detriment to the brain, and cognitive dysfunction is accompanied by increased food intake in 3xTg mice. PAI-1 levels and leptin deficiency were identified as potential peripheral contributors. Chronic INI improved peripheral and central outcomes.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Phagocytosis of Apoptotic Cells Is Specifically Upregulated in ApoE4 Expressing Microglia in vitro</title>

	<description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by intracellular tau aggregates and extracellular deposition of amyloid-ß (Aß). The major genetic risk factor to develop AD is the Apolipoprotein E isoform 4 (ApoE4). ApoE4 may directly affect Aß pathology, yet the exact role of ApoE4 in the progression of AD remains unclear. Although astrocytes are the main source of ApoE in brain tissue, other cell types might contribute to ApoE isotype-dependent effects. While ApoE expression does not play a relevant role in homeostatic microglia, we and others could recently show that ApoE expression is significant upregulated in disease-associated microglia including AD-mouse models and human AD. ApoE has been supposed to have an anti-inflammatory effect, with ApoE4 being less effective than ApoE3. However, ApoE-isotype specific effects on microglia function in disease have not been thoroughly investigated to date. In contrast to this, the role of ApoE2, the third most common major ApoE isoform, in neurodegeneration has not been characterized in detail, but it has been shown to delay the onset of disease in familial AD. To elucidate the differential roles of the three-major human ApoE isoforms on microglia function we each expressed the human ApoE isoforms in murine N9 microglia cells. We could show that ApoE4 specifically influences actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and morphology. In migration assays, ApoE4 significantly promotes cell motility. To quantify phagocytosis by microglia we established an uptake assay based on imaging flow cytometry. Although expression of ApoE4 led to significantly reduced uptake of Aß in contrast to the other isoforms, we could show that ApoE4 specifically increased phagocytosis of apoptotic neuronal cells. Our findings show that ApoE4 intrinsically affects microglia physiology by upregulating motility and phagocytic behavior in vitro and may therefore specifically contribute to microglia dysregulation in AD.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Kcnab1 Is Expressed in Subplate Neurons With Unilateral Long-Range Inter-Areal Projections</title>

	<description>Subplate (SP) neurons are among the earliest-born neurons in the cerebral cortex and heterogeneous in terms of gene expression. SP neurons consist mainly of projection neurons, which begin to extend their axons to specific target areas very early during development. However, the relationships between axon projection and gene expression patterns of the SP neurons, and their remnant layer 6b (L6b) neurons, are largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the corticocortical projections of L6b/SP neurons in the mouse cortex and searched for a marker gene expressed in L6b/SP neurons that have ipsilateral inter-areal projections. Retrograde tracing experiments demonstrated that L6b/SP neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) projected to the primary motor cortex (M1) within the same cortical hemisphere at postnatal day (PD) 2 but did not show any callosal projection. This unilateral projection pattern persisted into adulthood. Our microarray analysis identified the gene encoding a β subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel (Kcnab1) as being expressed in L6b/SP. Double labeling with retrograde tracing and in situ hybridization demonstrated that Kcnab1 was expressed in the unilaterally-projecting neurons in L6b/SP. Embryonic expression was specifically detected in the SP as early as embryonic day (E) 14.5, shortly after the emergence of subplate. Double immunostaining experiments revealed different degrees of co-expression of the protein product Kvβ1 with L6b/SP markers Ctgf (88%), Cplx3 (79%), and Nurr1 (58%), suggesting molecular subdivision of unilaterally-projecting L6b/SP neurons. In addition to expression in L6b/SP, scattered expression of Kcnab1 was observed during postnatal stages without layer specificity. Among splicing variants with three alternative first exons, the variant 1.1 explained all the cortical expression mentioned in this study. Together, our data suggest that L6b/SP neurons have corticocortical projections and Kcnab1 expression defines a subpopulation of L6b/SP neurons with a unilateral inter-areal projection.</description>

	<description>We investigated whether P300-ERP and cognitive test performance differ for age, sex and education in two groups of healthy elderly, and verified whether any correlations exist between P300 amplitude and latency and grey matter volume using whole brain voxel-by-voxel-based mapping, controlling for age, education, sex and Total Intracranial Volume (TIV). We used 32 channel electroencephalograms (EEG) to record the P300 responses and 3T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to determine grey matter volume. We recruited 36 native-Dutch speaking healthy older subjects, equally divided in two sub-groups of 52-64 and 65-76 years old, administered a battery of cognitive tests and recorded their demographics, EEGs and task performance; additionally, 16 adults from the second sub-group underwent an MRI scan. We found significant differences between age groups in their cognitive tests performance, P300 amplitudes for the frontal and parietal electrodes for the most difficult task, and P300 latencies for frontal, central and parietal electrodes for all three tasks difficulty levels. Interesting, sex and education affected cognitive and P300 results. Higher education was related to higher accuracy, and P300 amplitudes and shorter latencies. Moreover, females exhibited higher P300 amplitudes and shorter latencies, and better cognitive tasks performance compared to males. Additionally, for the 16 adults underwent to MRI scan, we found positive correlations between P300 characteristics in frontal, central and parietal areas and grey matter volume, controlling for demographic variables and TIV, but also showing that age, sex and education correlate with grey matter volume. These findings provide support that age, sex and education affect an individual’s cognitive, neurophysiological and structural characteristics, and therefore motivate the need to further investigate these in relation to P300 responses and grey matter volume in healthy elderly.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Glutamine Transporter Slc38a1 Regulates GABAergic Neurotransmission and Synaptic Plasticity</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;GABA signaling sustains fundamental brain functions, from nervous system development to the synchronization of population activity and synaptic plasticity. Despite these pivotal features, molecular determinants underscoring the rapid and cell-autonomous replenishment of the vesicular neurotransmitter GABA and its impact on synaptic plasticity remain elusive. Here, we show that genetic disruption of the glutamine transporter Slc38a1 in mice hampers GABA synthesis, modifies synaptic vesicle morphology in GABAergic presynapses and impairs critical period plasticity. We demonstrate that Slc38a1-mediated glutamine transport regulates vesicular GABA content, induces high-frequency membrane oscillations and shapes cortical processing and plasticity. Taken together, this work shows that Slc38a1 is not merely a transporter accumulating glutamine for metabolic purposes, but a key component regulating several neuronal functions.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Studies of sensory loss are a model for understanding the functional flexibility of human cortex. In congenital blindness, subsets of visual cortex are recruited during higher-cognitive tasks, such as language and math tasks. Is such dramatic functional repurposing possible throughout the lifespan or restricted to sensitive periods in development? We compared visual cortex function in individuals who lost their vision as adults (after age 17) to congenitally blind and sighted blindfolded adults. Participants took part in resting-state and task-based fMRI scans during which they solved math equations of varying difficulty and judged the meanings of sentences. Blindness at any age caused “visual” cortices to synchronize with specific frontoparietal networks at rest. However, in task-based data, visual cortices showed regional specialization for math and language and load-dependent activity only in congenital blindness. Thus, despite the presence of long-range functional connectivity, cognitive repurposing of human cortex is limited by sensitive periods.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling of the axon plasma membrane structure and its effects on protein diffusion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yihao Zhang, Anastasios V. Tzingounis, George Lykotrafitis&lt;/p&gt;

The axon plasma membrane consists of the membrane skeleton, which comprises ring-like actin filaments connected to each other by spectrin tetramers, and the lipid bilayer, which is tethered to the skeleton via, at least, ankyrin. Currently it is unknown whether this unique axon plasma membrane skeleton (APMS) sets the diffusion rules of lipids and proteins in the axon. To answer this question, we developed a coarse-grain molecular dynamics model for the axon that includes the APMS, the phospholipid bilayer, transmembrane proteins (TMPs), and integral monotopic proteins (IMPs) in both the inner and outer lipid layers. We first showed that actin rings limit the longitudinal diffusion of TMPs and the IMPs of the inner leaflet but not of the IMPs of the outer leaflet. To reconcile the experimental observations, which show restricted diffusion of IMPs of the outer leaflet, with our simulations, we conjectured the existence of actin-anchored proteins that form a fence which restricts the longitudinal diffusion of IMPs of the outer leaflet. We also showed that spectrin filaments could modify transverse diffusion of TMPs and IMPs of the inner leaflet, depending on the strength of the association between lipids and spectrin. For instance, in areas where spectrin binds to the lipid bilayer, spectrin filaments would restrict diffusion of proteins within the skeleton corrals. In contrast, in areas where spectrin and lipids are not associated, spectrin modifies the diffusion of TMPs and IMPs of the inner leaflet from normal to confined-hop diffusion. Overall, we showed that diffusion of axon plasma membrane proteins is deeply anisotropic, as longitudinal diffusion is of different type than transverse diffusion. Finally, we investigated how accumulation of TMPs affects diffusion of TMPs and IMPs of both the inner and outer leaflets by changing the density of TMPs. We showed that the APMS structure acts as a fence that restricts the diffusion of TMPs and IMPs of the inner leaflet within the membrane skeleton corrals. Our findings provide insight into how the axon skeleton acts as diffusion barrier and maintains neuronal polarity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0rLv1_9yqa4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrathecal baclofen treatment is used for the treatment of dystonia in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy, however, the current level of evidence for the effect is low. The primary aim of this study was to provide evidence for the effect of intrathecal baclofen treatment on individual goals in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multi‐centre, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial was performed at two University Medical Centres in the Netherlands. Patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy (Gross Motor Functioning Classification System level IV‐V), aged 4 to 24, eligible for intrathecal baclofen, were included. Patients were assigned by block randomization (2:2) for treatment with intrathecal baclofen or placebo during three months via an implanted micro‐infusion pump. The primary outcome was Goal Attainment Scaling of individual treatment goals (GAS T‐score). A linear regression model was used for statistical analysis with study site as a covariate. Safety analyses were done for number and type of (serious) adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐six patients were recruited from January 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; 2013 to March 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; 2018. Data for final analysis were available for 17 in the intrathecal baclofen group and 16 patients in the placebo group. Mean (SD) GAS T‐score at three months was 38∙9 (13∙2) for intrathecal baclofen and 21∙0 (4∙6) for placebo (regression coefficient 17∙8, 95% CI 10∙4 to 25∙0, p&amp;lt;0∙001). Number and types of (serious) adverse events were similar between groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrathecal baclofen treatment is superior to placebo in achieving treatment goals in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested two hypotheses regarding age at onset within familial epilepsies: (1) family members with epilepsy tend to have similar ages at onset, independent of epilepsy syndrome; (2) age at onset is younger in successive generations after controlling for sampling bias.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed clinical data collected by the Epi4K Consortium (303 multiplex families, 1,120 individuals). To test hypothesis 1, we used both linear mixed models commonly used for heritability analysis and Cox regression models with frailty terms to assess clustering of onset within families after controlling for other predictors. To test hypothesis 2, we used mixed effects models, pair‐wise analyses, and survival analysis to address sampling‐related bias that may mimic anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Age at seizure onset was significantly heritable (ICC 0.17, p &amp;lt; 0.001) after adjusting for epilepsy type, sex, site, history of febrile seizure, and age at last observation. This finding remained significant after adjusting for epilepsy syndromes, and was robust across statistical methods in all families and in generalized families. (2) The mean age at onset decreased in successive generations (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). After adjusting for age at last observation, this effect was not significant in mixed‐effects models (p=0.14), but remained significant in pair‐wise (p=0.0003) and survival analyses (p=0.02).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age at seizure onset is an independent familial trait, and may have genetic determinants distinct from the determinants of particular epilepsy syndromes. Younger onsets in successive generations can be explained in part by sampling bias, but the presence of genetic anticipation cannot be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Similarity of Neural Network Representations Revisited. (arXiv:1905.00414v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent work has sought to understand the behavior of neural networks by
comparing representations between layers and between different trained models.
We examine methods for comparing neural network representations based on
canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We show that CCA belongs to a family of
statistics for measuring multivariate similarity, but that neither CCA nor any
other statistic that is invariant to invertible linear transformation can
measure meaningful similarities between representations of higher dimension
than the number of data points. We introduce a similarity index that measures
the relationship between representational similarity matrices and does not
suffer from this limitation. This similarity index is equivalent to centered
kernel alignment (CKA) and is also closely connected to CCA. Unlike CCA, CKA
can reliably identify correspondences between representations in networks
trained from different initializations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Gradient-free activation maximization for identifying effective stimuli. (arXiv:1905.00378v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental question for understanding brain function is what types of
stimuli drive neurons to fire. In visual neuroscience, this question has also
been posted as characterizing the receptive field of a neuron. The search for
effective stimuli has traditionally been based on a combination of insights
from previous studies, intuition, and luck. Recently, the same question has
emerged in the study of units in convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), and
together with this question a family of solutions were developed that are
generally referred to as &quot;feature visualization by activation maximization.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sought to bring in tools and techniques developed for studying ConvNets to
the study of biological neural networks. However, one key difference that
impedes direct translation of tools is that gradients can be obtained from
ConvNets using backpropagation, but such gradients are not available from the
brain. To circumvent this problem, we developed a method for gradient-free
activation maximization by combining a generative neural network with a genetic
algorithm. We termed this method XDream (EXtending DeepDream with real-time
evolution for activation maximization), and we have shown that this method can
reliably create strong stimuli for neurons in the macaque visual cortex (Ponce
et al., 2019). In this paper, we describe extensive experiments characterizing
the XDream method by using ConvNet units as in silico models of neurons. We
show that XDream is applicable across network layers, architectures, and
training sets; examine design choices in the algorithm; and provide practical
guides for choosing hyperparameters in the algorithm. XDream is an efficient
algorithm for uncovering neuronal tuning preferences in black-box networks
using a vast and diverse stimulus space.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00319</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is becoming an important
method in the field of motor rehabilitation because of its ability to
non-invasively influence ongoing brain oscillations at arbitrary frequencies.
However, substantial variations in its effect across individuals are reported,
making tACS a currently unreliable treatment tool. One reason for this
variability is the lack of knowledge about the exact way tACS entrains and
interacts with ongoing brain oscillations. The present crossover stimulation
study on 20 healthy subjects contributes to the understanding of
cross-frequency effects of gamma (70 Hz) tACS over the contralateral motor
cortex by providing empirical evidence which is consistent with a role of low-
(12~-20 Hz) and high- (20-~30 Hz) beta power as a mediator of gamma-tACS on
motor performance.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Psychological and Physiological Part of Emotions: Multimodal Approximation for Valence Classification. (arXiv:1905.00231v1 [cs.HC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00231</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In order to develop more precise and functional affective applications, it is
necessary to achieve a balance between the psychology and the engineering
applied to emotions. Signals from the central and peripheral nervous systems
have been used for emotion recognition purposes, however, their operation and
the relationship between them remains unknown. In this context, in the present
work we have tried to approach the study of the psychobiology of both systems
in order to generate a computational model for the recognition of emotions in
the dimension of valence. To this end, the electroencephalography (EEG) signal,
electrocardiography (ECG) signal and skin temperature of 24 subjects have been
studied. Each methodology has been evaluated individually, finding
characteristic patterns of positive and negative emotions in each of them.
After feature selection of each methodology, the results of the classification
showed that, although the classification of emotions is possible at both
central and peripheral levels, the multimodal approach did not improve the
results obtained through the EEG alone. In addition, differences have been
observed between cerebral and physiological responses in the processing
emotions by separating the sample by sex; though, the differences between men
and women were only notable at the physiological level.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Functional Parcellation of Human Brain Precuneus Using Density-Based Clustering</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz086</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The human precuneus is involved in many high-level cognitive functions, which strongly suggests the existence of biologically meaningful subdivisions. However, the functional parcellation of the precuneus needs much to be investigated. In this study, we developed an eigen clustering (EIC) approach for the parcellation using precuneus–cortical functional connectivity from fMRI data of the Human Connectome Project. The EIC approach is robust to noise and can automatically determine the cluster number. It is consistently demonstrated that the human precuneus can be subdivided into six symmetrical and connected parcels. The anterior and posterior precuneus participate in sensorimotor and visual functions, respectively. The central precuneus with four subregions indicates a media role in the interaction of the default mode, dorsal attention, and frontoparietal control networks. The EIC-based functional parcellation is free of the spatial distance constraint and is more functionally coherent than parcellation using typical clustering algorithms. The precuneus subregions had high accordance with cortical morphology and revealed good functional segregation and integration characteristics in functional task-evoked activations. This study may shed new light on the human precuneus function at a delicate level and offer an alternative scheme for human brain parcellation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Differential Contribution of Cortical Thickness, Surface Area, and Gyrification to Fluid and Crystallized Intelligence</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Human intelligence can be broadly subdivided into fluid (g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;) and crystallized (g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;) intelligence, each tapping into distinct cognitive abilities. Although neuroanatomical correlates of intelligence have been previously studied, differential contribution of cortical morphologies to g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; and g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; has not been fully delineated. Here, we tried to disentangle the contribution of cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and cortical gyrification to g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; and g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; in a large sample of healthy young subjects (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 740, Human Connectome Project) with high-resolution MRIs, followed by replication in a separate data set with distinct cognitive measures indexing g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; and g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;. We found that while gyrification in distributed cortical regions had positive association with both g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; and g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;, surface area and thickness showed more regional associations. Specifically, higher performance in g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; was associated with cortical expansion in regions related to working memory, attention, and visuo-spatial processing, while g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; was associated with thinner cortex as well as higher cortical surface area in language-related networks. We discuss the results in a framework where “horizontal” cortical expansion enables higher resource allocation, computational capacity, and functional specificity relevant to g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; and g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;, while lower cortical thickness possibly reflects cortical pruning facilitating “vertical” intracolumnar efficiency in knowledge-based tasks relevant mostly to g&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Socioeconomic status (SES) is a multidimensional construct that includes not only measures of material wealth, but also education, social prestige, and neighborhood quality. Socioeconomic correlates between wealth and cognitive functions have been well established in behavioral studies. However, functional and structural brain correlates of SES remain unclear. Here, we sought to uncover the most likely neural regions to be affected by low SES, specifically associated with age. Using effect size–seed-based d Mapping, we compiled studies that examined individuals with low SES and performed functional magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry meta-analyses. The results revealed that as from early to late age, individuals exposed to low SES are less likely to have sustained executive network activity yet a greater likelihood to enhanced activity within reward-related regions. A similar activity was shown for gray matter volume across early to older age. These findings provide the first quantitative integration of neuroimaging results pertaining to the neural basis of SES. Hypoactivation of the executive network and hyperactivation of the reward network in low SES individuals may support the scarcity hypothesis and animal models of the effects of early adversity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Corrective Muscle Activity Reveals Subject-Specific Sensorimotor Recalibration</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies suggest that planned and corrective actions are recalibrated during some forms of motor adaptation. However, corrective (also known as reactive) movements in human locomotion are thought to simply reflect sudden environmental changes independently from sensorimotor recalibration. Thus, we asked whether corrective responses can indicate the motor system’s adapted state following prolonged exposure to a novel walking situation inducing sensorimotor adaptation. We recorded electromyographic (EMG) signals bilaterally on 15 leg muscles before, during, and after split-belts walking (i.e., novel walking situation), in which the legs move at different speeds. We exploited the rapid temporal dynamics of corrective responses upon unexpected speed transitions to isolate them from the overall motor output. We found that corrective muscle activity was structurally different following short versus long exposures to split-belts walking. Only after a long exposure, removal of the novel environment elicited corrective muscle patterns that matched those expected in response to a perturbation opposite to the one originally experienced. This indicated that individuals who recalibrated their motor system adopted split-belts environment as their new &quot;normal&quot; and transitioning back to the original walking environment causes subjects to react as if it was novel to them. Interestingly, this learning declined with age, but steady state modulation of muscle activity during split-belts walking did not, suggesting potentially different neural mechanisms underlying these motor patterns. Taken together, our results show that corrective motor commands reflect the adapted state of the motor system, which is less flexible as we age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Resetting the Respiratory Rhythm with a Spinal Central Pattern Generator</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that a variety of central and afferent stimuli, including swallowing, can produce phase resetting in the respiratory rhythmicity. Also, there are reports about the intrinsic linkage between locomotion and respiration. However, little is known about the interaction between the central pattern generators (CPGs) for scratching and respiration. The present study aims to examine whether the activation of scratching CPG produces phase resetting of the respiratory rhythm. We employed decerebrate cats to apply brief tactile stimuli to the pinna during the inspiratory-expiratory transition. We observed that those stimuli to the pinna not eliciting fictive scratching did not reset the respiratory rhythm. However, when the pinna stimuli elicited fictive scratching, then the respiratory rhythm exhibited a significant phase resetting. We also found interneurons in the medulla oblongata exhibiting phase resetting related to scratching-CPG episodes. This second finding suggests that this type of resetting involves brainstem components of the respiratory CPG. These results shed new light on the resetting action from a spinal CPG on the respiratory rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Restrained Dendritic Growth of Adult-Born Granule Cells Innervated by Transplanted Fetal GABAergic Interneurons in Mice with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0110-18.2019?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The dentate gyrus (DG) is a region of the adult rodent brain that undergoes continuous neurogenesis. Seizures and loss or dysfunction of GABAergic synapses onto adult-born dentate granule cells (GCs) alter their dendritic growth and migration, resulting in dysmorphic and hyperexcitable GCs. Additionally, transplants of fetal GABAergic interneurons in the DG of mice with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) result in seizure suppression, but it is unknown whether increasing interneurons with these transplants restores GABAergic innervation to adult-born GCs. Here, we address this question by birth-dating GCs with retrovirus at different times up to 12 weeks after pilocarpine-induced TLE in adult mice. Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2)-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)-expressing medial-ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived GABAergic interneurons from embryonic day (E)13.5 mouse embryos were transplanted into the DG of the TLE mice and GCs with transplant-derived inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) were identified by patch-clamp electrophysiology and optogenetic interrogation. Putative synaptic sites between GCs and GABAergic transplants were also confirmed by intracellular biocytin staining, immunohistochemistry, and confocal imaging. 3D reconstructions of dendritic arbors and quantitative morphometric analyses were carried out in &amp;gt;150 adult-born GCs. GABAergic inputs from transplanted interneurons correlated with markedly shorter GC dendrites, compared to GCs that were not innervated by the transplants. Moreover, these effects were confined to distal dendritic branches and a short time window of six to eight weeks. The effects were independent of seizures as they were also observed in naïve mice with MGE transplants. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that increased inhibitory currents over a smaller dendritic arbor in adult-born GCs may reduce their excitability and lead to seizure suppression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and an increase in oxidative damage, leading to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death. The oxidative status of RGCs is regulated intrinsically and also extrinsically by retinal glia. The mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) relieves oxidative and neuronal damage in a variety of neurodegenerative disease models. We hypothesized that deletion of &lt;i&gt;Ucp2&lt;/i&gt; in either RGCs or retinal glia would increase retinal damage and RGC death in a mouse model of glaucoma. Paradoxically, we found the reverse, and deletion of mitochondrial &lt;i&gt;Ucp2&lt;/i&gt; decreased oxidative protein modification and reduced RGC death in male and female mice. This paradox was resolved after finding that &lt;i&gt;Ucp2&lt;/i&gt; deletion also increased levels of mitophagy in cell culture and retinal tissue. Our data suggest that &lt;i&gt;Ucp2&lt;/i&gt; deletion facilitates increased mitochondrial function by improving quality control. An increase in mitochondrial function explains the resistance of &lt;i&gt;Ucp2&lt;/i&gt;-deleted retinas to glaucoma and may provide a therapeutic avenue for other chronic neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Many unsolved neurodegenerative conditions result from defects in mitochondrial function. Molecular tools that can manipulate mitochondria will therefore be central to developing neuroprotective therapies. Among the most potent regulators of mitochondrial function are the uncoupling proteins, particularly UCP2. In this manuscript, we show that, while loss of &lt;i&gt;Ucp2&lt;/i&gt; does increase mitochondrial membrane potential and the production of reactive oxygen species, it also initiates an increase in mitophagy that is ultimately neuroprotective. This novel protective consequence of uncoupling protein inhibition may lead to new therapeutic approaches to combat neurodegenerative disease, particularly because pharmacological compounds do exist that can selectively inhibit UCP2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Systems Analysis of the 22q11.2 Microdeletion Syndrome Converges on a Mitochondrial Interactome Necessary for Synapse Function and Behavior</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodevelopmental disorders offer insight into synaptic mechanisms. To unbiasedly uncover these mechanisms, we studied the 22q11.2 syndrome, a recurrent copy number variant, which is the highest schizophrenia genetic risk factor. We quantified the proteomes of 22q11.2 mutant human fibroblasts from both sexes and mouse brains carrying a 22q11.2-like defect, &lt;i&gt;Df(16)A&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Molecular ontologies defined mitochondrial compartments and pathways as some of top ranked categories. In particular, we identified perturbations in the SLC25A1-SLC25A4 mitochondrial transporter interactome as associated with the 22q11.2 genetic defect. Expression of SLC25A1-SLC25A4 interactome components was affected in neuronal cells from schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, hemideficiency of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; SLC25A1 or SLC25A4 orthologues, dSLC25A1-sea and dSLC25A4-sesB, affected synapse morphology, neurotransmission, plasticity, and sleep patterns. Our findings indicate that synapses are sensitive to partial loss of function of mitochondrial solute transporters. We propose that mitoproteomes regulate synapse development and function in normal and pathological conditions in a cell-specific manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We address the central question of how to comprehensively define molecular mechanisms of the most prevalent and penetrant microdeletion associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, the 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome. This complex mutation reduces gene dosage of ~63 genes in humans. We describe a disruption of the mitoproteome in 22q11.2 patients and brains of a 22q11.2 mouse model. In particular, we identify a network of inner mitochondrial membrane transporters as a hub required for synapse function. Our findings suggest that mitochondrial composition and function modulate the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: More Is Less: Increased Processing of Unwanted Memories Facilitates Forgetting</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The intention to forget can produce long-lasting effects. This ability has been linked to suppression of both rehearsal and retrieval of unwanted memories, processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Here, we describe an alternative account in which the intention to forget is associated with increased engagement with the unwanted information. We used pattern classifiers to decode human functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a task in which male and female participants viewed a series of pictures and were instructed to remember or forget each one. Pictures followed by a forget instruction elicited higher levels of processing in the ventral temporal cortex compared with those followed by a remember instruction. This boost in processing led to more forgetting, particularly for items that showed moderate (vs weak or strong) activation. This result is consistent with the nonmonotonic plasticity hypothesis, which predicts weakening and forgetting of memories that are moderately activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The human brain cannot remember everything. Forgetting has a critical role in curating memories and discarding unwanted information. Intentional forgetting has traditionally been linked to passive processes, such as the withdrawal of sustained attention or a stoppage of memory rehearsal. It has also been linked to active suppression of memory processes during encoding and retrieval. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and machine-learning methods, we show new evidence that intentional forgetting involves an enhancement of memory processing in the sensory cortex to achieve desired forgetting of recent visual experiences. This enhancement temporarily boosts the activation of the memory representation and renders it vulnerable to disruption via homeostatic regulation. Contrary to intuition, deliberate forgetting may involve more rather than less attention to unwanted information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Stem Cell-Derived Models of Neural Crest Are Essential to Understand Melanoma Progression and Therapy Resistance</title>

	<description>During development, neural crest (NC) cells are early precursors of several lineages including melanocytes. Along their differentiation from multipotent cells to mature melanocytes, NC cells will go through successive steps which require either proliferative or motile capacities. For example, they will undergo Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in order the separate from the neural tube and migrate to their final location in the epidermis (Larribere &amp;amp; Utikal, 2013; Skrypek, Goossens, De Smedt, Vandamme, &amp;amp; Berx, 2017). The differentiated melanocytes are the cells of origin of melanoma tumors which progress through several stages such as radial growth phase, vertical growth phase, metastasis formation, and often resistance to current therapies. Interestingly, depending on the stage of the disease, melanoma tumor cells share phenotypes with NC cells (proliferative, motile, EMT). These phenotypes are tightly controlled by specific signaling pathways and transcription factors which tend to be reactivated during the onset of melanoma. In this review, we summarize first the main transcription factors which control these common phenotypes. Then, we focus on the existing strategies used to generate human neural crests. Finally we discuss how identification and regulation of neural crest-associated genes provide an additional approach to improving current melanoma targeted therapies.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: GRK Mediates μ-Opioid Receptor Plasma Membrane Reorganization</title>

	<description>Differential regulation of the μ-opioid receptor (MOP) has been linked to the development of opioid tolerance and dependence which both limit the clinical use of opioid analgesics. At a cellular level, MOP regulation occurs via receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, plasma membrane redistribution and internalization. Here, we used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to detect and quantify ligand-dependent changes in the plasma membrane organization of MOP expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. The low internalizing agonist morphine and the antagonist naloxone did not alter constitutive MOP plasma membrane organization. In contrast, the internalizing agonist DAMGO changed MOP plasma membrane organization in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner and by two mechanisms. Firstly, it slowed MOP diffusion in a manner that was independent of internalization but dependent on GRK2/3. Secondly, DAMGO reduced the surface receptor number and the proportion of mobile receptors, and increased receptor clustering in a manner that was dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Overall, these results suggest the existence of distinct sequential MOP reorganization events at the plasma membrane and provide insights into the specific protein interactions that control MOP plasma membrane organization.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Perinatal Stress Programs Sex Differences in the Behavioral and Molecular Chronobiological Profile of Rats Maintained Under a 12-h Light-Dark Cycle</title>

	<description>Stress and the circadian systems play a major role in an organism’s adaptation to environmental changes. The adaptive value of the stress system is reactive while that of the circadian system is predictive. Dysfunctions in these two systems may account for many clinically relevant disorders. Despite the evidence that interindividual differences in stress sensitivity and in the functioning of the circadian system are related, there is limited integrated research on these topics. Moreover, sex differences in these systems are poorly investigated. We used the perinatal stress (PRS) rat model, a well-characterized model of maladaptive programming of reactive and predictive adaptation, to examine the relationship of early life stress-by-sex-by-circadian system at the behavioral and molecular level. We monitored the running wheel behavior in male and female adult PRS rats, under a normal light/dark cycle as well as in response to a chronobiological stressor (6-hours phase advance/shift). We then analyzed across different time points the expression of genes involved in circadian clocks, stress response, signaling, and glucose metabolism regulation in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In the unstressed control group, we found a sex-specific profile that was either enhanced or inverted by PRS. Also, PRS disrupted circadian wheel-running behavior by inducing a phase advance in the activity of males and hypoactivity in females and increased vulnerability to chronobiological stress in both sexes. We also observed circadian oscillations of several genes in the SCN of the unstressed group in both sexes. PRS affected males to a greater extent than females, with PRS males displaying a pattern similar to unstressed females. Altogether, our findings provide evidence for a specific profile of dysmasculinization induced by PRS at the behavioral and molecular level, thus advocating the necessity to include sex as a biological variable to study the set-up of circadian system in animal models.</description>

	<description>Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that is expressed in neurons. However, in a group of neurodegenerative diseases named tauopathies—characterized by an increase in aggregated and/or hyperphosphorylated Tau—the protein accumulates inside other cells, such as astrocytes and microglia. Given that these glial cells do not produce Tau, its presence can be explained by internalization from the extracellular medium and consequent formation of Tau aggregates. Among internalization mechanisms, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) have been proposed to be responsible for fibrillary Tau uptake in various cell types. Here we studied whether monomeric Tau, which has been observed to be internalized by glial cells such as microglia, was also taken up by astrocytes. Although this Tau form was internalized from the extracellular medium by these cells, the mechanism of uptake was found to be independent of HSPGs.</description>

	<description>In most task and resting state fMRI studies, a group consensus is often sought, where individual variability is considered a nuisance. None the less, biological variability is an important factor that cannot be ignored and is gaining more attention in the field. One recent development is the individual identification based on static functional connectome. While the original work was based on the static connectome, subsequent efforts using recurrent neural networks (RNN) demonstrated that the inclusion of temporal features greatly improved identification accuracy. Given that convolutional RNN (ConvRNN) seamlessly integrates spatial and temporal features, the present work applied ConvRNN for individual identification with resting state fMRI data. Our result demonstrates ConvRNN achieving a higher identification accuracy than conventional RNN, likely due to better extraction of local features between neighboring ROIs. Furthermore, given that each convolutional output assembles in-place features, they provide a natural way for us to visualize the informative spatial pattern and temporal information, opening up a promising new avenue for analyzing fMRI data.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Culture Impacts the Neural Response to Perceiving Outgroups Among Black and White Faces</title>

	<description>Outgroup members (e.g., individuals whose racial identity differs from perceivers’) are stigmatized in Eastern and Western cultures. However, it remains an open question how specific cultural influences affect stigmatization. In this study, we assessed whether cultural learning (i.e., social information acquired from the people in one’s environment) associated with Chinese individuals’ relocation to the United States differentiated the response to multiple outgroups. Two types of cultural learning predict diverging responses to outgroups – awareness of stereotypes about different racial outgroups is associated with increased negative affect and cognitive control towards the stereotyped outgroup. Conversely, intergroup contact attenuates those responses, and does so to a greater extent for individuals from Western cultures. As Chinese-Americans would have had more opportunities to have contact with both White and Black individuals (relative to the Chinese participants), we explored their responses to outgroups as well. Because the neural regions associated with stereotyping and intergroup contact have been well-characterized, we used neuroimaging to disentangle these possibilities. Eighteen White American, 18 Chinese-American, and 17 Chinese participants – who had relocated to the United States less than one year prior – viewed images of Black and White individuals while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants also completed measures of awareness of cultural stereotypes in the United States about Black and White individuals, implicit bias, and experiences with White and Black individuals. Behaviorally, White American and Chinese-American participants had more intergroup contact with either race than did Chinese participants, but there was no effect of participant group on stereotype knowledge or implicit bias. When viewing faces of White (as compared to Black) individuals while undergoing fMRI, White American (relative to Chinese) participants had attenuated activation in regions of the brain associated with cognitive control, including the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal striatum, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Chinese-Americans’ neural response to either race did not differ from White American or Chinese participants. Taken together, outgroup biases seemed to emerge in a culturally-dependent way based on variability in intergroup contact, but not necessarily awareness of stereotypes.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Marked Increases in Resting-State MEG Gamma-Band Activity in Combat-Related Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz087</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Combat-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a leading cause of sustained impairments in military service members and veterans. Recent animal studies show that GABA-ergic parvalbumin-positive interneurons are susceptible to brain injury, with damage causing abnormal increases in spontaneous gamma-band (30–80 Hz) activity. We investigated spontaneous gamma activity in individuals with mTBI using high-resolution resting-state magnetoencephalography source imaging. Participants included 25 symptomatic individuals with chronic combat-related blast mTBI and 35 healthy controls with similar combat experiences. Compared with controls, gamma activity was markedly elevated in mTBI participants throughout frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices, whereas gamma activity was reduced in ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Across groups, greater gamma activity correlated with poorer performances on tests of executive functioning and visuospatial processing. Many neurocognitive associations, however, were partly driven by the higher incidence of mTBI participants with both higher gamma activity and poorer cognition, suggesting that expansive upregulation of gamma has negative repercussions for cognition particularly in mTBI. This is the first human study to demonstrate abnormal resting-state gamma activity in mTBI. These novel findings suggest the possibility that abnormal gamma activities may be a proxy for GABA-ergic interneuron dysfunction and a promising neuroimaging marker of insidious mild head injuries.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Intensity Matters: High-intensity Interval Exercise Enhances Motor Cortex Plasticity More Than Moderate Exercise</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz075</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A single bout of cardiovascular exercise can enhance plasticity in human cortex; however, the intensity required for optimal enhancement is debated. We investigated the effect of exercise intensity on motor cortex synaptic plasticity, using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Twenty healthy adults (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 35.10 ± 13.25 years) completed three sessions. Measures of cortico-motor excitability (CME) and inhibition were obtained before and after a 20-min bout of either high-intensity interval exercise, moderate-intensity continuous exercise, or rest, and again after intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS). Results showed that high-intensity interval exercise enhanced iTBS plasticity more than rest, evidenced by increased CME and intracortical facilitation, and reduced intracortical inhibition. In comparison, the effect of moderate-intensity exercise was intermediate between high-intensity exercise and rest. Importantly, analysis of each participant’s plasticity response profile indicated that high-intensity exercise increased the likelihood of a facilitatory response to iTBS. We also established that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;Met polymorphism attenuated plasticity responses following high-intensity exercise. These findings suggest that high-intensity interval exercise should be considered not only when planning exercise interventions designed to enhance neuroplasticity, but also to maximize the therapeutic potential of non-invasive brain stimulation. Additionally, genetic profiling may enhance efficacy of exercise interventions for brain health.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Evidence suggests that amyloid β is highly toxic to synapses in a phospho-Tau-dependent manner. Here, I present a hypothesis that links previous evidence from the first rise of amyloid β through to Tau tangles and neurodegeneration. In the immediate vicinity of plaques, concentrated soluble amyloid β occurs in equilibrium with deposited forms. Initially, plaques cover only a small percentage of brain volume. Microglia, by efficiently removing damaged synapses, may prevent spread of damage along the axon, restricting damage to the immediate vicinity of plaques.</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dramatically amplified thoracic sympathetic postganglionic excitability and integrative capacity revealed with whole-cell patch clamp recordings</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Thoracic paravertebral sympathetic chain postganglionic neurons (tSPNs) comprise the final integrative output of the distributed sympathetic nervous system controlling vascular and thermoregulatory systems. Considered a non-integrating relay, what little is known of tSPN intrinsic excitability has been determined by sharp microelectrodes with presumed impalement injury. We thus undertook the first electrophysiological characterization of tSPN cellular properties using whole-cell recordings and coupled results with a conductance-based model to explore the principles governing their excitability in adult mice of both sexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recorded membrane resistance and time constant values were an order of magnitude greater than values previously obtained, leading to a demonstrable capacity for synaptic integration in driving recruitment. Variation in membrane resistivity was the primary determinant controlling cell excitability with vastly lower currents required for tSPN recruitment. Unlike previous microelectrode recordings in mouse which observed inability to sustain firing, all tSPNs were capable of repetitive firing. Computational modeling demonstrated that observed differences are explained by introduction of a microelectrode impalement injury conductance. Overall, tSPNs largely linearly encoded injected current magnitudes over a broad frequency range with distinct subpopulations differentiable based on repetitive firing signatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, whole-cell recordings reveal tSPNs have more dramatically amplified excitability than previously thought, with greater intrinsic capacity for synaptic integration and with the ability for maintained firing to support sustained actions on vasomotor tone and thermoregulatory function. Rather than acting as a relay, these studies support a more responsive role and possible intrinsic capacity for tSPNs to drive sympathetic autonomic function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Thoracic sympathetic postganglionic neurons (tSPNs) represent the final neural output for control of vasomotor and thermoregulatory function. We used whole-cell-recordings and computational modeling to provide broad insight on intrinsic cellular mechanisms controlling excitability and capacity for synaptic integration. Compared to past intracellular recordings using microelectrode impalement, we observed dramatically higher membrane resistivity with primacy in controlling enhanced tSPN excitability and recruitment via synaptic integration. Compared to reported phasic firing, all tSPNs fire repetitively and linearly encode injected current magnitude to firing frequency over a broad range. Modeling studies suggest microelectrode impalement injury accounts for differences in tSPN properties previously observed. Overall, intrinsic tSPN excitability plays a much greater role in the integration and maintenance of sympathetic output than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;It is not known why there is increased risk to have seizures with increased anxiety and stress after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Stressors cause the release of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) both from the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and from CNS neurons located in the central amygdala and GABAergic interneurons. We have previously shown that CRF signaling is plastic, becoming excitatory instead of inhibitory after the kindling model of epilepsy. Here, using Sprague-Dawley rats we have found that CRF signaling increased excitability after TBI. Following TBI, CRF type 1 receptor (CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) mediated activity caused abnormally large electrical responses in the amygdala including fast ripples which are considered to be epileptogenic. After TBI, we also found the ripple (120 Hz-250 Hz) and fast ripple activity (&amp;gt; 250 Hz) was cross frequency coupled with theta (3-8 Hz) oscillations. CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; antagonists reduced the incidence of phase coupling between ripples and fast ripples. Our observations indicate that pathophysiological signaling of the CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; increases the incidence of epileptiform activity after TBI. The use for CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; antagonist may be useful to reduce the severity and frequency of TBI associated epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The combination of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stress is known to increase the likelihood of post traumatic epilepsy. Here we show after moderate TBI that CRF increases the excitability of a number of limbic regions in the rat. In particular a tail pinch stress causes epileptiform activity that is characterized by the occurrence of fast ripples that are phase amplitude coupled to theta rhythm. This activity is blocked by CRF receptor 1 antagonist. Our data provide a possible mechanism by which stress exacerbates epileptiform activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Glucagon-like peptide-1 cleavage product improves cognitive function in a mouse model of Down syndrome</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Currently there is no effective therapy available for cognitive impairments in Down syndrome (DS), one of the most prevalent forms of mental retardation in humans associated with the chromosomes 21 trisomy. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that maintains glucose homeostasis by stimulating insulin secretion. Its natural cleavage product GLP-1 (9-36) lacks insulinotropic effects and has a low binding affinity for GLP-1 receptors (GLP1Rs); thus, GLP-1 (9-36) has historically been identified as an inactive metabolite. Conversely, recent work has demonstrated interesting physiological properties of GLP-1 (9-36) such as cardioprotection and neuroprotection. We have previously shown that GLP-1 (9-36) administration enhances neuronal plasticity in young WT mice and ameliorates cognitive deficits in a mouse model of AD. Here, we report that systemic administration of GLP-1 (9-36) in Ts65Dn DS model mice of either sex resulted in decreased mitochondrial oxidative stress in hippocampus and improved dendritic spine morphology – increase of mature spines and reduction of immature spines. Importantly, these molecular alterations translated into functional changes in that long-term potentiation (LTP) failure and cognitive impairments in TsDn65 DS model mice were rescued with GLP-1 (9-36) treatment. We also show that chronic GLP-1 (9-36) treatment did not alter glucose tolerance in either WT or DS model mice. Our findings suggest that GLP-1 (9-36) treatment may have therapeutic potential for DS and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with increased neuronal oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Presently no effective treatment exists for cognitive defects in Down syndrome (DS), one of the most common forms of mental retardation. Here, we studied the effect of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) cleavage product, GLP-1 (9-36), on an established mouse model of DS. We found that GLP-1 (9-36) treatment significantly improved DS-associated memory deficits and synaptic plasticity impairments. Consistently, GLP-1 (9-36) treatment in DS model mice led to decreased levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and improved dendritic spine morphology. Our findings indicate that GLP-1 (9-36) may have therapeutic potential to improve memory and cognition in DS and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with increased neuronal oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Deep brain stimulation: Connectivity profile for bradykinesia alleviation</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subthalamic deep brain stimulation may alleviate bradykinesia in Parkinson patients. Research suggests that this stimulation effect may be mediated by brain networks like the corticocerebellar loop. This study investigated the connectivity between stimulation sites and cortical and subcortical structures to identify connections for effective stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We retrospectively investigated 21 patients with Parkinson disease with bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation. Stimulation effectiveness in reducing bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity was evaluated for each electrode contact in brain hemispheres contralateral to the affected hemibody. Dysarthric side effects were also examined. Probabilistic tractography based on diffusion‐weighted imaging was performed in individual patient‐specific brains using electrode contacts as seeds. Connectivity profiles of contacts with effective and noneffective stimulation were compared.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connectivity profiles of effective and noneffective contacts differed. Moreover, the connectivity profile for bradykinesia differed from that for rigidity, tremor, or dysarthria. Regarding bradykinesia, effective contacts were significantly more often connected with the ipsilateral superior cerebellar peduncle and the ipsilateral dentate nucleus, which correspond to the ipsilateral portion of the cerebellothalamocortical pathway. Rigidity was mitigated by stimulation of ascending brainstem and intralaminar thalamic connections. Tremor alleviation was related to connections with the internal capsule (anterior limb) and the pallidum. Dysarthric side effects were associated with connections to the supplementary motor area and the decussating cerebellothalamocortical pathway.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas bradykinesia seems to be mitigated by stimulation of the ascending, ipsilateral cerebellothalamocortical pathway, stimulation of the descending corticopontocerebellar pathway may be ineffective. Rigidity, tremor, and dysarthric side effects seem to be influenced by different neural networks. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Longitudinal course of vasomotor symptoms in perimenopausal migraineurs</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the longitudinal course of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in women with a history of migraine in comparison to women without a history of migraine disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study sample consisted of 467 women with a self‐reported prior migraine diagnosis and 2,466 women without prior migraine diagnosis who were assessed longitudinally during menopausal transition as part of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. Linear mixed regression models with backward elimination were used to evaluate longitudinal associations between VMS and migraine while adjusting for baseline and time‐varying demographic, socioeconomic, psychological, and reproductive factors. Additional analyses were performed to further assess the specificity of the association between migraine and VMS that included evaluating the association between migraine and vaginal dryness and between back pain and VMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A history of migraine predicted an increased frequency of VMS but not vaginal dryness during menopausal transition. Significant interaction between history of migraine and menopausal status for the prediction of VMS was also identified. Burden of VMS was found to be higher during late‐stage perimenopause in women with migraine. In contrast, the history of back pain did not predict the frequency of VMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to delineate that a history of migraine predicts an increased frequency of VMS in women during menopausal transition. Hypothalamic abnormalities and thermoregulatory dysfunction against a milieu of decreasing estradiol concentrations during menopausal transition may explain the increased frequency of VMS in migraineurs during menopausal transition.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists after recent ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We compared outcomes after treatment with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and a recent cerebral ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted an individual patient data analysis of seven prospective cohort studies. We included patients with AF and a recent cerebral ischemia (&amp;lt;3 months before starting oral anticoagulation) and a minimum follow‐up of 3 months. We analyzed the association between type of anticoagulation (DOAC versus VKA) with the composite primary endpoint (recurrent ischemic stroke [AIS], intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH], or mortality) using mixed‐effects Cox proportional hazards regression models; we calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 4,912 patients (median age, 78 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 71–84]; 2,331 [47.5%] women; median National Institute of Health Stroke Severity Scale at onset, 5 [IQR, 2–12]); 2,256 (45.9%) patients received VKAs and 2,656 (54.1%) DOACs. Median time from index event to starting oral anticoagulation was 5 days (IQR, 2–14) for VKAs and 5 days (IQR, 2–11) for DOACs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.53). There were 262 acute ischemic strokes (AISs; 4.4%/year), 71 intracranial hemorrrhages (ICHs; 1.2%/year), and 439 deaths (7.4%/year) during the total follow‐up of 5,970 patient‐years. Compared to VKAs, DOAC treatment was associated with reduced risks of the composite endpoint (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67–1.00; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.05) and ICH (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24–0.71; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01); we found no differences for the risk of recurrent AIS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.70–1.19; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.5) and mortality (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.68–1.03; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.09).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOAC treatment commenced early after recent cerebral ischemia related to AF was associated with reduced risk of poor clinical outcomes compared to VKA, mainly attributed to lower risks of ICH. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Modulations in Oscillatory Activity of Globus Pallidus Internus Neurons During a Directed Hand Movement Task—A Primary Mechanism for Motor Planning</title>

	<description>Globus pallidus internus (GPi) neurons in the basal ganglia are traditionally thought to play a significant role in the promotion and suppression of movement via a change in firing rates. Here, we hypothesize that a primary mechanism of movement control by GPi neurons is through specific modulations in their oscillatory patterns. We analyzed neuronal spiking activity of 83 GPi neurons recorded from two healthy nonhuman primates executing a radial center-out motor task. We found that, in directionally tuned neurons, the power in the gamma band is significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) greater than that in the beta band (a ‘cross-over’ effect), during the planning stages of movements in their preferred direction. This cross-over effect is not observed in the non-directionally tuned neurons or when tuned neurons are aligned to their non-preferred direction. These data suggest that, during movement planning, information encoding by GPi neurons may be governed by a sudden emergence and suppression of oscillatory activities, rather than simply by a change in average firing rates.</description>

	<description>UBE3A is a gene implicated in the neurodevelopmental disorders. The protein product of UBE3A is the E3 ligase E6AP, and its expression in the brain is uniquely regulated via genetic imprinting. Loss of E6AP expression leads to the development of Angelman syndrome, clinically characterized by lack of speech, abnormal motor development, and the presence of seizures. Conversely, copy number variations (CNVs) that result in the overexpression of E6AP are strongly associated with the development of ASDs, defined by decreased communication, impaired social interest, and increased repetitive behavior. In this review, we focus on the neurobiological function of Ube3A/E6AP. As an E3 ligase, many functional target proteins of E6AP have been discovered, including p53, Arc, Ephexin5, and SK2. On a neuronal level, E6AP is widely expressed within the cell, including dendritic arbors, spines, and the nucleus. E6AP regulates neuronal morphological maturation, and plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and cortical development. These molecular findings provide insight into our understanding of the molecular events underlying AS and ASDs.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Sodium Benzoate Attenuates Secondary Brain Injury by Inhibiting Neuronal Apoptosis and Reducing Mitochondria-Mediated Oxidative Stress in a Rat Model of Intracerebral Hemorrhage: Possible Involvement of DJ-1/Akt/IKK/NFκB Pathway</title>

	<description>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease with high rates of mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study was to explore whether Sodium Benzoate (NaB) could reduce neural cell apoptosis and alleviate neurological deficits after ICH. To assess the therapeutic effects of NaB, first, we measured brain water content, neurobehavior, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity at 24 h after ICH in different groups. Then western blot and immunofluorescence staining (IF) were applied to test the levels of different proteins. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to observe ultra-structures within the cells in different groups. The results showed that levels of DJ-1, p-Akt and p-IκB kinase (IKK) increased after ICH and peaked at 24 h. Besides, NaB significantly upregulated DJ-1 in both cytoplasm and mitochondria, and also increased the levels of p-Akt, p-IKK and Bcl-2/Bax ratio, but decreased the levels of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Additionally, NaB decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) while increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which then improving the neurological functions at 24 h and long-term (21 days) memory and spatial learning ability after ICH. However, the results mentioned above could be greatly reversed by MK2206 and rotenone. Therefore, we concluded that NaB could attenuate secondary brain injury via inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and reducing mitochondria-mediated oxidative stress via DJ-1/Akt/IKK/NFκB pathway.</description>

	<description>This study investigated the degree of brain functional impairment in persistent somatoform pain disorder (PSPD) by examining changes in the patterns of brain functional hubs by degree centrality (DC) analysis as well as the connectivity among these hubs by functional connectivity (FC) analysis and Granger causality analysis (GCA). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 21 PSPD patients with headache as the main symptom and 17 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. DC, seed-based FC, and GCA were performed to characterize abnormal brain networks in PSPD (Gaussian random field corrected: P &amp;lt; 0.001, Z &amp;gt; 3.09). The relationships between DC and connectivity and clinical parameters were also examined. DC values in the bilateral inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), bilateral calcarine fissure (CAL), and left paracentral lobule (PCL) and FC values of right IOG–left CAL, right IOG–right CAL, right IOG–left IOG, left CAL–right CAL, left CAL–left IOG, left CAL–left PCL, right CAL–left PCL, and left IOG–left PCL were lower in PSPD patients as compared to controls. A negative causal effect from the left CAL to the left paracentral lobule and a positive effect from the right CAL to the right IOG were observed in PSPD patients. Abnormal DC, FC, and signed-path coefﬁcients in PSPD patients were negatively correlated with self-rating anxiety and depression scale scores. These results indicate that altered functional hubs and connectivity patterns in the somatosensory cortex may reflect emotional disturbance in PSPD patients.</description>

	<description>The selection of the appropriate hemodynamic response function (HRF) for signal modeling in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is important. Although the use of the boxcar-shaped hemodynamic response function (BHRF) and canonical hemodynamic response (CHRF) has gained increasing popularity in rodent fMRI studies, whether the selected HRF affects the results of rodent fMRI has not been fully elucidated. Here we investigated the signal change and t-statistic sensitivities of BHRF, CHRF, and impulse response function (IRF). The effect of HRF selection on different tasks was analyzed by using data collected from two groups of rats receiving either 3 mA whisker pad or 3 mA forepaw electrical stimulations (n = 10 for each group). Under whisker pad stimulation with large blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal change (4.31% ± 0.42%), BHRF significantly underestimated signal changes (P &amp;lt; 0.001) and t-statistics (P &amp;lt; 0.001) compared with CHRF or IRF. CHRF and IRF did not provide significantly different t-statistics (P &amp;gt; 0.05). Under forepaw stimulation with small BOLD signal change (1.71% ± 0.34%), different HRFs provided insignificantly different t-statistics (P &amp;gt; 0.05). Therefore, the selected HRF can influence data analysis in rodent fMRI experiments with large BOLD responses but not in those with small BOLD responses.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Toward a Bidirectional Communication Between Retinal Cells and a Prosthetic Device – A Proof of Concept</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00367</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00367</link>
	<description>Background: Significant progress towards the recovery of useful vision in blind patients with severe degenerative retinal diseases caused by photoreceptor death has been achieved with the development of visual prostheses that stimulate the retina electrically. However, currently used prostheses do not provide feedback about the retinal activity before and upon stimulation and do not adjust to changes during the remodeling processes in the retina. Both features are desirable to improve the efficiency of the electrical stimulation therapy offered by these devices. Accordingly, devices that not only enable electrical stimulation but at the same time provide information about the retinal activity are required. Given the above, a bidirectional communication strategy, in which inner retinal cells are stimulated and the output neurons of the retina, the ganglion cells, are recorded using penetrating microelectrode arrays (MEAs) is proposed. 
Methods: Custom-made penetrating MEAs with four silicon-based shanks, each one with three or four iridium oxide electrodes were used to record the activity of light-adapted wildtype mice retinas and degenerated retinas from rd10 mice in vitro. In addition, responses to high potassium concentration and to light stimulation in wildtype retinas were examined. Furthermore, voltage-controlled electrical stimulation was performed.
Results: The spiking activity of retinal ganglion cells was recorded at different depths of penetration inside the retina. Physiological responses during an increase of the extracellular potassium concentration and phasic and tonic responses during light stimulation were captured. Moreover, pathologic rhythmic activity was recorded from degenerated retinas. Finally, electrical stimulation of the inner retina and simultaneous recording of the activity of retinal ganglion cells was accomplished.
Conclusions: The access to different layers of the retina with penetrating electrodes while recording at the same time the spiking activity of retinal ganglion cells broadens the use and the field of action of multi-shank and multi-site penetrating MEAs for retinal applications. It enables a bidirectional strategy to stimulate inner retinal cells electrically and to record from the spiking retinal ganglion cells simultaneously (BiMEA). This opens the possibility of a feedback loop system to acknowledge the success of electrical stimulation carried out by retinal prostheses.</description>

	<description>In-ear EEG offers a promising path toward usable, discreet brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for both healthy individuals and persons with disabilities. To test the promise of this modality, we produced a brain-based authentication system using custom-fit EEG earpieces. In a sample of N=7 participants, we demonstrated that our system has high accuracy, higher than prior work using non-custom earpieces. We demonstrated that both inherence and knowledge factors contribute to authentication accuracy, and performed a simulated attack to show our system's robustness against impersonation. From an authentication standpoint, our system provides three factors of authentication in a single step. From a usability standpoint, our system does not require a cumbersome, head-worn device.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Muscle Synergies During Repetitive Stoop Lifting With a Bioelectrically-Controlled Lumbar Support Exoskeleton</title>

	<description>Lower back problems are common in the world, which leads to the development of various lumbar support exoskeletons to alleviate this problem. In general, previous studies evaluating lumbar support devices quantified assistance by reporting the reduction in back muscle activity and perceived fatigue. However, despite the beneficial effects of such devices, the effects of using such exoskeletons on muscle coordination are not well-studied. In this study, we examined the short-term change in muscle coordination of subjects using a bioelectrically-controlled lumbar support exoskeleton in a fatiguing stoop lifting task with muscle synergy analysis. Results indicate that muscle coordination changes were dominated by changes in timing coefficients, with minimal change in muscle synergy vectors. Analysis on muscle coordination changes would be useful to design future generations of exoskeletons.</description>

	<description>Basic and applied research are increasingly adopting transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) for modulating perceptual, cognitive, affective, and motor processes. Industry and defense applications of tES hold potential for accelerating training and knowledge acquisition and sustaining work-related performance in the face of fatigue, workload, and stress. This mini-review describes the promises and perils of tES, and reviews research testing its influence on two broad applied areas: sustaining and dividing attention, and operating in virtual environments. Also included is a discussion of challenges related to viable mechanistic explanations for tES effectiveness, attempts at replication and consideration of null results, and the potential importance of individual differences in predicting tES influences on human performance. Finally, future research directions are proposed to address these challenges and help develop a fuller understanding of tES viability for enhancing real-world performance.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Facial Attractiveness of Chinese College Students With Different Sexual Orientation and Sex Roles</title>

	<description>Facial attractiveness refers to a positive and joyful emotional experience induced by the face of a target person and the extent to which other people are driven to be close to their wishes. Since the 1970s, face attractiveness has gradually emerged in western psychological research, but most of the studies were confined to heterosexuals. More recently, some scholars have pointed out that sexual orientation may affect the judgment of facial attractiveness of individuals. Based on previous literature, this study proposed to explore the different facial attractiveness of individuals with different sexual orientation and sexual roles. Participants in this study were divided into two types (according to sexual orientation and sexual role) by the Sex Role Inventory for College Students (CSRI). Also, the eye-tracking technique was used to record the path of eye movements, where face images were manipulated by sexual dimorphism clues. The results showed that (1) compared to heterosexual men, homosexual men were significantly more likely to choose masculine faces as more attractive faces in paired faces; (2) male homosexuals are likely to have the feminization bias, and female homosexuals are likely to have the masculinization bias; (3) The masculine faces are more attractive than feminine faces to participants whose sex role in feminine type and androgynous type.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Depth and the Uncertainty of Statistical Knowledge on Musical Creativity Fluctuate Over a Composer's Lifetime</title>

	<description>Brain models music as a hierarchy of dynamical systems that encode probability distributions and complexity (i.e., entropy and uncertainty). Through musical experience over lifetime, a human is intrinsically motivated in optimizing the internalized probabilistic model for efficient information processing and the uncertainty resolution, which has been regarded as rewords. Human’s behavior, however, appears to be not necessarily directing to efficiency but sometimes act inefficiently in order to explore a maximum rewards of uncertainty resolution. Previous studies suggest that the drive for novelty seeking behavior (high uncertain phenomenon) reflects human’s curiosity, and that the curiosity rewards encourage humans to create and learn new regularities. That is to say, although brain generally minimizes uncertainty of music structure, we sometimes derive pleasure from music with uncertain structure due to curiosity for novelty seeking behavior by which we anticipate the resolution of uncertainty. Few studies, however, investigated how curiosity for uncertain and novelty seeking behavior modulates musical creativity. The present study investigated how the probabilistic model and the uncertainty in music fluctuate over a composer’s lifetime (all of the 32 piano sonatas by Ludwig van Beethoven). In the late periods of the composer’s lifetime, the transitional probabilities (TPs) of sequential patterns that ubiquitously appear in all of his music (familiar phrase) were decreased, whereas the uncertainties of the whole structure were increased. Furthemore, these findings were prominent in higher-, rather than lower-, order models of TP distribution. This may suggest that the higher-order probabilistic model is susceptible to experience and psychological phenomena over the composer’s lifetime. The present study first suggested the fluctuation of uncertainty of musical structure over a composer’s lifetime. It is suggested that human’s curiosity for uncertain and novelty seeking behavior may modulate optimization and creativity in human’s brain.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Distribution Patterns of Three Molecularly Defined Classes of GABAergic Neurons Across Columnar Compartments in Mouse Barrel Cortex</title>

	<description>The mouse somatosensory cortex is an excellent model to study the structural basis of cortical information processing, since it possesses anatomically recognizable domains that receive different thalamic inputs, which indicates spatial segregation of different processing tasks. In this work we examined three genetically labeled, non-overlapping subpopulations of GABAergic neurons: parvalbumin- (PV+), somatostatin- (SST+) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing (VIP+) cells. Each of these subpopulations displayed a unique cellular distribution pattern across layers. In terms of columnar localization, the distribution of these three populations was not quantitatively different between barrel-related versus septal compartments in most layers. However, in layer IV, SST+ and VIP+, but not PV+ neurons preferred the septal compartment over barrels. The examined cell types showed a tendency toward differential distribution in supragranular and infragranular barrel-related versus septal compartments, too. Our data suggests that the location of GABAergic neuron cell bodies correlates with the spatial pattern of cortical domains receiving different kinds of thalamic input. Thus, at least in layer IV, lemniscal inputs present a close spatial relation preferentially to PV+ cells whereas paralemniscal inputs target compartments in which more SST+ and VIP+ cells are localized. Our findings suggest pathway-specific roles for neocortical GABAergic neurons.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Decreased Cerebrospinal Fluid Flow Is Associated With Cognitive Deficit in Elderly Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00087</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00087</link>
	<description>Background
Disruptions in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow during aging could compromise protein clearance from the brain and contribute to the etiology of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). 
Objective
To determine whether CSF flow is associated with cognitive deficit in elderly patients (&amp;gt;70 years). 
Methods
We studied 92 patients admitted to our geriatric unit for non-acute reasons using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) to calculate their ventricular and spinal CSF flow, and assessed their global cognitive status, memory, executive functions and praxis. Multivariable regressions with backward selection (criterion p&amp;lt;0.15) were performed to determine associations between cognitive tests and ventricular and spinal CSF flow, adjusting for depression, anxiety, and cardiovascular risk factors.
Results 
The cohort comprised 71 women (77%) and 21 (33%) men, aged 84.1±5.2 years (range, 73¬–96). Net ventricular CSF flow was 52±40µL/cc (range, 0¬–210), and net spinal CSF flow was 500±295µL/cc (range, 0–1420). Ventricular CSF flow was associated with the number of BEC96 figures recognized (β=0.18, CI, 0.02–0.33; p=0.025). Spinal CSF flow was associated with the WAIS Digit Span Backward test (β=0.06, CI, 0.01–0.12; p=0.034), and categoric verbal fluency (β=0.53, CI, 0.07–0.98; p=0.024) and semantic verbal fluency (β=0.55, CI, 0.07–1.02; p=0.024). 
Conclusions
Patients with lower CSF flow had significantly worse memory, visuo-constructive capacities, and verbal fluency. Alterations in CSF flow could contribute to some of the cognitive deficit observed in patients with AD. Diagnosis and treatment of CSF flow alterations in geriatric patients with neurocognitive disorders could contribute to the prevention of their cognitive decline.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Accelerated Hyper-Maturation of Parvalbumin Circuits in the Absence of MeCP2</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz085</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz085/5479672?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) mutations are the primary cause of Rett syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Cortical parvalbumin GABAergic interneurons (PV) make exuberant somatic connections onto pyramidal cells in the visual cortex of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt;-deficient mice, which contributes to silencing neuronal cortical circuits. This phenotype can be rescued independently of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; by environmental, pharmacological, and genetic manipulation. It remains unknown how &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; mutation can result in abnormal inhibitory circuit refinement. In the present manuscript, we examined the development of GABAergic circuits in the primary visual cortex of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt;-deficient mice. We identified that PV circuits were the only GABAergic interneurons to be upregulated, while other interneurons were downregulated. Acceleration of PV cell maturation was accompanied by increased PV cells engulfment by perineuronal nets (PNNs) and by an increase of PV cellular and PNN structural complexity. Interestingly, selective deletion of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; from PV cells was sufficient to drive increased structure complexity of PNN. Moreover, the accelerated PV and PNN maturation was recapitulated in organotypic cultures. Our results identify a specific timeline of disruption of GABAergic circuits in the absence of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt;, indicating a possible cell-autonomous role of MeCP2 in the formation of PV cellular arbors and PNN structures in the visual cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Dopamine Receptor Expression Among Local and Visual Cortex-Projecting Frontal Eye Field Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Dopaminergic modulation of prefrontal cortex plays an important role in numerous cognitive processes, including attention. The frontal eye field (FEF) is modulated by dopamine and has an established role in visual attention, yet the underlying circuitry upon which dopamine acts is not known. We compared the expression of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors (D1Rs and D2Rs) across different classes of FEF neurons, including those projecting to dorsal or ventral extrastriate cortex. First, we found that both D1Rs and D2Rs are more prevalent on pyramidal neurons than on several classes of interneurons and are particularly prevalent on putatively long-range projecting pyramidals. Second, higher proportions of pyramidal neurons express D1Rs than D2Rs. Third, overall a higher proportion of inhibitory neurons expresses D2Rs than D1Rs. Fourth, among inhibitory interneurons, a significantly higher proportion of parvalbumin+ neurons expresses D2Rs than D1Rs, and a significantly higher proportion of calbindin+ neurons expresses D1Rs than D2Rs. Finally, compared with D2Rs, virtually all of the neurons with identified projections to both dorsal and ventral extrastriate visual cortex expressed D1Rs. Our results demonstrate that dopamine tends to act directly on the output of the FEF and that dopaminergic modulation of top-down projections to visual cortex is achieved predominately via D1Rs.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>The intrauterine environment provides a key interface between the mother and the developing fetus during pregnancy, and is a target for investigating mechanisms of fetal programming. Studies have demonstrated an association between prenatal stress and neurodevelopmental disorders. The role of the intrauterine environment in mediating this effect is still being elucidated. In this review, we discuss emerging preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting the existence of microbial communities in utero.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Dopaminergic Vulnerability in Parkinson Disease: The Cost of Humans’ Habitual Performance</title>

	<description>Humans can simultaneously combine automatic/habitual and voluntary/goal-directed aspects of behavioral control. Habitual routines permit us to perform well practiced task-components with minimal or no voluntary attention. Evidence from animal and human investigations indicates that dopaminergic neurons in lateral substantia nigra, which innervate the sensorimotor striatum, are engaged during the acquisition and performance of automatized skills and habits. Typically, in Parkinson disease (PD), there is a differential loss of dopamine, which occurs earliest and most severely in the caudal sensorimotor striatum, a subdivision of the striatum implicated in habitual control.</description>

	<description>18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) is an essential component in the diagnostic work-up of patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). With the development of pattern recognition technology, analysis of brain images using deep learning are becoming more and more popular. However, existing computer-aided-diagnosis technologies often overfit and have poor generalizability. Therefore, we aimed to improve a framework based on Group Lasso Sparse Deep Belief Network (GLS-DBN) for discriminating PD and normal control (NC) subjects. In this study, 225 NC and 125 PD cohorts from Huashan and Wuxi 904 hospitals were selected. They were divided into the training &amp;amp; validation dataset and 2 test datasets. First, in the training &amp;amp; validation set, subjects were randomly partitioned 80:20, with multiple training iterations for the deep learning model. Next, Locally Linear Embedding was used as a dimension reduction algorithm. Then, GLS-DBN was used for feature learning and classification. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, different sparse DBN models were used to compare datasets. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were examined to validate the results. Output variables of the network were also correlated with longitudinal changes of cognitive measurements (UPDRS, H&amp;amp;Y). As a result, accuracy of prediction (90% in Test 1, 86% in Test 2) for classification of PD and NC patients outperformed conventional approaches. Output scores of the network were strongly correlated with longitudinal changes in cognitive measurements (R = 0.705, p &amp;lt; 0.001; R = 0.697, p &amp;lt; 0.001 in Test 1; R = 0.592, p = 0.0018, R = 0.528, p = 0.0067 in Test 2). These results show the feasibility of GLS-DBN as a practical tool for early diagnosis of PD.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Synaptic Connectivity and Cortical Maturation Are Promoted by the ω-3 Fatty Acid Docosahexaenoic Acid</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain development is likely impacted by micronutrients. This is supported by the effects of the ω-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during early neuronal differentiation, when it increases neurite growth. Aiming to delineate DHA roles in postnatal stages, we selected the visual cortex due to its stereotypic maturation. Immunohistochemistry showed that young mice that received dietary DHA from birth exhibited more abundant presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations. DHA also increased density and size of synapses in a dose-dependent manner in cultured neurons. In addition, dendritic arbors of neurons treated with DHA were more complex. In agreement with improved connectivity, DHA enhanced physiological parameters of network maturation in vitro, including bursting strength and oscillatory behavior. Aiming to analyze functional maturation of the cortex, we performed in vivo electrophysiological recordings from awake mice to measure responses to patterned visual inputs. Dietary DHA robustly promoted the developmental increase in visual acuity, without altering light sensitivity. The visual acuity of DHA-supplemented animals continued to improve even after their cortex had matured and DHA abolished the acuity plateau. Our findings show that the ω-3 fatty acid DHA promotes synaptic connectivity and cortical processing. These results provide evidence that micronutrients can support the maturation of neuronal networks.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Although iron is crucial for neuronal functioning, many aspects of cerebral iron biology await clarification. The ability to quantify specific iron forms in the living brain would open new avenues for diagnosis, therapeutic monitoring, and understanding pathogenesis of diseases. A modality that allows assessment of brain tissue composition in vivo, in particular of iron deposits or myelin content on a submillimeter spatial scale, is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Multimodal strategies combining MRI with complementary analytical techniques ex vivo have emerged, which may lead to improved specificity.</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Transduction of the Geomagnetic Field as Evidenced from alpha-Band Activity in the Human Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Magnetoreception, the perception of the geomagnetic field, is a sensory modality well-established across all major groups of vertebrates and some invertebrates, but its presence in humans has been tested rarely, yielding inconclusive results. We report here a strong, specific human brain response to ecologically-relevant rotations of Earth-strength magnetic fields. Following geomagnetic stimulation, a drop in amplitude of electroencephalography (EEG) alpha-oscillations (8–13 Hz) occurred in a repeatable manner. Termed alpha-event-related desynchronization (alpha-ERD), such a response has been associated previously with sensory and cognitive processing of external stimuli including vision, auditory and somatosensory cues. Alpha-ERD in response to the geomagnetic field was triggered only by horizontal rotations when the static vertical magnetic field was directed downwards, as it is in the Northern Hemisphere; no brain responses were elicited by the same horizontal rotations when the static vertical component was directed upwards. This implicates a biological response tuned to the ecology of the local human population, rather than a generic physical effect. Biophysical tests showed that the neural response was sensitive to static components of the magnetic field. This rules out all forms of electrical induction (including artifacts from the electrodes) which are determined solely on dynamic components of the field. The neural response was also sensitive to the polarity of the magnetic field. This rules out free-radical &quot;quantum compass&quot; mechanisms like the cryptochrome hypothesis, which can detect only axial alignment. Ferromagnetism remains a viable biophysical mechanism for sensory transduction and provides a basis to start the behavioral exploration of human magnetoreception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Inhibiting bone morphogenetic protein 4 type I receptor signaling promotes remyelination by potentiating oligodendrocyte differentiation</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Blocking inhibitory factors within central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating lesions is regarded as a promising strategy to promote remyelination. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is an inhibitory factor present in demyelinating lesions. Noggin, an endogenous antagonist to BMP, has previously been shown to increase the number of oligodendrocytes and promote remyelination &lt;i&gt;in vivo.&lt;/i&gt; However, it remains unclear how BMP4 signaling inhibits remyelination. Here we investigated the downstream signaling pathway that mediates the inhibitory effect that BMP4 exerts upon remyelination through pharmacological and transgenic approaches. Using the cuprizone mouse model of central demyelination, we demonstrate that selectively blocking BMP4 signaling via the pharmacological inhibitor LDN-193189 significantly promotes oligodendroglial differentiation and the extent of remyelination &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. This was accompanied by the downregulation of transcriptional targets that suppress oligodendrocyte differentiation. Further, selective deletion of BMPRIA receptors within primary mouse OPCs significantly enhanced their differentiation and subsequent myelination &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Together, results of this study identify that BMP4 signals via BMPRIA within OPCs to inhibit oligodendroglial differentiation and their capacity to myelinate axons, and suggest that blocking BMP4/BMPRIA pathway in OPCs is a promising strategy to promote CNS remyelination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Blocking inhibitory factors within central demyelinating lesions is a promising strategy to promote remyelination. Previous studies have established that exogenous BMPs inhibit oligodendrocyte differentiation during CNS development and after injury. Here, we demonstrate that blocking endogenous BMP4 signaling via a selective pharmacological approach promotes oligodendroglial differentiation and the rate of remyelination after a central demyelinating insult &lt;i&gt;in vivo.&lt;/i&gt; Using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; analysis, we identify that OPC-expressed BMPRIA receptors mediate this effect. Together, our data propose that blocking the BMP4 signaling pathway and/or BMPRIA receptors in OPCs is a promising strategy to promote CNS remyelination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;SLC1A2&lt;/i&gt; is a trimeric transporter essential for clearing glutamate from neuronal synapses. Recurrent de novo &lt;i&gt;SLC1A2&lt;/i&gt; missense variants cause a severe, early onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy via an unclear mechanism. We demonstrate that all 3 variants implicated in this condition localize to the trimerization domain of &lt;i&gt;SLC1A2&lt;/i&gt;, and that the Leu85Pro variant acts via a dominant negative mechanism to reduce, but not eliminate, wild‐type &lt;i&gt;SLC1A2&lt;/i&gt; protein localization and function. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment of a 20‐month‐old &lt;i&gt;SLC1A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related epilepsy patient with the SLC1A2‐modulating agent ceftriaxone did not result in a significant change in daily spasm count.

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To define a distinct, dominantly inherited, mild skeletal myopathy associated with prominent and consistent tremor in two unrelated, three‐generation families.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical evaluations as well as exome and panel sequencing analyses were performed in affected and non‐affected members of two families to identify genetic variants segregating with the phenotype. Histological assessment of a muscle biopsy specimen was performed in one patient and quantitative tremor analysis was carried out in two patients. Molecular modeling studies and biochemical assays were performed for both mutations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two novel missense mutations in &lt;i&gt;MYBPC1&lt;/i&gt; (p.E248K in family‐1 and p.Y247H in family‐2) were identified and shown to segregate perfectly with the myopathy/tremor phenotype in the respective families. &lt;i&gt;MYBPC1&lt;/i&gt; encodes slow Myosin Binding Protein‐C (sMyBP‐C), a modular sarcomeric protein playing structural and regulatory roles via its dynamic interaction with actin and myosin filaments. The Y247H and E248K mutations are located in the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐terminal M‐motif of sMyBP‐C. Both mutations result in markedly increased binding of the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐terminus to myosin, possibly interfering with normal cross‐bridge cycling as the first muscle‐based step in tremor genesis. The clinical tremor features seen in all mutation carriers together with the tremor physiology studies performed in family‐2 suggest amplification by an additional central loop modulating the clinical tremor phenomenology.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we link two novel missense mutations in &lt;i&gt;MYBPC1&lt;/i&gt; with a dominant, mild skeletal myopathy invariably associated with a distinctive tremor. The molecular, genetic and clinical studies are consistent with a unique sarcomeric origin of the tremor, which we classify as “myogenic tremor”.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: SIRT2, ERK and Nrf2 Mediate NAD+ Treatment-Induced Increase in the Antioxidant Capacity of PC12 Cells Under Basal Conditions</title>

	<description>NAbstract
NAD+ (oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) administration is highly beneficial in numerous models of diseases and aging.  It is becoming increasingly important to determine if NAD+ treatment may directly increase the antioxidant capacity of cells under basal conditions.  In current study we tested our hypothesis that NAD+ can directly enhance the antioxidant capacity of cells under basal conditions by using PC12 cells as a cellular model.  We found that NAD+ treatment can increase the GSH/GSSG ratios in the cells under basal conditions.  NAD+ can also increase both the mRNA and protein level of -glutamylcysteine ligase – a key enzyme for glutathione synthesis, which appears to be mediated by the NAD+-induced increase in Nrf2 activity.  These NAD+-induced changes can be prevented by both SIRT2 siRNA and the SIRT2 inhibitor AGK2.  The NAD+-induced changes can also be blocked by the ERK signaling inhibitor U0126.  Moreover, the NAD+-induced ERK activation can be blocked by both SIRT2 siRNA and AGK2.  Collectively, our study has provided the first evidence that NAD+ can enhance directly the antioxidant capacity of the cells under basal conditions, which is mediated by SIRT2, ERK, and Nrf2.  These findings have suggested not only the great nutritional potential of NAD+, but also a novel mechanism underlying the protective effects of the NAD+ administration in the disease models: The NAD+ administration can enhance the resistance of the normal cells to oxidative insults by increasing the antioxidant capacity of the cells.</description>

	<description>Understanding underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases is fundamental to develop effective therapeutic intervention. Yet they remain largely elusive, but metabolic and transcriptional dysregulation are common events. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent lysine deacetylase, regulating transcription and critical for the cellular adaptations to metabolic stress. SIRT1 regulates the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), connecting the energetic state with cell growth and function. The activity of the transcription initiation factor-IA (TIF-IA) is important for the transcriptional regulation of rDNA genes in the nucleolus, and is also sensitive to changes in the cellular energetic state. Moreover TIF-IA is responsive to nutrient-deprivation, neurotrophic stimulation and oxidative stress. Hence, both SIRT1 and TIF-IA connect changes in cellular stress with transcriptional regulation and metabolic adaptation. Moreover, they finely tune the activity of the transcription factor p53, and maintain mitochondrial function and oxidative stress responses. 
Here we reviewed and discussed evidence that SIRT1 and TIF-IA are regulated by shared pathways and their activities preserve neuronal homeostasis in response to metabolic stressors. We provide evidence that loss of rDNA transcription due to altered TIF-IA function alters SIRT1 expression and propose a model of interdependent feedback mechanisms. An imbalance of this signaling might be a critical common event in neurodegenerative diseases. In conclusion, we provide a novel perspective for the prediction of the therapeutic benefits of the modulation of SIRT1- and nucleolar-dependent pathways in metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<description>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a progressive hereditary retinal degenerative disease in which photoreceptor cells undergo degeneration and apoptosis, eventually resulting in irreversible loss of visual function. Currently, no effective treatment exists for this disease. Neuroprotection and inflammation suppression have been reported to delay the development of RP. Metformin is a well-tested drug used to treat type 2 diabetes, and it has been reported to exert beneficial effects in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. In the present study, we used immunofluorescence staining, electroretinogram (ERG) recordings and RNA-Seq to explore the effects of metformin on photoreceptor degeneration and its mechanism in rd1 mice. We found that metformin significantly reduced apoptosis in photoreceptors and delayed the degeneration of photoreceptors and rod bipolar cells in rd1 mice, thus markedly improving the visual function of rd1 mice at P14, P18 and P22 when tested with a light/dark transition test and ERG. Microglial activation in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the retina of rd1 mice was significantly suppressed by metformin. RNA-Seq showed that metformin markedly downregulated inflammatory genes and upregulated the expression of crystallin proteins, which have been demonstrated to be important neuroprotective molecules in the retina, revealing the therapeutic potential of metformin for RP treatment. αA-crystallin proteins were further confirmed to be involved in the neuroprotective effects of metformin in a Ca2+ ionophore-damaged 661W photoreceptor cell line. These data suggest that metformin exerts a protective effect in rd1 mice via both immunoregulatory and new neuroprotective mechanisms.</description>

	<description>Herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSE) is the most common infectious disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in the worldwide. However, the pathogenesis of HSE is not clear. Research has reported that the immune response mediated by the TLR3 signaling pathway is an essential immune response to CNS against HSV infection. But if it is overreacted, it will cause tissue damage and related pathological changes. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanism of Corilagin to control HSE by controlling TLR3 signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo. When cells and mice were activated by Polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) or HSV-1, and then treated with Corilagin, the mRNA and protein levels of TLR3, TRIF, TRADD, TRAF3, TRAF6, NEMO, P38, IRF3 were decreased. Interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), type 1 IFN (IFN-β) were also decreased. Furthermore the expression of TLR3 molecule was silenced or over-expressed, Corilagin could still inhibit the expression of TLR3 and downstream mediators. Additionally the mice brain tissues were measured by immunohistochemistry and haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical (IHC), Corilagin could lessen the degree of brain inflammation. This results indicate that Corilagin can regulate the immune response in the pathogenesis of HSE and relieve inflammatory injury by affecting the TLR3 signaling pathway.</description>

	<description>Purinergic signaling is critically involved in neuroinflammation associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) and its major inflammatory animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Herein, we explored the expression of ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase1 (NTPDase1/CD39) in the spinal cord, at the onset (Eo), peak (Ep) and end (Ee) of EAE. Several-fold increase in mRNA and in NTPDase1 protein levels were observed at Eo and Ep. In situ hybridization combined with fluorescent immunohistochemistry showed that reactive microglia and infiltrated mononuclear cells mostly accounted for the observed increase. Colocalization analysis revealed that up to 80% of Iba1 immunoreactivity and ~ 50% of CD68 immunoreactivity  was colocalized with  NTPDase1, while flow cytometric analysis revealed that ~ 70% of mononuclear infiltrates were NTPDase1+ at Ep. Given the main role of NTPDase1 to degrade proinflammatory ATP, we hypothesized that the observed up-regulation of NTPDase1 may be associated with the transition between proinflammatory M1-like to neuroprotective M2-like phenotype of microglia/macrophages during EAE. Functional phenotype of reactive microglia/macrophages that overexpress NTPDase1 was assessed by multi-image colocalization analysis using iNOS and Arg1 as selective markers for M1 and M2 reactive states, respectively. At the peak of EAE NTPDase1 immunoreactivity showed much higher co-occurrence with Arg1 immunoreactivity in microglia and macrophages, compared to iNOS, implying its stronger association with M2-like reactive phenotype. Additionally, in ~80% of CD68 positive cells NTPDase1 was coexpressed with Arg1 compared to negligible fraction coexpresing iNOS and ~15% coexpresing both markers, additionally indicating prevalent association of NTPDase1 with M2-like microglial/macrophages phenotype at Ep. Together, our data suggest an association between NTPDase1 up-regulation by reactive microglia and infiltrated macrophages and their transition towards antiinflammatory phenotype in EAE.</description>

	<description>Traumatic brain injury (TBI), consisting of damage caused by a blow or jolt that disrupts normal brain function (1), is an emerging health epidemic with ~2.5 million cases occurring annually in the USA that are severe enough to cause hospitalization or death (2). Most common causes of TBI include contact sports, vehicle crashes, domestic violence or war injuries (3). TBI is one of the most consistent candidates for initiating the molecular and cellular cascades that result in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (4). 
Not every TBI event is alike with effects varying from person to person. The majority of people recover from mild TBI within a short period of time but repeated incidents can have deleterious long-lasting effects which depend on factors such as the number of TBI’s sustained, time till medical attention, age, gender and genetics of the individual (5). Despite extensive research many questions still remain regarding diagnosis, treatment and prevention of long-term effects from TBI as well as recovery of brain function. In this review, we discuss using Drosophila melanogaster as a model to study TBI (6) and outline the current TBI inducing methods used to inflict brain trauma. The relatively small brain sized (~100,000 neurons and glia), conserved neurotransmitter signaling mechanisms, and sophisticated genetics of Drosophila melanogaster allows for cell biological, molecular, and genetic analyses that are impractical in mammalian models of TBI.</description>

	<description>Decoding laminar information across deep brain structures and cortical regions is necessary in order to understand the neuronal ensembles that represent cognition and memory. Large animal models are essential for translational research due to their gyrencephalic neuroanatomy and significant white matter composition. A lack of long-length probes with appropriate stiffness to penetrate to deeper structures with minimal damage to the neural interface is one of the major technical limitations to applying the approaches currently utilized in lower order animals to large animals. We therefore tested the performance of multichannel silicon probes of various solutions and designs that were developed specifically for large animal electrophysiology. Neurophysiological signals from dorsal hippocampus were recorded in chronically implanted awake behaving Yucatan pigs. Single units and local field potentials were analyzed to evaluate performance of given silicon probes over time. EDGE-style probes had the highest yields during intra-hippocampal recordings in pigs, making them the most suitable for chronic implantations and awake behavioral experimentation. In addition, the cross-sectional area of silicon probes was found to be a crucial determinant of silicon probe performance over time, potentially due to reduction of damage to the neural interface. Novel 64-channel EDGE-style probes tested acutely produced an optimal single unit separation and a denser sampling of the laminar structure, identifying these research silicon probes as potential candidates for chronic implantations. This study provides an analysis of multichannel silicon probes designed for large animal electrophysiology of deep laminar brain structures, and suggests that current designs are reaching the physical thresholds necessary for long-term (~ 1 month) recordings with single-unit resolution.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Optimal Electrode Size for Multi-Scale Extracellular-Potential Recording From Neuronal Assemblies</title>

	<description>Advances in microfabrication technology have enabled the production of devices containing arrays of thousands of closely spaced recording electrodes, which afford subcellular resolution of electrical signals in neurons and neuronal networks. Rationalizing the electrode size and configuration in such arrays demands consideration of application-specific requirements and inherent features of the electrodes. Tradeoffs among size, spatial density, sensitivity, noise, attenuation, and other factors are inevitable. Although recording extracellular signals from neurons with planar metal electrodes is fairly well established, the effects of the electrode characteristics on the quality and utility of recorded signals, especially for small, densely packed electrodes, have yet to be fully characterized. Here, we present a combined experimental and computational approach to elucidating how electrode size, and size-dependent parameters, such as impedance, baseline noise, and transmission characteristics, influence recorded neuronal signals. Using arrays containing platinum electrodes of different sizes, we experimentally evaluated the electrode performance in the recording of local-field-potentials (LFPs) and extracellular-action-potentials (EAPs) from the following cell preparations: acute brain slices, dissociated cell cultures, and organotypic slice cultures. Moreover, we simulated the potential spatial decay of point-current sources to investigate signal averaging using known signal sources. We demonstrated that the noise and signal attenuation depend more on the electrode impedance than on electrode size, per se, especially for electrodes &amp;lt; 10 µm in width or diameter to achieve high-spatial-resolution readout. By minimizing electrode impedance in small electrodes (&amp;lt; 10 µm), via surface modification, we could maximize the signal-to-noise ratio to electrically visualize the propagation of axonal EAPs and to isolate single-unit spikes. Due to the large amplitude of LFP signals, recording quality was high and nearly independent of electrode size. These findings should be of value in configuring in vitro and in vivo microelectrode arrays for extracellular recordings with high spatial resolution in various applications.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Riemannian Modification of Artifact Subspace Reconstruction for EEG Artifact Handling</title>

	<description>Objective: Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) is an adaptive method for the online or offline correction of artifacts comprising multichannel EEG recordings. It repeatedly computes a principal component analysis on covariance matrices to detect artifacts based on their statistical properties in the component subspace. We adapted the existing ASR implementation by using Riemannian geometry for covariance matrix processing. EEG data that were recorded on smartphone in both outdoors and indoors conditions were used for evaluation (N = 27). A direct comparison between the original artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) and Riemannian ASR (rASR) was conducted for three performance measures: reduction of eye-blinks (sensitivity), improvement of visual-evoked potentials (specificity), and computation time (efficiency). Compared to ASR, our rASR algorithm performed favourably on all three measures. We conclude that rASR is suitable for the offline and online correction of multichannel EEG data acquired in laboratory and in field conditions.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Copernican Approach to Brain Advancement: The Paradigm of Allostatic Orchestration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00129</guid>

	<description>There are two main paradigms for brain-related science, with different implications for brain-focused intervention or advancement.  The paradigm of homeostasis (“stability through constancy,” Walter Cannon), originating from laboratory-based experimental physiology pioneered by Claude Bernard, shows that living systems tend to maintain system functionality in the direction of constancy (or similitude).  The aim of physiology is elucidate the factors that maintain homeostasis, and therapeutics aim to correct abnormal factor functions.  The homeostasis paradigm does not formally recognize influences outside its controlled experimental frames and it is variable in its modelling of neural contributions.  The paradigm of allostatic orchestration (PAO) extends the principle of allostasis (“stability through change”) as originally put forth by Peter Sterling.  The PAO originates from an evolutionary perspective and recognizes that biological set points change in anticipation of changing environments.  The brain is the organ of central command, orchestrating cross-system operations to support optimal behavior at the level of the whole organism.  Alternative views of blood pressure regulation and posttraumatic stress disorder illustrate differences between the paradigms.  For the PAO, complexities of top-down neural effects and environmental context are foundational (not to be “factored out”), and anticipatory regulation is the principle of their interface.  The allostatic state represents the integrated totality of brain-body interactions.  Health itself is an allostatic state of optimal anticipatory oscillation, hypothesized to relate to the state of criticality, a mathematical point of poise between phases, on the border between order and disorder (or the “edge of chaos”).  Diseases are allostatic states of impaired anticipatory oscillations, demonstrated as rigidifications of set points across the brain and body (disease comorbidity).  Conciliation of the paradigms is possible, with “reactive homeostasis” resolved as an illusion stemming from anticipation of environmental monotony.  Considerations are presented with respect to implications of the two paradigms for brain-focused intervention or advancement; the hypothesis that the state of criticality is a vehicle for evolutionary processes; concordance with a philosophy of freedom based on ethical individualism as well as self-creativity, non-obsolescence, empowerment, and citizenship; and concluding reflections on the science and ethics of the placebo, and the potential for virtuous cycles of brain-Anthropocene interactions.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Model-Based Assessment of the Seizure Onset Zone Predictive Power to Inform the Epileptogenic Zone</title>

	<description>Epilepsy surgery is a clinical procedure that aims to remove the brain tissue responsible for the emergence of seizures, the epileptogenic zone (EZ). It is preceded by an evaluation to determine the brain tissue that must be resected. The identification of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) from intracranial EEG recordings stands as one of the key proxies for the EZ. In this study we used computational models of epilepsy to assess to what extent the SOZ may or may not represent the EZ. We considered a set of different synthetic networks (e.g. regular, small-world, random, and scale-free networks) to represent large-scale brain networks and a phenomenological network model of seizure generation. In the model, the SOZ was inferred from the seizure likelihood (SL), a measure of the propensity of single nodes to produce epileptiform dynamics, whilst a surgery corresponded to the removal of nodes and connections from the network. We used the concept of node ictogenicity (NI) to quantify the effectiveness of each node removal on reducing the network’s propensity to generate seizures. This framework enabled us to systematically compare the SOZ and the seizure control achieved by each considered surgery. Specifically, we compared the distributions of SL and NI across different networks. We found that SL and NI were concordant when all nodes were similarly ictogenic, whereas when there was a small fraction of nodes with high NI, the SL was not specific at identifying these nodes. We further considered networks with heterogeneous node excitabilities, i.e. nodes with different susceptibilities of being engaged in seizure activity, to understand how such heterogeneity may affect the relationship between SL and NI. We found that while SL and NI are concordant when there is a small fraction of hyper-excitable nodes in a network that is otherwise homogeneous, they do diverge if the network is heterogeneous, such as in scale-free networks. We observe that SL is highly dependent on node excitabilities, whilst the effect of surgical resections as revealed by NI is mostly determined by network structure. Together our results suggest that the SOZ is not always a good marker of the EZ.</description>

	<description>Objective: Stimulus visual patterns, such as size, content, color, luminosity, and interval, play key roles for brain–computer interface (BCI) performance. However, the three primary colors to be intercompared as a single variable or factor on the same platform are poorly studied. In this work, we configured the visual stimulus patterns with red, green, and blue and designed a novel layout of the BCI interface to study the waveforms and performance of the evoked related potential (ERP).
Approach: Twelve subjects participated in our experiment, which was composed of three different color sub-experiments. Four blocks of the interface were presented along the edge of the screen, and the other four were assembled in the center, to investigate the problem of adjacency distraction. Repeated-measures ANOVA and Bonferroni correction were applied for statistical analysis. 
Main results: The averaged online accuracy was 98.44% for red paradigm, higher than 92.71% for green paradigm and 93.23% for blue paradigm. Furthermore, significant differences in online accuracy (p&amp;lt;0.05) and information transfer rate (p&amp;lt;0.05) were found between red and green paradigms.
Significance: The red stimulus paradigm yielded the best performance. The proposed design of ERP-based BCI was practical and effective for many potential applications.</description>

	<description>Background: Chronic inflammation plays a significant role in accelerating the aging process and is closely associated with the initiation and progression of a broad range of age-related diseases. Physical exercise is considered beneficial in alleviating these conditions, but the effects of aerobic exercise on inflammatory markers in a healthy population should be furtherly clarified. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of aerobic exercise on inflammatory markers in middle-aged and older adults. Methods: The literature search was conducted utilizing PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from their inception through April 2018, and the reference lists were screened to identify appropriate studies. Only randomized controlled trials that investigated the effect of aerobic exercise on inflammatory markers in middle-aged and older adults were eligible for this review. Results: Eleven studies involving 1250 participants were retrieved from the databases for analysis. The pooled results showed that aerobic exercise significantly reduced inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP): SMD = 0.53, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.11, p = 0.0002; tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α): SMD = 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.19, p = 0.0007; interleukin 6（IL-6): SMD = 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.19, p = 0.0007). No significant improvement was found in relation to interleukin 4 (IL-4). Conclusions: Aerobic exercise may have a positive effect on reduction of CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6 in middle-aged and older adults. Further randomized controlled trials (RCTs) need to be conducted to determine the effect of aerobic exercise on additional inflammatory markers in the population of middle-aged and older adults.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cingulate Cortex Atrophy Is Associated With Hearing Loss in Presbycusis With Cochlear Amplifier Dysfunction</title>

	<description>Age-related hearing loss is associated with cognitive decline and has been proposed as a risk factor for dementia. However, the mechanisms that relate hearing loss to cognitive decline remain elusive. Here, we propose that the impairment of the cochlear amplifier mechanism is associated with structural brain changes and cognitive impairment. Ninety-six subjects aged over 65 years old (63 female and 33 male) were evaluated using brain magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological and audiological assessments, including distortion product otoacoustic emissions as a measure of the cochlear amplifier function. All the analyses were adjusted by age, gender and education. The group with cochlear amplifier dysfunction showed greater brain atrophy in the cingulate cortex and in the parahippocampus. In addition, the atrophy of the cingulate cortex was associated with cognitive impairment in episodic and working memories and in language and visuoconstructive abilities. We conclude that the neural abnormalities observed in presbycusis subjects with cochlear amplifier dysfunction extend beyond core auditory network and are associated with cognitive decline in multiple domains. These results suggest that a cochlear amplifier dysfunction in presbycusis is an important mechanism relating hearing impairments to brain atrophy in the extended network of effortful hearing.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cognitive Profiling Related to Cerebral Amyloid Beta Burden Using Machine Learning Approaches</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00095</guid>

	<description>Abstract
Background:
Cerebral amyloid beta (Aβ) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ can be detected in vivo with amyloid imaging or cerebrospinal fluid assessments. However, these technologies can be both expensive and invasive, and their accessibility is limited in many clinical settings. Hence the current study aims to identify multivariate cost-efficient markers for Aβ positivity among non-demented individuals using machine learning (ML) approaches.
Methods:
The relationship between cost-efficient candidate markers and Aβ status was examined by analyzing 762 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-2 cohort at baseline visit (286 cognitively normal, 332 with mild cognitive impairment, and 144 with AD; mean age 73.2 years, range 55–90). Demographic variables (age, gender, education, and APOE status) and neuropsychological test scores were used as predictors in an ML algorithm. Cerebral Aβ burden and Aβ positivity were measured using 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography images. The adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) ML algorithm was implemented to identify cognitive performance and demographic variables and distinguish individuals from the population at high risk for cerebral Aβ burden. For generalizability, results were further checked by randomly dividing the data into training sets and test sets and checking predictive performances by 10-fold cross-validation.
Results:
Out of neuropsychological predictors, visuospatial ability and episodic memory test results were consistently significant predictors for Aβ positivity across subgroups with demographic variables and other cognitive measures considered. The adaptive LASSO model using out-of-sample classification could distinguish abnormal levels of Aβ. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.754 in the mild change group, 0.803 in the moderate change group, and 0.864 in the severe change group, respectively.
Conclusions:
Our results showed that the cost-efficient neuropsychological model with demographics could predict Aβ positivity, suggesting a potential surrogate method for detecting Aβ deposition non-invasively with clinical utility. More specifically, it could be a very brief screening tool in various settings to recruit participants with potential biomarker evidence of AD brain pathology. These identified individuals would be valuable participants in secondary prevention trials aimed at detecting an anti-amyloid drug effect in the non-demented population.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Angiotensin II Receptor 1 Blockage Limits Brain Damage and Improves Functional Outcome After Brain Injury in Aged Animals Despite Age-Dependent Reduction in AT1 Expression</title>

	<description>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a frequent pathology and associated with poor outcome in the aged population. We recently observed accelerated cerebral inflammation in aged mice in response to TBI. Candesartan is a potent specific inhibitor of angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) which limits cerebral inflammation and brain damage in juvenile animals after experimental TBI. In the present study, we show significantly lower posttraumatic AT1 mRNA levels in aged (21 months) compared to young (2 months) mice. Despite low cerebral At1 expression, pharmacologic blockade by treatment with candesartan (daily, beginning 30 minutes after experimental TBI by controlled cortical impact [CCI]) was highly effective in both young and aged animals and reduced histological brain damage by -20 % after five days. In young mice neurological improvement was enhanced by AT1 inhibition five days after CCI. In old animals, candesartan treatment reduced functional impairment already on day 3 after TBI and post-traumatic body weight loss was attenuated. Candesartan reduced microglial activation (-40 %) in young and aged animals, and neutrophil infiltration (-40 - 50 %) in aged mice, whereas T-cell infiltration was not changed in both age groups. In young animals, markers of anti-inflammatory microglia M2a polarization (arginase 1 [Arg1], chitinase3-like 3 [Ym1]) were increased by candesartan at days 1 and 5 after insult. In aged mice five days after insult expression of Arg1 was significantly higher independent of the treatment, whereas Ym1 gene expression was further enhanced by AT1 inhibition. Despite age dependent posttraumatic differences in At1 expression levels, inhibition of AT1 was highly effective in a posttreatment paradigm. Targeting inflammation with candesartan is therefore a promising therapeutic strategy to limit secondary brain damage independent of the age.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Graded Change in Connectivity across the Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex Reveals Distinct Subregions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz079</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The functional heterogeneity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) suggests it may include distinct functional subregions. To date these have not been well elucidated. Regions with differentiable connectivity (and as a result likely dissociable functions) may be identified using emergent data-driven approaches. However, prior parcellations of the vmPFC have only considered hard splits between distinct regions, although both hard and graded connectivity changes may exist. Here we determine the full pattern of change in structural and functional connectivity across the vmPFC for the first time and extract core distinct regions. Both structural and functional connectivity varied along a dorsomedial to ventrolateral axis from relatively dorsal medial wall regions to relatively lateral basal orbitofrontal cortex. The pattern of connectivity shifted from default mode network to sensorimotor and multimodal semantic connections. This finding extends the classical distinction between primate medial and orbital regions by demonstrating a similar gradient in humans for the first time. Additionally, core distinct regions in the medial wall and orbitofrontal cortex were identified that may show greater correspondence to functional differences than prior hard parcellations. The possible functional roles of the orbitofrontal cortex and medial wall are discussed.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;c‐Jun‐amino‐terminal kinase‐interacting protein 3 (JIP3), encoded by &lt;i&gt;MAPK8IP3&lt;/i&gt;, is an adaptor protein of the kinesin‐1 complex and essential for axonal transport in neurons. However, an association between &lt;i&gt;MAPK8IP3&lt;/i&gt; variants and human disease has not been established. We identified 5 individuals from four families with recurrent de novo variants c.1732C&amp;gt;T (p.Arg578Cys) and c.3436C&amp;gt;T (p.Arg1146Cys) in &lt;i&gt;MAPK8IP3&lt;/i&gt;. The core phenotype includes spastic diplegia, intellectual disability, cerebral atrophy, and corpus callosum hypoplasia. Zebrafish embryos overexpressing human mutant JIP3 showed axon varicosities of the posterior lateral line nerve, suggesting an adverse effect on the developing axons. Our results suggest that &lt;i&gt;MAPK8IP3&lt;/i&gt; variants cause a neurodevelopmental disease. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Physiological and Behavioral Responses to Optogenetic Stimulation of PKD2L1+ Type III Taste Cells</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Type III taste cells in mammalian taste buds are implicated in the detection and communication of sour and some salty stimuli, as well as carbonation and water. With this variety of proposed roles, it is unclear what information activated Type III cells are communicating to the central nervous system. To better elucidate the role of Type III cells in the taste bud, we use a Type III cell-specific protein (polycystic kidney disease 2-like 1, PKD2L1) to drive Cre-dependent expression of light sensitive channelrhodopsin (Ai32) in mouse Type III taste cells. Activation of these cells with light produces a taste nerve response in both the chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal nerves, and elicits a slight but significant aversion in two-bottle preference tests in both male and female mice. Unlike previous reports (Zocchi et al., 2017), our mice did not react to blue light stimulation with sustained drinking responses. These data suggest that Type III cells are capable of communicating the presence of aversive stimuli in the oral cavity, which is in line with their responsiveness to sour and high concentrations of salt stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The sour-sensing Type III cells of the mammalian taste bud are historically difficult to study in vivo, as sour stimulation of the tongue causes intracellular acidification in all epithelial cells, not just Type III cells. The present study circumvents this issue by using Cre-dependent expression of channelrhodopsin in Type III cells, so that they can be activated by blue light, rather than acid (sour). Our data suggest that Type III cells communicate an aversive signal to the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Spreading of α-Synuclein and Tau: A Systematic Comparison of the Mechanisms Involved</title>

	<description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are age-associated neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) and tau, respectively. The coexistence of aSyn and tau aggregates suggests a strong overlap between tauopathies and synucleinopathies. Interestingly, misfolded forms of aSyn and tau can propagate from cell to cell, and throughout the brain, thereby templating the misfolding of native forms of the proteins. The exact mechanisms involved in the propagation of the two proteins show similarities, and are reminiscent of the spreading characteristic of prion diseases. Recently, several models were developed to the study the spreading of aSyn and tau. Here, we discuss the mechanisms involved, the similarities and differences between the spreading of the two proteins and that of the prion protein, and the different cell and animal models used for studying these processes. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved may lead to the identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention in a variety of devastating neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Differential Neuroplastic Changes in Fibromyalgia and Depression Indexed by Up-Regulation of Motor Cortex Inhibition and Disinhibition of the Descending Pain System: An Exploratory Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00138</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00138</link>
	<description>Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and fibromyalgia (FM) present overlapped symptoms. Although the connection between these two disorders has not been elucidated yet, the disruption of neuroplastic processes that mediate the equilibrium in the inhibitory systems stands out as a possible mechanism. Thus, the purpose of this cross-sectional exploratory study was: i) to compare the motor cortex inhibition indexed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures [short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation  (ICF)], as well as the function of descending pain modulatory systems (DPMS) among FM, MDD, and healthy subjects (HS); ii) to compare SICI, ICF and the role of DPMS evaluated by the change on Numerical Pain Scale (NPS) during the conditioned pain modulation test (CPM-test) between FM and MDD considering the BDNF-adjusted index; iii) to assess the relationship between the role of DPMS and the BDNF-adjusted index, despite  clinical diagnosis.

Patients and methods:  A cohort of 63 women, aged 18 to 75 years [FM (n=18), MDD (n=19) and HC (n=29)]. 

Results: The MANCOVA analysis revealed that the mean of SICI was 53.40% larger in FM compared to MDD [1.03 (0.50) vs. 0.55(0.43)] and 66.99% larger compared to HC [1.03 (0.50) vs. 0.34 (0.19), respectively. The inhibitory potency of the DPMS assessed by the change on the NPS during CPM-test was 112.29 % lower in the FM compared to MDD [0.22 (1.37) vs. - 0.87 (1.49)]. The mean of BDNF from FM compared to MDD was 35.70% higher [49.82 (16.31) vs. 14.12 (8.86)]. In FM, the Spearman`s coefficient between the change in the NPS during CPM-test with the SICI was Rho=-0.49, [confidence interval (CI) 95%; -0.78 to -0.03)]. The BDNF-adjusted index was positively correlated with the disinhibition of the DPMS. 

Conclusion: These findings support the hypothesis that in FM a deteriorated function of cortical inhibition, indexed by a higher SICI parameter, a lower function of the DPMS, together with a higher level of BDNF indicate that FM has different pathological substrates from depression. They suggest that an up-regulation phenomenon of intracortical inhibitory networks associated with a disruption of the DPMS function occurs in FM.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: BDNF Controls Bidirectional Endocannabinoid Plasticity at Corticostriatal Synapses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz081</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The dorsal striatum exhibits bidirectional corticostriatal synaptic plasticity, NMDAR and endocannabinoids (eCB) mediated, necessary for the encoding of procedural learning. Therefore, characterizing factors controlling corticostriatal plasticity is of crucial importance. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, the tropomyosine receptor kinase-B (TrkB), shape striatal functions, and their dysfunction deeply affects basal ganglia. BDNF/TrkB signaling controls NMDAR plasticity in various brain structures including the striatum. However, despite cross-talk between BDNF and eCBs, the role of BDNF in eCB plasticity remains unknown. Here, we show that BDNF/TrkB signaling promotes eCB-plasticity (LTD and LTP) induced by rate-based (low-frequency stimulation) or spike-timing–based (spike-timing–dependent plasticity, STDP) paradigm in striatum. We show that TrkB activation is required for the expression and the scaling of both eCB-LTD and eCB-LTP. Using 2-photon imaging of dendritic spines combined with patch-clamp recordings, we show that TrkB activation prolongs intracellular calcium transients, thus increasing eCB synthesis and release. We provide a mathematical model for the dynamics of the signaling pathways involved in corticostriatal plasticity. Finally, we show that TrkB activation enlarges the domain of expression of eCB-STDP. Our results reveal a novel role for BDNF/TrkB signaling in governing eCB-plasticity expression in striatum and thus the engram of procedural learning.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist Treatment Does Not Reduce Abuse-Related Effects of Opioid Drugs</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Dependence on opioids and the number of opioid overdose deaths are serious and escalating public health problems, but medication-assisted treatments for opioid addiction remain inadequate for many patients. Glucagon-like pepide-1 (GLP-1) is a gut hormone and neuropeptide with actions in peripheral tissues and in the brain, including regulation of blood glucose and food intake. GLP-1 analogs, which are approved diabetes medications, can reduce the reinforcing and rewarding effects of alcohol, cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine in rodents. Investigations on effects of GLP-1 analogs on opioid reward and reinforcement have not been reported. We assessed the effects of the GLP-1 receptor agonist Exendin-4 (Ex4) on opioid-related behaviors in male mice, i.e., morphine-conditioned place preference (CPP), intravenous self-administration (IVSA) of the short-acting synthetic opioid remifentanil, naltrexone-precipitated morphine withdrawal, morphine analgesia (male and female mice), and locomotor activity. Ex4 treatment had no effect on morphine-induced CPP, withdrawal, or hyperlocomotion. Ex4 failed to decrease remifentanil self-administration, if anything reinforcing effects of remifentanil appeared increased in Ex4-treated mice relative to saline. Ex4 did not significantly affect analgesia. In contrast, Ex4 dose dependently decreased oral alcohol self-administration, and suppressed spontaneous locomotor activity. Taken together, Ex4 did not attenuate the addiction-related behavioral effects of opioids, indicating that GLP-1 analogs would not be useful medications in the treatment of opioid addiction. This difference between opioids and other drug classes investigated to date may shed light on the mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor treatment in the addictive effects of alcohol, central stimulants, and nicotine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals with urea cycle disorders (UCDs) often present with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The major aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions on cognitive outcomes in UCDs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prospective, observational, multicenter study includes data from 503 individuals with UCDs who had comprehensive neurocognitive testing with a cumulative follow‐up of 702 patient‐years.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mean cognitive standard deviation score (cSDS) was lower in symptomatic than in asymptomatic (p&amp;lt;0.001, t‐test) individuals with UCDs. Intellectual disability (Intellectual quotient &amp;lt; 70; cSDS &amp;lt; ‐2.0) was associated with the respective subtype of UCD and early disease onset, while height of the initial peak plasma ammonium concentration was inversely associated with neurocognitive outcomes in mitochondrial (i.e. proximal) rather than cytosolic (i.e. distal) UCDs. In ornithine transcarbamylase and argininosuccinate synthetase 1 deficiencies, we did not find evidence that monoscavenger therapy with sodium or glycerol phenylbutyrate was superior to sodium benzoate in providing cognitive protection. Early liver transplantation appears to be beneficial for UCDs. Noteworthy, individuals with argininosuccinate synthetase 1 and argininosuccinate lyase deficiencies identified by newborn screening had better neurocognitive outcomes than those diagnosed after the manifestation of first symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive function is related to interventional and non‐interventional variables. Early detection by newborn screening and early liver transplantation appear to offer greater cognitive protection, but none of the currently used nitrogen scavengers was superior with regard to long‐term neurocognitive outcome. Further confirmation could determine these variables as important clinical indicators of neuroprotection for individuals with UCDs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Although several agents have been identified to provide therapeutic benefits in Huntington Disease (HD), the number of conventionally used treatments remains limited and only symptomatic. Thus, it is plausible that the need to identify new therapeutic targets for the development of alternative and more effective treatments is becoming increasingly urgent. 
Recently, sphingosine-1-phosphate axis has been reported to be a valid potential novel molecular target for therapy development in HD. 
Modulation of aberrant metabolism of S1P in HD has been proved to exert neuroprotective action in vitro settings including human HD iPSC-derived neurons. 
In this study, we investigated whether promoting S1P production by stimulating Sphingosine Kinase 1 (SPHK1) by the selective activator, K6PC-5, may have therapeutic benefit in-vivo in R6/2 HD mouse model. Our findings indicate that chronic administration of 0.05 mg/kg K6PC-5 exerted an overall beneficial effect in R6/2 mice. It significantly slowed down the progressive motor deficit associated with disease progression, modulated S1P metabolism, evoked the activation of pro-survival pathways and markedly reduced the toxic mutant huntingtin aggregation.
These results suggest that K6PC-5 may represent a future therapeutic option in HD and may potentially counteract the perturbed brain function induced by deregulated S1P pathways</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Oleoylethanolamide Modulates BDNF-ERK Signaling and Neurogenesis in the Hippocampi of Rats Exposed to Δ9-THC and Ethanol Binge Drinking During Adolescence</title>

	<description>Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an endogenous N-acylethanolamide that modulates ethanol-seeking behavior and ethanol-induced neuroinflammation. In the present study we further analyze the role of OEA in hippocampal neurogenesis, BDNF-ERK signaling and spatial memory that are affected by alcohol. Additionally, we addressed the effects of OEA on the association of alcohol and cannabis, a frequent combination in human alcohol addicts, and whose long-term effects are far from being understood. To this end, OEA (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was pharmacologically administered for 5 days/week in a preclinical model of adolescent rats with binge-like consumption (1 day/week) of ethanol (3 g/kg, i.g.) combined or not with acute administrations of Δ9-THC (5 mg/kg, i.p.) for 5 weeks. OEA restored ethanol/THC-related decreases in both short-term spatial memory (spontaneous alternation by Y-maze) and circulating levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), reduced cell proliferation (Mki67 and IdU+ cells) and maturation (Dcx, Calb1), and improved cell survival (Casp3 and BrdU+ cells) in the dorsal hippocampus. Interestingly, OEA alone or combined with THC also decreased the mRNA levels of neurotrophic factors (Bdnf, Ntf3) and the NT3 receptor TrkC, but increased the BDNF receptor TrkB in the hippocampus of ethanol-exposed rats. These effects were likely associated with a OEA-specific phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1, key signaling regulators of cell proliferation and survival. These results suggest a regulatory role of OEA in short-term spatial memory and hippocampal neurogenesis through BDNF/AKT/ERK1 signaling in response to acute THC in an alcoholic context during adolescence.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Endocannabinoid System in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type-3 and Other Autosomal-Dominant Cerebellar Ataxias: Potential Role in Pathogenesis and Expected Relevance as Neuroprotective Targets</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00094</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00094</link>
	<description>Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of hereditary and progressive neurological disorders characterized by a loss of balance and motor coordination typically associated with cerebellar atrophy. The most prevalent SCA types are all polyQ disorders like Huntington’s disease, sharing the most relevant events in pathogenesis with this basal ganglia disorder, but with most of the damage concentrated in cerebellar neurons, and in their afferent and efferent connections (e.g. brainstem nuclei). SCAs have no cure and effective symptom-alleviating and disease-modifying therapies are not currently available. However, based on results obtained in studies conducted in murine models and information derived from analyses in post-mortem tissue samples from patients, which show notably higher levels of CB1 receptors found in different cerebellar neuronal subpopulations, the blockade of these receptors has been proposed for acutely modulating motor incoordination in cerebellar ataxias, whereas their chronic activation for preserving specific neuronal losses. Additional studies in post-mortem tissues from SCA patients have also demonstrated elevated levels of CB2 receptors in Purkinje neurons, as well as in glial elements in the granular layer and in the cerebellar white matter, with a similar profile found for endocannabinoid hydrolyzing enzymes, then suggesting that activating CB2 receptors and/or inhibiting these enzymes may also serve to develop cannabinoid-based neuroprotective therapies. The present review will address both aspects. On one hand, that the endocannabinoid signaling becomes dysregulated in the cerebellum and also in other CNS structures (e.g. brainstem, basal ganglia) in SCAs, which may contribute to the progression of pathogenic events in these diseases. On the other hand, that these endocannabinoid alterations may be pharmacologically corrected or enhanced, and this may have therapeutic consequences, either alleviating specific symptoms or eliciting neuroprotective effects, an objective presently under investigation.</description>

	<description>Medial frontal cortex is currently viewed as the main hub of the performance monitoring system; upon detection of an error committed, it establishes functional connections with brain regions involved in task performance, thus leading to neural adjustments in them. Previous research has identified targets of such adjustments in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cortical regions, motor cortical areas, and subthalamic nucleus. Yet most of such studies involved visual tasks with relatively moderate cognitive load and strong dependence on motor inhibition – thus highlighting sensory, executive and motor effects while underestimating sensorimotor transformation and related aspects of decision making. Currently there is ample evidence that posterior parietal cortical areas are involved in task-specific neural processes of decision making (including evidence accumulation, sensorimotor transformation, attention, etc.) – yet, to our knowledge, no EEG studies have demonstrated post-error increase in functional connectivity in the theta-band between midfrontal and posterior parietal areas during performance on non-visual tasks. In the present study, we recorded EEG while subjects were performing an auditory version of the cognitively demanding attentional condensation task; this task involves rather non-straightforward stimulus-to-response mapping rules, thus, creating increased load on sensorimotor transformation. We observed strong pre-response alpha-band suppression in the left parietal area, which presumably reflected involvement of the posterior parietal cortex in task-specific decision-making processes. Negative feedback was followed by increased midfrontal theta-band power and increased functional coupling in the theta band between midfrontal and left parietal regions. This could be interpreted as activation of the performance monitoring system and top-down influence of this system on the posterior parietal regions involved in decision making, respectively. This inter-site coupling related to negative feedback was stronger for subjects who tended to commit errors with slower response times. Generally, current findings support the idea that slower errors are related to the state of outcome uncertainty caused by failures of task-specific processes, associated with posterior parietal regions.</description>

	<description>Extensive research using penetrating electrodes implanted in the central and peripheral nervous systems has been performed for many decades with significant advances made in recent years. While penetrating devices provide proximity to individual neurons in vivo, they suffer from declining performance over the course of months and often fail within a year. 2D histology studies using serial tissue sections have been extremely insightful in identifying and quantifying factors such as astroglial scar formation and neuronal death around the implant sites that may be contributing to failures. However, 2D histology has limitations in providing a holistic picture of the problems occurring at the electrode-tissue interface and struggles to analyze tissue below the electrode tips where the electrode tracks are no longer visible. In this study, we present 3D reconstruction of serial sections to overcome the limitations of 2D histological analysis. We used a cohort of software: XuvStitch, AutoAligner, and Imaris coupled with custom MATLAB programming to correct warping effects. Once the 3D image volume was reconstructed, we were able to use Imaris to quantify neuronal densities around the electrode tips of a hybrid microelectrode array incorporating Blackrock, Microprobes, and NeuroNexus electrodes in the same implant. This paper presents proof-of-concept and detailed methodological description of a technique which can be used to quantify neuronal densities in future studies of implanted electrodes.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Data-Driven Analysis of Age, Sex, and Tissue Effects on Gene Expression Variability in Alzheimer's Disease</title>

	<description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been categorized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as the 6th leading cause of death in the United States. AD is a significant health-care burden because of its increased occurrence (specifically in the elderly population) and the lack of effective treatments and preventive methods. With an increase in life expectancy, the CDC expects AD cases to rise to 15 million by 2060. Aging has been previously associated with susceptibility to AD, and there are ongoing efforts to effectively differentiate between normal and AD age-related brain degeneration and memory loss. AD targets neuronal function and can cause neuronal loss due to the buildup of amyloid-beta  plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. 

Our study aims to identify temporal changes within gene expression profiles of healthy controls and AD subjects. We conducted a meta-analysis using publicly available microarray expression data from AD and healthy cohorts. For our meta-analysis, we selected datasets that reported donor age and gender, and used Affymetrix and Illumina microarray platforms (8 datasets, 2,088 samples). Raw microarray expression data were re-analyzed, and normalized across arrays. We then performed an analysis of variance, using a linear model that incorporated age, tissue type, sex, and disease state as effects, as well as study to account for batch effects, and including binary interaction between factors.  Our results identified 3,735 statistically significant (Bonferroni adjusted p&amp;lt;0.05) gene expression differences between AD and healthy controls, which we filtered for biological effect (10% two-tailed quantiles of mean differences between groups) to obtain 352 genes. Interesting pathways identified as enriched comprised of neurodegenerative diseases pathways (including AD), and also mitochondrial translation and dysfunction, synaptic vesicle cycle and GABAergic synapse, and gene ontology terms enrichment in neuronal system, transmission across chemical synapses and mitochondrial translation.

Overall our approach allowed us to effectively combine multiple available microarray datasets and identify gene expression differences between AD and healthy individuals including full age and tissue type considerations. Our findings provide potential gene and pathway associations that can be targeted to improve AD diagnostics and potentially treatment or prevention. (US).</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Multimodal Evaluation of TMS - Induced Somatosensory Plasticity and Behavioral Recovery in Rats With Contusion Spinal Cord Injury</title>

	<description>Introduction: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes partial or complete damage to sensory and motor pathways and induces immediate changes in cortical function. Current rehabilitative strategies do not address this early alteration, therefore impacting the degree of neuroplasticity and subsequent recovery. The following study aims to test if a non-invasive brain stimulation technique such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is effective in promoting plasticity and rehabilitation, and can be used as an early intervention strategy in a rat model of SCI. 

Methods: A contusion SCI was induced at segment T9 in adult rats. An rTMS coil was positioned over the brain to deliver high frequency stimulation. Behavior, motor and sensory functions were tested in three groups: SCI rats that received high-frequency (20 Hz) rTMS within 10 minutes post injury (acute-TMS; n=7); SCI rats that received TMS starting two weeks post injury (chronic-TMS; n=5), and SCI rats that received sham TMS (no-TMS, n=5). Locomotion was evaluated by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) and gridwalk tests. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from the forepaw across all groups to measure integrity of motor pathways. Functional MRI (fMRI) responses to contralateral tactile hindlimb stimulation were measured in an 11.7T horizontal bore small-animal scanner. 

Results: The acute-TMS group demonstrated the fastest improvements in locomotor performance in both the BBB and gridwalk tests compared to chronic and no-TMS groups. MEP responses from forepaw showed significantly greater difference in the inter-peak latency between acute-TMS and no-TMS groups, suggesting increases in motor function. Finally, the acute-TMS group showed increased fMRI-evoked responses to hindlimb stimulation over the right and left hindlimb primary somatosensory representations (S1), respectively; the chronic-TMS group showed moderate sensory responses in comparison, and the no-TMS group exhibited the lowest sensory responses to both hindlimbs.

Conclusion: The results suggest that rTMS therapy beginning in the acute phase after spinal cord injury promotes neuroplasticity and is an effective rehabilitative approach in a rat model of SCI.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Erythropoietin and Friedreich Ataxia: Time for a Reappraisal?</title>

	<description>Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a rare neurological disorder due to deficiency of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Frataxin deficiency results in impaired mitochondrial function and iron deposition in affected tissues. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a cytokine which was mostly known as a key regulator of erythropoiesis until cumulative evidence showed additional neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties. These features offered the rationale for advancement of EPO in clinical trials in different neurological disorders in the past years, including FRDA. Several mechanisms of action of EPO may be beneficial in FRDA. First of all, EPO exposure results in frataxin upregulation in vitro and in vivo. By promoting erythropoiesis, EPO influences iron metabolism and induces shifts in iron pool which may ameliorate conditions of free iron excess and iron accumulation. Furthermore, EPO signaling is crucial for mitochondrial gene activation and mitochondrial biogenesis. Up to date nine clinical trials investigated the effects of EPO and derivatives in FRDA. The majority of these studies had a proof-of-concept design. Considering the natural history of FRDA, all of them were too short in duration and not powered for clinical changes. However, these studies addressed significant issues in the treatment with EPO, such as (1) the challenge of the dose finding, (2) stability of frataxin up-regulation, (3) continuous versus intermittent stimulation with EPO/regimen, or (4) tissue changes in vivo after EPO exposure (muscle biopsy, brain imaging). Despite several clinical trials in the past, no treatment is available for the treatment of FRDA.  Current lines of research focus on gene therapy, frataxin replacement strategies and on regulation of key metabolic checkpoints such as NrF2. Due to potential crosstalk with all these mechanisms, interventions on EPO pathway still represent a valuable research field. The recent development of small EPO mimetics which maintain cytoprotective properties without erythropoietic action may open a new era in EPO research for the treatment of FRDA.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Differential Aggregation and Phosphorylation of Alpha Synuclein in Membrane Compartments Associated With Parkinson Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00382</guid>

	<description>The aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) is a major factor behind the onset of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Sublocalization of this protein may be relevant for the formation of multimeric α-syn oligomeric configurations, insoluble aggregates that form Lewy bodies in PD brains. Processing of this protein aggregation is regulated by associations with distinct lipid classes. For instance, instability of lipid raft (LR) microdomains, membrane regions with a particular lipid composition, is an early event in the development of PD. However, the relevance of membrane microdomains in the regulation and trafficking of the distinct α-syn configurations associated with PD remains unexplored. In this study, using 6- and 14-month-old healthy and MPTP-treated animals as a model of PD, we have investigated the putative molecular alterations of raft membrane microstructures, and their impact on α-syn dynamics and conformation. A comparison of lipid analyses of LR microstructures and non-raft (NR) fractions showed alterations in gangliosides, cholesterol, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and phospholipids in the midbrain and cortex of aged and MPTP-treated mice. In particular, the increase of PUFA and phosphatidylserine (PS) during aging correlated with α-syn multimeric formation in NR. In these aggregates, α-syn was phosphorylated in pSer129, the most abundant post-transductional modification of α-syn promoting toxic aggregation. Interestingly, similar variations in PUFA and PS content correlating with α-syn insoluble accumulation were also detected in membrane microstructures from the human cortex of incidental Parkinson Disease (iPD) and PD, as compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, structural changes in membrane lipid microenvironments may induce rearrangements in raft-interacting proteins involved in other neuropathologies. Therefore, we also investigated the dynamic of other protein markers involved in cognition and memory impairment such as metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), ionotropic NMDA receptor (NMDAR2B), prion protein (PrPc) and amyloid precursor protein (APP), whose activity depends on membrane lipid organization. We observed a decline of these protein markers in LR fractions with the progression of aging and pathology. Overall, our findings demonstrate that lipid alterations in membranous compartments promoted by brain aging and PD-like injury may have an effect on α-syn aggregation and segregation in abnormal multimeric structures.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Using Chronopotentiometry to Better Characterize the Charge Injection Mechanisms of Platinum Electrodes Used in Bionic Devices</title>

	<description>The safe charge injection capacity and charge density of neural stimulating electrodes is based on empirical evidence obtained from stimulating feline cortices.  Stimulation induced tissue damage may be caused by electrochemical or biological mechanisms.  Separating these mechanisms requires greater understanding of charge transfer at the electrode-tissue interface.  Clinical devices typically use a biphasic waveform with controlled current.  Therefore, the charge injection mechanism and charge injection capacity of platinum was assessed on a commercial potentiostat by chronopotentiometry (controlled current stimulation).  Platinum is a non-ideal electrode, charge injection by chronopotentiometry can be passed via capacitive and Faradaic mechanisms.  Electrodes were tested under a variety of conditions to assess the impact on charge injection capacity.  The change in electrode potential (charge injection capacity) was affected by applied charge density, pulse length, pulse polarity, electrode size, polishing method, electrolyte composition and oxygen concentration.  The safe charge injection capacity and charge density could be increased by changing the electrode-solution composition and stimulation parameters.  However, certain conditions (eg acid polished electrodes) allowed the electrode to exceed the water electrolysis potential despite the stimulation protocol being deemed safe according to the Shannon plot.  Multiple current pulses led to a shift or ratcheting in electrode potential due to changes in the electrode-solution composition. An accurate measure of safe charge injection capacity and charge density of an implantable electrode can only be obtained from suitable conditions (an appropriately degassed electrolyte and clinically relevant electrode structure).  Cyclic voltammetric measurement of charge injection capacity can be performed on implantable electrodes, but will not provide information on electrode stability to multiple chronopotentiometric pulses.  In contrast, chronopotentiometry will provide details on electrode stability, but the minimum time resolution of typical commercial potentiostats (ms range) is greater than used in a clinical stimulator (µs range) so that extrapolation to short stimulation pulses is required.  A chronopotentiometic biphasic protocol is typically used as an impedance test.  Here it is shown that the measured potential is a function of many parameters.  Subsequently, impedance test results allow electrode comparison and to indicate electrode failure, but use of Ohm’s law to calculate an impedance value is not valid.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Correlates of Spreading Depolarization, Spreading Depression, and Negative Ultraslow Potential in Epidural Versus Subdural Electrocorticography</title>

	<description>Spreading depolarizations (SD) are characterized by near-complete breakdown of the transmembrane ion gradients, neuronal oedema and activity loss (=depression). The SD extreme in ischemic tissue, termed ‘terminal SD’, shows prolonged depolarization, in addition to a slow baseline variation called ‘negative ultraslow potential’ (NUP). The NUP is the largest bioelectrical signal ever recorded from the human brain and is thought to reflect the progressive recruitment of neurons into death in the wake of SD. However, it is unclear whether the NUP is a field potential or results from contaminating sensitivities of platinum electrodes. In contrast to Ag/AgCl-based electrodes in animals, platinum/iridium electrodes are the gold standard for intracranial direct current (DC) recordings in humans. Here, we investigated the full continuum including short-lasting SDs under normoxia, long-lasting SDs under systemic hypoxia, and terminal SD under severe global ischemia using platinum/iridium electrodes in rats to better understand their recording characteristics. Sensitivities for detecting SDs or NUPs were 100% for both electrode types. Nonetheless, the platinum/iridium-recorded NUP was ten times smaller in rats than humans. The SD continuum was then further investigated by comparing subdural platinum/iridium and epidural titanium peg electrodes in patients. In seven patients with either aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage or malignant hemispheric stroke, two epidural peg electrodes were placed 10mm from a subdural strip. We found that 31/67 SDs (46%) on the subdural strip were also detected epidurally. SDs that had longer negative DC shifts and spread more widely across the subdural strip were more likely to be observed in epidural recordings. One patient displayed an SD-initiated NUP while undergoing brain death despite continued circulatory function. The NUP’s amplitude was -150mV subdurally and -67mV epidurally. This suggests that the human NUP is a bioelectrical field potential rather than an artefact of electrode sensitivity to other factors, since the dura separates the epidural from the subdural compartment and the epidural microenvironment was unlikely changed, given that ventilation, arterial pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation remained constant during the NUP. Our data provide further evidence for the clinical value of invasive electrocorticographic monitoring, highlighting important possibilities as well as limitations of less invasive recording techniques.</description>

	<description>There is a principle in science, known as Occam’s razor, that says the correct solution is usually the one with the simplest explanation. The microbiota-gut-brain axis, an interdependent series of communication loops between the enteric nervous system, the microbiota, the gut, and the brain, offers important insight into how changes in our gut affect distant organs like our brains. The inherent complexity of this axis with the crosstalk between the immune system, inflammatory states, and the thousands of bacteria, viral, and fungal species that together make up the microbiota make studying the interactions that govern this axis difficult and far from parsimonious. It is becoming increasingly clear that the microbiota is integral to this axis. Disruption of the healthy flora, a phenomenon collectively referred to as dysbiosis, has been implicated as a driver for several diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, and neurological disorders such as depression, anxiety, and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Teasing apart these complex interactions as they pertain to PD is critical for our understanding of this debilitating disease, but more importantly, for the development of future treatments. So far, treatments have been unable to stop this neurodegenerative disease, succeeding only in briefly dampening symptoms and buying patients time before the inevitable loss of function ensues. Given that the 10-year prognosis for death or life-limiting disability with someone diagnosed with PD is upwards of 80%, there is a desperate need for curative treatments that go beyond symptom management. If PD does begin in the periphery with bidirectional communication between the microbiota and the immune system, as recent literature suggests, there is an exciting possibility that progression could be stopped before it reaches the brain. This systematic review assesses the current literature surrounding the role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of alpha-synucleinopathies and explores the hypothesis that alpha-synuclein folding is modulated by the microbiota. Furthermore, we discuss how changes in the gut environment can lead to pathology and outline the implications that advances in understanding the interactions between host and microbiota will have on future research and the development of potential biomarkers.</description>

	<description>Reproducibly generating human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based functional neuronal circuits, solely obtained from single individuals, poses particular challenges to achieve personalized and patient specific functional neuronal in vitro models. A hallmark of functional neuronal assemblies, synchronous neuronal activity, can be non-invasively studied by microelectrode array (MEA) technology, reliably capturing physiological and pathophysiological aspects of human brain function. In our here presented manuscript, we demonstrate a procedure to generate 3D neural aggregates comprising astrocytes, oligodendroglial cells and neurons obtained from the same human tissue sample. Moreover, we demonstrate the robust ability of those neurons to create a highly synchronously active neuronal network within 3 weeks in vitro, without additionally applied astrocytes. The fusion of MEA-technology with functional neuronal circuits solely obtained from one individuals cells represent isogenic person-specific human neuronal sensor chips that pave the way for specific personalized in vitro neuronal networks as well as neurological and neuropsychiatric disease modelling.</description>

	<description>Contralateral intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) can potentially improve swallowing disorders with unilateral lesion of the swallowing cortex. However, the after-effects of iTBS on brain excitability remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the alterations of temporal dynamics of inter-regional connectivity induced by iTBS following continuous TBS (cTBS) in the contralateral suprahyoid muscle cortex. A total of 20 right-handed healthy subjects underwent cTBS over the left suprahyoid muscle motor cortex and then immediately afterwards, iTBS was applied to the contralateral homologous area. All of the subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (Rs-fMRI) before and post-TBS implemented on a different day. We compared the static and dynamic functional connectivity (FC) between the post-TBS and the baseline. The whole-cortical time series and a sliding-window correlation approach were used to quantify the dynamic characteristics of FC. Compared with the baseline, for static FC measurement, increased FC was found in the precuneus (BA 19), left fusiform gyrus (BA 37), and right pre/post-central gyrus (BA 4/3), and decreased FC was observed in the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC) (BA 29) and left inferior parietal lobule (BA 39). However, in the dynamic FC analysis, post-TBS showed reduced FC in the left angular and PCC in the early windows, and in the following windows, increased FC in multiple cortical areas including bilateral pre- and postcentral gyri and paracentral lobule and non-sensorimotor areas including the prefrontal, temporal and occipital gyrus, and brain stem. Our results indicate that iTBS reverses the after-effects induced by cTBS on the contralateral suprahyoid muscle cortex. Dynamic FC analysis displayed a different pattern of alteration compared with the static FC approach in brain excitability induced by TBS. Our results provide novel evidence for us in understanding the topographical and temporal aftereffects linked to brain excitability induced by different TBS protocols and might be valuable information for their application in the rehabilitation of deglutition.</description>

	<description>We describe the steps involved in analysis of multi-modal, multi-subject human neuroimaging data using the SPM12 free and open source software (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) and a publically-available dataset organised according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000117/). The dataset contains electroencephalographic (EEG), magnetoencephalographic (MEG), and functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 16 subjects who undertook multiple runs of a simple task performed on a large number of famous, unfamiliar and scrambled faces. We demonstrate: 1) batching and scripting of preprocessing of multiple runs/subjects of combined MEG and EEG data, 2) creation of trial-averaged evoked responses, 3) source-reconstruction of the power (induced and evoked) across trials within a time-frequency window around the “N/M170” evoked component, using structural MRI for forward modelling and simultaneous inversion (fusion) of MEG and EEG data, 4) group-based optimisation of spatial priors during M/EEG source reconstruction using fMRI data on the same paradigm, and 5) statistical mapping across subjects of cortical source power increases for faces versus scrambled faces.</description>

	<description>Real-time visualization of large-scale neural dynamics in whole mammalian brains is hindered with existing neuroimaging methods having limited capacity when it comes to imaging large tissue volumes at high speeds. Optoacoustic imaging has been shown to be capable of real-time three-dimensional imaging of multiple cerebral hemodynamic parameters in rodents. However, optoacoustic imaging of calcium activity deep within the mammalian brain is hampered by strong blood absorption in the visible light spectrum as well as lack of activity labels excitable in the near-infrared window. We have developed and validated an isolated whole mouse brain preparation labelled with genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f, which can closely resemble in vivo conditions. An optoacoustic imaging system coupled to a superfusion system was further designed and used for rapid volumetric monitoring of stimulus-evoked calcium dynamics in the brain. Our new technique captures calcium fluxes as true three-dimensional information across the entire brain with temporal resolution of 10ms and spatial resolution of 150µm, thus enabling large-scale neural recording at penetration depths and spatio-temporal resolution scales not covered with any existing neuroimaging techniques.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Localization of Epileptogenic Zone Based on Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP): A Feature Extraction and Graph Theory Approach</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00031</guid>

	<description>Objective: Epilepsy is a chronic brain disease, which is prone to relapse and affects individuals of all ages worldwide, particularly the very young and elderly. Up to one-third of these patients are medically intractable and require resection surgery. However, the outcomes of epilepsy surgery rely upon the clear identification of epileptogenic zone (EZ). The combination of cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP) and electrocorticography (ECoG) provides an opportunity to observe the connectivity of human brain network and more comprehensive information that may help the clinicians localize the epileptogenic focus more precisely. However, there is no standard analysis method in the clinical application of CCEPs, especially for the quantitative analysis of abnormal connectivity of epileptic networks. The aim of this paper was to present an approach on the batch processing of CCEPs and provide information relating to the localization of EZ for clinical study.
Methods: Eight medically intractable epilepsy patients were included in this study. Each patient was implanted with subdural grid electrodes and electrical stimulations were applied directly to their cortex to induce CCEPs. After signal preprocessing, we constructed three effective brain networks at different spatial scales for each patient, regarding the amplitudes of CCEPs as the connection weights. Graph theory was then applied to analyze the brain network topology of epileptic patients, and the topological metrics of EZ and non-EZ (NEZ) were compared.
Results: The effective connectivity network reconstructed from CCEPs was asymmetric, and both the number and the amplitudes of effective CCEPs decreased with increasing distance between stimulating and recording sites. Besides, the distribution of CCEP responses were associated with the locations of EZ which tended to have higher degree centrality and shortest path length than NEZ.
Conclusions: Our results indicated that the brain networks of epileptics were asymmetric and mainly composed of short-distance connections. The degree centrality and shortest path length were highly consistent to the distribution of the EZ, and these topological parameters have great potential to be readily applied to the clinical localization of the epileptogenic zone.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Dilated Dense U-Net for Infant Hippocampus Subfield Segmentation</title>

	<description>Accurate and automatic segmentation of infant hippocampal subfields from magnetic resonance (MR) images is an important step for studying memory related infant neurological diseases. However, existing hippocampus subfield segmentation methods were generally designed based on adult subjects and would compromise performance when applied to infant subjects due to insufficient tissue contrast and fast changing structural patterns of early hippocampal development. In this paper, we propose a new fully convolutional network (FCN) for infant hippocampus subfield segmentation by embedding the dilated dense network in the U-net, namely DUnet. The embedded dilated dense network can generate multi-scale features while keeping high spatial resolution, which is useful in fusing the low-level features in the contracting path with the high-level features in the expanding path. To further improve the performance, we group every two convolutional layers with one residual connection in the DUnet, and obtain the Residual DUnet (ResDUnet). Experimental results show that the proposed DUnet and ResDUnet improve the average Dice coefficient by 2.1% and 2.5% for infant hippocampus subfield segmentation, respectively, when compared with the 3D U-net. The results also demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Responsible Data Governance of Neuroscience Big Data</title>

	<description>Current discussions of the ethical aspects of big data are shaped by concerns regarding the social consequences of both the widespread adoption of machine learning and the ways in which biases in data can be replicated and perpetuated. We instead focus here on the ethical issues arising from the use of big data in international neuroscience collaborations. Neuroscience innovation relies upon neuroinformatics, large-scale data collection and analysis enabled by novel and emergent technologies. Each step of this work involves aspects of ethics, ranging from concerns for adherence to informed consent or animal protection principles and issues of data re-use at the stage of data collection, to data protection and privacy during data processing and analysis, and issues of attribution and intellectual property at the data-sharing and publication stages. Significant dilemmas and challenges with far-reaching implications are also inherent, including reconciling the ethical imperative for openness and validation with data protection compliance, and considering future innovation trajectories or the potential for misuse of research results. Furthermore, these issues are subject to local interpretations within different ethical cultures applying diverse legal systems emphasising different aspects. Neuroscience big data require a concerted approach to research across boundaries, wherein ethical aspects are integrated within a transparent, dialogical data governance process. We address this by developing the concept of ‘responsible data governance’, applying the principles of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) to the challenges presented by governance of neuroscience big data in the Human Brain Project (HBP).</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Functional Connectivity Changes Across the Spectrum of Subjective Cognitive Decline, Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00026</guid>

	<description>The abnormality occurs at molecular, cellular as well as network levels in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prior to diagnosis. Most previous connectivity studies were conducted at 1 out of 3 (local, meso and global) scales in subjects covering only part of the entire AD spectrum (subjective cognitive decline, SCD; amnestic mild cognitive impairment, aMCI; and then fully manifest AD). Data interpretation within the framework of disease progression is thus difficult. The current study included 3 age- and sex-matched cohorts: SCD (n=32), aMCI (n=37) and fully-established AD (n=30). A group of healthy elderly subjects (n=40) was included as normal control (NC). Network connectivity was examined at the local (degree centrality), meso (subgraph centrality), and global (eigenvector and page-rank centralities) levels. In compared to NC, SCD subjects had isolated decrease of subgraph centrality in primary (somatomotor and visual) networks. aMCI subjects had decreased centralities at all 3 scales in associative (frontoparietal control, dorsal attention, limbic and default) networks. AD subjects had increased centrality at the global scale in all 7 networks. There was a positive association between MoCA scores and DC in the frontoparietal control network in SCD, a negative relationship between MMSE scores and EC in the somatomotor network in AD. These findings suggest that the primary network is impaired as early as in SCD. Impairment in the associative network also starts at the local level at this stage and may contribute to the cognitive decline. As associative network impairment extends from local to meso and global scales in aMCI, compensatory mechanisms in the primary network are activated.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Influence of Combined Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Motor Training on Corticospinal Excitability in Children With Unilateral Cerebral Palsy</title>

	<description>Combined non-invasive brain stimulation and rehabilitation interventions have the potential to improve function in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP), however their effects on developing brain function are not well understood. In a proof-of-principle study, we used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to measure changes in corticospinal excitability and relationships to motor performance following a randomized controlled trial consisting of 10 days of combined constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to the contralesional motor cortex. Twenty children and young adults (mean age = 12 years, 9 month, range = 7 years 7 months, 21 year, 7 months) with UCP participated. TMS testing was performed before, after, and six months after the intervention to measure motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and cortical silent period (CSP) duration. The association between neurophysiologic and motor outcomes, and differences in excitability between hemispheres were examined. Contralesional MEP amplitude decreased as hypothesized in 5 of 5 participants receiving active tDCS immediately after and 6 months after the intervention, however no statistically significant differences between intervention groups were noted for MEP amplitude (mean difference = -323.9 µV, 95% CI = [-989, 341], p = 0.34) or CSP duration (mean difference = 3.9 ms, 95% CI = [-7.7, 15.5], p = 0.51). Changes in corticospinal excitability were not statistically associated with improvements in hand function after the intervention. Across all participants, MEP amplitudes measured in the more-affected hand from both contralesional (mean difference = -474.5 µV) and ipsilesional hemispheres (-624.5 µV) were smaller compared to the less-affected hand. Assessing neurophysiologic changes after tDCS in children with UCP provides an understanding of long-term effects on brain excitability to help determine its potential as a therapeutic intervention. Additional investigation into the neurophysiologic effects of tDCS in larger samples of children with UCP are needed to confirm these findings.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Induces High Gamma-Band Activity in the Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex During a Working Memory Task: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Crossover Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00136</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00136</link>
	<description>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to have mixed effects on working memory (WM) capacity in healthy individuals. Different stimulation paradigms may account for these discrepancies, with certain features being favored. To determine the effect in the context of anodal tDCS, we investigated whether anodal tDCS induced cortical oscillatory changes during a WM task. Specifically, we tested whether anodal offline tDCS over the left prefrontal cortex enhances WM capacity by modulating the oscillatory activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using magnetoencephalography (MEG). This study employed a double-blind, randomized, crossover design, in which 24 healthy right-handed participants conducted MEG recordings during a 3-back task after administration of 2 mA tDCS or sham stimulation as a placebo. Our results showed that the effect of tDCS did not appear in the behavioral indices – WM accuracy (d´) or reaction time. From the results of the time-frequency analysis, significant event-related synchronization (ERS) in the high-gamma band (82 - 84 Hz) of the left DLPFC was found under the tDCS condition; however, ERS was not correlated with WM capacity. Furthermore, we calculated the modulation index (MI), which indicates the strength of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). tDCS significantly decreased MI of the left DLPFC, representing the theta-gamma PAC during the n-back task using color names as verbal stimuli. Our results suggest that although tDCS increased the gamma-band oscillation indicating greater neural activity in the left DLPFC, it did not lead to an improvement of WM capacity; this may be due to the inability of gamma-band oscillation to couple with the task-induced theta wave. WM capacity might not increase unless theta-gamma PAC is not enhanced by tDCS.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Associating Vehicles Automation With Drivers Functional State Assessment Systems: A Challenge for Road Safety in the Future</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00131</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00131</link>
	<description>In the near future, vehicles will gradually gain more autonomous functionalities. Drivers’ activity will be less about driving than about monitoring intelligent systems to which driving action will be delegated. Road safety, therefore, remains dependent on the human factor and we should identify the limits beyond which driver’s functional state (DFS) may no longer be able to ensure safety. Depending on the level of automation, estimating the DFS may have different targets, e.g. assessing driver’s situation awareness in lower levels of automation and his ability to respond to emerging hazard or assessing driver’s ability to monitor the vehicle performing operational tasks in higher levels of automation. Unfitted DFS (e.g., drowsiness) may impact the driver ability respond to taking over abilities. This paper reviews the most appropriate psychophysiological indices in naturalistic driving while considering the DFS through exogenous sensors, providing the more efficient trade-off between reliability and intrusiveness. The DFS also originates from kinematic data of the vehicle, thus providing information that indirectly relates to drivers behaviour. The whole data should be synchronously processed, providing a diagnosis on the DFS, and bringing it to the attention of the decision maker in real time. Next, making the information available can be permanent or intermittent (or even undelivered), and may also depend on the automation level. Such interface can include recommendations for decision support or simply give neutral instruction. Mapping of relevant psychophysiological and behavioural indicators for DFS will enable practitioners and researchers provide reliable estimates, fitted to the level of automation.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Tracing of Afferent Connections in the Zebrafish Cerebellum Using Recombinant Rabies Virus</title>

	<description>The cerebellum is involved in some forms of motor coordination and learning, and in cognitive and emotional functions. To elucidate the functions of the cerebellum, it is important to unravel the detailed connections of the cerebellar neurons. Although the cerebellar neural circuit structure is generally conserved among vertebrates, it is not clear whether the cerebellum receives and processes the same or similar information in different vertebrate species. Here, we performed monosynaptic retrograde tracing with recombinant rabies viruses to identify the afferent connections of the zebrafish cerebellar neurons. We used a G-deleted rabies virus that expressed GFP. The virus was also pseudotyped with EnvA, an envelope protein of avian sarcoma and leucosis virus (ALSV-A). For the specific infection of cerebellar neurons, we expressed the rabies virus glycoprotein (G) gene and the envelope protein TVA, which is the receptor for EnvA, in Purkinje cells (PCs) or granule cells (GCs), using the promoter for aldolase Ca (aldoca) or cerebellin 12 (cbln12), respectively. When the virus infected PCs in the aldoca line, GFP was detected in the PCs’ presynaptic neurons, including granule cells (GCs) and neurons in the inferior olivary nuclei (IOs), which send climbing fibers (CFs). These observations validated the rabies virus tracing method in zebrafish. When the virus infected GCs in the cbln12 line, GFP was again detected in their presynaptic neurons, including neurons in the pretectum nuclei, the nucleus lateralis valvulae (NLV), the central gray (CG), the medial octavolateralis nucleus (MON), and the descending octaval nucleus (DON). GFP was not observed in these neurons when the virus infected PCs in the aldoca line. These precerebellar neurons generally agree with those reported for other teleost species and are at least partly conserved with those in mammals. Our results demonstrate that the rabies virus system can be used for connectome analyses in zebrafish, and provide fundamental information about the cerebellar neural circuits, which will be valuable for elucidating the functions of cerebellar neural circuits in zebrafish.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Hierarchical and Nonlinear Dynamics in Prefrontal Cortex Regulate the Precision of Perceptual Beliefs</title>

	<description>Actions are shaped not only by the content of our percepts but also by our confidence in them. To study the cortical representation of perceptual precision in decision making, we acquired functional imaging data whilst participants performed two vibrotactile forced-choice discrimination tasks: a fast-slow judgement, and a same-different judgement. The first task requires a comparison of the perceived vibrotactile frequencies to decide which one is faster. However, the second task requires that the estimated difference between those frequencies is weighed against the precision of each percept – if both stimuli are very precisely perceived, then any slight difference is more likely to be identified than if the percepts are uncertain. We additionally presented either pure sinusoidal or temporally degraded “noisy” stimuli, whose frequency/period differed slightly from cycle to cycle. In this way, we were able to manipulate the perceptual precision. We report a constellation of cortical regions in rostral prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and superior frontal gyrus associated with the perception of stimulus difference, the presence of stimulus noise and the interaction between these factors. Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of these data suggested a nonlinear, hierarchical model, whereby activity in the rostral prefrontal cortex (evoked by the presence of stimulus noise) mutually interacts with activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (evoked by stimulus differences). This model of effective connectivity outperformed competing models with serial and parallel interactions, hence providing a unique insight into the hierarchical architecture underlying the representation and appraisal of perceptual belief and precision in the prefrontal cortex.</description>

	<description>The neocortex is capable of anticipating the sensory results of movement but the neural mechanisms are poorly understood. In the entorhinal cortex, grid cells represent the location of an animal in its environment, and this location is updated through movement and path integration. In this paper, we propose that sensory neocortex incorporates movement using grid cell-like neurons that represent the location of sensors on an object. We describe a two-layer neural network model that uses cortical grid cells and path integration to robustly learn and recognize objects through movement and predict sensory stimuli after movement. A layer of cells consisting of several grid cell-like modules represents a location in the reference frame of a specific object. Another layer of cells which processes sensory input receives this location input as context and uses it to encode the sensory input in the object’s reference frame. Sensory input causes the network to invoke previously learned locations that are consistent with the input, and motor input causes the network to update those locations. Simulations show that the model can learn hundreds of objects even when object features alone are insufficient for disambiguation. We discuss the relationship of the model to cortical circuitry and suggest that the reciprocal connections between layers 4 and 6 fit the requirements of the model. We propose that the subgranular layers of cortical columns employ grid cell-like mechanisms to represent object specific locations that are updated through movement.</description>

	<description>Obstructive hydrocephalus is a brain disorder in which circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is altered in a manner that causes expansion of fluid-filled intracranial compartments particularly the ventricles. The pyramidal neurons of the sensorimotor cortex are excitatory in nature and their dendritic spines are target of excitatory synapses. This study evaluated the effect of hydrocephalus on dendritic arborization and synaptic structure of the pyramidal neurons of the sensorymotor cortex of neonatal hydrocephalic mice.. Sterile kaolin suspension (0.01ml of 250mg/mL) was injected intracisternally into day old mice. Control animals mice received sham injections. Pups were weighed and sacrificed on postnatal days (PND) 7, 14, 21. Fixed brain tissue blocks were silver impregnated using a modified golgi staining technique and immunolabelled with synaptophysin to determine dendritic morphology and synaptic integrity respectively Data were analysed using ANOVA at α0.05. Golgi staining revealed diminished arborization of the basal dendrites and loss of dendritic spinesin the pyramidal neurons of hydrocephalic mice. There was significant reduction in the percentage immunoreactivity of anti-synaptophysin in hydrocephalic mice at PND 7 (14.26±1.91%), PND 14 (4.19±1.57%) and PND 21 (17.55±2.76%) compared to age-matched controls (62.57±9.40%, 93.01±1.66% and 99.11±0.63% respectively). These alterations may  may impair neuronal connections that are essential for the development of cortical circuits and may contribute to deficits observed in neonatal hydrocephalus.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Mindfulness-Based Intervention for People With Dementia and Their Partners: Results of a Mixed-Methods Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00092</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00092</link>
	<description>Objectives. Studies have shown preliminary support for mindfulness-based interventions benefitting people with dementia and their caregivers. However, most studies focus on these two groups separately. This study examined whether it would be possible and beneficial for people with dementia and their caregiver to jointly undergo an adjusted Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training, named TANDEM.  
Method. The 8-week MBSR training was adjusted based on a literature review and interviews with experts (clinicians and mindfulness trainers). Seven couples (a person with early-stage dementia and their caregiver) participated together in the 8-week TANDEM program. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted after completion. Questionnaires (administered before and after the intervention) assessed the primary outcomes of quality of life and psychological distress (stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms). Secondary outcomes were mindfulness, self-compassion, positive mental health, worrying, and perceived burden (for caregivers).
Results. All participants completed the program and reported beneficial effects (relaxation, awareness, acceptance, and resilience). Most managed to integrate exercises into their daily lives and planned to continue their practice. Participating in a group was considered valuable and supportive. Furthermore, it was appreciated that participants could follow the training together (as a couple). The quantitative results showed a small effect on increased quality of life for caregivers. No substantial decrease in psychological distress was apparent. Caregivers displayed a large increase in mindfulness. 
Conclusions. The results of this mixed-methods study suggest that an adjusted mindfulness program is feasible and well-received among couples of persons with early-stage dementia and their caregiver, warranting further research in this area.</description>

	<description>Background: Urine samples are ideal for exploration of non-invasive biomarkers to confirm amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) status of patients versus unimpaired ones.
Objective: We aimed to detect differentially metabolized amino acids from urine of aMCI patients, which may give clinicians the possibility to intervene with early treatments that curb Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).
Methods: The study included 208 subjects, 98 of them were aMCI patients, and 110 were control subjects without dementia. Urine samples were taken from each participant and supernatant was obtained for analysis. The concentrations of amino acids were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Results: Urine arginine levels and its metabolites, ornithine in aMCI patients are obviously lower than in normal controls (q&amp;lt;0.2 and p＜0.05). Meanwhile, aMCI patients had significant reduced urine global arginine bioavailability ratio (GABR), and GABR in urine displayed a positive correlation with the score of MMSE.
Conclusion: Urine dysregulated arginine metabolism that may serve as a helpful clinical diagnostic biomarker for aMCI in older adults.</description>

	<description>Cells translate extracellular signals to regulate processes such as differentiation, metabolism and proliferation, via transmembranar receptors. G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) belong to the largest family of transmembrane receptors, with over 800 members in the human species. Given the variety of key physiological functions regulated by GPCRs, these are main targets of existing drugs. During normal aging, alterations in the expression and activity of GPCRs have been observed. The central nervous system (CNS) is particularly affected by these alterations, which results in decreased brain functions, neuroregeneration, and increased vulnerability to neuropathologies, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson diseases. GPCRs signal via heterotrimeric G proteins, as Go, the most abundant heterotrimeric G protein in CNS. We here review age-induced effects of GPCRs signaling via the Gi/o subfamily at the CNS. During the aging process, a reduction in protein density is observed for almost half of the Gi/o-coupled GPCRs, particularly in age-vulnerable regions such as the frontal cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra and striatum. Gi/o levels also tend to decrease with aging, particularly in regions such as the frontal cortex. Alterations in the expression and activity of GPCRs and coupled G proteins result from altered proteostasis, peroxidation of membranar lipids and age-associated neuronal degeneration and death, and have impact on aging hallmarks and age-related neuropathologies. Further, due to oligomerization of GPCRs at the membrane and their cooperative signaling, down-regulation of a specific Gi/o-coupled GPCR may affect signaling and drug targeting of other types/subtypes of GPCRs with which it dimerizes. Gi/o-coupled GPCRs receptorsomes are thus the focus of more effective therapeutic drugs aiming to prevent or revert the decline in brain functions and increased risk of neuropathologies at advanced ages.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Insulin Signaling Impairment in the Brain as a Risk Factor in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The underlying mechanism that links up the two conditions seems to be the de-sensitisation of insulin signalling. In patients with AD, insulin signalling was found to be de-sensitised in the brain, even if they did not have diabetes. Insulin is an important growth factor that regulates cell growth, energy utilisation, mitochondrial function and replacement, autophagy, oxidative stress management, synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. Insulin desensitisation therefore can enhance the risk of developing neurological disorders in later life. Other risk factors such as high blood pressure or brain injury also enhance the likelihood of developing AD. All of those risk factors have one thing in common – they induce a chronic inflammation response in the brain. Pro-inflammatory cytokines block growth factor signalling and enhance oxidative stress. The underlying molecular processes for this are described in the review. Treatments to re-sensitise insulin signalling in the brain are also described, such as nasal insulin tests in AD patients, or treatments with re-sensitising hormones such as leptin, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). First clinical trials show promising results and are a proof of concept that utilising such treatments is valid.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Age-Related Whole-Brain Structural Changes in Relation to Cardiovascular Risks Across the Adult Age Spectrum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00085</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00085</link>
	<description>Background: The brain atrophy and lesion index (BALI) has been developed to assess whole-brain structural deficits that are commonly seen on MRI in aging. It is unclear whether such changes can be detected at younger ages and how they might relate to other exposures. Here, we investigate how BALI scores, and the subcategories that make the total score, compare across adulthood and whether they are related to the level of cardiovascular risks, in both young and old adulthood.
Methods: Data were from 229 subjects (72% men; 24-80 years of age) whose annual health evaluation included a routine anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. A brain atrophy and lesion index (BALI) score was generated for each subject from T2-weighted MRI. Differences in the BALI total score and categorical subscores were examined by age and by the level of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF). Regression analysis was used to evaluate relationships between continuous variables. Relative risk ratios (RRR) of CVRF on BALI were examined using a multinomial logistic regression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to estimate the classification accuracy.
Results: Nearly 90% of the participants had at least one CVRF. Mean CVRF scores increased with age (slope=0.03; r=0.36, 95% confidence intervals: 0.23-0.48; p&amp;lt;0.001). The BALI total score was closely related to age (slope=0.18; r=0.69, 95% confidence intervals: 0.59-0.78; p&amp;lt;0.001), as so were the categorical subscores (r’s= 0.41-0.61, p&amp;lt;0.001); each differed by the number of CVRF (t-test: 4.16-14.83, Chi2: 6.9-43.9, p’s&amp;lt;0.050). Multivariate analyses adjusted for age and sex suggested an independent impact of age and the CVRF on the BALI score (for each year of advanced age, RRR=1.20, 95% CI= 1.11-1.29; for each additional CVRF, RRR=3.63, 95% CI=2.12-6.23). The CVRF and BALI association remained significant even in younger adults.
Conclusion: The accumulation of MRI-detectable structural brain deficits can be evident from young adulthood. Age and the number of CVFR are independently associated with BALI score. Further research is needed to understand the extent to which other age-related health deficits can increase the risk of abnormalities in brain structure and function, and how these, with BALI scores relate to cognition.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Flow diverters are new generation stents that have recently garnered a large amount of interest for use in treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Flow diverters reduce blood flow into the aneurysm, with redirection along the path of the parent vessel. Flow stagnation into the aneurysm and neck coverage with subsequent endothelialization are the important synergistic mechanisms by which the therapy acts. Several studies have examined the mechanisms by which flow diverters subsequently lead to aneurysm occlusion. This review aims to provide a general overview of the flow diverters and their mechanism of action and potential implications. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A deficit in myelination, resulting from the deletion of a Williams syndrome-associated gene in forebrain excitatory neurons, causes hypersociability by impairing action potential conduction. Accordingly, rescuing myelination or conduction normalizes this behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/NfAgEiA6Pzo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Between Perfectly Critical and Fully Irregular: A Reverberating Model Captures and Predicts Cortical Spike Propagation</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Knowledge about the collective dynamics of cortical spiking is very informative about the underlying coding principles. However, even most basic properties are not known with certainty, because their assessment is hampered by spatial subsampling, i.e., the limitation that only a tiny fraction of all neurons can be recorded simultaneously with millisecond precision. Building on a novel, subsampling-invariant estimator, we fit and carefully validate a minimal model for cortical spike propagation. The model interpolates between two prominent states: asynchronous and critical. We find neither of them in cortical spike recordings across various species, but instead identify a narrow “reverberating” regime. This approach enables us to predict yet unknown properties from very short recordings and for every circuit individually, including responses to minimal perturbations, intrinsic network timescales, and the strength of external input compared to recurrent activation “thereby informing about the underlying coding principles for each circuit, area, state and task.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

However, the relationship between epigenetic regulation and neuropathology is largely correlational due to the presence of mixed cell populations within brain regions and the genome-wide effects of classical approaches to manipulate the epigenome. Locus-specific epigenetic editing allows direct epigenetic regulation of specific genes to elucidate the direct causal relationship between epigenetic modifications and transcription. This review discusses some of the latest innovations in the efficacy and flexibility in this approach that hold promise for neurobiological application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

During neuronal differentiation, spatially and temporally regulated transcription allows neuronal migration, the growth of dendrites and axons, and at later stages, synaptic formation and the establishment of neuronal circuitry. Genome topology and relocation of gene loci within the nucleus are now regarded as key factors that contribute to transcriptional regulation. Here, we review recent work supporting the hypothesis that the dynamic organization of chromatin within the nucleus impacts gene activation in response to extrinsic signalling and during neuronal differentiation. The consequences of disruption of the genome architecture on neuronal health will be also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Inhibition of the Interaction Between Group I Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors and PDZ-Domain Proteins Prevents Hippocampal Long-Term Depression, but Not Long-Term Potentiation</title>

	<description>The group I metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor subtypes, mGlu1 and mGlu5, strongly regulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Both harbour PDZ (PSD-95/discs-large/ ZO-1) motifs at their extreme carboxyl terminals, which allow interaction with the PDZ domain of Tamalin, regulate the cell surface expression of group I mGlu receptors, and may modulate their coupling to signalling proteins. We investigated the functional role of this interaction in hippocampal long-term depression (LTD). Acute intracerebral treatment of adult rats with a cell permeable PDZ-blocking peptide (pep-mGluR-STL), designed to competitively inhibit the interaction between Tamalin and group 1 mGlu receptors, prevented expression of LTD in the hippocampal CA1 region without affecting long-term potentiation or basal synaptic transmission. Pep-mGluR-STL prevented facilitation by the group I mGlu receptor agonist, DHPG, and the mGlu5 agonist, CHPG, of short-term depression into LTD, suggesting that Tamalin preferentially acts by mediating signalling through mGlu5. These data support that Tamalin is essential for the persistent expression of LTD and that Tamalin subserves the effective signalling of group 1 mGlu receptors.</description>

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been proposed to treat various pain syndromes related to central sensitization phenomenon, but was never applied in the context of knee osteoarthritis.
Methods: A 71-year-old woman presenting clinical evidence of central sensitization of pain associated with left knee osteoarthritis underwent monthly sessions of rTMS delivered at 10 Hz over the right motor cortex. 
Results: From the week following the 3rd session, she began to improve on various clinical aspects, including pain. After 10 sessions (i.e. almost one year of follow-up), pain was reduced by 67%, especially regarding neuropathic components, while sleep disorders and fatigue also improved by 57-67%. The Central Sensitization Inventory score was reduced by 70%
Conclusion: This observation suggests that high-frequency motor cortex rTMS could be a therapeutic option to treat neuropathic pain and psychological symptoms associated with central sensitization developing in the context of chronic osteoarthritis of the knee joint.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Implantable Direct Current Neural Modulation: Theory, Feasibility, and Efficacy</title>

	<description>Implantable neuroprostheses such as cochlear implants, deep brain stimulators, spinal cord stimulators, and retinal implants use charge-balanced alternating current (AC) pulses to recover delivered charge and thus mitigate toxicity from electrochemical reactions occurring at the metal-tissue interface. At low pulse rates, these short duration pulses have the effect of evoking spikes in neural tissue in a phase-locked fashion.  When the therapeutic goal is to suppress neural activity, implants typically work indirectly by delivering excitation to populations of neurons that then inhibit the target neurons, or by delivering very high pulse rates that suffer from a number of undesirable side effects.  
Direct current (DC) neural modulation is an alternative methodology that can directly modulate extracellular membrane potential.  This neuromodulation paradigm can excite or inhibit neurons in a graded fashion while maintaining their stochastic firing patterns. DC can also sensitize or desensitize neurons to input.  When applied to a population of neurons, DC can modulate synaptic connectivity.
Because DC delivered to metal electrodes inherently violates safe charge injection criteria, its use has not been explored for practical applicability of DC-based neural implants.  Recently, several new technologies and strategies have been proposed that address this safety criteria and deliver ionic-based direct current (iDC).  This, along with the increased understanding of the mechanisms behind the transcutaneous DC-based modulation of neural targets, has caused a resurgence of interest in the interaction between iDC and neural tissue both in the central and the peripheral nervous system.
In this review we assess the feasibility of in-vivo iDC delivery as a form of neural modulation. We present the current understanding of DC/neural interaction. We explore the different design methodologies and technologies that attempt to safely deliver iDC to neural tissue and assess the scope of application for direct current modulation as a form of neuroprosthetic treatment in disease.  Finally, we examine the safety implications of long duration iDC delivery.  
We conclude that DC-based neural implants are a promising new modulation technology that could benefit from further chronic safety assessments and a better understanding of the basic biological and biophysical mechanisms that underpin DC-mediated neural modulation.</description>

	<description>The amygdala is a structure involved in emotions, fear, learning and memory and is highly interconnected with other brain regions, for example the motor cortex and the basal ganglia that are often targets of treatments involving electrical stimulation. Deep brain stimulation of the basal ganglia is successfully used to treat movement disorders, but can carry along non-motor side effects. The origin of these non-motor side effects is not fully understood yet, but might be altered oscillatory communication between specific motor areas and the amygdala. Oscillations in various frequency bands have been detected in the amygdala during cognitive and emotional tasks, which can couple with oscillations in cortical regions or the hippocampus. However, data on oscillatory coupling between the amygdala and motor areas are still lacking. This review provides a summary of oscillation frequencies measured in the amygdala and their possible functional relevance in different species, followed by evidence for connectivity between the amygdala and motor areas, such as the basal ganglia and the motor cortex. We hypothesize that the amygdala could communicate with motor areas through coherence of low frequency bands in the theta-alpha range. Furthermore, we discuss a potential role of the amygdala in therapeutic approaches based on electrical stimulation.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: DeepBouton: Automated Identification of Single-Neuron Axonal Boutons at the Brain-Wide Scale</title>

	<description>Fine morphological reconstructions of individual neurons across the entire brain are needed for mapping the brain circuits. Inference of presynaptic axonal boutons, as a key part of single-neuron fine reconstructions, is critical for interpreting the patterns of neural circuit wiring schemes. However, automated bouton identification remains challenging for current neuron reconstruction tools, as they are being focused mainly on neurite skeleton drawing and have difficulties to accurately quantify bouton morphology. Here, we developed an automatic method for recognizing single-neuron axonal boutons in whole-brain fluorescence microscopy datasets. The method is based on deep convolutional neural networks and density-peak clustering. High-dimensional feature representations of bouton morphology can be learned adaptively through the convolutional networks and used for the bouton recognition and bouton subtype classification. We demonstrated that the approach is effective in detecting single-neuron boutons at the brain-wide scale for both long-range projection pyramidal neurons and local interneurons.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neurophysiological Analysis of Intermanual Transfer in Motor Learning</title>

	<description>The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of motor training on motor imagery, by comparing motor performance and motor cortex excitability changes with and without intermanual transfer of motor learning. Intermanual transfer was investigated in terms of excitability changes in the motor cortex and motor performance from right hand training to left hand performance. Participants were assigned to a transfer training group and a control group. We recorded motor evoked potentials induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation, applied to the left extensor carpi radialis both with and without intermanual transfer. The results showed that after learning by the right hand, motor evoked potentials decreased during left hand motor imagery. Motor evoked potentials during motor imagery were significantly decreased by unilateral training in the transfer training group. Since intermanual transfer plays an important role in stabilizing performance by the contralateral side, this result suggests that unilateral training decreases motor evoked potentials during motor imagery on the contralateral side. In the control group, without right hand training, motor evoked potentials significantly increased after left hand training during motor imagery. In the trained side, we found increased excitability in the agonist muscle area of the primary motor cortex. However, in the untrained side, excitability decreased in the homonymous muscle area of the primary motor cortex. This constitutes an increase in inhibitory effects and suggests that excitability changes in the respective neural circuit contribute to skilled performance by the ipsilateral and contralateral sides in the same motor task.</description>

	<description>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique which provides unique potential to directly improve human capability on a temporary, at needs, basis. The purpose of this paper is to consider the utility of tDCS through analysis of the potential risks and benefits in the context of defence service personnel. First, we look at the potential benefits to Defence, focusing primarily on warfighter survivability and enriching cognition quality in support of command and control. Second, we look at the potential detriments to tDCS military use, focusing on adverse effects, safety considerations, and risk. Third, we examine how the level of risk can be mitigated through military doctrine development focusing on safety parameters and exclusion criteria. Finally, we explore the future prospects of military tDCS use, particularly in terms of addressing gaps in the literature so that tDCS can be used ethically and efficaciously at the level of individual personnel.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Aberrant Coupling Between Resting-State Cerebral Blood Flow and Functional Connectivity in Wilson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00025</guid>

	<description>Both abnormities of resting-state cerebral blood flow (CBF) and functional connectivity in Wilson’s disease (WD) have been identified by several studies. Whether the coupling of CBF and functional connectivity is imbalanced in WD remains largely unknown. To assess this possibility, 27 patients with WD and 27 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were recruited to acquire functional MRI and arterial spin labeling imaging data. Functional connectivity strength (FCS) and CBF were calculated based on standard gray mask. Compared to healthy controls, the CBF-FCS correlations of patients with WD were significantly decreased in basal ganglia and cerebellum, and slightly increased in prefrontal cortex and thalamus. In contrast, decreased CBF of patients with WD occurred predominately in subcortical, and cognitive- and emotional-related brain regions, including basal ganglia, thalamus, insular, and inferior prefrontal cortex, whereas increased CBF occurred primarily in the temporal cortex. The FCS decrease of WD patients was predominately in basal ganglia and thalamus, and the increase was primarily in prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that aberrant neurovascular coupling in the brain may be a possible neuropathological mechanism underlying WD.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Modeling Group-Level Repeated Measurements of Neuroimaging Data Using the Univariate General Linear Model</title>

	<description>Group-level repeated measurements are common in neuroimaging, yet their analysis remains complex. Although a variety of specialised tools now exist, it is surprising that to-date there has been no clear discussion of how repeated-measurements can be analysed appropriately using the standard general linear model approach, as implemented in software such as SPM and FSL. This is particularly surprising given that these implementations necessitate the use of multiple models, even for seemingly conventional analyses, and that without care it is very easy to specify contrasts that do not correctly test the effects of interest. Despite this, interest in fitting these types of models using conventional tools has been growing in the neuroimaging community. As such it has become even more important to elucidate the correct means of doing so. To begin, this paper will discuss the key concept of the expected mean squares (EMS) for defining suitable F-ratios for testing hypotheses. Once this is understood, the logic of specifying correct repeated measurements models in the GLM should be clear. The ancillary issue of specifying suitable contrast weights in these designs will also be discussed, providing a complimentary perspective on the EMS. A set of steps will then be given alongside an example of specifying a 3-way repeated-measures ANOVA in SPM. Equivalency of the results compared to other statistical software will be demonstrated. Additional issues, such as the inclusion of continuous covariates and the assumption of sphericity, will also be discussed. The hope is that this paper will provide some clarity on this confusing topic, giving researchers the confidence to correctly specify these forms of models within traditional neuroimaging analysis tools.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: A Python Code for Simulating Single Tactile Receptors and the Spiking Responses of Their Afferents</title>

	<description>This work presents a pieces of Python code to rapidly simulate the spiking responses of large numbers of single cutaneous tactile afferents with millisecond precision. To simulate the spike responses of all the major types of cutaneous tactile afferents, we proposed an electromechanical circuit model, in which a two-channel filter was developed to characterize the mechanical selectivity of tactile receptors, and a spike synthesizer was designed to recreate the action potentials evoked in afferents. The parameters of this model were fitted using previous neurophysiological datasets. Several simulation examples were presented in this paper to reproduce action potentials, sensory adaptation, frequency characteristics and spiking timing for each afferent type. The results indicated that the simulated responses matched previous neurophysiological recordings well. The model allows for a real-time reproduction of the spiking responses of about 4000 tactile units with a timing precision of less than 6 ms. The current work provides a valuable guidance to designing highly realistic tactile interfaces such as neuroprosthesis and haptic devices.</description>

	<description>This study examines whether a decrease in brain development is observable after players have reduced their video gaming time over a period of one year. Both video gaming experts and non-experts were recruited, whose resting-state fMRI data were collected at the beginning and the end of the study. Immediately after the first scan, the participants were instructed to spend no smore than three hours on video gaming weekly for one year. The results showed decreased self-reported video gaming skills and decreased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation in the experts at the end of the study, demonstrating that a reduction in video gaming time over a period of one year produced a decrease in brain development. The non-experts served as a control group and had no significant changes. The findings support the adaptive effect of video gaming experience on brain and cognitive development.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Morphological and Whole-Word Semantic Processing Are Distinct: Event Related Potentials Evidence From Spoken Word Recognition in Chinese</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00133</guid>

	<description>Behavioral and imaging studies in alphabetic languages have shown that morphological processing is a discrete and independent element of lexical access. However, there is no explicit marking of morphological structure in Chinese complex words, such that the extent to which morpheme meaning is related to word meaning is unknown. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were used in the present study to investigate the dissociation of morphemic and whole-word meaning in an auditory-auditory primed lexical decision task. All the priming and target words are compounds consisting of two Chinese morphemes. The relationship between morpheme and whole-word meaning was manipulated while controlling the phonology and orthography of the first syllable in each prime-target pair. A clear dissociation was found between morphemic and whole-word meaning on N400 amplitude and topography. Specifically, sharing a morpheme produced a larger N400 in the anterior-central electrode sites, while sharing whole-word meaning produced a smaller N400 in central-posterior electrode sites. In addition, the morphological N400 effect was negatively correlated with the participants’ reading ability, with better readers needing less orthographic information to distinguish different morphemes in compound words. These findings indicate that morphological and whole-word meaning are dissociated in spoken Chinese compound word recognition, and that even in the spoken language modality, good readers are better able to access the meaning of individual morphemes in Chinese compound word processing.</description>

	<description>Long-range neuronal circuits play an important role in motor and sensory information processing. Determining direct synaptic inputs of excited and inhibited neurons is important for understanding circuit mechanisms involved in regulating movement. Here, we used monosynaptic rabies tracing technique combined with fluorescent micro-optical sectional tomography to characterize the brain-wide input to motor cortex. The whole brain dataset showed that main excited and inhibited neurons in the motor cortex receive inputs from similar brain regions with quantitative difference. With 3D reconstruction, we found that the distribution of input neurons that target the primary and secondary motor cortex had different patterns. In cortex, the neurons projecting to primary motor cortex mainly distributed in the lateral and anterior portion, while those to secondary motor cortex distributed in the medial and posterior portion. The input neurons in subcortical areas also showed the topographic shift model, as in thalamus the neurons distributed as outer and inner shells and the neurons in claustrum and amygdala were in ventral and dorsal part respectively. These results lay the anatomical foundation for understanding the organized pattern of motor circuits and the functional differences between primary and secondary motor cortex.</description>

	<description>In a recent study, Masuda and colleagues (Nature 2019;566:388–392) used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile microglia across different anatomical compartments, developmental stages, and types of brain pathology in mice. Moreover, the authors performed a novel transcriptomic characterization of microglia from multiple sclerosis patients and identified phenotypically conserved microglial subsets between species. These findings, together with seminal prior results from various groups, provide valuable insights into the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of microglia during brain development and disease.</description>
