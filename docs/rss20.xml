	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Orally Administered Cinnamon Extract Attenuates Cognitive and Neuronal Deficits Following Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The present paper shows how cinnamon extract (CE) consumption mitigates neuronal loss and memory impairment following traumatic brain injury (TBI), one of the world’s most common neurodegenerative diseases. TBI patients suffer short- and long-term behavioral, cognitive, and emotional impairments, including difficulties in concentration, memory loss, and depression. Research shows that CE  application can mitigate cognitive and behavioral impairments in animal models for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, whose pathophysiology is similar to that of TBI. This study builds on prior research by showing similar results in TBI mice models. After drinking CE for a week, mice were injured using our 70-g weight drop TBI device. For 2 weeks thereafter, the mice continued drinking CE alongside standard lab nutrition. Subsequently, the mice underwent behavioral tests to assess their memory, motor activity, and anxiety. The mice brains were harvested for immunohistochemistry staining to evaluate overall neuronal survival. Our results show that CE consumption almost completely mitigates memory impairment and decreases neuronal loss after TBI. Mice that did not consume CE demonstrated impaired memory. Our results also show that CE consumption attenuated neuronal loss in the temporal cortex and the dentate gyrus. Mice that did not consume CE suffered a significant neuronal loss. There were no significant differences in anxiety levels and motor activity between all groups. These findings show a new therapeutic approach to improve cognitive function and decrease memory loss after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Altered ANRIL Methylation in Epileptic Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01666-w</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01666-w</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have regulatory roles in several aspects of cellular physiology. Recent studies have also revealed their role in neuronal differentiation and the pathophysiology of neurologic disorders such as epilepsy. We have recently reported altered expression of a number of lncRNAs in the peripheral blood of epileptic patients in association with their response to antiepileptic drugs. One the most significantly altered lncRNAs in epileptic patients is the antisense non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ANRIL&lt;/em&gt;), whose expression has been found to be higher in both refractory and non-refractory groups compared with controls. In the current study, we aimed to identify the methylation status of this lncRNA to suggest a potential mechanism for deregulated &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ANRIL&lt;/em&gt; expression. Thus, we assessed the methylation status of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ANRIL&lt;/em&gt; promoter in 40 patients with refractory epilepsy, 40 patients with non-refractory epilepsy and 40 normal controls using the high-resolution melting (HRM) method. The HRM results showed hypomethylation of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ANRIL&lt;/em&gt; promoter region in both refractory epilepsy and non-refractory epilepsy patients compared with normal controls. This methylation pattern was consistent with the recently reported upregulation of this lncRNA in patients with epilepsy. Thus, we suggest altered methylation of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ANRIL&lt;/em&gt; promoter as a potential cause of its aberrant expression in peripheral blood of epileptic patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Association Analysis of ANRIL Polymorphisms and Haplotypes with Autism Spectrum Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01657-x</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been shown to have a complex inheritance. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to be associated with risk of this neurodevelopmental disorder. In the current study, we genotyped four SNPs in a genomic hotspot for human disorders. The selected SNPs were located in adjacency of the antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ANRIL&lt;/em&gt;) and have been shown to be associated with a number of human disorders. Genotyping was performed in 420 ASD cases and 420 normally developed children. After correction of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; values for multiple comparisons, there was no significant difference in frequencies of rs1333045, rs1333048, rs4977574, and rs10757278 alleles, genotypes, or haplotypes between ASD children and children with normal development. However, one estimated haplotype (T A A A haplotype corresponding to rs1333045, rs1333048, rs4977574, and rs10757278 SNPs, respectively) tended to be more prevalent among cases compared with controls (OR (95% CI) = 1.77 (1.19–2.64), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.07). Besides, the T A G G tended to be less common among ASD cases compared with controls (OR (95% CI) = 0.64 (0.47–0.87), adjusted P value = 0.07). Although we could not detect significant difference in alleles, genotypes, or haplotypes frequencies between cases and controls, the trend toward association between two haplotypes and ASD risk implies that there might be a putative causative variant in the mentioned haplotypes whose association with ASD could be determined in larger cohorts of patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: The Association Between Traumatic Brain Injury and Accelerated Fracture Healing: A Study on the Effects of Growth Factors and Cytokines</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01640-6</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Evidence suggests that some systemic and local factors, including cytokines and growth factors in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), can play an essential role in accelerating fracture healing. The purpose of this study was to evaluate serum levels of some inflammatory cytokines and growth factors in patients with fracture and TBI as well as healthy subjects. In this study, a total number of 30 patients with a femoral fracture, 30 cases with TBI, 30 patients with TBI and a femoral fracture (fracture + TBI group), and 30 healthy subjects were recruited. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores were also determined upon their admission. Then, the serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, 12 h and 4 weeks after injury and hospital admission. The study results demonstrated that the serum levels of BMP-2, FGF-2, IL-1β, and PDGF in the femoral fracture + TBI group increased significantly over 12 h and after 4 weeks compared with other groups, but the serum levels of IGF-I, IL-6, and TGF-β in this group increased in a significant manner at 12 h compared with other studied groups. The findings also showed that the time to union of a femoral fracture was shorter in the fracture + TBI group than in cases with a femoral fracture alone (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03). Accordingly, it seems that elevated serum levels of BMP-2, PDGF, FGF-2, and IL-1β may be associated with healing acceleration in fracture + TBI patients. However, further studies are needed to confirm this claim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The role of the gut microbiota in triggering autism is a rapidly emerging field of research. Gut microbiota have been incriminated because autistic children often have gastrointestinal symptoms. Pathogenic gut bacteria in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been reported. The present study aimed to assess &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/em&gt; in the stool of children with ASD and its relation to gastrointestinal (GI) comorbidities, autism severity, and sensory impairment. The study included 58 ASD patients, 45 of their neurotypical siblings, and 45 unrelated controls. Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) was used to assess the severity of autism. Sensory problems were evaluated using the Short Sensory Profile (SSP). GI symptoms were assessed with a modified six-item GI Severity Index (6-GSI) questionnaire. Quantitative real-time PCR was done for the detection and quantitation of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;C. difficile&lt;/em&gt; and its toxins A and B. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;C. difficile&lt;/em&gt; was detected in 25.9%, 40%, and 15.6% of ASD cases, siblings, and unrelated control respectively. Regarding toxin A and B production, 73.3%, 77.8%, and 71.4% of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;C. difficile&lt;/em&gt; in positive ASD, siblings, and unrelated control cases respectively were toxigenic. There was no statistically significant difference between the three groups as regards &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;C. difficile&lt;/em&gt; qualitative, quantitative, and toxin production results. In conclusion&lt;strong class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;C. difficile&lt;/em&gt; is not specifically prevalent in the gut of children with ASD. Although most of the strains are toxigenic, there were no GI symptoms in the control groups and no statistically significant association with GI Severity Index in autistic cases. Gastrointestinal dysfunction and sensory impairment are common comorbidities in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Gene Panel Sequencing Identifies Novel Pathogenic Mutations in Moroccan Patients with Familial Parkinson Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01635-3</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In the past two decades, genetic studies of familial forms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) have shown evidence that PD has a significant genetic component. Indeed, 12 genes are strongly involved in PD causality, three of them having dominant inheritance and 9 causing early-onset autosomal recessive forms, including 3 with a typical PD and 6 with an atypical parkinsonism. The aim of this study was to determine the genetic basis of familial PD in Moroccan patients. We selected 18 Moroccan index case with familial forms of PD. Patients were first screened for exon-rearrangements by MLPA kit. They were then analyzed by gene panel next-generation sequencing (NGS). Functional variants with minor allele frequencies &amp;lt; 0.5% in public databases were considered potential candidate variants to PD. In the 18 PD patients with a positive family history that were analyzed, MLPA assays identified &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PRKN&lt;/em&gt; deletions in two patients: a homozygous exon 3–5 deletion and a heterozygous exon 4 deletion. Sixteen rare SNV were identified by NGS, four of them were novel. Seven mutations were categorized as pathogenic, five as likely pathogenic, two to be of uncertain significance, and 3 were predicted to be likely benign but may give a weaker pathogenic effect and could contribute to PD since they were found in late-onset PD patients. Rare or novel mutations that could be related to the disease were identified in 72% of these patients (13/18), including nine with bi-allelic pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in genes causing recessive PD, particularly &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PRKN&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PINK1&lt;/em&gt;. Mutations in genes with dominant inheritance were found in 4/18 patients (22%).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Increased Levels of IL-34 in Acquired Immune-Mediated Neuropathies</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Interleukin (IL)-34 is ligand for the colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1 receptor. This cytokine has fundamental roles the pathogenesis of a number of autoimmune and neurologic disorders. However, its role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies (AIDP and CIDP) has not been assessed yet. We measured serum levels of IL-34 33 CIDP cases, 16 AIDP cases, and 33 control subjects using commercial ELISA kits. IL-34 levels were significantly higher in both AIDP (44.87 ± 4.38) and CIDP (44.87 ± 4.38) groups compared with healthy subjects (30.10 ± 1.05) (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.046 and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01, respectively). Differences between female subgroups were insignificant. However, levels of this cytokine were significantly higher in male subjects with CIDP compared with male controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.042). Thus, levels of this cytokine might be regarded as biomarkers for these kinds of autoimmune disorders. Future studies are needed to verify these results and find the molecular mechanism of participation of IL-34 in the pathogenesis of AIDP/CIDP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Dopamine transporter (DAT) or solute carrier family 6 member 3 (SLC6A3) is a transmembrane protein regulating dopaminergic neurotransmission. It has been implicated in playing important roles in the dopaminergic reward pathways, and thus, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;DAT1&lt;/em&gt; is a strong candidate gene for association studies with heroin dependence. A case-control study involving 279 individuals (147 controls and 132 heroin-dependent cases) was conducted. Ten polymorphisms of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;DAT1 (SLC6A3)&lt;/em&gt; gene were analysed for its association with heroin dependence. Following the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test, genetic association analyses were performed for the study groups. The post hoc statistical power of the study was 0.655 (65.5%). Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs246997 was found to be significantly associated with heroin dependence at allelic, genotypic, and haplotypic levels. A significant difference in the distribution of 11R allele and 10R/11R genotype of rs28363170 between heroin-dependent cases and controls was also observed. Nominal significance at degrees of freedom (df) = 5 was also observed for rs28363170. Five bimarker-based haplotype combinations were also found to be associated with heroin dependence. For the first time, 13R allele (7R/13R genotype) and 14R allele (7R/14R genotype) were identified for rs3836790 in the population. The study also reports that the 11R allele and 10R/11R genotype of rs28363170 is associated with protection against heroin dependence. 7R and 6R alleles were also found to be the common alleles of rs3836790 in the study population. The study provides evidence for the association of polymorphisms of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;DAT1 (SLC6A3)&lt;/em&gt; with heroin dependence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Naringin Targets NFKB1 to Alleviate Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation–Induced Injury in PC12 Cells Via Modulating HIF-1α/AKT/mTOR-Signaling Pathway</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study was designed to investigate the effect of naringin in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model and its mechanism. The target gene of naringin and the enriched pathways of the gene were searched and identified using bioinformatics analysis. Then OGD/R model was built using PC12 cells, after which the cells were treated with different concentrations of naringin. Subsequently, cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry assays, respectively. Meanwhile, the expression of NFKB1 in PC12 cells underwent OGD/R-induced injury was detected by qRT-PCR, while apoptosis-related and pathway-related proteins were checked by Western blot. DCF-DA kit was utilized to measure the level of ROS. Our results revealed that NFKB1, which was upregulated in MACO rats and OGD/R-treated PC12 cells, was a target gene of naringin. Naringin could alleviate OGD/R-induced injury via promoting the proliferation, and repressing the apoptosis of PC12 cells through regulating the expression of NFKB1 and apoptosis-associated proteins and ROS level. Besides, the depletion of NFKB1 was positive to cell proliferation but negative to cell apoptosis. Moreover, the depletion of NFKB1 enhanced the influences of naringin on cell proliferation and apoptosis as well as the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and ROS level. Western blotting indicated that both naringin treatment and depletion of NFKB1 could increase the expression of HIF-1α, p-AKT, and p-mTOR compared with OGD/R group. What’s more, treatment by naringin and si-NFKB1 together could significantly increase these effects. Nevertheless, the expression of AKT and mTOR among each group was almost not changed. In conclusion, naringin could prevent the OGD/R-induced injury in PC12 cells in vitro by targeting NFKB1 and regulating HIF-1α/AKT/mTOR-signaling pathway, which might provide novel ideas for the therapy of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Hyperphosphorylated tau is the main component of neurofibrillary tangles and involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Increasing evidences suggest close associations between &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;) and AD, but the relationship between &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; and tau hyperphosphorylation is still unclear. In this study, we investigated whether peripheral infection with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; caused tau hyperphosphorylation by using wild Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and HT-22 cells. The rats were injected with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; suspension or phosphate-buffered saline 3 times per week. After 4 weeks or 12 weeks, the rats were sacrificed for analyzing systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, and tau hyperphosphorylation. The results showed that the severity of phosphorylated tau at the AD-related sites Thr181 and Thr231 and the number of activated astrocytes were notably greater in the hippocampus of rats with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; injection. And the levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in serum and hippocampus were also increased in the rats with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; injection. In addition, the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was significantly inhibited in the hippocampus of rats with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; injection. In vitro, IL-1β induced tau hyperphosphorylation by inhibiting the activity of PP2A in HT-22 cells and application of the PP2A promoter efficiently attenuated IL-1β-induced tau hyperphosphorylation in HT-22 cells. These results indicated that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; could induce tau hyperphosphorylation via, in part, attenuating the activity of PP2A through triggering systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation in wild-type SD rats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to participate in the pathogenesis of several complex disorders such as immune-related disorders. Multiple sclerosis (MS) as an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system has been associated with aberrant expression of several lncRNAs. In the current study, we assessed expression of NF-κB-, autophagy-, and obesity-associated lncRNAs/genes and two inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood of MS patients and healthy controls. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LNC-MKI67IP&lt;/em&gt; was down-regulated in total MS patients compared with total controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001). However, when comparing its expression in a gender-based manner, no significant difference was found between patients and controls. Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HNF1A-AS1&lt;/em&gt; was significantly lower in total MS patients and patients of both sexes when compared with the matched controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.03; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.004, respectively). Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00305&lt;/em&gt; had a similar pattern to &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HNF1A-AS1&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.005; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001, respectively). Expressions of other assessed NF-κB associated lncRNAs were not different between cases and controls. Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-1B&lt;/em&gt; was significantly lower in total MS patients compared with total controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001). Such decreased expression was detected in female patients compared with female controls as well (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001). Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-6&lt;/em&gt; was not different between cases and controls. Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CEBPA&lt;/em&gt; was higher in total MS patients compared with controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.047). However, when dividing study participants into male and female subgroups, no significant difference was detected between cases and gender-matched controls. There were no significant difference in the expression of any assessed autophagy-associated lncRNAs between cases and controls. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ATG5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CEBPA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HNF1A-AS1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-1B&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00305&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LNC-MKI67IP&lt;/em&gt; could differentiate disease status with diagnostic power values of 0.781, 0.582, 0.744, 0.76, 0.926, and 0.703, respectively. Expression levels of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADINR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CHAST&lt;/em&gt; were correlated with age of MS patients and disease duration, respectively (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.33, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.34, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001, respectively). The present study highlighted the role of a number lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of MS and supported the previous data regarding aberrant expression of these transcripts in this immune-related disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Nrn1 Overexpression Attenuates Retinal Ganglion Cell Apoptosis, Promotes Axonal Regeneration, and Improves Visual Function Following Optic Nerve Crush in Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neuritin (Nrn1) is a small highly conserved extracellular membrane protein involved in the process of neural cell survival and differentiation, axonal and dendritic growth, and synapse formation and maturation. Previous studies have demonstrated that intravitreal injection of recombinant Nrn1 as a gene therapy could alleviate retinal ganglion cell (RGC) apoptosis and promote optic nerve axon regeneration after optic nerve crush (ONC). However, the mechanism underlying the repairing effect of Nrn1 against optic never injury remains elusive. In this study, a rAAV2-mediated Nrn1 overexpression vector (AAV2-Nrn1) was applied to treat ONC through intravitreal injection for the purpose of further exploring the effect and mechanism of Nrn1 in repairing the injured optic nerve. The results showed that AAV2-Nrn1 was mainly transfected into RGCs without affecting astrocytes. Nrn1 overexpression effectively reduced RGC apoptosis and promoted optic nerve regeneration and visual function restoration as demonstrated by retinal imaging, histopathological analysis, and physiological function detection in vivo following ONC. Immunoblot assay revealed that functional molecules of Nrn1 activated the Akt1 and Stat3 pathways and inhibited the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The results of the present study may provide experimental evidence for further application of Nrn1 to the clinical treatment of optic nerve injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: TRPV1, Targeted by miR-338-3p, Induces Neuropathic Pain by Interacting with NECAB2</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A variety of studies have proposed that transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is involved in the progression of multiple diseases, including neuropathic pain. Although increased expression of TRPV1 in chronic constriction injury was described earlier, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of TRPV1 in neuropathic pain remain largely unknown. In our study, we constructed a chronic constriction injury (CCI) rat model to deeply analyze the mechanisms underlying TRPV1. RT-qPCR-indicated TRPV1 mRNA and protein expression were extremely upregulated in CCI rat dorsal spinal cord tissues. Then, TRPV1 was corroborated to interact with N-terminal EF-hand Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding protein 2 (NECAB2). The mRNA and protein levels of NECAB2 were increased in CCI tissues. Moreover, TRPV1 and NECAB2 together regulated nociceptive procession-associated protein metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2), and Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in isolated microglia of CCI rats. Moreover, TRPV1 upregulation apparently increased mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia as well as the expression of inflammation-associated genes (COX-2, TNF-α, and IL-6). In addition, downregulation of NECAB2 significantly decreased mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia as well as the expression of COX-2, TNF-α, and IL-6. Furthermore, TRPV1 was confirmed to be a downstream target of miR-338-3p. TRPV1 overexpression abolished the inhibitory effect by miR-338-3p elevation on neuropathic pain development. In summary, this study proved TRPV1, targeted by miR-338-3p, induced neuropathic pain by interacting with NECAB2, which provides a potential therapeutic target for neuropathic pain treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: LncRNA HOTAIR Participates in Microglia Activation and Inflammatory Factor Release by Regulating the Ubiquitination of MYD88 in Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) have been reported to be closely associated with various diseases, but their roles in TBI has not been fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the underlying mechanism of LncRNA HOTAIR in TBI-induced microglial activation and inflammatory factor release. In vivo mouse TBI model and in vitro microglia activation model were established by Feeney’s free-fall impact method and by LPS stimulation, respectively. The expression of LncRNA HOTAIR in activated microglia was detected by qRT-PCR. After shRNA knocked down, the expressions of LncRNA HOTAIR and microglia activation marker Iba-1 in microglia were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot and by ELISA that detected the concentration of inflammatory factor in cell culture supernatants. The relationship between LncRNA HOTAIR and MYD88 in mouse microglia BV2 cells was observed by RNA pull-down assay. Furthermore, the effect of LncRNA HOTAIR on MYD88 stability was assessed by cycloheximide (CHX)-chase and by immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays that analyzed MYD88 ubiquitination. LncRNA HOTAIR was abnormally highly expressed in activated microglia. By Western blot and ELISA, the knockdown of LncRNA HOTAIR in microglia significantly repressed microglia activation and inflammatory factor release. By RNA pull-down assay, LncRNA HOTAIR could bind to MYD88 protein. Besides, by cycloheximide (CHX)-chase and immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays, the overexpression of the LncRNA HOTAIR enhanced the stability of MYD88 protein and inhibited Nrdp1-mediated ubiquitination of MYD88 protein. After the transfection of shRNA-HOTAIR and shRNA-HOTAIR+pcDNA-MYD88 into microglia, shRNA-HOTAIR could significantly inhibit the activation of microglia and the release of inflammatory factors, while these effects were reversed after the transfection of pcDNA-MYD88. Our experimental data indicated that LncRNA HOTAIR was highly expressed in activated microglia, and our further studies had found that the interference with LncRNA HOTAIR could repress microglia activation and inflammatory factor release via promoting Nrdp1-mediated ubiquitination of MYD88 protein.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Cronobacter sakazakii Infection in Early Postnatal Rats Impaired Contextual-Associated Learning: a Putative Role of C5a-Mediated NF-κβ and ASK1 Pathways</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study was designed to test whether the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cronobacter sakazakii&lt;/em&gt; infection-impaired contextual learning and memory are mediated by the activation of the complement system; subsequent activation of inflammatory signals leads to alternations in serotonin transporter (SERT). To test this, rat pups (postnatal day, PND 15) were treated with either &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;C. sakazakii&lt;/em&gt; (10&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; CFU) or &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; OP50 (10&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; CFU) or Luria bertani broth (100 μL) through oral gavage and allowed to stay with their mothers until PND 24. Experimental groups’ rats were allowed to explore (PNDs 31–35) and then trained in contextual learning task (PNDs 36–43). Five days after training, individuals were tested for memory retention (PNDs 49–56). Observed behavioural data showed that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;C. sakazakii&lt;/em&gt; infection impaired contextual-associative learning and memory. Furthermore, our analysis showed that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;C. sakazakii&lt;/em&gt; infection activates complement system complement anaphylatoxin (C5a) (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS1)) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase1 (MEKK1). Subsequently, MEKK1 induces pro-inflammatory signals possibly through apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK-1), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1/3) and protein kinase B gamma (AKT-3). In parallel, activated nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer B cells (NF-κB) induces interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IFNα-1, which may alter the level of serotonin transporter (SERT). Observed results suggest that impaired contextual learning and memory could be correlated with C5a-mediated NF-κβ and ASK1 pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Anti-aging Klotho Protects SH-SY5Y Cells Against Amyloid β1–42 Neurotoxicity: Involvement of Wnt1/pCREB/Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is considered a prevalent neurological disorder with a neurodegenerative nature in elderly people. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation due to amyloid β (Aβ) peptides are strongly involved in AD pathogenesis. Klotho is an anti-aging protein with multiple protective effects that its deficiency is involved in development of age-related disorders. In this study, we investigated the beneficial effect of Klotho pretreatment at different concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2 nM against Aβ1–42 toxicity at a concentration of 20 μM in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Our findings showed that Klotho could significantly and partially restore cell viability and decrease reactive oxygen species (known as ROS) and improve superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) in addition to reduction of caspase 3 activity and DNA fragmentation following Aβ1–42 challenge. In addition, exogenous Klotho also reduced inflammatory biomarkers consisting of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in Aβ-exposed cells. Besides, Klotho caused downregulation of Wnt1 level, upregulation of phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element binding (pCREB), and mRNA levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) with no significant alteration of epsilon isoform of protein kinase C (PKCε) after Aβ toxicity. In summary, Klotho could alleviate apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in human neuroblastoma cells after Aβ challenge and its beneficial effect is partially exerted through appropriate modulation of Wnt1/pCREB/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: RAB7L1 Participates in Secondary Brain Injury Induced by Experimental Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;RAB7, a member of RAS oncogene family–like 1 (RAB7L1), is a GTPase belonging to the Rab family and acts as an upstream regulator to regulate the kinase activity of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). Although LRRK2 has been shown to aggravate secondary brain injury (SBI) after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), it is unknown whether RAB7L1 is also involved in this process. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of RAB7L1 in ICH-induced SBI in vivo. Autologous blood was injected into adult male Sprague-Dawley rats to induce an ICH model in vivo. The results showed that the protein levels of RAB7L1 increased after ICH. Overexpression of RAB7L1 induced neuronal apoptosis and damage, as demonstrated by TUNEL-positive and FJB-positive cells, and exacerbated ICH-induced learning and cognitive dysfunctions; in contrast, downregulation of RAB7L1 via RNA interference yielded comparatively opposite changes in these parameters. In summary, this study demonstrates that RAB7L1 promotes SBI after ICH and may represent a potential target for ICH therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Identification of SHANK2 Pathogenic Variants in a Chinese Uygur Population with Schizophrenia</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Genomic studies on schizophrenia (SCZ) have revealed several candidate genes involved in excitatory synapse function and plasticity associated with its etiology. SHANK2 is a postsynaptic scaffolding protein, which anchors a protein complex connecting NMDAR, AMPAR, and mGluR receptors at excitatory neuronal synapses. Mutations in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SHANK2&lt;/em&gt; gene have been reported to be associated with human autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and SCZ. To identify variants in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SHANK2&lt;/em&gt; gene and determine the association of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SHANK2&lt;/em&gt; with SCZ in the Chinese Uygur population, we conducted targeted sequencing of whole exon regions and exon-intron boundaries of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SHANK2&lt;/em&gt; in 1574 SCZ patients and 1481 healthy controls. A total of 149 variants were identified, including six common variants and 143 rare variants. For common variants, rs62622853 and rs3924047 showed allelic significance with SCZ before correction, but the association was eliminated after Bonferroni correction. Seven rare nonsynonymous variants, p.Arg739Trp, p.Pro807Leu, p.Ile854Phe, p.Thr1322Ser, p.Leu1434Arg, p.Val1486Ile, and p.Thr1674Met, occurred only in the patients but not in any of the healthy controls. In silico analysis predicted that p.Arg739Trp, p.Leu1434Arg, and p.Val1486Ile variants are likely to be damaging. The present study suggests that individuals with two novel rare nonsynonymous variants (p.Arg739Trp, p.Leu1434Arg) and p.Val1486Ile variants of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SHANK2&lt;/em&gt; might increase the susceptibility to developing SCZ disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, society has experienced notable growth in a variety of
technological areas. However, the Fourth Industrial Revolution has not been
embraced yet. Industry 4.0 imposes several challenges which include the
necessity of new architectural models to tackle the uncertainty that open
environments represent to cyber-physical systems (CPS). Waste Electrical and
Electronic Equipment (WEEE) recycling plants stand for one of such open
environments. Here, CPSs must work harmoniously in a changing environment,
interacting with similar and not so similar CPSs, and adaptively collaborating
with human workers. In this paper, we support the Distributed Adaptive Control
(DAC) theory as a suitable Cognitive Architecture for managing a recycling
plant. Specifically, a recursive implementation of DAC (between both
single-agent and large-scale levels) is proposed to meet the expected demands
of the European Project HR-Recycler. Additionally, with the aim of having a
realistic benchmark for future implementations of the recursive DAC, a
micro-recycling plant prototype is presented.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;For more than a century, scientists have been collecting behavioral data--an
increasing fraction of which is now being publicly shared so other researchers
can reuse them to replicate, integrate or extend past results. Although
behavioral data is fundamental to many scientific fields, there is currently no
widely adopted standard for formatting, naming, organizing, describing or
sharing such data. This lack of standardization is a major bottleneck for
scientific progress. Not only does it prevent the effective reuse of data, it
also affects how behavioral data in general are processed, as non-standard data
calls for custom-made data analysis code and prevents the development of
efficient tools. To address this problem, we develop the Behaverse Data Model
(BDM), a standard for structuring behavioral data. Here we focus on major
concepts in behavioral data, leaving further details and developments to the
project's website (https://behaverse.github.io/data-model/).

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is emerging as a new research direction
which has the potential to replace the hand-crafted neural architectures
designed for specific tasks. Previous evolution based architecture search
requires high computational resources resulting in high search time. In this
work, we propose a novel way of applying a simple genetic algorithm to the NAS
problem called EvNAS (Evolving Neural Architecture using One Shot Model) which
reduces the search time significantly while still achieving better result than
previous evolution based methods. The architectures are represented by using
the architecture parameter of the one shot model which results in the weight
sharing among the architectures for a given population of architectures and
also weight inheritance from one generation to the next generation of
architectures. We propose a decoding technique for the architecture parameter
which is used to divert majority of the gradient information towards the given
architecture and is also used for improving the performance prediction of the
given architecture from the one shot model during the search process.
Furthermore, we use the accuracy of the partially trained architecture on the
validation data as a prediction of its fitness in order to reduce the search
time. EvNAS searches for the architecture on the proxy dataset i.e. CIFAR-10
for 4.4 GPU day on a single GPU and achieves top-1 test error of 2.47% with
3.63M parameters which is then transferred to CIFAR-100 and ImageNet achieving
top-1 error of 16.37% and top-5 error of 7.4% respectively. All of these
results show the potential of evolutionary methods in solving the architecture
search problem.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The preB\&quot;otzinger Complex, the mammalian inspiratory rhythm generator,
encodes inspiratory time as motor pattern. Spike synchronization throughout
this sparsely connected network generates inspiratory bursts albeit with
variable latencies after preinspiratory activity onset in each breathing cycle.
Using preB\&quot;otC rhythmogenic microcircuit minimal models, we examined the
variability in probability and latency to burst, mimicking experiments. Among
various physiologically plausible graphs of 1000 point neurons with
experimentally determined neuronal and synaptic parameters, directed
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs best captured the experimentally observed dynamics.
Mechanistically, preB\&quot;otC (de)synchronization and oscillatory dynamics are
regulated by the efferent connectivity of spiking neurons that gates the
amplification of modest preinspiratory activity through input convergence.
Furthermore, to replicate experiments, a lognormal distribution of synaptic
weights was necessary to augment the efficacy of convergent coincident inputs.
These mechanisms enable exceptionally robust yet flexible preB\&quot;otC attractor
dynamics that, we postulate, represent universal temporal-processing and
decision-making computational motifs throughout the brain.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A central challenge in the computational modeling of neural dynamics is the
trade-off between accuracy and simplicity. At the level of individual neurons,
nonlinear dynamics are both experimentally established and essential for
neuronal functioning. An implicit assumption has thus formed that an accurate
computational model of whole-brain dynamics must also be highly nonlinear,
whereas linear models may provide a first-order approximation. Here, we provide
a rigorous and data-driven investigation of this hypothesis at the level of
whole-brain blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and macroscopic field potential
dynamics by leveraging the theory of system identification. Using functional
MRI (fMRI) and intracranial EEG (iEEG), we model the resting state activity of
700 subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and 122 subjects from the
Restoring Active Memory (RAM) project using state-of-the-art linear and
nonlinear model families. We assess relative model fit using predictive power,
computational complexity, and the extent of residual dynamics unexplained by
the model. Contrary to our expectations, linear auto-regressive models achieve
the best measures across all three metrics, eliminating the trade-off between
accuracy and simplicity. To understand and explain this linearity, we highlight
four properties of macroscopic neurodynamics which can counteract or mask
microscopic nonlinear dynamics: averaging over space, averaging over time,
observation noise, and limited data samples. Whereas the latter two are
technological limitations and can improve in the future, the former two are
inherent to aggregated macroscopic brain activity. Our results, together with
the unparalleled interpretability of linear models, can greatly facilitate our
understanding of macroscopic neural dynamics and the principled design of
model-based interventions for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We combine two popular optimization approaches to derive learning algorithms
for generative models: variational optimization and evolutionary algorithms.
The combination is realized for generative models with discrete latents by
using truncated posteriors as the family of variational distributions. The
variational parameters of truncated posteriors are sets of latent states. By
interpreting these states as genomes of individuals and by using the
variational lower bound to define a fitness, we can apply evolutionary
algorithms to realize the variational loop. The used variational distributions
are very flexible and we show that evolutionary algorithms can effectively and
efficiently optimize the variational bound. Furthermore, the variational loop
is generally applicable (&quot;black box&quot;) with no analytical derivations required.
To show general applicability, we apply the approach to three generative models
(we use noisy-OR Bayes Nets, Binary Sparse Coding, and Spike-and-Slab Sparse
Coding). To demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency of the novel variational
approach, we use the standard competitive benchmarks of image denoising and
inpainting. The benchmarks allow quantitative comparisons to a wide range of
methods including probabilistic approaches, deep deterministic and generative
networks, and non-local image processing methods. In the category of
&quot;zero-shot&quot; learning (when only the corrupted image is used for training), we
observed the evolutionary variational algorithm to significantly improve the
state-of-the-art in many benchmark settings. For one well-known inpainting
benchmark, we also observed state-of-the-art performance across all categories
of algorithms although we only train on the corrupted image. In general, our
investigations highlight the importance of research on optimization methods for
generative models to achieve performance improvements.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Tag-based Genetic Regulation for Genetic Programming. (arXiv:2012.09229v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09229</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce and experimentally demonstrate tag-based genetic regulation, a
new genetic programming (GP) technique that allows evolving programs to
dynamically adjust which code modules to express. Tags are evolvable labels
that provide a flexible mechanism for referring to code modules. Tag-based
genetic regulation extends existing tag-based naming schemes to allow programs
to &quot;promote&quot; and &quot;repress&quot; code modules. This extension allows evolution to
structure a program as a gene regulatory network where program modules are
regulated based on instruction executions. We demonstrate the functionality of
tag-based regulation on a range of program synthesis problems. We find that
tag-based regulation improves problem-solving performance on context-dependent
problems; that is, problems where programs must adjust how they respond to
current inputs based on prior inputs (i.e., current context). We also observe
that our implementation of tag-based genetic regulation can impede adaptive
evolution when expected outputs are not context-dependent (i.e., the correct
response to a particular input remains static over time). Tag-based genetic
regulation broadens our repertoire of techniques for evolving more dynamic
genetic programs and can easily be incorporated into existing tag-enabled GP
systems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have great potential for energy-efficient
implementation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on dedicated neuromorphic
hardware. Recent studies demonstrated competitive performance of SNNs compared
with DNNs on image classification tasks, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet data.
The present work focuses on using SNNs in combination with deep reinforcement
learning in ATARI games, which involves additional complexity as compared to
image classification. We review the theory of converting DNNs to SNNs and
extending the conversion to Deep Q-Networks (DQNs). We propose a robust
representation of the firing rate to reduce the error during the conversion
process. In addition, we introduce a new metric to evaluate the conversion
process by comparing the decisions made by the DQN and SNN, respectively. We
also analyze how the simulation time and parameter normalization influence the
performance of converted SNNs. We achieve competitive scores on 17
top-performing Atari games. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first
to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple Atari games with SNNs. Our
work serves as a benchmark for the conversion of DQNs to SNNs and paves the way
for further research on solving reinforcement learning tasks with SNNs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial neural networks can achieve impressive performances, and even
outperform humans in some specific tasks. Nevertheless, unlike biological
brains, the artificial neural networks suffer from tiny perturbations in
sensory input, under various kinds of adversarial attacks. It is therefore
necessary to study the origin of the adversarial vulnerability. Here, we
establish a fundamental relationship between geometry of hidden representations
(manifold perspective) and the generalization capability of the deep networks.
For this purpose, we choose a deep neural network trained by local errors, and
then analyze emergent properties of trained networks through the manifold
dimensionality, manifold smoothness, and the generalization capability. To
explore effects of adversarial examples, we consider independent Gaussian noise
attacks and fast-gradient-sign-method (FGSM) attacks. Our study reveals that a
high generalization accuracy requires a relatively fast power-law decay of the
eigen-spectrum of hidden representations. Under Gaussian attacks, the
relationship between generalization accuracy and power-law exponent is
monotonic, while a non-monotonic behavior is observed for FGSM attacks. Our
empirical study provides a route towards a final mechanistic interpretation of
adversarial vulnerability under adversarial attacks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have become competitive forecasting methods,
as most notably shown in the winning method of the recent M4 competition.
However, established statistical models such as ETS and ARIMA gain their
popularity not only from their high accuracy, but they are also suitable for
non-expert users as they are robust, efficient, and automatic. In these areas,
RNNs have still a long way to go. We present an extensive empirical study and
an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for
forecasting, that allow us to develop guidelines and best practices for their
use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality
directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns,
otherwise we recommend a deseasonalization step. Comparisons against ETS and
ARIMA demonstrate that the implemented (semi-)automatic RNN models are no
silver bullets, but they are competitive alternatives in many situations.

	<title>eLife: Graded titin cleavage progressively reduces tension and uncovers the source of A-band stability in contracting muscle</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64107</link>
	<description>The giant muscle protein titin is a major contributor to passive force; however, its role in active force generation is unresolved. Here, we use a novel titin-cleavage (TC) mouse model that allows specific and rapid cutting of elastic titin to quantify how titin-based forces define myocyte ultrastructure and mechanics. We show that under mechanical strain, as titin cleavage doubles from heterozygous to homozygous TC muscles, Z-disks become increasingly out of register while passive and active forces are reduced. Interactions of elastic titin with sarcomeric actin filaments are revealed. Strikingly, when titin-cleaved muscles contract, myosin-containing A-bands become split and adjacent myosin filaments move in opposite directions while also shedding myosins. This establishes intact titin filaments as critical force-transmission networks, buffering the forces observed by myosin filaments during contraction. To perform this function, elastic titin must change stiffness or extensible length, unveiling its fundamental role as an activation-dependent spring in contracting muscle.</description>

	<description>The prefrontal cortex (PFC)'s functions are thought to include working memory, as its activity can reflect information that must be temporarily maintained to realize the current goal. We designed a flexible spatial working memory task that required rats to navigate—after distractions and a delay—to multiple possible goal locations from different starting points and via multiple routes. This made the current goal location the key variable to remember, instead of a particular direction or route to the goal. However, across a broad population of PFC neurons, we found no evidence of current-goal-specific memory in any previously reported form—i.e. differences in the rate, sequence, phase or covariance of firing. This suggests such patterns do not hold working memory in the PFC when information must be employed flexibly. Instead, the PFC grouped locations representing behaviorally equivalent task features together, consistent with a role in encoding long-term knowledge of task structure.</description>

	<description>Protein &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-mannosyltransferases (PMTs) represent a conserved family of multispanning endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins involved in glycosylation of S/T-rich protein substrates and unfolded proteins. PMTs work as dimers and contain a luminal MIR domain with a β-trefoil fold, which is susceptive for missense mutations causing α-dystroglycanopathies in humans. Here, we analyze PMT-MIR domains by an integrated structural biology approach using X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy and evaluate their role in PMT function in vivo. We determine Pmt2- and Pmt3-MIR domain structures and identify two conserved mannose-binding sites, which are consistent with general β-trefoil carbohydrate-binding sites (α, β), and also a unique PMT2-subfamily exposed FKR motif. We show that conserved residues in site α influence enzyme processivity of the Pmt1-Pmt2 heterodimer in vivo. Integration of the data into the context of a Pmt1-Pmt2 structure and comparison with homologous β-trefoil – carbohydrate complexes allows for a functional description of MIR domains in protein &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-mannosylation.</description>

	<description>Key enzymatic processes use the nonequilibrium error correction mechanism called kinetic proofreading to enhance their specificity. The applicability of traditional proofreading schemes, however, is limited since they typically require dedicated structural features in the enzyme, such as a nucleotide hydrolysis site or multiple intermediate conformations. Here, we explore an alternative conceptual mechanism that achieves error correction by having substrate binding and subsequent product formation occur at distinct physical locations. The time taken by the enzyme-substrate complex to diffuse from one location to another is leveraged to discard wrong substrates. This mechanism does not have the typical structural requirements, making it easier to overlook in experiments. We discuss how the length scales of molecular gradients dictate proofreading performance, and quantify the limitations imposed by realistic diffusion and reaction rates. Our work broadens the applicability of kinetic proofreading and sets the stage for studying spatial gradients as a possible route to specificity.</description>

	<title>eLife: Constitutive activation of cellular immunity underlies the evolution of resistance to infection in Drosophila</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59095</link>
	<description>Organisms rely on inducible and constitutive immune defences to combat infection. Constitutive immunity enables a rapid response to infection but may carry a cost for uninfected individuals, leading to the prediction that it will be favoured when infection rates are high. When we exposed populations of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster &lt;/i&gt;to intense parasitism by the parasitoid wasp &lt;i&gt;Leptopilina boulardi, &lt;/i&gt;they evolved resistance by developing a more reactive cellular immune response. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that immune-inducible genes had become constitutively upregulated. This was the result of resistant larvae differentiating precursors of specialized immune cells called lamellocytes that were previously only produced after infection. Therefore, populations evolved resistance by genetically hard-wiring the first steps of an induced immune response to become constitutive.</description>

	<title>eLife: Manipulation of the human tRNA pool reveals distinct tRNA sets that act in cellular proliferation or cell cycle arrest</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58461</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58461</link>
	<description>Different subsets of the tRNA pool in human are expressed in different cellular conditions. The 'proliferation-tRNAs' are induced upon normal and cancerous cell division, while the 'differentiation tRNAs' are active in non-dividing, differentiated cells. Here we examine the essentiality of the various tRNAs upon cellular growth and arrest. We established a CRISPR-based editing procedure with sgRNAs that each target a tRNA family. We measured tRNA essentiality for cellular growth and found that most proliferation tRNAs are essential compared to differentiation tRNAs in rapidly growing cell lines. Yet in more slowly dividing lines, the differentiation tRNAs were more essential. In addition, we measured the essentiality of each tRNA family upon response to cell cycle arresting signals. Here we detected a more complex behavior with both proliferation-tRNAs and differentiation-tRNAs showing various levels of essentiality. These results provide the so-far most comprehensive functional characterization of human tRNAs with intricate roles in various cellular states.</description>

Besides, dendrites are significantly larger, have more spines and contain more mitochondria.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use and abuse of cannabis can be associated with significant pathophysiology, however it remains unclear whether 1) acute administration of Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during early adulthood alters the cannabinoid type 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor localization and expression in cells of the brain, and 2) THC produces structural brain changes. Here we use electron microscopy and a highly sensitive pre‐embedding immunogold method to examine CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the hippocampus cornu ammonis subfield 1 (CA1) 30 min after male mice were exposed to a single THC injection (5 mg/kg). The findings show that acute exposure to THC can significantly decrease the percentage of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor immunopositive terminals making symmetric synapses, mitochondria and astrocytes. The percentage of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐labeled terminals forming asymmetric synapses was unaffected. Lastly, CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor expression was significantly lower at terminals of symmetric and asymmetric synapses as well as in mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structurally, CA1 dendrites were significantly larger, and contained more spines and mitochondria following acute THC administration. The area of the dendritic spines, synaptic terminals, mitochondria and astrocytes decreased significantly following acute THC exposure. Altogether, these results indicate that even a single THC exposure can have a significant impact on CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor expression, and can alter CA1 ultrastructure, within 30 min of drug exposure. These changes may contribute to the behavioral alterations experienced by young individuals shortly after cannabis intoxication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Covert speech comprehension predicts recovery from acute unresponsive states</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25995?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25995?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with traumatic brain injury who fail to obey commands after sedation‐washout pose one of the most significant challenges for neurological prognostication. Reducing prognostic uncertainty will lead to more appropriate care decisions and ensure provision of limited rehabilitation resources to those most likely to benefit. Bedside‐markers of covert residual cognition, including speech comprehension, may reduce this uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recruited 28 patients with acute traumatic brain injury who were 2‐7‐days sedation‐free and failed to obey commands. Patients heard streams of isochronous monosyllabic words that built meaningful phrases and sentences while their brain activity via electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. In healthy individuals, EEG activity only synchronises with the rhythm of phrases and sentences when listeners consciously comprehend the speech. This approach therefore provides a measure of residual speech comprehension in unresponsive patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17‐ and 16‐patients were available for assessment with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended at three‐ and six‐months, respectively. Outcome significantly correlated with the strength of patients’ acute cortical tracking of phrases and sentences (r&amp;gt;.6, p&amp;lt;.007), quantified by inter‐trial phase coherence. Linear regressions revealed that the strength of this comprehension response (beta=.603, p=.006) significantly improved the accuracy of prognoses relative to clinical characteristics alone (e.g. Glasgow Coma Scale, Computer Tomography (CT) grade).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple, passive, auditory EEG protocol improves prognostic accuracy in a critical period of clinical decision‐making. Unlike other approaches to probing covert cognition for prognostication, this approach is entirely passive and therefore less susceptible to cognitive deficits, increasing the number of patients who may benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

Within the tumor microenvironment, macrophages exist in an immunosuppressive state, preventing T cells from eliminating the tumor. Due to this, research is focusing on immunotherapies that specifically target macrophages in order to reduce their immunosuppressive capabilities and promote T cell function. In this study, we develop an agent-based model consisting of the interactions between macrophages, T cells, and tumor cells to determine how the immune response changes due to three macrophage-based immunotherapeutic strategies: macrophage depletion, recruitment inhibition, and macrophage reeducation. We find that reeducation, which converts the macrophages into an immune promoting phenotype, is the most effective strategy and that the macrophage recruitment rate and tumor proliferation rate (tumor-specific properties) have large impacts on therapy efficacy. We also employ a novel method of using a neural network to reduce the computational complexity of an intracellular signaling mechanistic model.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/itGbDRPWJ0A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Insulin resistance (IR) precedes the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and increases cardiovascular disease risk. Although genome wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered new loci associated with T2D, their contribution to explain the mechanisms leading to decreased insulin sensitivity has been very limited. Thus, new approaches are necessary to explore the genetic architecture of insulin resistance. To that end, we generated an iPSC library across the spectrum of insulin sensitivity in humans. RNA-seq based analysis of 310 induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones derived from 100 individuals allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes between insulin resistant and sensitive iPSC lines. Analysis of the co-expression architecture uncovered several insulin sensitivity-relevant gene sub-networks, and predictive network modeling identified a set of key driver genes that regulate these co-expression modules.

The fate of scientific hypotheses often relies on the ability of a computational model to explain the data, quantified in modern statistical approaches by the likelihood function. The log-likelihood is the key element for parameter estimation and model evaluation. However, the log-likelihood of complex models in fields such as computational biology and neuroscience is often intractable to compute analytically or numerically. In those cases, researchers can often only estimate the log-likelihood by comparing observed data with synthetic observations generated by model simulations. Standard techniques to approximate the likelihood via simulation either use summary statistics of the data or are at risk of producing substantial biases in the estimate. Here, we explore another method, inverse binomial sampling (IBS), which can estimate the log-likelihood of an entire data set efficiently and without bias. For each observation, IBS draws samples from the simulator model until one matches the observation. The log-likelihood estimate is then a function of the number of samples drawn. The variance of this estimator is uniformly bounded, achieves the minimum variance for an unbiased estimator, and we can compute calibrated estimates of the variance. We provide theoretical arguments in favor of IBS and an empirical assessment of the method for maximum-likelihood estimation with simulation-based models. As case studies, we take three model-fitting problems of increasing complexity from computational and cognitive neuroscience. In all problems, IBS generally produces lower error in the estimated parameters and maximum log-likelihood values than alternative sampling methods with the same average number of samples. Our results demonstrate the potential of IBS as a practical, robust, and easy to implement method for log-likelihood evaluation when exact techniques are not available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OsIhzQozl6c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Fluorescence reconstruction microscopy (FRM) describes a class of techniques where transmitted light images are passed into a convolutional neural network that then outputs predicted epifluorescence images. This approach enables many benefits including reduced phototoxicity, freeing up of fluorescence channels, simplified sample preparation, and the ability to re-process legacy data for new insights. However, FRM can be complex to implement, and current FRM benchmarks are abstractions that are difficult to relate to how valuable or trustworthy a reconstruction is. Here, we relate the conventional benchmarks and demonstrations to practical and familiar cell biology analyses to demonstrate that FRM should be judged in context. We further demonstrate that it performs remarkably well even with lower-magnification microscopy data, as are often collected in screening and high content imaging. Specifically, we present promising results for nuclei, cell-cell junctions, and fine feature reconstruction; provide data-driven experimental design guidelines; and provide researcher-friendly code, complete sample data, and a researcher manual to enable more widespread adoption of FRM.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wf9Ho97_a2o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

By modifying and calibrating an active vertex model to experiments, we have simulated numerically a confluent cellular monolayer spreading on an empty space and the collision of two monolayers of different cells in an antagonistic migration assay. Cells are subject to inertial forces and to active forces that try to align their velocities with those of neighboring ones. In agreement with experiments in the literature, the spreading test exhibits formation of fingers in the moving interfaces, there appear swirls in the velocity field, and the polar order parameter and the correlation and swirl lengths increase with time. Numerical simulations show that cells inside the tissue have smaller area than those at the interface, which has been observed in recent experiments. In the antagonistic migration assay, a population of fluidlike Ras cells invades a population of wild type solidlike cells having shape parameters above and below the geometric critical value, respectively. Cell mixing or segregation depends on the junction tensions between different cells. We reproduce the experimentally observed antagonistic migration assays by assuming that a fraction of cells favor mixing, the others segregation, and that these cells are randomly distributed in space. To characterize and compare the structure of interfaces between cell types or of interfaces of spreading cellular monolayers in an automatic manner, we apply topological data analysis to experimental data and to results of our numerical simulations. We use time series of data generated by numerical simulations to automatically group, track and classify the advancing interfaces of cellular aggregates by means of bottleneck or Wasserstein distances of persistent homologies. These techniques of topological data analysis are scalable and could be used in studies involving large amounts of data. Besides applications to wound healing and metastatic cancer, these studies are relevant for tissue engineering, biological effects of materials, tissue and organ regeneration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FpOKxraLPNY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Classification and phylogeny for the annotation of novel eukaryotic GNAT acetyltransferases</title>

The enzymes of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily count more than 870 000 members through all kingdoms of life and share the same structural fold. GNAT enzymes transfer an acyl moiety from acyl coenzyme A to a wide range of substrates including aminoglycosides, serotonin, glucosamine-6-phosphate, protein N-termini and lysine residues of histones and other proteins. The GNAT subtype of protein N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) alone targets a majority of all eukaryotic proteins stressing the omnipresence of the GNAT enzymes. Despite the highly conserved GNAT fold, sequence similarity is quite low between members of this superfamily even when substrates are similar. Furthermore, this superfamily is phylogenetically not well characterized. Thus functional annotation based on sequence similarity is unreliable and strongly hampered for thousands of GNAT members that remain biochemically uncharacterized. Here we used sequence similarity networks to map the sequence space and propose a new classification for eukaryotic GNAT acetyltransferases. Using the new classification, we built a phylogenetic tree, representing the entire GNAT acetyltransferase superfamily. Our results show that protein NATs have evolved more than once on the GNAT acetylation scaffold. We use our classification to predict the function of uncharacterized sequences and verify by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; protein assays that two fungal genes encode NAT enzymes targeting specific protein N-terminal sequences, showing that even slight changes on the GNAT fold can lead to change in substrate specificity. In addition to providing a new map of the relationship between eukaryotic acetyltransferases the classification proposed constitutes a tool to improve functional annotation of GNAT acetyltransferases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PEKlfRJLvyY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Zoonotic avian influenza viruses pose severe health threats to humans. Of several viral subtypes reported, the low pathogenic avian influenza H7N9 virus has since February 2013 caused more than 1,500 cases of human infection with an almost 40% case-fatality rate. Vaccination of poultry appears to reduce human infections. However, the emergence of highly pathogenic strains has increased concerns about H7N9 pandemics. To develop an efficacious H7N9 human vaccine, we designed vaccine viruses by changing the patterns of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-linked glycosylation (NLG) on the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein based on evolutionary patterns of H7 HA NLG changes. Notably, a virus in which 2 NLG modifications were added to HA showed higher growth rates in cell culture and elicited more cross-reactive antibodies than did other vaccine viruses with no change in the viral antigenicity. Developed into an inactivated vaccine formulation, the vaccine virus with 2 HA NLG additions exhibited much better protective efficacy against lethal viral challenge in mice than did a vaccine candidate with wild-type (WT) HA by reducing viral replication in the lungs. In a ferret model, the 2 NLG-added vaccine viruses also induced hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies and significantly suppressed viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts compared with the WT HA vaccines. In a mode of action study, the HA NLG modification appeared to increase HA protein contents incorporated into viral particles, which would be successfully translated to improve vaccine efficacy. These results suggest the strong potential of HA NLG modifications in designing avian influenza vaccines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tD-eDoOH63s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) defects have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as &lt;i&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/i&gt;-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD). Here, we identify a neuroprotective pathway of like-Sm protein 12 (&lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt;) and exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP 1 (&lt;i&gt;EPAC1&lt;/i&gt;) that sustains the nucleocytoplasmic RAN gradient and thereby suppresses NCT dysfunction by the &lt;i&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/i&gt;-derived poly(glycine-arginine) protein. LSM12 depletion in human neuroblastoma cells aggravated poly(GR)-induced impairment of NCT and nuclear integrity while promoting the nuclear accumulation of poly(GR) granules. In fact, &lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt; posttranscriptionally up-regulated &lt;i&gt;EPAC1&lt;/i&gt; expression, whereas EPAC1 overexpression rescued the RAN gradient and NCT defects in &lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt;-deleted cells. C9-ALS patient-derived neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (C9-ALS iPSNs) displayed low expression of &lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;EPAC1&lt;/i&gt;. Lentiviral overexpression of LSM12 or EPAC1 indeed restored the RAN gradient, mitigated the pathogenic mislocalization of TDP-43, and suppressed caspase-3 activation for apoptosis in C9-ALS iPSNs. EPAC1 depletion biochemically dissociated RAN-importin β1 from the cytoplasmic nuclear pore complex, thereby dissipating the nucleocytoplasmic RAN gradient essential for NCT. These findings define the &lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;EPAC1&lt;/i&gt; pathway as an important suppressor of the NCT-related pathologies in C9-ALS/FTD.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/PGYGt4CxIDM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Histone variants expand chromatin functions in eukaryote genomes. &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; genes are testis-expressed short histone H2A variants that arose in placental mammals. Their biological functions remain largely unknown. To investigate their function, we generated a knockout (KO) model that disrupts all 3 &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; genes in mice. We show that &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; KO males have globally altered chromatin structure in postmeiotic germ cells. Yet, they do not show impaired spermatogenesis or testis function. Instead, we find that &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; plays a crucial role postfertilization. Crosses between &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; KO males and females yield embryos with lower viability and reduced size. Using a series of genetic crosses that separate parental and zygotic contributions, we show that the &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; status of both the father and mother, but not of the zygote, affects embryonic viability and growth during gestation. We conclude that &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; is a novel parental-effect gene, establishing a role for short H2A histone variants in mammalian development. We posit that parental antagonism over embryonic growth drove the origin and ongoing diversification of short histone H2A variants in placental mammals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/38O2OT1oGoc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The brain activity of the four brain regions during visuo‐guided grip force tracking tasks were detected by functional near‐infrared spectroscopy. Pearson's correlation method, partial correlation method, and a pairwise maximum entropy model were used to get a more comprehensive and accurate functional connectivity for precise grip force control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functional connectivity (FC) between multiple brain regions during tasks is currently gradually being explored with functional near‐infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). However, the FC present during grip force tracking tasks performed under visual feedback remains unclear. In the present study, we used fNIRS to measure brain activity during resting states and grip force tracking tasks at 25%, 50%, and 75% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in 11 healthy subjects, and the activity was measured from four target brain regions: the left prefrontal cortex (lPFC), right prefrontal cortex (rPFC), left sensorimotor cortex (lSMC), and right sensorimotor cortex (rSMC). We determined the FC between these regions utilizing three different methods: Pearson's correlation method, partial correlation method, and a pairwise maximum entropy model (MEM). The results showed that the FC of lSMC‐rSMC and lPFC‐rPFC (interhemispheric homologous pairs) were significantly stronger than those of other brain region pairs. Moreover, FC of lPFC‐rPFC was strengthened during the 75% MVC task compared to the other task states and the resting states. The FC of lSMC‐lPFC and rSMC‐rPFC (intrahemispheric region pairs) strengthened with a higher task load. The results provided new insights into the FC between brain regions during visuo‐guided grip force tracking tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;N‐cadherin localization in taste buds of mouse circumvallate papillae&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/725af322-842c-4a8b-a5c9-885a4ee65dfa/cne25090-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N‐cadherin is involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses. It was mainly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in taste buds. Immunoelectron microscopy detected N‐cadherin symmetrically in the membranes of contact sites between afferent fibers (N) and type II cells (II), including synapses. Arrowheads: atypical mitochondria.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taste buds, the receptor organs for taste, contain 50–100 taste bud cells. Although these cells undergo continuous turnover, the structural and functional integrity of taste buds is maintained. The molecular mechanisms by which synaptic connectivity between taste buds and afferent fibers is formed and maintained remain ambiguous. In the present study, we examined the localization of N‐cadherin in the taste buds of the mouse circumvallate papillae because N‐cadherin, one of the classical cadherins, is important for the formation and maintenance of synapses. At the light microscopic level, N‐cadherin was predominantly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in the connective tissues in and around the vallate papillae. At the ultrastructural level, N‐cadherin immunoreactivity appears along the cell membrane and in the intracellular vesicles of type II cells. N‐cadherin immunoreactivity also is evident in the membranes of afferent terminals at the contact sites to N‐cadherin‐positive type II cells. At channel type synapses between type II cells and nerve fibers, N‐cadherin is present surrounding, but not within, the presumed neurotransmitter release zone, identified by large mitochondria apposed to the taste cells. The present results suggest that N‐cadherin is important for the formation or maintenance of type II cell afferent synapses in taste buds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Portable fixed dynamometry: towards remote muscle strength measurements in patients with motor neuron disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10366-9</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10366-9</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We aimed to determine (1) the test–retest reliability of a newly developed portable fixed dynamometer (PFD) as compared to the hand-held dynamometer (HHD) in patients with motor neuron disease (MND) and (2) the PFD’s ability to reduce possible examiner-induced ceiling effects.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Test–retest reliability of isometric muscle strength of the quadriceps was measured in patients with MND and non-neurological controls using the HHD and PFD. Reliability was estimated by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM) using linear mixed effects models, and the Bland–Altman method of agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In total, 45 patients with MND and 43 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. The ICC of the PFD was excellent and similar in both patients and controls (ICC &lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Patients&lt;/sub&gt; 99.5% &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;vs.&lt;/em&gt; ICC &lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Controls&lt;/sub&gt; 98.6%) with a SEM of 6.2%. A strong examiner-induced ceiling effect in HHD was found when the participant’s strength exceeded that of examiner. Employing the PFD increased the range of muscle strength measurements across individuals nearly twofold from 414 to 783 N.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Portable fixed dynamometry may significantly reduce examiner-induced ceiling effects, optimize the standardization of muscle strength testing, and maximize reliability. Ultimately, PFD may improve the delivery of care due to its potential for unsupervised, home-based assessments and reduce the burden to the patient of participating in clinical trials for MND or other neuromuscular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neurology: The sleep and circadian problems of Huntington’s disease: when, why and their importance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10334-3</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10334-3</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mounting evidence supports the existence of an important feedforward cycle between sleep and neurodegeneration, wherein neurodegenerative diseases cause sleep and circadian abnormalities, which in turn exacerbate and accelerate neurodegeneration. If so, sleep therapies bear important potential to slow progression in these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This cycle is challenging to study, as its bidirectional nature renders cause difficult to disentangle from effect. Likewise, well-controlled intervention studies are often impractical in the setting of established neurodegenerative disease. It is this that makes understanding sleep and circadian abnormalities in Huntington’s disease (HD) important: as a monogenic fully penetrant neurodegenerative condition presenting in midlife, it provides a rare opportunity to study sleep and circadian abnormalities longitudinally, prior to and throughout disease manifestation, and in the absence of confounds rendered by age and comorbidities. It also provides potential to trial sleep therapies at a preclinical or early disease stage. Moreover, its monogenic nature facilitates the development of transgenic animal models through which to run parallel pre-clinical studies. HD, therefore, provides a key model condition through which to gain new insights into the sleep-neurodegeneration interface.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Here, we begin by summarising contemporary knowledge of sleep abnormalities in HD, and consider how well these parallel those of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s as more common neurodegenerative conditions. We then discuss what is currently known of the sleep-neurodegeneration cyclical relationship in HD. We conclude by outlining key directions of current and future investigation by which to advance the sleep-neurodegeneration field via studies in HD.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: One nerve suffices: A clinically guided nerve ultrasound protocol for the differentiation of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10323-6</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To investigate diagnostic accuracy of a nerve ultrasound (US) protocol that is individualized to a patient’s clinical deficits for the differentiation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with predominant lower motoneuron disease (ALS/LMND) and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Single-center, prospective, examiner-blinded, diagnostic study in two cohorts. Cohort I (model development): Convenience sample of subjects with ALS/LMND or MMN according to revised El-Escorial or EFNS guidelines. Cohort II (model validation): Consecutively recruited treatment-naïve subjects with suspected diagnosis of ALS/LMND or MMN.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cutoffs for 28 different US values were determined by Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) in cohort I. Area Under The Curve (AUC) of US was compared to nerve conduction studies (NCS). Diagnostic accuracy of US protocols, individualized according to clinical deficits, was compared to former rigid non-individualized protocols and to random examination site selection in cohort II.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;48 patients were recruited. In cohort I (28 patients), US had higher ROC AUCs than NCS, US 0.82 (0.12) (mean (standard deviation)), NCS (compound muscle action potential (CMAP) 0.60 (0.09), &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001; two-sided &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;-test).&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Endocannabinoid-Like Lipid Neuromodulators in the Regulation of Dopamine Signaling: Relevance for Drug Addiction</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The family of lipid neuromodulators has been rapidly growing, as the use of different -omics techniques led to the discovery of a large number of naturally occurring N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) and N-acyl amino acids belonging to the complex lipid signaling system termed endocannabinoidome. These molecules exert a variety of biological activities in the central nervous system, as they modulate physiological processes in neurons and glial cells and are involved in the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Their effects on dopamine cells have attracted attention, as dysfunctions of dopamine systems characterize a range of psychiatric disorders, i.e., schizophrenia and substance use disorders (SUD). While canonical endocannabinoids are known to regulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs impinging on dopamine cells and modulate several dopamine-mediated behaviors, such as reward and addiction, the effects of other lipid neuromodulators are far less clear. Here, we review the emerging role of endocannabinoid-like neuromodulators in dopamine signaling, with a focus on non-cannabinoid N-acylethanolamines and their receptors. Mounting evidence suggests that these neuromodulators contribute to modulate synaptic transmission in dopamine regions and might represent a target for novel medications in alcohol and nicotine use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Target Molecules of STIM Proteins in the Central Nervous System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.617422</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stromal interaction molecules (STIMs), including STIM1 and STIM2, are single-pass transmembrane proteins that are located predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). They serve as calcium ion (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) sensors within the ER. In the central nervous system (CNS), they are involved mainly in Orai-mediated store-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry (SOCE). The key molecular components of the SOCE pathway are well-characterized, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of this pathway need further investigation. Numerous intracellular target proteins that are located in the plasma membrane, ER, cytoskeleton, and cytoplasm have been reported to play essential roles in concert with STIMs, such as conformational changes in STIMs, their translocation, the stabilization of their interactions with Orai, and the activation of other channels. The present review focuses on numerous regulators, such as Homer, SOCE-associated regulatory factor (SARAF), septin, synaptopodin, golli proteins, partner of STIM1 (POST), and transcription factors and proteasome inhibitors that regulate STIM-Orai interactions in the CNS. Further we describe novel roles of STIMs in mediating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx via other than Orai pathways, including TRPC channels, VGCCs, AMPA and NMDA receptors, and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. This review also summarizes recent findings on additional molecular targets of STIM proteins including SERCA, IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs, end-binding proteins (EB), presenilin, and CaMKII. Dysregulation of the SOCE-associated toolkit, including STIMs, contributes to the development of neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease), traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and stroke. Emerging evidence points to the role of STIM proteins and several of their molecular effectors and regulators in neuronal and glial physiology and pathology, suggesting their potential application for future therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Recent Developments in Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) Mass Spectrometry: Application of Quantitative Analysis of the Brain Proteome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.564446</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.564446</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mass spectrometry is the driving force behind current brain proteome analysis. In a typical proteomics approach, a protein isolate is digested into tryptic peptides and then analyzed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. The recent advancements in data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry provide higher sensitivity and protein coverage than the classic data dependent acquisition. DIA cycles through a pre-defined set of peptide precursor isolation windows stepping through 400–1,200 m/z across the whole liquid chromatography gradient. All peptides within an isolation window are fragmented simultaneously and detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Peptides are identified by matching the ion peaks in a mass spectrum to a spectral library that contains information of the peptide fragment ions' pattern and its chromatography elution time. Currently, there are several reports on DIA in brain research, in particular the quantitative analysis of cellular and synaptic proteomes to reveal the spatial and/or temporal changes of proteins that underlie neuronal plasticity and disease mechanisms. Protocols in DIA are continuously improving in both acquisition and data analysis. The depth of analysis is currently approaching proteome-wide coverage, while maintaining high reproducibility in a stable and standardisable MS environment. DIA can be positioned as the method of choice for routine proteome analysis in basic brain research and clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Frontal Functional Network Disruption Associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: An fNIRS-Based Minimum Spanning Tree Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.613990</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.613990</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent evidence increasingly associates network disruption in brain organization with multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a rare terminal disease. However, the comparability of brain network characteristics across different studies remains a challenge for conventional graph theoretical methods. One suggested method to address this issue is minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis, which provides a less biased comparison. Here, we assessed the novel application of MST network analysis to hemodynamic responses recorded by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging modality, during an activity-based paradigm to investigate hypothetical disruptions in frontal functional brain network topology as a marker of the executive dysfunction, one of the most prevalent cognitive deficit reported across ALS studies. We analyzed data recorded from nine participants with ALS and ten age-matched healthy controls by first estimating functional connectivity, using phase-locking value (PLV) analysis, and then constructing the corresponding individual and group MSTs. Our results showed significant between-group differences in several MST topological properties, including leaf fraction, maximum degree, diameter, eccentricity, and degree divergence. We further observed a global shift toward more centralized frontal network organizations in the ALS group, interpreted as a more random or dysregulated network in this cohort. Moreover, the similarity analysis demonstrated marginally significantly increased overlap in the individual MSTs from the control group, implying a reference network with lower topological variation in the healthy cohort. Our nodal analysis characterized the main local hubs in healthy controls as distributed more evenly over the frontal cortex, with slightly higher occurrence in the left prefrontal cortex (PFC), while in the ALS group, the most frequent hubs were asymmetrical, observed primarily in the right prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the global PLV (gPLV) synchronization metric is associated with disease progression, and a few topological properties, including leaf fraction and tree hierarchy, are linked to disease duration. These results suggest that dysregulation, centralization, and asymmetry of the hemodynamic-based frontal functional network during activity are potential neuro-topological markers of ALS pathogenesis. Our findings can possibly support new bedside assessments of the functional status of ALS’ brain network and could hypothetically extend to applications in other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: MiR-128-3p Alleviates Spinal Cord Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury Associated Neuroinflammation and Cellular Apoptosis via SP1 Suppression in Rat</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.609613</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation and cellular apoptosis caused by spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury result in neurological dysfunction. MicroRNAs (miRs) have crucial functions in spinal cord I/R injury pathogenesis according to previous evidences. Herein, whether miR-128-3p contributes to spinal cord I/R injury by regulating specificity protein 1 (SP1) was assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A rat model of spinal cord I/R injury was established by occluding the aortic arch for 14 min. Then, miR-128-3p’s interaction with SP1 was detected by dual-luciferase reporter assays. Next, miR-128-3p mimic and inhibitor, as well as adenovirus-delivered shRNA specific for SP1 were injected intrathecally for assessing the effects of miR-128-3p and SP1 on rats with spinal cord I/R injury. SP1, Bax and Bcl-2 expression levels in I/R injured spinal cord tissues were evaluated by Western blotting, while IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 were quantitated by ELISA. Tarlov scores were obtained to detect hind-limb motor function. Evans blue (EB) dye extravasation was utilized to examine blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed for neuronal apoptosis assessment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;MiR-128-3p expression was decreased, while SP1 amounts were increased in rat spinal cord tissue specimens following I/R. SP1 was identified as a miR-128-3p target and downregulated by miR-128-3p. MiR-128-3p overexpression or SP1 silencing alleviated I/R-induced neuroinflammation and cell apoptosis, and improved Tarlov scores, whereas pretreatment with miR-128-3p inhibitor aggravated the above injuries.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Overexpression of miR-128-3p protects neurons from neuroinflammation and apoptosis during spinal cord I/R injury partially by downregulating SP1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Improving Accuracy of Brainstem MRI Volumetry: Effects of Age and Sex, and Normalization Strategies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.609422</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.609422</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Brainstem-mediated functions are impaired in neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Atrophy can be visualized by MRI. This study investigates extrinsic sources of brainstem volume variability, intrinsic sources of anatomical variability, and the influence of age and sex on the brainstem volumes in healthy subjects. We aimed to develop efficient normalization strategies to reduce the effects of intrinsic anatomic variability on brainstem volumetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Brainstem segmentation was performed from MPRAGE data using our deep-learning-based brainstem segmentation algorithm MD-GRU. The extrinsic variability of brainstem volume assessments across scanners and protocols was investigated in two groups comprising 11 (median age 33.3 years, 7 women) and 22 healthy subjects (median age 27.6 years, 50% women) scanned twice and compared using Dice scores. Intrinsic anatomical inter-individual variability and age and sex effects on brainstem volumes were assessed in segmentations of 110 healthy subjects (median age 30.9 years, range 18–72 years, 53.6% women) acquired on 1.5T (45%) and 3T (55%) scanners. The association between brainstem volumes and predefined anatomical covariates was studied using Pearson correlations. Anatomical variables with associations of |r| &amp;gt; 0.30 as well as the variables age and sex were used to construct normalization models using backward selection. The effect of the resulting normalization models was assessed by % relative standard deviation reduction and by comparing the inter-individual variability of the normalized brainstem volumes to the non-normalized values using paired t- tests with Bonferroni correction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The extrinsic variability of brainstem volumetry across different field strengths and imaging protocols was low (Dice scores &amp;gt; 0.94). Mean inter-individual variability/SD of total brainstem volumes was 9.8%/7.36. A normalization based on either total intracranial volume (TICV), TICV and age, or v-scale significantly reduced the inter-individual variability of total brainstem volumes compared to non-normalized volumes and similarly reduced the relative standard deviation by about 35%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The extrinsic variability of the novel brainstem segmentation method MD-GRU across different scanners and imaging protocols is very low. Anatomic inter-individual variability of brainstem volumes is substantial. This study presents efficient normalization models for variability reduction in brainstem volumetry in healthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Network Diffusion Modeling Explains Longitudinal Tau PET Data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.566876</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.566876</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease is associated with the cerebral accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The progressive occurrence of tau aggregates in different brain regions is closely related to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. However, our current understanding of tau propagation relies almost exclusively on postmortem histopathology, and the precise propagation dynamics of misfolded tau in the living brain remain poorly understood. Here we combine longitudinal positron emission tomography and dynamic network modeling to test the hypothesis that misfolded tau propagates preferably along neuronal connections. We follow 46 subjects for three or four annual positron emission tomography scans and compare their pathological tau profiles against brain network models of intracellular and extracellular spreading. For each subject, we identify a personalized set of model parameters that characterizes the individual progression of pathological tau. Across all subjects, the mean protein production rate was 0.21 ± 0.15 and the intracellular diffusion coefficient was 0.34 ± 0.43. Our network diffusion model can serve as a tool to detect non-clinical symptoms at an earlier stage and make informed predictions about the timeline of neurodegeneration on an individual personalized basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: NeuroRA: A Python Toolbox of Representational Analysis From Multi-Modal Neural Data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.563669</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.563669</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In studies of cognitive neuroscience, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is widely used as it offers richer information than traditional univariate analysis. Representational similarity analysis (RSA), as one method of MVPA, has become an effective decoding method based on neural data by calculating the similarity between different representations in the brain under different conditions. Moreover, RSA is suitable for researchers to compare data from different modalities and even bridge data from different species. However, previous toolboxes have been made to fit specific datasets. Here, we develop NeuroRA, a novel and easy-to-use toolbox for representational analysis. Our toolbox aims at conducting cross-modal data analysis from multi-modal neural data (e.g., EEG, MEG, fNIRS, fMRI, and other sources of neruroelectrophysiological data), behavioral data, and computer-simulated data. Compared with previous software packages, our toolbox is more comprehensive and powerful. Using NeuroRA, users can not only calculate the representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM), which reflects the representational similarity among different task conditions and conduct a representational analysis among different RDMs to achieve a cross-modal comparison. Besides, users can calculate neural pattern similarity (NPS), spatiotemporal pattern similarity (STPS), and inter-subject correlation (ISC) with this toolbox. NeuroRA also provides users with functions performing statistical analysis, storage, and visualization of results. We introduce the structure, modules, features, and algorithms of NeuroRA in this paper, as well as examples applying the toolbox in published datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Increased Phase Cone Turnover in 80–250 Hz Bands Occurs in the Epileptogenic Zone During Interictal Periods</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.615744</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.615744</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We found that phase cone clustering patterns in EEG ripple bands demonstrate an increased turnover rate in epileptogenic zones compared to adjacent regions. We employed 256 channel EEG data collected in four adult subjects with refractory epilepsy. The analysis was performed in the 80–150 and 150–250 Hz ranges. Ictal onsets were documented with intracranial EEG recordings. Interictal scalp recordings, free of epileptiform patterns, of 240-s duration, were selected for analysis for each subject. The data was filtered, and the instantaneous phase was extracted after the Hilbert transformation. Spatiotemporal contour plots of the unwrapped instantaneous phase with 1.0 ms intervals were constructed using a montage layout of the 256 electrode positions. Stable phase cone patterns were selected based on criteria that the sign of spatial gradient did not change for a minimum of three consecutive time samples and the frame velocity was consistent with known propagation velocities of cortical axons. These plots exhibited increased dynamical formation and dissolution of phase cones in the ictal onset zones, compared to surrounding cortical regions, in all four patients. We believe that these findings represent markers of abnormally increased cortical excitability. They are potential tools that may assist in localizing the epileptogenic zone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Differential Effects of Up- and Down-Regulation of SMR Coherence on EEG Activity and Memory Performance: A Neurofeedback Training Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.606684</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.606684</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modulating connectivity measures in EEG-based neurofeedback studies is assumed to be a promising therapeutic and training tool. However, little is known so far about its effects and trainability. In the present study, we investigated the effects of up- and down-regulating SMR (12–15 Hz) coherence by means of neurofeedback training on EEG activity and memory functions. Twenty adults performed 10 neurofeedback training sessions in which half of them tried to increase EEG coherence between Cz and CPz in the SMR frequency range, while the other half tried to down-regulate coherence. Up-regulation of SMR coherence led to between- and within-session changes in EEG coherence. SMR power increased across neurofeedback training sessions but not within training sessions. Cross-over training effects on baseline EEG measures were also observed in this group. Up-regulation of SMR coherence was also associated with improvements in memory functions when comparing pre- and post-test results. Participants were not able to down-regulate SMR coherence. This group did not show any changes in baseline EEG measures or memory functions comparing pre- and post-test. Our results provide insights in the trainability and effects of connectivity-based neurofeedback training and indications for its practical application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Repeatability and Reproducibility of in-vivo Brain Temperature Measurements</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.598435</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.598435</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a neuroimaging technique that may be useful for non-invasive mapping of brain temperature (i.e., thermometry) over a large brain volume. To date, intra-subject reproducibility of MRSI-based brain temperature (MRSI-t) has not been investigated. The objective of this repeated measures MRSI-t study was to establish intra-subject reproducibility and repeatability of brain temperature, as well as typical brain temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Healthy participants aged 23–46 years (N = 18; 7 females) were scanned at two time points ~12-weeks apart. Volumetric MRSI data were processed by reconstructing metabolite and water images using parametric spectral analysis. Brain temperature was derived using the frequency difference between water and creatine (T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt;) for 47 regions of interest (ROIs) delineated by the modified Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas. Reproducibility was measured using the coefficient of variation for repeated measures (COVrep), and repeatability was determined using the standard error of measurement (SEM). For each region, the upper and lower bounds of Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) were established to characterize the typical range of T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt; values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The mean global brain temperature over all subjects was 37.2°C with spatial variations across ROIs. There was a significant main effect for time [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 1,591)&lt;/sub&gt; = 37.0, p &amp;lt; 0.0001] and for brain region [F&lt;sub&gt;(46, 1,591)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.66, p &amp;lt; 0.0001]. The time&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;brain region interaction was not significant [F&lt;sub&gt;(46, 1,591)&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.80, p = 0.83]. Participants' T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt; was stable for each ROI across both time points, with ROIs' COVrep ranging from 0.81 to 3.08% (mean COVrep = 1.92%); majority of ROIs had a COVrep &amp;lt;2.0%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Brain temperature measurements were highly consistent between both time points, indicating high reproducibility and repeatability of MRSI-t. MRSI-t may be a promising diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tool for non-invasively monitoring brain temperature changes in health and disease. However, further studies of healthy participants with larger sample size(s) and numerous repeated acquisitions are imperative for establishing a reference range of typical brain T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as the threshold above which T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt; is likely pathological.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Working Memory in Aphasia: The Role of Temporal Information Processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.589802</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.589802</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aphasia is an acquired impairment of language functions resulting from a brain lesion. It is usually accompanied by deficits in non-linguistic cognitive processes. This study aimed to investigate in patients with aphasia the complex interrelationships between selected cognitive functions: auditory speech comprehension, working memory (WM), and temporal information processing (TIP) in the millisecond time range. Thirty right-handed subjects (20 males) aged from 27 to 82 years suffering from post-stroke aphasia participated in the study. Verbal working memory (VWM) and spatial working memory (SWM) were assessed with: (1) a receptive verbal test and (2) the Corsi Block-Tapping Test, respectively. Both these WM tests used the forward tasks (mainly engaging maintenance processes, i.e., storing, monitoring, and matching information) and backward tasks (engaging both maintenance and manipulation processes, i.e., reordering and updating information). Auditory comprehension was assessed by receptive language tests, and TIP efficiency was assessed by auditory perception of temporal order in the millisecond time range. We observed better performance of forward WM tasks than backward ones, independently of the type of material used. Furthermore, the severity of auditory comprehension impairment correlated with the efficiency on both forward and backward VWM tasks and the backward SWM task. Further analysis revealed that TIP plays a crucial role only in the latter task. These results indicate the divergent pattern of interactions between WM and TIP depending on the type of WM tasks. Level of verbal competency appeared to play an important role in both VWM tasks, whereas TIP (which is associated with manipulation processes) appeared to be important for SWM, but only on the backward task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adaptation can optimize information processing by allowing the visual system to always adjust to the environment. However, only a few studies have investigated how the visual system makes adjustments to repeatedly occurring changes in the input, still less about the related neural mechanism. Our previous study found that contrast adaptation attenuated after multiple daily sessions of repeated adaptation, which was explained by the habituation of either the adapter’s effective strength or the adaptation mechanisms. To examine the former hypothesis, in the present study we used the frequency tagging technique to measure the adapter-elicited steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) amplitudes. Participants repeatedly adapted to the same contrast adapter in a top-up manner for six continuous days, which was called training of adaptation. The behavioral adaptation effect and SSVEP response to the trained adapter and an untrained control adapter were measured before and after training. The psychophysical results showed that the effect of adaptation in the trained condition significantly reduced after training, replicating our previous finding. Contradicting the prediction of the hypothesis that repeated adaptation attenuated the effective strength of the adapter, the SSVEP amplitude was unchanged after training, which was further confirmed by an equivalence test. Taken together, the results challenge the account of habituation of adapter in repeated adaptation, while leaving the account of habituation of adaptation mechanism to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Involvement of the Right Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex in Numerical Rule Induction: A Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Numerical inductive reasoning has been considered as one of the most important higher cognitive functions of the human brain. Importantly, previous behavioral studies have consistently reported that one critical component of numerical inductive reasoning is checking, which often occurs when a discrepant element is discovered, and reprocessing is needed to determine whether the discrepancy is an error of the original series. However, less is known about the neural mechanism underlying the checking process. Given that the checking effect involves cognitive control processes, such as the incongruent resolution, that are linked to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), this study hypothesizes that the right DLPFC may play a specific role in the checking process. To test the hypothesis, this study utilized the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation method that could modulate cortical excitability, and examined whether and how the stimulation of the right DLPFC via tDCS could modulate the checking effect during a number-series completion problem task. Ninety healthy participants were allocated to one of the anodal, cathodal, and sham groups. Subjects were required to verify whether number sequences formed rule-based series, and checking effect was assessed by the difference in performance between invalid and valid conditions. It was found that significantly longer response times (RTs) were exhibited in invalid condition compared with valid condition in groups of anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS. Furthermore, the anodal tDCS significantly shortened the checking effect than those of the cathodal and sham groups, whereas no significantly prolonged checking effect was detected in the cathodal group. The current findings indicated that anodal tDCS affected the process of checking, which suggested that the right DLPFC might play a critical role in the checking process of numerical inductive reasoning by inhibiting incongruent response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Dynamic Modulation of a Learned Motor Skill for Its Recruitment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans learn motor skills (MSs) through practice and experience and may then retain them for recruitment, which is effective as a rapid response for novel contexts. For an MS to be recruited for novel contexts, its recruitment range must be extended. In addressing this issue, we hypothesized that an MS is dynamically modulated according to the feedback context to expand its recruitment range into novel contexts, which do not involve the learning of an MS. The following two sub-issues are considered. We previously demonstrated that the learned MS could be recruited in novel contexts through its modulation, which is driven by dynamically regulating the synergistic redundancy between muscles according to the feedback context. However, this modulation is trained in the dynamics under the MS learning context. Learning an MS in a specific condition naturally causes movement deviation from the desired state when the MS is executed in a novel context. We hypothesized that this deviation can be reduced with the additional modulation of an MS, which tunes the MS-produced muscle activities by using the feedback gain signals driven by the deviation from the desired state. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a feedback gain signal-driven tuning model of a learned MS for its robust recruitment. This model is based on the neurophysiological architecture in the cortico-basal ganglia circuit, in which an MS is plausibly retained as it was learned and is then recruited by tuning its muscle control signals according to the feedback context. In this study, through computational simulation, we show that the proposed model may be used to neurophysiologically describe the recruitment of a learned MS in novel contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Neural Interactions in Developing Rhythmogenic Spinal Networks: Insights From Computational Modeling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms involved in generation of rhythmic locomotor activity in the mammalian spinal cord remain poorly understood. These mechanisms supposedly rely on both intrinsic properties of constituting neurons and interactions between them. A subset of Shox2 neurons was suggested to contribute to generation of spinal locomotor activity, but the possible cellular basis for rhythmic bursting in these neurons remains unknown. Ha and Dougherty (2018) recently revealed the presence of bidirectional electrical coupling between Shox2 neurons in neonatal spinal cords, which can be critically involved in neuronal synchronization and generation of populational bursting. Gap junctional connections found between functionally-related Shox2 interneurons decrease with age, possibly being replaced by increasing interactions through chemical synapses. Here, we developed a computational model of a heterogeneous population of neurons sparsely connected by electrical or/and chemical synapses and investigated the dependence of frequency of populational bursting on the type and strength of neuronal interconnections. The model proposes a mechanistic explanation that can account for the emergence of a synchronized rhythmic activity in the neuronal population and provides insights into the possible role of gap junctional coupling between Shox2 neurons in the spinal mechanisms for locomotor rhythm generation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: AAV-Mediated GALC Gene Therapy Rescues Alpha-Synucleinopathy in the Spinal Cord of a Leukodystrophic Lysosomal Storage Disease Mouse Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Krabbe's disease (KD) is primarily a demyelinating disorder, but recent studies have identified the presence of neuronal protein aggregates in the brain, at least partially composed by alpha-synuclein (α-syn). The role of this protein aggregation in the pathogenesis of KD is largely unknown, but it has added KD to a growing list of lysosomal storage diseases that can be also be considered as proteinopathies. While the presence of these protein aggregates within the KD brain is now appreciated, the remainder of the central nervous system (CNS) remains uncharacterized. This study is the first to report the presence of thioflavin-S reactive inclusions throughout the spinal cord of both murine and human spinal tissue. Stereological analysis revealed the temporal and spatial accumulation of these inclusions within the neurons of the ventral spinal cord vs. those located in the dorsal cord. This study also confirmed that these thio-S positive accumulations are present within neuronal populations and are made up at least in part by α-syn in both the twitcher mouse and cord autopsied material from affected human patients. Significantly, neonatal gene therapy for galactosylceramidase, a treatment that strongly improves the survival and health of KD mice, but not bone marrow transplantation prevents the formation of these inclusions in spinal neurons. These results expand the understanding of α-syn protein aggregation within the CNS of individuals afflicted with KD and underlines the tractability of this problem via early gene therapy, with potential impact to other synucleinopathies such as PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Chronic Tear Deficiency Sensitizes Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1-Mediated Responses in Corneal Sensory Nerves</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.598678</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic tear deficiency enhances the excitability of corneal cold-sensitive nerves that detect ocular dryness, which can lead to discomfort in patients with dry eye disease (DED). However, changes in corneal nerve excitations through the polymodal nociceptor “transient receptor potential vanilloid 1” (TRPV1) and the potential link between this receptor and symptoms of DED remain unclear. In this study, we examined the firing properties of corneal cold-sensitive nerves expressing TRPV1 and possible contributions of chronic tear deficiency to corneal nerve excitability by TRPV1 activation. The bilateral excision of lacrimal glands in guinea pigs decreased the tear volume and increased the frequency of spontaneous eyeblinks 1–4 weeks after surgery. An analysis of the firing properties of the cold-sensitive nerves was performed by single-unit recordings of corneal preparations 4 weeks after surgery in both the sham-operated and gland-excised groups. Perfusion of the TRPV1 agonist, capsaicin (1 μM), transiently increased the firing frequency in approximately 46–48% of the cold-sensitive nerves characterized by low-background activity and high threshold (LB-HT) cold thermoreceptors in both groups. Gland excision significantly decreased the latency of capsaicin-induced firing in cold-sensitive nerves; however, its magnitude was unchanged. Calcium imaging of cultured trigeminal ganglion neurons from both groups showed that intracellular calcium elevation of corneal neurons induced by a low concentration of capsaicin (0.03 μM) was significantly larger in the gland excision group, regardless of responsiveness to cold. An immunohistochemical study of the trigeminal ganglion revealed that gland excision significantly increased the proportion of corneal neurons enclosed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunopositive satellite glial cells. Topical application of the TRPV1 antagonist, A784168 (30 μM), on the ocular surface attenuated eye-blink frequency after gland excision. Furthermore, gland excision enhanced blink behavior induced by a low concentration of capsaicin (0.1 μM). These results suggest that chronic tear deficiency sensitizes the TRPV1-mediated response in the corneal LB-HT cold thermoreceptors and cold-insensitive polymodal nociceptors, which may be linked to dry eye discomfort and hyperalgesia resulting from nociceptive stimuli in aqueous-deficient dry eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Chemically Induced Models of Parkinson’s Disease: History and Perspectives for the Involvement of Ferroptosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.581191</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of necrotic cell death characterized by its dependency on iron and lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis has attracted much attention recently in the area of neurodegeneration since the involvement of ferroptosis in Parkinson’s disease (PD), a major neurodegenerative disease, has been indicated using animal models. Although PD is associated with both genetic and environmental factors, sporadic forms of PD account for more than 90% of total PD. Following the importance of environmental factors, various neurotoxins are used as chemical inducers of PD both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast to other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases (AD and HD), many of the characteristics of PD can be reproduced in vivo by the use of specific neurotoxins. Given the indication of ferroptosis in PD pathology, several studies have been conducted to examine whether ferroptosis plays role in the loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD. However, there are still few reports showing an authentic form of ferroptosis in neuronal cells during exposure to the neurotoxins used as PD inducers. In this review article, we summarize the history of the uses of chemicals to create PD models in vivo and in vitro. Besides, we also survey recent reports examining the possible involvement of ferroptosis in chemical models of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Does Diet Have a Role in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aging process causes many changes to the brain and is a major risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Despite an already vast amount of research on AD, a greater understanding of the disease's pathology and therapeutic options are desperately needed. One important distinction that is also in need of further study is the ability to distinguish changes to the brain observed in early stages of AD vs. changes that occur with normal aging. Current FDA-approved therapeutic options for AD patients have proven to be ineffective and indicate the need for alternative therapies. Aging interventions including alterations in diet (such as caloric restriction, fasting, or methionine restriction) have been shown to be effective in mediating increased health and lifespan in mice and other model organisms. Because aging is the greatest risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, certain dietary interventions should be explored as they have the potential to act as a future treatment option for AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Cognitive Profile of Mild Cognitive Impairment Due to Dementia With Lewy Bodies—An Updated Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.597579</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.597579</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is the second most common type of neurodegenerative dementia. Yet, the domain-specific cognitive impairment of the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) phase of this disease (DLB-MCI) is still not been established. This article gives an updated review on the neuropsychological profile of DLB-MCI, building on the findings from a previous review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed systematic review and searched five different electronic databases (Scopus, Cochrane, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) in May 2020 based on a PICO scheme. Our search was then restricted to articles published in 2019 and 2020. Ending up with a total of 90 articles to be reviewed by abstract and/or full text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In total four papers were included, whereof only one met our full inclusion criteria. Despite a substantial heterogeneity, our findings indicate that DLB-MCI patients have a pattern of executive, visuospatial, and attentional deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The findings indicate that the neuropsychological profile of DLB-MCI is characterized by executive, visuospatial, and attentional deficits. Furthermore, the shortage of studies clearly underlines the paucity of published research into DLB-MCI and emphasizes the need for well-controlled studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: BUB-1 targets PP2A:B56 to regulate chromosome congression during meiosis I in C. elegans oocytes</title>

	<description>Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a heterotrimer composed of scaffolding (A), catalytic (C), and regulatory (B) subunits. PP2A complexes with B56 subunits are targeted by Shugoshin and BUBR1 to protect centromeric cohesion and stabilise kinetochore-microtubule attachments in yeast and mouse meiosis. In &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;the closest BUBR1 ortholog lacks the B56-interaction domain and Shugoshin is not required for meiotic segregation. Therefore, the role of PP2A in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;female meiosis is unknown. We report that PP2A is essential for meiotic spindle assembly and chromosome dynamics during &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; female meiosis. BUB-1 is the main chromosome-targeting factor for B56 subunits during prometaphase I. BUB-1 recruits PP2A:B56 to the chromosomes via a newly identified LxxIxE motif in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and this recruitment is important for proper chromosome congression. Our results highlight a novel mechanism for B56 recruitment, essential for recruiting a pool of PP2A involved in chromosome congression during meiosis I.</description>

	<description>The basal forebrain cholinergic system projects broadly throughout the cortex and constitutes a critical source of neuromodulation for arousal and attention. Traditionally, this system was thought to function diffusely. However, recent studies have revealed a high degree of spatiotemporal specificity in cholinergic signaling. How the organization of cholinergic afferents confers this level of precision remains unknown. Here, using intersectional genetic fate mapping, we demonstrate that cholinergic fibers within the mouse cortex exhibit remarkable laminar and regional specificity and that this is organized in accordance with cellular birthdate. Strikingly, birthdated cholinergic projections within the cortex follow an inside-out pattern of innervation. While early born cholinergic populations target deep layers, late born ones innervate superficial laminae. We also find that birthdate predicts cholinergic innervation patterns within the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Our work reveals previously unappreciated specificity within the cholinergic system and the developmental logic by which these circuits are assembled.</description>

	<title>eLife: Specific Neuroligin3–αNeurexin1 signaling regulates GABAergic synaptic function in mouse hippocampus</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59545</link>
	<description>Synapse formation and regulation require signaling interactions between pre- and postsynaptic proteins, notably cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). It has been proposed that the functions of neuroligins (Nlgns), postsynaptic CAMs, rely on the formation of trans-synaptic complexes with neurexins (Nrxns), presynaptic CAMs. Nlgn3 is a unique Nlgn isoform that localizes at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. However, Nlgn3 function mediated via Nrxn interactions is unknown. Here we demonstrate that Nlgn3 localizes at postsynaptic sites apposing vesicular glutamate transporter 3-expressing (VGT3+) inhibitory terminals and regulates VGT3+ inhibitory interneuron-mediated synaptic transmission in mouse organotypic slice cultures. Gene expression analysis of interneurons revealed that the αNrxn1+AS4 splice isoform is highly expressed in VGT3+ interneurons as compared with other interneurons. Most importantly, postsynaptic Nlgn3 requires presynaptic αNrxn1+AS4 expressed in VGT3+ interneurons to regulate inhibitory synaptic transmission. Our results indicate that specific Nlgn–Nrxn signaling generates distinct functional properties at synapses.</description>

	<title>eLife: Re-expression of SMARCA4/BRG1 in Small Cell Carcinoma of Ovary, Hypercalcemic Type (SCCOHT) promotes an epithelial-like gene signature through an AP-1-dependent mechanism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59073</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59073</link>
	<description>Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare and aggressive form of ovarian cancer. SCCOHT tumors have inactivating mutations in &lt;i&gt;SMARCA4 &lt;/i&gt;(BRG1), one of the two mutually exclusive ATPases of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. To address the role that BRG1 loss plays in SCCOHT tumorigenesis, we performed integrative multi-omic analyses in SCCOHT cell lines +/- BRG1 re-expression. BRG1 re-expression induced a gene and protein signature similar to an epithelial cell and gained chromatin accessibility sites correlated with other epithelial originating TCGA tumors. Gained chromatin accessibility and BRG1 recruited sites were strongly enriched for transcription factor binding motifs of AP-1 family members. Furthermore, AP-1 motifs were enriched at the promoters of highly upregulated epithelial genes. Using a dominant negative AP-1 cell line, we found that both AP-1 DNA binding activity and BRG1 re-expression are necessary for the gene and protein expression of epithelial genes. Our study demonstrates that BRG1 re-expression drives an epithelial-like gene and protein signature in SCCOHT cells that depends upon by AP-1 activity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Daily electrical activity in the master circadian clock of a diurnal mammal</title>

	<description>Daily or circadian rhythms in mammals are orchestrated by a master circadian clock within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Here, cell-autonomous oscillations in gene expression, intrinsic membrane properties, and synaptic communication shape the electrical landscape of the SCN across the circadian day, rendering SCN neurons overtly more active during the day than at night. This well-accepted hallmark bioelectrical feature of the SCN has overwhelmingly emerged from studies performed on a small number of nocturnal rodent species. Therefore, for the first time, we investigate the spontaneous and evoked electrical activity of SCN neurons in a diurnal mammal. To this end, we measured the electrical activity of individual SCN neurons during the day and at night in brain slices prepared from the diurnal murid rodent Rhabdomys pumilio and then developed cutting-edge data assimilation and mathematical modelling approaches to uncover the underlying ionic mechanisms. We find that R. pumilio SCN neurons were more excited in the day than at night, recapitulating the prototypical pattern of SCN neuronal activity previously observed in nocturnal rodents. By contrast, the evoked activity of R. pumilio neurons included a prominent suppressive response that is not present in the SCN of nocturnal rodents. Our computational modelling approaches reveal transient subthreshold A-type potassium channels as the primary determinant of the suppressive response and highlight a key role for this ionic mechanism in tuning excitability of clock neurons and optimising SCN function to accommodate R. pumilio's diurnal niche.</description>

	<description>Early life stress (ELS) presents an important risk factor for drug addiction and comorbid depression and anxiety through persistent effects on the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathways1. Using an ELS model for child neglect (a single 24 h episode of maternal deprivation, MD) in rats, recent published works from our lab show that MD induces dysfunction in ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons 2-4 and its negative controller, the lateral habenula (LHb) 5-7. In regard to LHb, MD-induced potentiation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons shifts the coordination of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance towards excitation, resulting in an increase in the overall spontaneous neuronal activity with elevation in bursting and tonic firing, and intrinsic excitability of LHb neurons in early adolescent male rats 5-7. Here, we explored how MD affects intravenous morphine self-administration (MSA) acquisition and sucrose preference as well as glutamatergic synaptic function in LHb neurons of adult male rats self-administering morphine. We found that MD-induced increases in LHb neuronal and glutamatergic synaptic activity and E/I ratio persisted into adulthood. Moreover, MD significantly reduced morphine intake, triggered anhedonia-like behavior in the sucrose preference test (SPT), and was associated with persistent glutamatergic potentiation 24h after the last MSA session. MSA also triggered postsynaptic glutamatergic potentiation in LHb neurons of control rats during this time period. Our data highlights that ELS-induced glutamatergic plasticity in LHb may dampen the positive reinforcing properties of natural rewards and opioids, and contribute to the development of anhedonic and dysphoric states associated with opioids.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Core Circadian Clock Genes Per1 and Per2 regulate the Rhythm in Photoreceptor Outer Segment Phagocytosis</title>

	<description>Retinal photoreceptors undergo daily renewal of their distal outer segments, a process indispensable for maintaining retinal health. Photoreceptor Outer Segment (POS) phagocytosis occurs as a daily peak, roughly about one hour after light onset. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms which initiate this process are still unknown. Here we show that, under constant darkness, mice deficient for core circadian clock genes (Per1 and Per2), lack a daily peak in POS phagocytosis. By qPCR analysis we found that core clock genes were rhythmic over 24h in both WT and Per1, Per2 double mutant whole retinas. More precise transcriptomics analysis of laser capture microdissected WT photoreceptors revealed no differentially expressed genes between time-points preceding and during the peak of POS phagocytosis. By contrast, we found that microdissected WT retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) had a number of genes that were differentially expressed at the peak phagocytic time-point compared to adjacent ones. We also found a number of differentially expressed genes in Per1, Per2 double mutant RPE compared to WT ones at the peak phagocytic time-point. Finally, based on STRING analysis we found a group of interacting genes which potentially drive POS phagocytosis in the RPE. This potential pathway consists of genes such as: Pacsin1, Syp, Camk2b and Camk2d among others. Our findings indicate that Per1 and Per2 are necessary clock components for driving POS phagocytosis and suggest that this process is transcriptionally driven by the RPE.</description>

	<description>Actin, spectrin, and associated molecules form a membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS) in neurons. The molecular composition and functions of the MPS remain incompletely understood. Here, using co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified hundreds of candidate MPS-interacting proteins that span diverse functional categories. We validated representative proteins in several of these categories, including previously unknown MPS structural components, as well as motor proteins, cell adhesion molecules, ion channels, and signaling proteins, demonstrating periodic distributions of ~20 proteins in neurons using super-resolution imaging. Genetic perturbations of the MPS and its interacting proteins further suggested functional roles of the MPS in axon-axon and axon-dendrite interactions and in axon diameter regulation, and implicated the involvement of MPS interactions with cell adhesion molecules and non-muscle myosin in these roles. These results provide new insights into the interactome of the MPS, and suggest new functions of the MPS in neurons.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Temporal resolution relates to sensory hyperreactivity independently of stimulus detection sensitivity in individuals with autism spectrum disorder</title>

	<description>Background: Researchers have been focused on perceptual characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in terms of sensory hyperreactivity. Previously, we demonstrated that temporal resolution, which is the accuracy in differentiating the order of two successive vibrotactile stimuli, is associated with the severity of sensory hyperreactivity (Ide et al. 2019). Herein, we examined whether an increase in the perceptual intensity of a tactile stimulus, despite its short duration, is derived from high temporal resolution and a high frequency of sensory temporal summation. Method: Sixteen participants with ASD and fifteen typically developing (TD) participants performed two psychophysical experimental tasks, and we evaluated the detectable duration of vibrotactile stimuli with the same amplitude and temporal resolution. Sensory hyperreactivity was estimated using a self-reported questionnaire. Results: There was no relationship between temporal resolution and the duration of detectable stimuli in either group. However, the ASD group showed more severe sensory hyperreactivity in daily life than the TD group did, and ASD participants with severe sensory hyperreactivity tended to have high temporal resolution but not high sensitivity for detectable duration. Conclusion: Contrary to our hypothesis, there might be different processing between temporal resolution and sensitivity for stimulus detection. Sensory reactivity in daily life would not be based on sensitivity for stimulus detection measured in an experimental task, and we suggest that atypical temporal processing would affect sensory reactivity in ASD.</description>

	<description>Studies of neural population dynamics of cell activity from monkey motor areas during reaching show that it mostly represents the generation and timing of motor behavior. We compared neural dynamics in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) during the performance of a visuomotor task executed under different contexts and during an observation task. In the former, monkeys moved a visual cursor in different directions by applying isometric forces on a joystick, either individually or in cooperation with a conspecific. In the latter, they observed the cursor's motion guided by the partner. We found that neural dynamics were shared across isometric and observation tasks and they discriminated directions more accurately than task types, suggesting that PMd encodes spatial aspects independently from specific behavioral demands. Therefore, the largest components of population dynamics might reflect higher cognitive processes, such as the representation of action goals or outcomes, rather than mechanisms strictly confined to motor functions.</description>

	<description>Background and aims:  Imperil by the convenience of information and knowledge access, children exposed to pornography have worsened. As such, this study aims to gain insight into brain connectivity and cognitive function effect of pornography addiction in juveniles, as the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to specifically learn about memory function in juveniles pornography addiction. Methods:  We screened 30 juveniles with 4 dropouts (13 non-addiction vs 13 addiction group). Subjects underwent neuropsychiatric tests (memory, attention, and intelligence) and fMRI image acquisition. We carried correlation analysis of brain connectivity and neuropsychiatric test results. Results:  Significant disconnection between left hippocampus to ACC (Z-transformed r-value, non-addiction vs addiction = 0.07 {+/-} 0.19 vs -0.08 {+/-} 0.17, p=0.04, cohen d=0.83) followed by worse verbal recent memory in pornography addicted juveniles (RAVLT A6 sub-score, p &amp;lt;0.01, d=0.67; A7 sub-score, p=0.01). Attention and intelligence test resulted to insignificant correlation. Discussion:  This data-driven analysis result strongly promotes the involvement of cortico-subcortical systems in pornography addiction, emphasizing the role of reward system pathology, indifferent to addiction pathophysiology in general. Decline in working memory, which are maintained by corticolimbic network, including hippocampus and ACC, affects goal-oriented behaviour greatly. This, correspond to our significant result of addiction groups decline in memory, regardless of its association with attention and intelligence. Conclusion : Disconnection between left hippocampus to ACC suggested similar neurobiological abnormalities as seen on other addictive disorders. Its disconnection was also correlated with worse verbal recent memory in pornography addicted juveniles, without affecting attention and intelligence, results showed.</description>

	<description>It has been reported that MET carriers may express deficits in motor learning and neuroplasticity, possibly deterring musicianship. Here, we compared the prevalence of the Val66Met Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6265) in a sample of musicians (N=50) and an ethnically matched subset from the 1000 Human Genome Project (N-424). We report no differences in genotype or allele frequencies. Results are consistent with the view that hypothesized Met-dependent deficits in neuroplasticity are either mild or can be overcome by long-term practice.</description>

	<description>The stroke induced by ischemia of brain remains high incidence and death rate. The study wanted to confirm the effects of QKI 6 on the protection role in neurons of rat model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI). The rat model with CIRI induced by MCAO (middle cerebral artery occlusion) was well established and rat neurons were isolated to characterize the effects of QKI 6 mediated by SIRT1 on synthesis of triglyceride in neuron and neuronal apoptosis via activation of SIRT1-PPAR{gamma}-PGC-1 signaling pathway. The expression levels of SIRT1 or QKI 6, and acetylation level of QKI 6 was decreased in neurons of rat model with CIRI. QKI 6 deacetylated and mediated by SIRT1 that contributed to suppressing the progression of neuronal apoptosis in rat through promoting synthesis of triglyceride in vivo and in vitro via SIRT1-PPAR{gamma}-PGC-1 signaling pathway, then inhibiting CIRI. In conclusion, our results demonstrated SIRT1 deacetylates QKI 6, the RNA-binding protein, that affects significantly the synthesis of triglyceride in neurons of CIRI rat model. Moreover, it activated transcription factor PGC-1 through post-transcriptional regulation of the expression of PPAR{gamma}, and further enhanced synthesis of triglyceride, thereby restrained the progression of neural apoptosis and CIRI.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Mechanism of cellular production and in vivo seeding effects of hexameric β-amyloid assemblies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424094v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.424094v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: The {beta}-amyloid peptide (A{beta}) plays a key role in Alzheimer's disease. After its production by catabolism of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through the action of presenilin 1 (PS1)- or presenilin 2 (PS2)-dependent {gamma}-secretases, monomeric A{beta} can assemble in oligomers. In a pathological context, this eventually leads to the formation of fibrils, which deposit in senile plaques. Many studies suggest that A{beta} toxicity is related to its soluble oligomeric intermediates. Among these, our interest focuses on hexameric A{beta}, which acts as a nucleus for A{beta} self-assembly. Methods: Biochemical analyses were used to identify hexameric A{beta} in a wide range of models; cell lines, cerebrospinal fluid from cognitively impaired patients and transgenic mice exhibiting human A{beta} pathology (5xFAD). We isolated this assembly and assessed both its effect on primary neuron viability in vitro, and its contribution to amyloid deposition in vivo following intracerebral injection. In both cases, we used wild-type mice (C57BL/6) to mimic an environment where hexameric A{beta} is present alone and 5xFAD mice to incubate hexameric A{beta} in a context where human A{beta} species are pre-existing. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we produced stable knockdown human cell lines for either PS1 or PS2 to elucidate their contribution to the formation of hexameric A{beta}. Results: In WT mice, we found that neither in vitro or in vivo exposure to hexameric A{beta} was sufficient to induce cytotoxic effects or amyloid deposition. In 5xFAD mice, we observed a significant increase in neuronal death in vitro following exposure to 5M hexameric A{beta}, as well as a 1.47-fold aggravation of amyloid deposition in vivo. At the cellular level, we found hexameric A{beta} in extracellular vesicles and observed a strong decrease in its excretion when PS2 was knocked down by 60%. Conclusions: Our results indicate the absence of cytotoxic effects of cell-derived hexameric A{beta} by itself, but its capacity to aggravate amyloid deposition by seeding other A{beta} species. We propose an important role for PS2 in the formation of this particular assembly in vesicular entities, in line with previous reports linking the restricted location of PS2 in acidic compartments to the production of more aggregation-prone A{beta}.</description>

	<description>The &quot;Narratives&quot; collection aggregates a variety of functional MRI datasets collected while human subjects listened to naturalistic spoken stories. The current release includes 345 subjects, 891 functional scans, and 27 diverse stories of varying duration totaling ~4.6 hours of unique stimuli (~43,000 words). This data collection is well-suited for naturalistic neuroimaging analysis, and is intended to serve as a benchmark for models of language and narrative comprehension. We provide standardized MRI data accompanied by rich metadata, preprocessed versions of the data ready for immediate use, and the spoken story stimuli with time-stamped phoneme- and word-level transcripts. All code and data are publicly available with full provenance in keeping with current best practices in transparent and reproducible neuroimaging.</description>

	<description>ES/iPS-retinal sheet transplantation, which supplies photoreceptors as well as other retinal cells, has been shown able to restore visual function in mice with end-stage retinal degeneration. Here, by introducing a novel type of genetically engineered ES/iPS-retinal sheet with reduced numbers of secondary retinal neurons but intact photoreceptor cell layer structure, we reinforced the evidence that ES/iPS-retinal sheet transplantation can establish synaptic connections with the host, restore light responsiveness and reduce aberrant RGC spiking. Furthermore, we show that genetically engineered grafts can substantially improve the outcome of the treatment by improving neural integration. We speculate that this leads to reduced spontaneous activity in the host which in turn contributes to a better visual recovery.</description>

	<description>Non-invasive techniques to electrically stimulate the brain such as transcranial direct and alternating current stimulation (tDCS/tACS) are increasingly used in human neuroscience and offer potential new avenues to treat brain disorders. However, their often weak and variable effects have also raised concerns in the scientific community. A possible factor influencing the efficacy of these methods is the dependence on brain-states. Here, we utilized Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to decompose concurrent tACS-magnetoencephalography data into transient brain-states with distinct spatial, spectral and connectivity profiles. We found that out of four spontaneous brain-states only one was susceptible to tACS. No or only marginal effects were found in the remaining states. TACS did not influence the time spent in each state. Our results suggest, that tACS effects may be mediated by a hidden, spontaneous state-dependency and provide novel insights to the changes in os-cillatory activity underlying aftereffects of tACS.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Biological Correlations and Confounding Variables for Quantification of Retinal Ganglion Cells Based on Optical Coherence Tomography Using Diversity Outbred Mice</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.23.423848v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Purpose: Despite popularity of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in glaucoma studies, it is unclear how well OCT-derived metrics compare to traditional measures of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) abundance. Here, Diversity Outbred (J:DO) mice are used to directly compare ganglion cell complex (GCC)-thickness measured by OCT to metrics of retinal anatomy measured ex vivo with retinal wholemounts or optic nerve cross sections. Methods: J:DO mice (n = 48) underwent OCT and fundoscopic exams, with GCC-thickness measured using automated segmentation. Following euthanasia, RGC axons were quantified from para-phenylenediamine-stained optic nerve cross sections and RGC somas from BRN3A-immunolabeled retinal wholemounts with total cellularity assessed by TO-PRO or hematoxylin nuclear staining. Results: J:DO tissues lacked overt disease. GCC-thickness (62.4 {+/-} 3.7 m), RGC abundance (3,097 {+/-} 515 BRN3A+ nuclei/mm2; 45,533 {+/-} 9,077 axons), and total inner retinal cell abundance (6,952 {+/-} 810 nuclei/mm2) varied broadly. GCC-thickness correlated significantly to RGC somal density (r = 0.46) and axon number (r = 0.49), whereas total inner retinal cellularity did not. Retinal area (20.3 {+/-} 2.4 mm2) and optic nerve (0.09 {+/-} 0.02 mm2) cross-sectional area varied widely. Sex did not significantly influence any of these metrics. In bilateral comparisons, GCC-thickness (r = 0.89), inner retinal cellularity (r = 0.47), and RGC axon abundance (r = 0.72) all correlated significantly. Conclusions: Amongst outbred mice with widely variable phenotypes, OCT-derived measurements of GCC thickness significantly correlate to RGC abundance and axon number. The extensive phenotypic variability exhibited by J:DO mice make them a powerful resource for studies of retinal anatomy using quantitative genetics.</description>

	<description>The extent to which faces and written words share neural circuitry in the human brain is actively debated. Here we compared face-selective and word-selective responses in a large group of patients (N = 37) implanted with intracerebral depth electrodes in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC). Both face-selective (i.e., significantly different responses to faces vs. nonface visual objects) and word-selective (i.e., significantly different responses to words vs. pseudofonts) neural activity is isolated through frequency-tagging. Critically, this sensitive approach allows to objectively quantify category-selective neural responses and disentangle them from general visual responses. About 70% of significant contacts show either only face-selectivity or only word-selectivity, with the expected right and left hemispheric dominance, respectively. Spatial dissociations are also found within core regions of face and word processing, with a medio-lateral dissociation in the fusiform gyrus (FG) and surrounding sulci, while a postero-anterior dissociation is found in the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG). Only 30% of the significant contacts show both face- and word-selective responses. Critically, in these contacts, across the VOTC or in the FG and surrounding sulci, between-category selective-amplitudes (faces vs. words) showed no-to-weak correlations, despite strong correlations in both the within-category selective amplitudes (face-face, word-word) and the general visual responses to words and faces. Overall, we conclude that category-selectivity for faces and written words is largely dissociated in the human VOTC.</description>

	<description>The role of different cell types and their interactions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an open question that we have pursued by mapping the human brain at the single cell level. Here, we present a high resolution cellular map of the aging frontal cortex by single nucleus RNA-sequencing of 24 individuals with different clinicopathologic characteristics; which we used to infer the cellular architecture of 640 individuals with bulk RNA-seq profiles. Powered by this sample of sufficient size to obtain statistically robust results, we uncovered AD associations with neuronal subtypes and oligodendroglial states. Moreover, we uncovered a network of cellular communities, each composed of different neuronal, glial and endothelial cells subpopulations whose frequencies are correlated across individuals. Two of the cellular communities are altered in relation to cognitive decline and tau pathology. Our work provides a roadmap for evaluating cross-cell type differences in the cellular environment of the AD brain.</description>

	<description>The preBotzinger Complex, the mammalian inspiratory rhythm generator, encodes inspiratory time as motor pattern. Spike synchronization throughout this sparsely connected network generates inspiratory bursts albeit with variable latencies after preinspiratory activity onset in each breathing cycle. Using preBotC rhythmogenic microcircuit minimal models, we examined the variability in probability and latency to burst, mimicking experiments. Among various physiologically plausible graphs of 1000 point neurons with experimentally determined neuronal and synaptic parameters, directed Erd[o]s-Renyi graphs best captured the experimentally observed dynamics. Mechanistically, preBotC (de)synchronization and oscillatory dynamics are regulated by the efferent connectivity of spiking neurons that gates the amplification of modest preinspiratory activity through input convergence. Furthermore, to replicate experiments, a lognormal distribution of synaptic weights was necessary to augment the efficacy of convergent coincident inputs. These mechanisms enable exceptionally robust yet flexible preBotC attractor dynamics that, we postulate, represent universal temporal-processing and decision-making computational motifs throughout the brain.</description>

	<description>A missense mutation (A391T) in the manganese transporter SLC39A8 is strongly associated with schizophrenia in genomic studies, though the molecular connection to the brain remains hypothetical. Human carriers of A391T have reduced serum manganese, altered plasma glycosylation, and brain MRI changes consistent with altered metal transport. Here, using a knock-in mouse model homozygous for A391T, we show that the schizophrenia-associated variant changes protein glycosylation in the brain. N-linked glycosylation was most significantly impaired, with effects differing between regions. RNAseq analysis showed negligible regional variation, consistent with changes in the activity of glycosylation enzymes rather than gene expression. Finally, nearly one third of detected glycoproteins were differentially N-glycosylated in the cortex, including members of several pathways previously implicated in schizophrenia such as cell adhesion molecules and neurotransmitter receptors. These findings provide a mechanistic link between a risk allele and biochemical changes in the brain, furthering our molecular understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Distinct VIP interneurons in the cingulate cortex encode anxiogenic and social stimuli</title>

	<description>A hallmark of higher-order cortical regions is their functional heterogeneity, but it is not well understood how these areas encode such diverse information. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), for example, is important in both emotional regulation and social cognition. Previous work shows activation of the ACC to anxiety-related and social stimuli, but it is unknown how subpopulations or microcircuits within the ACC simultaneously encode these distinct stimuli. One type of inhibitory interneuron, which is positive for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), is known to alter the activity of many cells in local cortical microcircuits, but it is unknown whether the activity of VIP cells in the ACC (VIPACC) encodes anxiety-related or social information. Using in vivo calcium imaging and miniscopes in freely behaving mice to monitor VIPACC activity, we identified distinct, non-overlapping subpopulations of VIPACC that preferentially activated to either anxiogenic, anxiolytic, social, or non-social stimuli. We determined that stimulus-selective cells encode the animal's behavioral states and VIP interneuron clusters may co-activate, improving this encoding. Finally, we used trans-synaptic tracing to show that VIPACC receive widespread inputs from regions implicated in emotional regulation and social cognition. These findings demonstrate not only that the ACC is not homogeneous in its function, but also that there is marked functional heterogeneity even within disinhibitory interneuron populations. This work contributes to our understanding of how the cortex encodes information across diverse contexts and provides insight into the complexity of neural processes involved in anxiety and social behavior.</description>

	<description>Repetitive mild TBI (rmTBI) events are common in the U.S. However, rmTBI is challenging to study and this contributes to a poor understanding of mechanistic bases for disease following these injuries. We used fruit flies (D. melanogaster) and a modified version of the high-impact trauma (HIT) method of TBI to assess the pattern of mortality observed after rmTBI. We found that the pattern of mortality was synergistic after a critical number of injuries, similar to that observed previously at more moderate levels of TBI severity. The identity of cellular and molecular factors which contribute to the synergistic effect on mortality remain unknown, but this model offers a platform for investigation into such factors.</description>

	<description>Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) have been used extensively in statistical models of spike train data. However, the IRLS algorithm, which is often used to fit such models, can fail to converge in situations where response and non-response can be separated by a single predictor or a linear combination of multiple predictors. Such situations are likely to arise in many neural systems due to properties such as refractoriness and incomplete sampling of the signals that influence spiking. In this paper, we describe multiple classes of approaches to address this problem: Standard IRLS with a fixed iteration limit, computing the maximum likelihood solution in the limit, Bayesian estimation, regularization, change of basis, and modifying the search parameters. We demonstrate a specific application of each of these methods to spiking data from rat somatosensory cortex and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each. We also provide an example of a roadmap for selecting a method based on the problem's particular analysis issues and scientific goals.</description>

	<description>The cerebral cortex is involved in the control of cognition and the processing of learned information and it appears to have a role in the adaptation of behavior in response to unpredictable circumstances. In addition, the cortex may have a role in the regulation of innate responses since rodents, cats or primates with surgical removal or accidental destruction of cortical regions show excessive irritability, aggression and rage elicited by threatening stimuli. However, it remains unclear whether cortex has an acute role in suppressing innate threat responses because the imprecision and chronic nature of these lesions leaves open the possibility that compensatory processes may underlie some of these phenotypes. In the present study we used pharmacogenetic inhibition to precisely, rapidly and reversibly suppress cortical pyramidal neuron function and examine its contribution to defensive behaviors elicited by a variety of innately aversive stimuli. Inhibition of cortex caused an increase of defensive responses elicited by an aggressive conspecific, a novel prey, and a physically stressful stimulus. These findings are consistent with a role of cortex in the acute inhibition of innate defensive behaviors.</description>

	<description>The ratiometric fluorescent calcium indicator Fura-2 plays a fundamental role in the investigation of cellular calcium dynamics. Despite of its widespread use in the last 30 years, only one publication proposed a way of obtaining confidence intervals on fitted calcium dynamic model parameters from single 'calcium transients'. Shortcomings of this approach are its requirement for a '3 wavelengths' protocol (excitation at 340 and 380 nm as usual plus at 360 nm, the isosbectic point) as well as the need for an autofluorence / background fluorescence model at each wavelength. We propose here a simpler method that eliminates both shortcommings: 1. a precise estimation of the standard errors of the raw data is obtained first, 2. the standard error of the ratiometric calcium estimator (a function of the raw data values) is derived using both the propagation of uncertainty and a Monte-Carlo method. Once meaningful standard errors for calcium estimates are available, standard errors on fitted model parameters follow directly from the use of nonlinear least-squares optimization algorithms.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Cell-intrinsic effects of TorsinA(ΔE) disrupt dopamine release in a mouse model of DYT1-TOR1A dystonia</title>

	<description>DYT1-TOR1A dystonia is an inherited dystonia caused by a three base-pair deletion in the TOR1A gene (TOR1A{Delta}E). Although the mechanisms underlying the dystonic movements are largely unknown, abnormalities in striatal dopamine and acetylcholine neurotransmission are consistently implicated whereby dopamine release is reduced while cholinergic tone is increased. Because striatal cholinergic neurotransmission mediates dopamine release, it is not known if the dopamine release deficit is mediated indirectly by abnormal acetylcholine neurotransmission or if Tor1a({Delta}E) acts directly within dopaminergic neurons to attenuate release. To dissect the microcircuit that governs the deficit in dopamine release, we conditionally expressed Tor1a({Delta}E) in either dopamine neurons or cholinergic interneurons in mice and assessed striatal dopamine release using ex vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry or dopamine efflux using in vivo microdialysis. Conditional expression of Tor1a({Delta}E) in cholinergic neurons did not affect striatal dopamine release. In contrast, conditional expression of Tor1a({Delta}E) in dopamine neurons reduced dopamine release to 50% of normal, which is comparable to the deficit in Tor1a+/{Delta}E knockin mice that express the mutation ubiquitously. Despite the deficit in dopamine release, we found that the Tor1a({Delta}E) mutation does not cause obvious nerve terminal dysfunction as other presynaptic mechanisms, including electrical excitability, vesicle recycling/refilling, Ca2+ signaling, D2 dopamine autoreceptor function and GABAB receptor function, are intact. Although the mechanistic link between Tor1a({Delta}E) and dopamine release is unclear, these results clearly demonstrate that the defect in dopamine release is caused by the action of the Tor1a({Delta}E) mutation within dopamine neurons.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Transforming representations of movement from body- to world-centric space</title>

	<description>When an animal moves through the world, its brain receives a stream of information about the body's translational movement. These incoming movement signals, relayed from sensory organs or as copies of motor commands, are referenced relative to the body. Ultimately, such body-centric movement signals must be transformed into world-centric coordinates for navigation [1]. Here we show that this computation occurs in the fan-shaped body in the Drosophila brain. We identify two cell types in the fan-shaped body, PFNd and PFNv [2,3], that conjunctively encode translational velocity signals and heading signals in walking flies. Specifically, PFNd and PFNv neurons form a Cartesian representation of body-centric translational velocity -- acquired from premotor brain regions [4,5] -- that is layered onto a world-centric heading representation inherited from upstream compass neurons [6-8]. Then, we demonstrate that the next network layer, comprising h{Delta}B neurons, is wired so as to transform the representation of translational velocity from body-centric to world-centric coordinates. We show that this transformation is predicted by a computational model derived directly from electron microscopy connectomic data [9]. The model illustrates the key role of a specific network motif, whereby the PFN neurons that synapse onto the same h{Delta}B neuron have heading-tuning differences that offset the differences in their preferred body-centric directions of movement. By integrating a world-centric representation of travel velocity over time, it should be possible for the brain to form a working memory of the path traveled through the environment [10-12].</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Chlorzoxazone, A BKCa Channel Agonist, Rescues The Pathological Phenotypes Of Williams-Beuren Syndrome In A Preclinical Model</title>

	<description>Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare developmental disorder caused by the deletion of a 1.5 Mb region in chromosome 7 (7q11.23). WBS has been recently modelled by a mutant mouse line having a complete deletion (CD) of the equivalent locus on mouse chromosome 5, thus resembling the genetic defect found in WBS patients. CD mice have been shown to have physical and neurobehavioral abnormalities that recapitulate most of the symptoms associated with human WBS, including cardiovascular, motor, social, emotional and sensory alterations. This model has been largely used to investigate the etiopathological mechanisms of WBS; nonetheless, pharmacological therapies for this syndrome have not been identified yet. Here we propose a novel treatment for WBS, chlorzoxazone (CHLOR), i.e., a molecule targeting calcium-activated large conductance potassium (BKCa) channels, since a reduction in the expression of these channels has been recently described in neurons from WBS patients, as well as in other rare developmental pathologies. Our results demonstrate both the acute and chronic effects of CHLOR on some major pathological phenotypes of CD mice, including several behavioural alterations and cardiac hypertrophy. We conclude that BKCa channels are a therapeutic target of high potential for clinical applications and are likely to play a key role in the etiopathology of WBS.</description>

	<description>Many behavioral tasks require the manipulation of mathematical vectors, but, outside of computational models, it is not known how brains perform vector operations. Here we show how the Drosophila central complex, a region implicated in goal-directed navigation, performs vector arithmetic. First, we describe neural signals in the fan-shaped body that explicitly track a fly's allocentric traveling direction, that is, the traveling direction in reference to external cues. Past work has identified neurons in Drosophila and mammals that track allocentric heading (e.g., head-direction cells), but these new signals illuminate how the sense of space is properly updated when traveling and heading angles differ. We then characterize a neuronal circuit that rotates, scales, and adds four vectors related to the fly's egocentric traveling direction--the traveling angle referenced to the body axis--to compute the allocentric traveling direction. Each two-dimensional vector is explicitly represented by a sinusoidal activity pattern across a distinct neuronal population, with the sinusoid's amplitude representing the vector's length and its phase representing the vector's angle. The principles of this circuit, which performs an egocentric-to-allocentric coordinate transformation, may generalize to other brains and to domains beyond navigation where vector operations or reference-frame transformations are required.</description>

	<description>Individual-level morphological brain networks are becoming an important approach for studying human connectome; however, their interindividual differences are not well understood with respect to behavioral and cognitive relevance, individual identification, and genetic origin. Using three publicly available datasets that involved cross-sectional and longitudinal structural magnetic resonance scans of adults and children, we constructed four morphological brain networks for each of 1,451 images from 1,329 participants on the basis of cerebral surface-based, vertex-wise cortical thickness, fractal dimension, gyrification index and sulcal depth, respectively. The morphological index-dependent networks were further fused via multiplex network model, and fed into community detection. We found that the multiplex morphological brain networks 1) accounted for significant proportions of interindividual variance in and were predictive of multiple behavioral and cognitive domains, in particular Cognition and Motor domains (P &amp;lt; 0.05, corrected), 2) distinguished individuals from each other with high accuracies even for twin subjects (accuracies &amp;gt; 96%), and 3) exhibited low-moderate heritability with the highest for sulcal depth-based morphological brain networks. Intriguingly, compared with intra-module morphological connectivity, inter-module connections explained more behavioral and cognitive variance and were associated with higher heritability. Further comparisons revealed that multiplex morphological brain networks outperformed each type of single-layer morphological brain networks in the performance of behavioral and cognitive association and prediction, and individual identification. Finally, all the findings were generally reproducible over different datasets. Altogether, our findings indicate that interindividual differences in individual-level morphological brain networks are biologically meaningful, which underpins their usage as fingerprints for individualized studies in health and disease.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although seizures are common in prehospital settings, standardized emergency medical services (EMS) treatment algorithms do not exist nationally. We examined nationwide variability in status epilepticus treatment by analyzing 33 publicly available statewide EMS protocols. All adult protocols recommend intravenous benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 33; lorazepam, n = 23; diazepam, n = 24), 30 recommend intramuscular benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 30; lorazepam, n = 8; diazepam, n = 3), and 27 recommend intranasal benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 27; lorazepam, n = 3); pediatric protocols also frequently recommend rectal diazepam (n = 14). Recommended dosages vary widely, and first‐ and second‐line agents are designated in only 18 and 2 states, respectively. Given this degree of variability, standardized national EMS guidelines are needed. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Subtype Diagnosis of Sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease with Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25983?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25983?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (sCJD) comprises several subtypes as defined by genetic and prion protein characteristics, which are associated with distinct clinical and pathological phenotypes. To date, no clinical test can reliably diagnose the subtype. We established two procedures for the antemortem diagnosis of sCJD subtype using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRI of 1,458 patients referred to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center were collected through its consultation service. One neuroradiologist blind to the diagnosis scored 12 brain regions and generated a lesion profile for each MRI scan. We selected 487 patients with autopsy‐confirmed diagnosis of “pure” sCJD subtype and at least one positive diffusion MRI examination. We designed and tested two data‐driven procedures for subtype diagnosis: the first procedure—prion subtype classification algorithm with MRI (PriSCA_MRI)—uses only MRI examinations; the second—PriSCA_MRI + Gen—includes knowledge of the prion protein codon 129 genotype, a major determinant of sCJD subtypes. Both procedures were tested on the first MRI and the last MRI follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PriSCA_MRI classified the 3 most prevalent subtypes with 82% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PriSCA_MRI + Gen raised the accuracy to 89% and identified all subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individually, the 2 most prevalent sCJD subtypes, MM1 and VV2, were diagnosed with sensitivities up to 95 and 97%, respectively. The performances of both procedures did not change in 168 patients with longitudinal MRI studies when the last examination was used.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides the first practical algorithms for antemortem diagnosis of sCJD subtypes. MRI diagnosis of subtype is likely to be attainable at early disease stages to prognosticate clinical course and design future therapeutic trials. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines are widely used in industry for biological drug production. During cell culture development, considerable effort is invested to understand the factors that greatly impact cell growth, specific productivity and product qualities of the biotherapeutics. While high-throughput omics approaches have been increasingly utilized to reveal cellular mechanisms associated with cell line phenotypes and guide process optimization, comprehensive omics data analysis and management have been a challenge. Here we developed CHOmics, a web-based tool for integrative analysis of CHO cell line omics data that provides an interactive visualization of omics analysis outputs and efficient data management. CHOmics has a built-in comprehensive pipeline for RNA sequencing data processing and multi-layer statistical modules to explore relevant genes or pathways. Moreover, advanced functionalities were provided to enable users to customize their analysis and visualize the output systematically and interactively. The tool was also designed with the flexibility to accommodate other types of omics data and thereby enabling multi-omics comparison and visualization at both gene and pathway levels. Collectively, CHOmics is an integrative platform for data analysis, visualization and management with expectations to promote the broader use of omics in CHO cell research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sj7SQ1kIpEI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Biological measurements frequently involve measuring parameters as a function of time, space, or frequency. Later, during the analysis phase of the study, the researcher splits the recorded data trace into smaller sections, analyzes each section separately by finding a mean or fitting against a specified function, and uses the analysis results in the study. Here, we present the software that allows to analyze these data traces in a manner that ensures repeatability of the analysis and simplifies the application of FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles in such studies. At the same time, it simplifies the routine data analysis pipeline and gives access to a fast overview of the analysis results. For that, the software supports reading the raw data, processing the data as specified in the protocol, and storing all intermediate results in the laboratory database. The software can be extended by study- or hardware-specific modules to provide the required data import and analysis facilities. To simplify the development of the data entry web interfaces, that can be used to enter data describing the experiments, we released a web framework with an example implementation of such a site. The software is covered by open-source license and is available through several online channels.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lX_XzerFB6I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Microbial natural products constitute a wide variety of chemical compounds, many which can have antibiotic, antiviral, or anticancer properties that make them interesting for clinical purposes. Natural product classes include polyketides (PKs), nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), and ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). While variants of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for known classes of natural products are easy to identify in genome sequences, BGCs for new compound classes escape attention. In particular, evidence is accumulating that for RiPPs, subclasses known thus far may only represent the tip of an iceberg. Here, we present decRiPPter (Data-driven Exploratory Class-independent RiPP TrackER), a RiPP genome mining algorithm aimed at the discovery of novel RiPP classes. DecRiPPter combines a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that identifies candidate RiPP precursors with pan-genomic analyses to identify which of these are encoded within operon-like structures that are part of the accessory genome of a genus. Subsequently, it prioritizes such regions based on the presence of new enzymology and based on patterns of gene cluster and precursor peptide conservation across species. We then applied decRiPPter to mine 1,295 &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; genomes, which led to the identification of 42 new candidate RiPP families that could not be found by existing programs. One of these was studied further and elucidated as a representative of a novel subfamily of lanthipeptides, which we designate class V. The 2D structure of the new RiPP, which we name pristinin A3 (1), was solved using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data, and chemical labeling. Two previously unidentified modifying enzymes are proposed to create the hallmark lanthionine bridges. Taken together, our work highlights how novel natural product families can be discovered by methods going beyond sequence similarity searches to integrate multiple pathway discovery criteria.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bknPhbPA6VM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Primordial follicle assembly in the mouse occurs during perinatal ages and largely determines the ovarian reserve that will be available to support the reproductive life span. The development of primordial follicles is controlled by a complex network of interactions between oocytes and ovarian somatic cells that remain poorly understood. In the present research, using single-cell RNA sequencing performed over a time series on murine ovaries, coupled with several bioinformatics analyses, the complete dynamic genetic programs of germ and granulosa cells from E16.5 to postnatal day (PD) 3 were reported. Along with confirming the previously reported expression of genes by germ cells and granulosa cells, our analyses identified 5 distinct cell clusters associated with germ cells and 6 with granulosa cells. Consequently, several new genes expressed at significant levels at each investigated stage were assigned. By building single-cell pseudotemporal trajectories, 3 states and 1 branch point of fate transition for the germ cells were revealed, as well as for the granulosa cells. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment enabled identification of the biological process most represented in germ cells and granulosa cells or common to both cell types at each specific stage, and the interactions of germ cells and granulosa cells basing on known and novel pathway were presented. Finally, by using single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC) algorithm, we were able to establish a network of regulons that can be postulated as likely candidates for sustaining germ cell-specific transcription programs throughout the period of investigation. Above all, this study provides the whole transcriptome landscape of ovarian cells and unearths new insights during primordial follicle assembly in mice.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iFIJU6CdENw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Phosphorylation of seryl-tRNA synthetase by ATM/ATR is essential for hypoxia-induced angiogenesis</title>

Hypoxia-induced angiogenesis maintains tissue oxygen supply and protects against ischemia but also enhances tumor progression and malignancy. This is mediated through activation of transcription factors like hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and c-Myc, yet the impact of hypoxia on negative regulators of angiogenesis is unknown. During vascular development, seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) regulates angiogenesis through a novel mechanism by counteracting c-Myc and transcriptionally repressing vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression. Here, we reveal that the transcriptional repressor role of SerRS is inactivated under hypoxia through phosphorylation by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR) at Ser101 and Ser241 to attenuate its DNA binding capacity. In zebrafish, SerRS&lt;sup&gt;S101D/S241D&lt;/sup&gt;, a phosphorylation-mimicry mutant, cannot suppress VEGFA expression to support normal vascular development. Moreover, expression of SerRS&lt;sup&gt;S101A/S241A&lt;/sup&gt;, a phosphorylation-deficient and constitutively active mutant, prevents hypoxia-induced binding of c-Myc and HIF-1 to the &lt;i&gt;VEGFA&lt;/i&gt; promoter, and activation of VEGFA expression. Consistently, SerRS&lt;sup&gt;S101A/S241A&lt;/sup&gt; strongly inhibits normal and tumor-derived angiogenesis in mice. Therefore, we reveal a key step regulating hypoxic angiogenesis and highlight the importance of nuclear SerRS in post-developmental angiogenesis regulation in addition to vascular development. The role of nuclear SerRS in inhibiting both c-Myc and HIF-1 may provide therapeutic opportunities to correct dysregulation of angiogenesis in pathological settings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rZ9l5M1hOJk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Computational protein design is rapidly becoming more powerful, and improving the accuracy of computational methods would greatly streamline protein engineering by eliminating the need for empirical optimization in the laboratory. In this work, we set out to design novel granulopoietic agents using a rescaffolding strategy with the goal of achieving simpler and more stable proteins. All of the 4 experimentally tested designs were folded, monomeric, and stable, while the 2 determined structures agreed with the design models within less than 2.5 Å. Despite the lack of significant topological or sequence similarity to their natural granulopoietic counterpart, 2 designs bound to the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor and exhibited potent, but delayed, in vitro proliferative activity in a G-CSF-dependent cell line. Interestingly, the designs also induced proliferation and differentiation of primary human hematopoietic stem cells into mature granulocytes, highlighting the utility of our approach to develop highly active therapeutic leads purely based on computational design.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4g376v1rJ3I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Oligodendrocytes support axonal transport and maintenance via exosome secretion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Carsten Frühbeis, Wen Ping Kuo-Elsner, Christina Müller, Kerstin Barth, Leticia Peris, Stefan Tenzer, Wiebke Möbius, Hauke B. Werner, Klaus-Armin Nave, Dominik Fröhlich, Eva-Maria Krämer-Albers&lt;/p&gt;

Neurons extend long axons that require maintenance and are susceptible to degeneration. Long-term integrity of axons depends on intrinsic mechanisms including axonal transport and extrinsic support from adjacent glial cells. The mechanisms of support provided by myelinating oligodendrocytes to underlying axons are only partly understood. Oligodendrocytes release extracellular vesicles (EVs) with properties of exosomes, which upon delivery to neurons improve neuronal viability in vitro. Here, we show that oligodendroglial exosome secretion is impaired in 2 mouse mutants exhibiting secondary axonal degeneration due to oligodendrocyte-specific gene defects. Wild-type oligodendroglial exosomes support neurons by improving the metabolic state and promoting axonal transport in nutrient-deprived neurons. Mutant oligodendrocytes release fewer exosomes, which share a common signature of underrepresented proteins. Notably, mutant exosomes lack the ability to support nutrient-deprived neurons and to promote axonal transport. Together, these findings indicate that glia-to-neuron exosome transfer promotes neuronal long-term maintenance by facilitating axonal transport, providing a novel mechanistic link between myelin diseases and secondary loss of axonal integrity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Ph2iKJtdsn8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Age, sex, and regional differences in scavenger receptor CD36 in the mouse brain: Potential relevance to cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Age, sex, and regional differences in scavenger receptor CD36 in the mouse brain: Potential relevance to cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/697eb9f1-564c-4fe2-b30e-897c004fe20e/cne25089-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scavenger receptor CD36 contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and amyloid deposition in the brain. Here, we characterized CD36 gene and protein expression in the brains of young and aged male and female C57BL/6J mice. We found age‐related increases in CD36 mRNA, and CD36 protein differed by region, age, and sex and was primarily expressed intravascularly. These variations may contribute to Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scavenger receptor CD36 contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and amyloid deposition, while CD36 deficiency is associated with restored cerebrovascular function in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. Yet the distribution of CD36 has not been examined in the brain. Here, we characterized CD36 gene and protein expression in the brains of young, middle aged, aged, and elderly male and female C57BL/6J mice. Age‐related increases in CD36 mRNA expression were observed in the male hippocampus and female midbrain. Additionally, male mice had greater CD36 mRNA expression than females in the striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain. CD36 protein was primarily expressed intravascularly, and this expression differed by region, age, and sex in the mouse brain. Although male mice brains demonstrated an increase in CD36 protein with age in several cortices, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and midbrain, a decrease with age was observed in female mice in the same regions. These data suggest that distinctive age, region, and sex expression of CD36 in the brain may contribute to Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Cellular and behavioral basis of cannabinioid and opioid interactions: Implications for opioid dependence and withdrawal</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain's endogenous opioid and endocannabinoid systems are neuromodulatory of synaptic transmission, and play key roles in pain, memory, reward, and addiction. Recent clinical and pre‐clinical evidence suggests that opioid use may be reduced with cannabinoid intake. This suggests the presence of a functional interaction between these two systems. Emerging research indicates that cannabinoids and opioids can functionally interact at different levels. At the cellular level, opioid and cannabinoids can have direct receptor associations, alterations in endogenous opioid peptide or cannabinoid release, or post‐receptor activation interactions via shared signal transduction pathways. At the systems level, the nature of cannabinoid and opioid interaction might differ in brain circuits underlying different behavioral phenomenon, including reward‐seeking or antinociception. Given the rising use of opioid and cannabinoid drugs, a better understanding of how these endogenous signaling systems interact in the brain is of significant interest. This review focuses on the potential relationship of these neural systems in addiction‐related processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Levodopa–Carbidopa Intrajejunal gel (LCIG) infusion is an effective intervention for people with advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although age may not be a limiting factor for LCIG implant, no data are available on late elderly PD (LE-PD) subjects. In this cross-sectional, we aimed to demonstrate if older age may impact on quality of life (QoL), motor and non-motor symptoms severity, and profile of side effects in PD treated with LCIG.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Out of 512 PD subjects treated with LCIG at 9 Italian PD centers, we selected 25 LE-PD defined as age ≥ 80 years at last follow-up who were available to attend the study visit. Twenty-five PD patients (Control-PD, defined as age &amp;lt; 75 years at last follow-up) matched to LE-PD by disease and LCIG duration served as control group. The following motor and non-motor variables were ascertained: quality of life (PDQ-8), time spent in ON, wearing-off Questionnaire, Unified PD Rating Scale, freezing of gait questionnaire, Parkinson’s disease sleep scale-2, Non Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), and MOCA.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;No statistically significant differences were found between LE-PD and Control-PD on PDQ-8 and several motor and non-motor variables. LE-PD had less frequent and milder impulsive–compulsive behaviors and milder dyskinesia. At multivariable regression, worse quality of life was associated with UPDRS-III and NMSS scores but not to age at study visit and age at LICG implant. Rate of adverse effects was similar in both groups. Drop-out rate calculated in the whole PD cohort was comparable between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Our data provide evidence that valuable LCIG infusion might be achieved in late elderly PD.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Natural Compounds as Inhibitors of Aβ Peptide Aggregation: Chemical Requirements and Molecular Mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.619667</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.619667</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, with no cure and preventive therapy. Misfolding and extracellular aggregation of Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are recognized as the main cause of AD progression, leading to the formation of toxic Aβ oligomers and to the deposition of β-amyloid plaques in the brain, representing the hallmarks of AD. Given the urgent need to provide alternative therapies, natural products serve as vital resources for novel drugs. In recent years, several natural compounds with different chemical structures, such as polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenes, flavonoids, tannins, saponins and vitamins from plants have received attention for their role against the neurodegenerative pathological processes. However, only for a small subset of them experimental evidences are provided on their mechanism of action. This review focuses on those natural compounds shown to interfere with Aβ aggregation by direct interaction with Aβ peptide and whose inhibitory mechanism has been investigated by means of biophysical and structural biology experimental approaches. In few cases, the combination of approaches offering a macroscopic characterization of the oligomers, such as TEM, AFM, fluorescence, together with high-resolution methods could shed light on the complex mechanism of inhibition. In particular, solution NMR spectroscopy, through peptide-based and ligand-based observation, was successfully employed to investigate the interactions of the natural compounds with both soluble NMR-visible (monomer and low molecular weight oligomers) and NMR-invisible (high molecular weight oligomers and protofibrils) species. The molecular determinants of the interaction of promising natural compounds are here compared to infer the chemical requirements of the inhibitors and the common mechanisms of inhibition. Most of the data converge to indicate that the Aβ regions relevant to perturb the aggregation cascade and regulate the toxicity of the stabilized oligomers, are the N-term and β1 region. The ability of the natural aggregation inhibitors to cross the brain blood barrier, together with the tactics to improve their low bioavailability are discussed. The analysis of the data ensemble can provide a rationale for the selection of natural compounds as molecular scaffolds for the design of new therapeutic strategies against the progression of early and late stages of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Role of Sirtuins in Modulating Neurodegeneration of the Enteric Nervous System and Central Nervous System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.614331</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegeneration of the central and enteric nervous systems is a common feature of aging and aging-related diseases, and is accelerated in individuals with metabolic dysfunction including obesity and diabetes. The molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration in both the CNS and ENS are overlapping. Sirtuins are an important family of histone deacetylases that are important for genome stability, cellular response to stress, and nutrient and hormone sensing. They are activated by calorie restriction (CR) and by the coenzyme, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Sirtuins, specifically the nuclear SIRT1 and mitochondrial SIRT3, have been shown to have predominantly neuroprotective roles in the CNS while the cytoplasmic sirtuin, SIRT2 is largely associated with neurodegeneration. A systematic study of sirtuins in the ENS and their effect on enteric neuronal growth and survival has not been conducted. Recent studies, however, also link sirtuins with important hormones such as leptin, ghrelin, melatonin, and serotonin which influence many important processes including satiety, mood, circadian rhythm, and gut homeostasis. In this review, we address emerging roles of sirtuins in modulating the metabolic challenges from aging, obesity, and diabetes that lead to neurodegeneration in the ENS and CNS. We also highlight a novel role for sirtuins along the microbiota-gut-brain axis in modulating neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: RatLesNetv2: A Fully Convolutional Network for Rodent Brain Lesion Segmentation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.610239</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.610239</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a fully convolutional neural network (ConvNet), named RatLesNetv2, for segmenting lesions in rodent magnetic resonance (MR) brain images. RatLesNetv2 architecture resembles an autoencoder and it incorporates residual blocks that facilitate its optimization. RatLesNetv2 is trained end to end on three-dimensional images and it requires no preprocessing. We evaluated RatLesNetv2 on an exceptionally large dataset composed of 916 T2-weighted rat brain MRI scans of 671 rats at nine different lesion stages that were used to study focal cerebral ischemia for drug development. In addition, we compared its performance with three other ConvNets specifically designed for medical image segmentation. RatLesNetv2 obtained similar to higher Dice coefficient values than the other ConvNets and it produced much more realistic and compact segmentations with notably fewer holes and lower Hausdorff distance. The Dice scores of RatLesNetv2 segmentations also exceeded inter-rater agreement of manual segmentations. In conclusion, RatLesNetv2 could be used for automated lesion segmentation, reducing human workload and improving reproducibility. RatLesNetv2 is publicly available at https://github.com/jmlipman/RatLesNetv2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Auditory Noise Leads to Increased Visual Brain-Computer Interface Performance: A Cross-Modal Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.590963</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.590963</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Noise has been proven to have a beneficial role in non-linear systems, including the human brain, based on the stochastic resonance (SR) theory. Several studies have been implemented on single-modal SR. Cross-modal SR phenomenon has been confirmed in different human sensory systems. In our study, a cross-modal SR enhanced brain–computer interface (BCI) was proposed by applying auditory noise to visual stimuli. Fast Fourier transform and canonical correlation analysis methods were used to evaluate the influence of noise, results of which indicated that a moderate amount of auditory noise could enhance periodic components in visual responses. Directed transfer function was applied to investigate the functional connectivity patterns, and the flow gain value was used to measure the degree of activation of specific brain regions in the information transmission process. The results of flow gain maps showed that moderate intensity of auditory noise activated the brain area to a greater extent. Further analysis by weighted phase-lag index (wPLI) revealed that the phase synchronization between visual and auditory regions under auditory noise was significantly enhanced. Our study confirms the existence of cross-modal SR between visual and auditory regions and achieves a higher accuracy for recognition, along with shorter time window length. Such findings can be used to improve the performance of visual BCIs to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Case Report: Concurrent Resistance and Aerobic Training Regulate Adiponectin Expression and Disease Severity in Multiple Sclerosis: A Case Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.567302</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adapted exercise is an effective non-pharmacological tool to improve functional, cognitive, and psychological parameters in multiple sclerosis (MS), in association with increased quality of life (QoL) and decreased disease severity. Adipose tissue, through the production of different adipokines, is involved in regulating energy metabolism and inflammation. Adiponectin, increased in MS, circulates as oligomers of low (LMW), medium (MMW), and high molecular weight (HMW), the latter mediating the main biological effects. The aim of study was to evaluate the effects of 4 months training at moderate intensity [65% heart rate reserve (HRR)] on BMI, adiponectin, and QoL in a volunteer with secondary progressive MS. The parameters were evaluated before (T0), after 4 months training (T1), and 6 months after the end of training (T2); total serum adiponectin and its oligomeric profile were evaluated. We found a reduction in BMI (−0.9%) and FAT (−2.6%), an improvement in perceived QoL and a reduced expression of total adiponectin and HMW oligomers together with decreased MS disability level at T1 measured by EDSS. Despite the limitations of a case study, this represent a starting point to understand the influence of exercise in MS and the relationship with adiponectin expression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Semi-Automated and Direct Localization and Labeling of EEG Electrodes Using MR Structural Images for Simultaneous fMRI-EEG</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.558981</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.558981</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) source reconstruction estimates spatial information from the brain’s electrical activity acquired using EEG. This method requires accurate identification of the EEG electrodes in a three-dimensional (3D) space and involves spatial localization and labeling of EEG electrodes. Here, we propose a new approach to tackle this two-step problem based on the simultaneous acquisition of EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For the step of spatial localization of electrodes, we extract the electrode coordinates from the curvature of the protrusions formed in the high-resolution T1-weighted brain scans. In the next step, we assign labels to each electrode based on the distinguishing feature of the electrode’s distance profile in relation to other electrodes. We then compare the subject’s electrode data with template-based models of prelabeled distance profiles of correctly labeled subjects. Based on this approach, we could localize EEG electrodes in 26 head models with over 90% accuracy in the 3D localization of electrodes. Next, we performed electrode labeling of the subjects’ data with progressive improvements in accuracy: with ∼58% accuracy based on a single EEG-template, with ∼71% accuracy based on 3 EEG-templates, and with ∼76% accuracy using 5 EEG-templates. The proposed semi-automated method provides a simple alternative for the rapid localization and labeling of electrodes without the requirement of any additional equipment than what is already used in an EEG-fMRI setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Voluntary and Involuntary Attention in Bistable Visual Perception: A MEG Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.597895</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.597895</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, voluntary and involuntary visual attention focused on different interpretations of a bistable image, were investigated using magnetoencephalography (MEG). A Necker cube with sinusoidally modulated pixels' intensity in the front and rear faces with frequencies 6.67 Hz (60/9) and 8.57 Hz (60/7), respectively, was presented to 12 healthy volunteers, who interpreted the cube as either left- or right-oriented. The tags of these frequencies and their second harmonics were identified in the average Fourier spectra of the MEG data recorded from the visual cortex. In the first part of the experiment, the subjects were asked to voluntarily control their attention by interpreting the cube orientation as either being on the left or right. Accordingly, we observed the dominance of the corresponding spectral component, and voluntary attention performance was measured. In the second part of the experiment, the subjects were asked to focus their gaze on a red marker at the center of the cube image without putting forth effort in its interpretation. The alternation of the dominant spectral energies at the second harmonics of the stimulation frequencies was treated as changes in the cube orientation. Based on the results of the first experimental stage and using a wavelet analysis, we developed a method which allowed us to identify the currently perceived cube orientation. Finally, we characterized involuntary attention using the distribution of dominance times when focusing attention on one of the cube orientations, which was related to voluntary attention performance and brain noise. In particular, we confirmed our hypothesis that higher attention performance is associated with stronger brain noise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Evidence for [Coronal] Underspecification in Typical and Atypical Phonological Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.580697</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.580697</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL) theory predicts that [coronal] is the language universal default place of articulation for phonemes. This assumption has been consistently supported with adult behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) data; however, this underspecification claim has not been tested in developmental populations. The purpose of this study was to determine whether children demonstrate [coronal] underspecification patterns similar to those of adults. Two English consonants differing in place of articulation, [labial] /b/ and [coronal] /d/, were presented to 24 children (ages 4–6 years) characterized by either a typically developing phonological system (TD) or a phonological disorder (PD). Two syllables, /bɑ/ and /dɑ/, were presented in an ERP oddball paradigm where both syllables served as the standard and deviant stimulus in opposite stimulus sets. Underspecification was examined with three analyses: traditional mean amplitude measurements, cluster-based permutation tests, and single-trial general linear model (GLM) analyses of single-subject data. Contrary to previous adult findings, children with PD demonstrated a large positive mismatch response (PMR) to /bɑ/ while the children with TD exhibited a negative mismatch response (MMN); significant group differences were not observed in the /dɑ/ responses. Moreover, the /bɑ/ deviant ERP response was significantly larger in the TD children than in the children with PD. At the single-subject level, more children demonstrated mismatch responses to /dɑ/ than to /bɑ/, though some children had a /bɑ/ mismatch response and no /dɑ/ mismatch response. While both groups of children demonstrated similar responses to the underspecified /dɑ/, their neural responses to the more specified /bɑ/ varied. These findings are interpreted within a proposed developmental model of phonological underspecification, wherein children with PD are functioning at a developmentally less mature stage of phonological acquisition than their same-aged TD peers. Thus, phonological underspecification is a phenomenon that likely develops over time with experience and exposure to language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Experiments in animal models have shown that running increases neuronal activity in early visual areas in light as well as in darkness. This suggests that visual processing is influenced by locomotion independent of visual input. Combining mobile electroencephalography, motion- and eye-tracking, we investigated the influence of overground free walking on cortical alpha activity (~10 Hz) and eye movements in healthy humans. Alpha activity has been considered a valuable marker of inhibition of sensory processing and shown to negatively correlate with neuronal firing rates. We found that walking led to a decrease in alpha activity over occipital cortex compared to standing. This decrease was present during walking in darkness as well as during light. Importantly, eye movements could not explain the change in alpha activity. Nevertheless, we found that walking and eye related movements were linked. While the blink rate increased with increasing walking speed independent of light or darkness, saccade rate was only significantly linked to walking speed in the light. Pupil size, on the other hand, was larger during darkness than during light, but only showed a modulation by walking in darkness. Analyzing the effect of walking with respect to the stride cycle, we further found that blinks and saccades preferentially occurred during the double support phase of walking. Alpha power, as shown previously, was lower during the swing phase than during the double support phase. We however could exclude the possibility that the alpha modulation was introduced by a walking movement induced change in electrode impedance. Overall, our work indicates that the human visual system is influenced by the current locomotion state of the body. This influence affects eye movement pattern as well as neuronal activity in sensory areas and might form part of an implicit strategy to optimally extract sensory information during locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Will We Ever Have Conscious Machines?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The question of whether artificial beings or machines could become self-aware or conscious has been a philosophical question for centuries. The main problem is that self-awareness cannot be observed from an outside perspective and the distinction of being really self-aware or merely a clever imitation cannot be answered without access to knowledge about the mechanism's inner workings. We investigate common machine learning approaches with respect to their potential ability to become self-aware. We realize that many important algorithmic steps toward machines with a core consciousness have already been taken.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cellular and Synaptic Mechanisms That Differentiate Mitral Cells and Superficial Tufted Cells Into Parallel Output Channels in the Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.614377</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A common feature of the primary processing structures of sensory systems is the presence of parallel output “channels” that convey different information about a stimulus. In the mammalian olfactory bulb, this is reflected in the mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs) that have differing sensitivities to odors, with TCs being more sensitive than MCs. In this study, we examined potential mechanisms underlying the different responses of MCs vs. TCs. For TCs, we focused on superficial TCs (sTCs), which are a population of output TCs that reside in the superficial-most portion of the external plexiform layer, along with external tufted cells (eTCs), which are glutamatergic interneurons in the glomerular layer. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in mouse bulb slices, we first measured excitatory currents in MCs, sTCs, and eTCs following olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) stimulation, separating the responses into a fast, monosynaptic component reflecting direct inputs from OSNs and a prolonged component partially reflecting eTC-mediated feedforward excitation. Responses were measured to a wide range of OSN stimulation intensities, simulating the different levels of OSN activity that would be expected to be produced by varying odor concentrations in vivo. Over a range of stimulation intensities, we found that the monosynaptic current varied significantly between the cell types, in the order of eTC &amp;gt; sTC &amp;gt; MC. The prolonged component was smaller in sTCs vs. both MCs and eTCs. sTCs also had much higher whole-cell input resistances than MCs, reflecting their smaller size and greater membrane resistivity. To evaluate how these different electrophysiological aspects contributed to spiking of the output MCs and sTCs, we used computational modeling. By exchanging the different cell properties in our modeled MCs and sTCs, we could evaluate each property's contribution to spiking differences between these cell types. This analysis suggested that the higher sensitivity of spiking in sTCs vs. MCs reflected both their larger monosynaptic OSN signal as well as their higher input resistance, while their smaller prolonged currents had a modest opposing effect. Taken together, our results indicate that both synaptic and intrinsic cellular features contribute to the production of parallel output channels in the olfactory bulb.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Long Non-coding RNA LINC00320 Inhibits Tumorigenicity of Glioma Cells and Angiogenesis Through Downregulation of NFKB1-Mediated AQP9</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.542552</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The inhibitory effect of long intergenic non-coding RNA 00320 (LINC00320) in glioma cell proliferation has been proposed in a recent study. However, the mechanisms by which LINC00320 regulate aquaporin 9 (AQP9) in glioma require further exploration. Hence, this study aims to investigate effects of LINC00320 on tumorigenicity of glioma cells and angiogenesis of microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs). Expression of LINC00320 and AQP9 in glioma tissues and cells was measured by reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The relationship among LINC00320, nuclear factor κB subunit 1 (NFKB1) and AQP9 was examined by RNA immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase reporter gene, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The participation of LINC00320 and AQP9 in glioma cell proliferation and MVEC angiogenesis was analyzed using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Finally, a nude mouse orthotopic xenograft model of glioma was established to investigate the effects of LINC00320 and AQP9 on glioma growth in vivo. LINC00320 was under-expressed and AQP9 was over-expressed in glioma tissues. Further mechanistic investigation showed that LINC00320 downregulated AQP9 by inhibiting the recruitment of NFKB1 to the promoter region of AQP9. LINC00320 overexpression or AQP9 silencing inhibited the proliferation of glioma cells and angiogenesis of MVECs. Also, upregulation of LINC00320 restrained tumor growth and angiogenesis in xenograft mice by downregulating AQP9. Taken together, LINC00320 acts as a tumor suppressor in glioma, thus presenting a novel therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Dual-Task Training Affect Cognitive and Physical Performances and Brain Oscillation Ratio of Patients With Alzheimer’s Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.605317</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the effect of 12 weeks of dual-task training on cognitive status, physical performance, and brain oscillation of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Twenty-six AD patients were randomly assigned to two groups, the training group (TG) and control group (CG). TG executed progressive combined exercises with visual stimulation twice a week for 12 weeks. Training included muscle endurance, balance, flexibility, and aerobic exercises with eyes closed and opened. Brain oscillation on electroencephalography (EEG) and a series of physical, cognitive, and mental tests were taken before and post-intervention. There was a significant improvement after training protocol in cognitive function, particularly in short-term and working memory, attention, and executive function (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Besides, there were substantial improvements in depression status (GDS scale), aerobic fitness (6 min walking), flexibility (chair sit and reach) functional ability (chair stand, timed up and go test), strength (knee extensions, preacher biceps curl, handgrip) in TG compared to CG. These signs of progress were associated with a significant increase (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in the frequency of brain oscillation and a decrease in the theta/alpha ratio. In addition to physical performance, the regular combined training with visual stimulation improves brain health as indicated by improving cognitive function and reducing the theta/alpha ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) https://www.irct.ir/, identifier IRCT20190504043468N1—August 5, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Neuroprotective Effect of Irisin in Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.588958</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Irisin is a PGC-1α-dependent myokine that causes increased energy expenditure by driving the development of white adipose tissue into brown fat-like tissue. Exercise can improve irisin levels and lead to its release into the blood. In ischemic stroke, neurons are always sensitive to energy supply; after a series of pathophysiological processes, reactive oxygen species that are detrimental to cell survival via mitochondrial dysfunction are generated in large quantities. As a protein associated with exercise, irisin can alleviate brain injury in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. It is thought that irisin can upregulate the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which protects nerve cells from injury during ischemic stroke. Furthermore, the release of irisin into the blood via exercise influences the mitochondrial dynamics crucial to maintaining the normal function of nerve cells. Consequently, we intended to summarize the known effects of irisin during ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: A structure of substrate-bound Synaptojanin1 provides new insights in its mechanism and the effect of disease mutations</title>

	<description>Synaptojanin1 (Synj1) is a phosphoinositide phosphatase, important in clathrin uncoating during endocytosis of presynaptic vesicles. It was identified as a potential drug target for Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome and TBC1D24-associated epilepsy, while also loss-of-function mutations in Synj1 are associated with epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. Despite its involvement in a range of disorders, structural and detailed mechanistic information regarding the enzyme is lacking. Here, we report the crystal structure of the 5-phosphatase domain of Synj1. Moreover, we also present a structure of this domain bound to the substrate diC8-PI(3,4,5)P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, providing the first image of a 5-phosphatase with a trapped substrate in its active site. Together with an analysis of the contribution of the different inositide phosphate groups to catalysis, these structures provide new insights in the Synj1 mechanism. Finally, we analyzed the effect of three clinical missense mutations (Y793C, R800C, Y849C) on catalysis, unveiling the molecular mechanisms underlying Synj1-associated disease.</description>

	<title>eLife: In vitro reconstitution of dynamically interacting integral membrane subunits of energy-coupling factor transporters</title>

	<description>Energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters mediate import of micronutrients in prokaryotes. They consist of an integral membrane S-component (that binds substrate) and ECF module (that powers transport by ATP hydrolysis). It has been proposed that different S-components compete for docking onto the same ECF module, but a minimal liposome-reconstituted system, required to substantiate this idea, is lacking. Here, we co-reconstituted ECF transporters for folate (ECF-FolT2) and pantothenate (ECF-PanT) into proteoliposomes, and assayed for crosstalk during active transport. The kinetics of transport showed that exchange of S-components is part of the transport mechanism. Competition experiments suggest much slower substrate association with FolT2 than with PanT. Comparison of a crystal structure of ECF-PanT with previously determined structures of ECF-FolT2 revealed larger conformational changes upon binding of folate than pantothenate, which could explain the kinetic differences. Our work shows that a minimal in vitro system with two reconstituted transporters recapitulates intricate kinetics behaviour observed in vivo.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63265</link>
	<description>Cell proliferation and quiescence are intimately coordinated during metazoan development. Here, we adapt a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) sensor to uncouple these key events of the cell cycle in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; and zebrafish through live-cell imaging. The CDK sensor consists of a fluorescently tagged CDK substrate that steadily translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to increasing CDK activity and consequent sensor phosphorylation. We show that the CDK sensor can distinguish cycling cells in G1 from quiescent cells in G0, revealing a possible commitment point and a cryptic stochasticity in an otherwise invariant &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;cell lineage. Finally, we derive a predictive model of future proliferation behavior in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; based on a snapshot of CDK activity in newly born cells. Thus, we introduce a live-cell imaging tool to facilitate &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies of cell cycle control in a wide-range of developmental contexts.</description>

	<title>eLife: Individual differences in honey bee behavior enabled by plasticity in brain gene regulatory networks</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62850</link>
	<description>Understanding the regulatory architecture of phenotypic variation is a fundamental goal in biology, but connections between gene regulatory network (GRN) activity and individual differences in behavior are poorly understood. We characterized the molecular basis of behavioral plasticity in queenless honey bee (&lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt;) colonies, where individuals engage in both reproductive and non-reproductive behaviors. Using high-throughput behavioral tracking, we discovered these colonies contain a continuum of phenotypes, with some individuals specialized for either egg-laying or foraging and ‘generalists’ that perform both. Brain gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles were correlated with behavioral variation, with generalists intermediate in behavior and molecular profiles. Models of brain GRNs constructed for individuals revealed that transcription factor (TF) activity was highly predictive of behavior, and behavior-associated regulatory regions had more TF motifs. These results provide new insights into the important role played by brain GRN plasticity in the regulation of behavior, with implications for social evolution.</description>

	<title>eLife: Phylogenomics of white-eyes, a 'great speciator', reveals Indonesian archipelago as the center of lineage diversity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.62765</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62765</link>
	<description>Archipelagoes serve as important 'natural laboratories' which facilitate the study of island radiations and contribute to the understanding of evolutionary processes. The white-eye genus &lt;i&gt;Zosterops &lt;/i&gt;is a classical example of a 'great speciator', comprising c. 100 species from across the Old World, most of them insular. We achieved an extensive geographic DNA sampling of &lt;i&gt;Zosterops &lt;/i&gt;by using historical specimens and recently collected samples. Using over 700 genome-wide loci in conjunction with coalescent species tree methods and gene flow detection approaches, we untangled the reticulated evolutionary history of &lt;i&gt;Zosterops&lt;/i&gt;, which comprises three main clades centered in Indo-Africa, Asia, and Australasia, respectively. Genetic introgression between species permeates the &lt;i&gt;Zosterops&lt;/i&gt; phylogeny, regardless of how distantly related species are. Crucially, we identified the Indonesian archipelago, and specifically Borneo, as the major centre of diversity and the only area where all three main clades overlap, attesting to the evolutionary importance of this region.</description>

	<title>eLife: Impaired adaptation of learning to contingency volatility in internalizing psychopathology</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61387</link>
	<description>Using a contingency volatility manipulation, we tested the hypothesis that difficulty adapting probabilistic decision-making to second-order uncertainty might reflect a core deficit that cuts across anxiety and depression and holds regardless of whether outcomes are aversive or involve reward gain or loss. We used bifactor modeling of internalizing symptoms to separate symptom variance common to both anxiety and depression from that unique to each. Across two experiments, we modeled performance on a probabilistic decision-making under volatility task using a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Elevated scores on the common internalizing factor, with high loadings across anxiety and depression items, were linked to impoverished adjustment of learning to volatility regardless of whether outcomes involved reward gain, electrical stimulation, or reward loss. In particular, high common factor scores were linked to dampened learning following better-than-expected outcomes in volatile environments. No such relationships were observed for anxiety- or depression-specific symptom factors.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60987</link>
	<description>Essential, conserved cellular processes depend not only on essential, strictly conserved proteins but also on essential proteins that evolve rapidly. To probe this poorly understood paradox, we exploited the rapidly evolving &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; telomere-binding protein, &lt;i&gt;cav&lt;/i&gt;/HOAP, which protects chromosomes from lethal end-to-end fusions. We replaced the &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; HOAP with a highly diverged version from its close relative, &lt;i&gt;D. yakuba&lt;/i&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;yakuba&lt;/i&gt; HOAP ('HOAP[yak]') localizes to &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; telomeres and protects &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; chromosomes from fusions. However, HOAP[yak] fails to rescue a previously uncharacterized HOAP function: silencing of the specialized telomeric retrotransposons that, instead of telomerase, maintain chromosome length in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila.&lt;/i&gt; Whole genome sequencing and cytogenetics of experimentally evolved populations revealed that HOAP[yak] triggers telomeric retrotransposon proliferation, resulting in aberrantly long telomeres. This evolution-generated, separation-of-function allele resolves the paradoxical observation that a fast-evolving essential gene directs an essential, strictly conserved function: telomeric retrotransposon containment, not end-protection, requires evolutionary innovation at HOAP.</description>

	<title>eLife: SUMOylation contributes to proteostasis of the chloroplast protein import receptor TOC159 during early development</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60968</link>
	<description>Chloroplast biogenesis describes the transition of non-photosynthetic proplastids to photosynthetically active chloroplasts in the cells of germinating seeds. Chloroplast biogenesis requires the import of thousands of nuclear-encoded preproteins by essential import receptor TOC159. We demonstrate that the SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-related Modifier) pathway crosstalks with the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to affect TOC159 stability during early plant development. We identified a SUMO3-interacting motif (SIM) in the TOC159 GTPase domain and a SUMO3 covalent SUMOylation site in the membrane domain. A single K to R substitution (K1370R) in the M-domain disables SUMOylation. Compared to wild type TOC159, TOC159K1370R was destabilized under UPS-inducing stress conditions. However, TOC159K1370R recovered to same protein level as wild type TOC159 in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor. Thus, SUMOylation partially stabilizes TOC159 against UPS-dependent degradation under stress conditions. Our data contribute to the evolving model of tightly controlled proteostasis of the TOC159 import receptor during proplastid to chloroplast transition.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60107</link>
	<description>A key challenge in human genetics is to understand the geographic distribution of human genetic variation. Often genetic variation is described by showing relationships among populations or individuals, drawing inferences over many variants. Here, we introduce an alternative representation of genetic variation that reveals the relative abundance of different allele frequency patterns. This approach allows viewers to easily see several features of human genetic structure: (1) most variants are rare and geographically localized, (2) variants that are common in a single geographic region are more likely to be shared across the globe than to be private to that region, and (3) where two individuals differ, it is most often due to variants that are found globally, regardless of whether the individuals are from the same region or different regions. Our variant-centric visualization clarifies the geographic patterns of human variation and can help address misconceptions about genetic differentiation among populations.</description>

	<title>eLife: Molecular rationale for antibody-mediated targeting of the hantavirus fusion glycoprotein</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58242</link>
	<description>The intricate lattice of Gn and Gc glycoprotein spike complexes on the hantavirus envelope facilitates host-cell entry and is the primary target of the neutralizing antibody-mediated immune response. Through study of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody termed mAb P-4G2, which neutralizes the zoonotic pathogen Puumala virus (PUUV), we provide a molecular-level basis for antibody-mediated targeting of the hantaviral glycoprotein lattice. Crystallographic analysis demonstrates that P-4G2 binds to a multi-domain site on PUUV Gc and may preclude fusogenic rearrangements of the glycoprotein that are required for host-cell entry. Furthermore, cryo-electron microscopy of PUUV-like particles in the presence of P-4G2 reveals a lattice-independent configuration of the Gc, demonstrating that P-4G2 perturbs the (Gn-Gc)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; lattice. This work provides a structure-based blueprint for rationalizing antibody-mediated targeting of hantaviruses.</description>

	<description>Cerebral cortical architecture at birth encodes regionally differential dendritic arborization and synaptic formation. It underlies behavioral emergence of 2-year-olds. Brain changes in 0–2 years are most dynamic across the lifespan. Effective prediction of future behavior with brain microstructure at birth will reveal structural basis of behavioral emergence in typical development and identify biomarkers for early detection and tailored intervention in atypical development. Here we aimed to evaluate the neonate whole-brain cortical microstructure quantified by diffusion MRI for predicting future behavior. We found that individual cognitive and language functions assessed at the age of 2 years were robustly predicted by neonate cortical microstructure using support vector regression. Remarkably, cortical regions contributing heavily to the prediction models exhibited distinctive functional selectivity for cognition and language. These findings highlight regional cortical microstructure at birth as a potential sensitive biomarker in predicting future neurodevelopmental outcomes and identifying individual risks of brain disorders.</description>

	<title>eLife: Neuronal hyperexcitability is a DLK-dependent trigger of Herpes Simplex Virus reactivation that can be induced by IL-1</title>

	<description>Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) establishes a latent infection in neurons and periodically reactivates to cause disease. The stimuli that trigger HSV-1 reactivation have not been fully elucidated. We demonstrate HSV-1 reactivation from latently infected mouse neurons induced by forskolin requires neuronal excitation. Stimuli that directly induce neurons to become hyperexcitable also induced HSV-1 reactivation. Forskolin-induced reactivation was dependent on the neuronal pathway of DLK/JNK activation and included an initial wave of viral gene expression that was independent of histone demethylase activity and linked to histone phosphorylation. IL-1β is released under conditions of stress, fever and UV exposure of the epidermis; all known triggers of clinical HSV reactivation. We found that IL-1β induced histone phosphorylation and increased the excitation in sympathetic neurons. Importantly, IL-1β triggered HSV-1 reactivation, which was dependent on DLK and neuronal excitability. Thus, HSV-1 co-opts an innate immune pathway resulting from IL-1 stimulation of neurons to induce reactivation.</description>

	<title>eLife: KDM5A mutations identified in autism spectrum disorder using forward genetics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56883</guid>

	<description>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a constellation of neurodevelopmental disorders with high phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, complicating the discovery of causative genes. Through a forward genetics approach selecting for defective vocalization in mice, we identified &lt;i&gt;Kdm5a&lt;/i&gt; as a candidate ASD gene. To validate our discovery, we generated a &lt;i&gt;Kdm5a&lt;/i&gt; knockout mouse model (&lt;i&gt;Kdm5a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;) and confirmed that inactivating &lt;i&gt;Kdm5a&lt;/i&gt; disrupts vocalization. In addition, &lt;i&gt;Kdm5a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice displayed repetitive behaviors, sociability deficits, cognitive dysfunction, and abnormal dendritic morphogenesis. Loss of KDM5A also resulted in dysregulation of the hippocampal transcriptome. To determine if &lt;i&gt;KDM5A&lt;/i&gt; mutations cause ASD in humans, we screened whole exome sequencing and microarray data from a clinical cohort. We identified pathogenic &lt;i&gt;KDM5A&lt;/i&gt; variants in nine patients with ASD and lack of speech. Our findings illustrate the power and efficacy of forward genetics in identifying ASD genes and highlight the importance of KDM5A in normal brain development and function.</description>

	<title>eLife: Hippocampal low-frequency stimulation prevents seizure generation in a mouse model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy</title>

	<description>Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common form of focal, pharmacoresistant epilepsy in adults and is often associated with hippocampal sclerosis. Here, we established the efficacy of optogenetic and electrical low-frequency stimulation (LFS) in interfering with seizure generation in a mouse model of MTLE. Specifically, we applied LFS in the sclerotic hippocampus to study the effects on spontaneous subclinical and evoked generalized seizures. We found that stimulation at 1 Hz for one hour resulted in an almost complete suppression of spontaneous seizures in both hippocampi. This seizure-suppressive action during daily stimulation remained stable over several weeks. Furthermore, LFS for 30 min before a pro-convulsive stimulus successfully prevented seizure generalization. Finally, acute slice experiments revealed a reduced efficacy of perforant path transmission onto granule cells upon LFS. Taken together, our results suggest that hippocampal LFS constitutes a promising approach for seizure control in MTLE.</description>

	<title>eLife: MS-275, a class 1 histone deacetylase inhibitor augments glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonism to improve glycemic control and reduce obesity in diet-induced obese mice</title>

	<description>Given its glycemic efficacy and ability to reduce the body weight, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonism has emerged as a preferred treatment for diabetes associated with obesity. We here report that a small-molecule Class 1 histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Entinostat (MS-275) enhances GLP-1R agonism to potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and decrease body weight in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. MS-275 is not an agonist or allosteric activator of GLP-1R but enhances the sustained receptor-mediated signaling through the modulation of the expression of proteins involved in the signaling pathway. MS-275 and liraglutide combined therapy improved fasting glycemia upon short-term treatment and a chronic administration causes a reduction of obesity in DIO mice. Overall, our results emphasize the therapeutic potential of MS-275 as an adjunct to GLP-1R therapy in the treatment of diabetes and obesity.</description>

	<description>Learning to detect, identify or select stimuli is an essential requirement of many behavioral tasks. In real life situations, relevant and non-relevant stimuli are often embedded in a continuous sensory stream, presumably represented by different segments of neural activity. Here, we introduce a neural circuit model that can learn to identify action-relevant stimuli embedded in a spatio-temporal stream of spike trains, while learning to ignore stimuli that are not behaviorally relevant. The model uses a biologically plausible plasticity rule and learns from the reinforcement of correct decisions taken at the right time. Learning is fully online; it is successful for a wide spectrum of stimulus-encoding strategies; it scales well with population size; and can segment cortical spike patterns recorded from behaving animals. Altogether, these results provide a biologically plausible theory of reinforcement learning in the absence of prior information on the relevance and timing of input stimuli.</description>

	<description>Evidence from functional neuroimaging studies support neural differences between the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) presentation types. It remains unclear if these neural deficits also manifest at the structural level.  We have previously shown that the ADHD combined, and ADHD inattentive types demonstrate differences in graph properties of structural covariance suggesting an underlying difference in neuroanatomical organization. The goal of this study was to examine and validate white matter brain organization between the two subtypes using both scalar and connectivity measures of brain white matter. We used both tract-based spatial statistical (TBSS) and tractography analyses with network-based Statistics (NBS) and graph-theoretical analyses in a cohort of 35 ADHD participants (aged 8-17 years) defined using DSM-IV criteria as combined (ADHD-C) type (n=19) or as predominantly inattentive (ADHD-I) type (n=16), and 28 matched neurotypical controls. We performed TBSS analyses on scalar measures of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), radial (RD), and axial (AD) diffusivity to assess differences in WM between ADHD types and controls. NBS and graph theoretical analysis of whole brain inter-regional tractography examined connectomic differences and brain network organization, respectively. None of the scalar measures significantly differed between ADHD types or relative to controls.  Similarly, there were no tractography connectivity differences between the two subtypes and relative to controls using NBS. Global and regional graph measures were also similar between the groups. A single significant finding was observed for nodal degree between the ADHD-C and controls, in the right insula (corrected p=.029). Our result of no white matter differences between the subtypes is consistent with most previous findings. These findings together might suggest that the white matter structural architecture is largely similar between the DSM-based ADHD presentations.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Neuroplasticity in NMDA receptor signaling in subregions of the rat rostral ventrolateral medulla following sedentary versus physically active conditions</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroplasticity in NMDA receptor signaling in subregions of the rat rostral ventrolateral medulla following sedentary versus physically active conditions&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/de5eed8f-c429-4113-8100-90ee7105f957/cne25094-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms by which the brain undergoes neuroplasticity during sedentary versus active conditions are important in understanding how a sedentary lifestyle has become the leading cause of death due to modifiable risk factors. Neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) regulate ongoing sympathetic vasoconstriction and cardiac function under normal conditions, and their activity appears heightened in models of cardiovascular disease associated with sympathetic overactivity. The current study provides evidence of activity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM via increased glutamate levels and increased expression of NMDA receptors in the RVLM of sedentary compared to active rats. These mechanisms produce a complex framework by which RVLM neurons increase their influence on sympathoexcitation in sedentary compared to physically active conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is a brain region involved in normal regulation of the cardiovascular system and heightened sympathoexcitatory states of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among major risk factors for CVD, sedentary lifestyles contribute to higher mortality than other modifiable risk factors. Previous studies suggest excessive glutamatergic excitation of presympathetic neurons in the RVLM occurs in sedentary animals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine neuroplasticity in the glutamatergic system in the RVLM of sedentary and physically active rats. We hypothesized that relative to active rats, sedentary rats would exhibit higher expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunits (GluN), phosphoGluN1 and the excitatory scaffold protein PSD95, while achieving higher glutamate levels. Male Sprague‐Dawley rats (4 wks old) were divided into sedentary and active (running wheel) conditions for 10‐12 weeks. We used retrograde tracing/triple‐labeling techniques; western blotting; and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We report in sedentary versus physically active rats: 1) fewer bulbospinal non‐C1 neurons positive for GluN1, 2) significantly higher expression of GluN1 and GluN2B but lower levels of phosphoGluN1 (pSer896) and PSD95 and 3) higher levels of glutamate in the RVLM. Higher GluN expression is consistent with enhanced sympathoexcitation in sedentary animals; however, a more complex neuroplasticity occurs within subregions of the ventrolateral medulla. Our results in rodents may also indicate that alterations in glutamatergic excitation of the RVLM contribute to the increased incidence of CVD in humans who lead sedentary lifestyles. Thus, there is a strong need to further pursue mechanisms of inactivity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Predictors of long‐term outcome of subthalamic stimulation in Parkinson disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25994?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25994?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify preoperative predictive factors of long‐term motor outcome in a large cohort of consecutive Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN‐DBS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All consecutive PD patients who underwent bilateral STN‐DBS at the Grenoble University Hospital (France) from 1993 to 2015 were evaluated before surgery, at 1 year (short‐term) and in the long‐term after surgery. All demographic variables, neuroimaging data and clinical characteristics available were collected. Preoperative predictors of long‐term motor outcome were investigated by performing survival and univariate/multivariate Cox regression analyses. Loss of motor benefit from stimulation in the long‐term was defined as a reduction lower than 25% of the Movement Disorder Society‐UPDRS (MDS‐UPDRS) part‐III scores compared to the baseline off‐medication scores. As secondary objective, potential predictors of short‐term motor outcome after STN‐DBS were assessed by performing univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long‐term analyses (mean follow‐up: 8.4 ± 6.26 years; median: 10 years, 1–17 range), 138 patients were included. Preoperative higher Frontal Score and off‐medication MDS‐UDPRS part‐III scores predicted a better long‐term motor response to stimulation whereas the presence of vascular changes on neuroimaging predicted a worse motor outcome. In 357 patients available with 1‐year follow‐up, preoperative levodopa response, tremor dominant phenotype, baseline Frontal Score and off‐medication MDS‐UPDRS part‐III scores predicted the short‐term motor outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontal lobe dysfunction, disease severity in the off‐medication condition and the presence of vascular changes on neuroimaging represent the main preoperative clinical predictors of long‐term motor STN‐DBS effects.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synapse loss is the strongest correlate for cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms underlying synapse loss have been extensively investigated using mouse models expressing genes with human familial Alzheimer's disease mutations. In this review, we summarize how multiphoton in vivo imaging has improved our understanding of synapse loss mechanisms associated with excessive amyloid in the living animal brain. We also discuss evidence obtained from these imaging studies for the role of cell-intrinsic calcium dyshomeostasis and cell-extrinsic activities of microglia, which are the immune cells of the brain, in mediating synapse loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Tuberculosis disease is a major global public health concern and the growing prevalence of drug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; is making disease control more difficult. However, the increasing application of whole-genome sequencing as a diagnostic tool is leading to the profiling of drug resistance to inform clinical practice and treatment decision making. Computational approaches for identifying established and novel resistance-conferring mutations in genomic data include genome-wide association study (GWAS) methodologies, tests for convergent evolution and machine learning techniques. These methods may be confounded by extensive co-occurrent resistance, where statistical models for a drug include unrelated mutations known to be causing resistance to other drugs. Here, we introduce a novel ‘cannibalistic’ elimination algorithm (“Hungry, Hungry SNPos”) that attempts to remove these co-occurrent resistant variants. Using an &lt;i&gt;M. tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; genomic dataset for the virulent Beijing strain-type (n = 3,574) with phenotypic resistance data across five drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin), we demonstrate that this new approach is considerably more robust than traditional methods and detects resistance-associated variants too rare to be likely picked up by correlation-based techniques like GWAS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/okdPb6yDxS8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In this work, we introduce new phenomenological neuronal models (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;LIF and mAdExp) that account for energy supply and demand in the cell as well as the inactivation of spike generation how these interact with subthreshold and spiking dynamics. Including these constraints, the new models reproduce a broad range of biologically-relevant behaviors that are identified to be crucial in many neurological disorders, but were not captured by commonly used phenomenological models. Because of their low dimensionality &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;LIF and mAdExp open the possibility of future large-scale simulations for more realistic studies of brain circuits involved in neuronal disorders. The new models enable both more accurate modeling and the possibility to study energy-associated disorders over the whole time-course of disease progression instead of only comparing the initially healthy status with the final diseased state. These models, therefore, provide new theoretical and computational methods to assess the opportunities of early diagnostics and the potential of energy-centered approaches to improve therapies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vFKzK1Xrads&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Practical identifiability of Systems Biology models has received a lot of attention in recent scientific research. It addresses the crucial question for models’ predictability: how accurately can the models’ parameters be recovered from available experimental data. The methods based on profile likelihood are among the most reliable methods of practical identification. However, these methods are often computationally demanding or lead to inaccurate estimations of parameters’ confidence intervals. Development of methods, which can accurately produce parameters’ confidence intervals in reasonable computational time, is of utmost importance for Systems Biology and QSP modeling.
We propose an algorithm Confidence Intervals by Constraint Optimization (CICO) based on profile likelihood, designed to speed-up confidence intervals estimation and reduce computational cost. The numerical implementation of the algorithm includes settings to control the accuracy of confidence intervals estimates. The algorithm was tested on a number of Systems Biology models, including Taxol treatment model and STAT5 Dimerization model, discussed in the current article.
The CICO algorithm in a software package freely available in Julia (https://github.com/insysbio/LikelihoodProfiler.jl) and Python (https://github.com/insysbio/LikelihoodProfiler.py).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IKML73pQJqw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Simulations of tissue-specific effects of primary acute viral infections like COVID-19 are essential for understanding disease outcomes and optimizing therapies. Such simulations need to support continuous updating in response to rapid advances in understanding of infection mechanisms, and parallel development of components by multiple groups. We present an open-source platform for multiscale spatiotemporal simulation of an epithelial tissue, viral infection, cellular immune response and tissue damage, specifically designed to be modular and extensible to support continuous updating and parallel development. The base simulation of a simplified patch of epithelial tissue and immune response exhibits distinct patterns of infection dynamics from widespread infection, to recurrence, to clearance. Slower viral internalization and faster immune-cell recruitment slow infection and promote containment. Because antiviral drugs can have side effects and show reduced clinical effectiveness when given later during infection, we studied the effects on progression of treatment potency and time-of-first treatment after infection. In simulations, even a low potency therapy with a drug which reduces the replication rate of viral RNA greatly decreases the total tissue damage and virus burden when given near the beginning of infection. Many combinations of dosage and treatment time lead to stochastic outcomes, with some simulation replicas showing clearance or control (treatment success), while others show rapid infection of all epithelial cells (treatment failure). Thus, while a high potency therapy usually is less effective when given later, treatments at late times are occasionally effective. We illustrate how to extend the platform to model specific virus types (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;., hepatitis C) and add additional cellular mechanisms (tissue recovery and variable cell susceptibility to infection), using our software modules and publicly-available software repository.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VHQEs_Hqk94&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Individuals differ widely in their contribution to the spread of infection within and across populations. Three key epidemiological host traits affect infectious disease spread: susceptibility (propensity to acquire infection), infectivity (propensity to transmit infection to others) and recoverability (propensity to recover quickly). Interventions aiming to reduce disease spread may target improvement in any one of these traits, but the necessary statistical methods for obtaining risk estimates are lacking. In this paper we introduce a novel software tool called SIRE (standing for “Susceptibility, Infectivity and Recoverability Estimation”), which allows for the first time simultaneous estimation of the genetic effect of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), as well as non-genetic influences on these three unobservable host traits. SIRE implements a flexible Bayesian algorithm which accommodates a wide range of disease surveillance data comprising any combination of recorded individual infection and/or recovery times, or disease diagnostic test results. Different genetic and non-genetic regulations and data scenarios (representing realistic recording schemes) were simulated to validate SIRE and to assess their impact on the precision, accuracy and bias of parameter estimates. This analysis revealed that with few exceptions, SIRE provides unbiased, accurate parameter estimates associated with all three host traits. For most scenarios, SNP effects associated with recoverability can be estimated with highest precision, followed by susceptibility. For infectivity, many epidemics with few individuals give substantially more statistical power to identify SNP effects than the reverse. Importantly, precise estimates of SNP and other effects could be obtained even in the case of incomplete, censored and relatively infrequent measurements of individuals’ infection or survival status, albeit requiring more individuals to yield equivalent precision. SIRE represents a new tool for analysing a wide range of experimental and field disease data with the aim of discovering and validating SNPs and other factors controlling infectious disease transmission.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QjeuobbTQoc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Whether the brain operates at a critical “tipping” point is a long standing scientific question, with evidence from both cellular and systems-scale studies suggesting that the brain does sit in, or near, a critical regime. Neuroimaging studies of humans in altered states of consciousness have prompted the suggestion that maintenance of critical dynamics is necessary for the emergence of consciousness and complex cognition, and that reduced or disorganized consciousness may be associated with deviations from criticality. Unfortunately, many of the cellular-level studies reporting signs of criticality were performed in non-conscious systems (in vitro neuronal cultures) or unconscious animals (e.g. anaesthetized rats). Here we attempted to address this knowledge gap by exploring critical brain dynamics in invasive ECoG recordings from multiple sessions with a single macaque as the animal transitioned from consciousness to unconsciousness under different anaesthetics (ketamine and propofol). We use a previously-validated test of criticality: avalanche dynamics to assess the differences in brain dynamics between normal consciousness and both drug-states. Propofol and ketamine were selected due to their differential effects on consciousness (ketamine, but not propofol, is known to induce an unusual state known as “dissociative anaesthesia”). Our analyses indicate that propofol dramatically restricted the size and duration of avalanches, while ketamine allowed for more awake-like dynamics to persist. In addition, propofol, but not ketamine, triggered a large reduction in the complexity of brain dynamics. All states, however, showed some signs of persistent criticality when testing for exponent relations and universal shape-collapse. Further, maintenance of critical brain dynamics may be important for regulation and control of conscious awareness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_QTyAKQ-bYs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The broad concept of &lt;i&gt;emergence&lt;/i&gt; is instrumental in various of the most challenging open scientific questions—yet, few quantitative theories of what constitutes emergent phenomena have been proposed. This article introduces a formal theory of causal emergence in multivariate systems, which studies the relationship between the dynamics of parts of a system and macroscopic features of interest. Our theory provides a quantitative definition of &lt;i&gt;downward causation&lt;/i&gt;, and introduces a complementary modality of emergent behaviour—which we refer to as &lt;i&gt;causal decoupling&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, the theory allows practical criteria that can be efficiently calculated in large systems, making our framework applicable in a range of scenarios of practical interest. We illustrate our findings in a number of case studies, including Conway’s Game of Life, Reynolds’ flocking model, and neural activity as measured by electrocorticography.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YJdTyhyWdXI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Graph theoretical analyses of nervous systems usually omit the aspect of connection polarity, due to data insufficiency. The chemical synapse network of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; is a well-reconstructed directed network, but the signs of its connections are yet to be elucidated. Here, we present the gene expression-based sign prediction of the ionotropic chemical synapse connectome of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; (3,638 connections and 20,589 synapses total), incorporating available presynaptic neurotransmitter and postsynaptic receptor gene expression data for three major neurotransmitter systems. We made predictions for more than two-thirds of these chemical synapses and observed an excitatory-inhibitory (E:I) ratio close to 4:1 which was found similar to that observed in many real-world networks. Our open source tool (http://EleganSign.linkgroup.hu) is simple but efficient in predicting polarities by integrating neuronal connectome and gene expression data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cFTifw-3DnI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Prediction error signaling explains neuronal mismatch responses in the medial prefrontal cortex</title>

The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a key biomarker of automatic deviance detection thought to emerge from 2 cortical sources. First, the auditory cortex (AC) encodes spectral regularities and reports frequency-specific deviances. Then, more abstract representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) allow to detect contextual changes of potential behavioral relevance. However, the precise location and time asynchronies between neuronal correlates underlying this frontotemporal network remain unclear and elusive. Our study presented auditory oddball paradigms along with “no-repetition” controls to record mismatch responses in neuronal spiking activity and local field potentials at the rat medial PFC. Whereas mismatch responses in the auditory system are mainly induced by stimulus-dependent effects, we found that auditory responsiveness in the PFC was driven by unpredictability, yielding context-dependent, comparatively delayed, more robust and longer-lasting mismatch responses mostly comprised of prediction error signaling activity. This characteristically different composition discarded that mismatch responses in the PFC could be simply inherited or amplified downstream from the auditory system. Conversely, it is more plausible for the PFC to exert top-down influences on the AC, since the PFC exhibited flexible and potent predictive processing, capable of suppressing redundant input more efficiently than the AC. Remarkably, the time course of the mismatch responses we observed in the spiking activity and local field potentials of the AC and the PFC combined coincided with the time course of the large-scale MMN-like signals reported in the rat brain, thereby linking the microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic levels of automatic deviance detection.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rfwvinIx228&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019, leading to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that continues to cause significant global mortality in human populations. Given its sequence similarity to SARS-CoV, as well as related coronaviruses circulating in bats, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in Chiroptera species in China. However, whether the virus spread directly to humans or through an intermediate host is currently unclear, as is the potential for this virus to infect companion animals, livestock, and wildlife that could act as viral reservoirs. Using a combination of surrogate entry assays and live virus, we demonstrate that, in addition to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has a broad host tropism for mammalian ACE2 receptors, despite divergence in the amino acids at the Spike receptor binding site on these proteins. Of the 22 different hosts we investigated, ACE2 proteins from dog, cat, and cattle were the most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, while bat and bird ACE2 proteins were the least efficiently used receptors. The absence of a significant tropism for any of the 3 genetically distinct bat ACE2 proteins we examined indicates that SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage likely shifted during zoonotic transmission from bats into people, possibly in an intermediate reservoir. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage to the related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and RaTG13 identified distinct tropisms, with the 2 human viruses being more closely aligned. Finally, using bioinformatics, structural data, and targeted mutagenesis, we identified amino acid residues within the Spike–ACE2 interface, which may have played a pivotal role in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The apparently broad tropism of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of viral entry confirms the potential risk of infection to a wide range of companion animals, livestock, and wildlife.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/m8cpZ3EpcOg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Coevolution between transposable elements (TEs) and their hosts can be antagonistic, where TEs evolve to avoid silencing and the host responds by reestablishing TE suppression, or mutualistic, where TEs are co-opted to benefit their host. The &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; TE functions as an important component of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; telomeres but has also reportedly inserted into the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; nuclear export factor gene &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt;. We find that, rather than inserting into &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; has actually captured a portion of &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; sequence. We show that &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; produces abundant Piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs), some of which are antisense to the &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; transcript, and that the &lt;i&gt;TART&lt;/i&gt;-like region of &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; is evolving rapidly. Furthermore, in &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; is present at higher copy numbers, and &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; shows reduced expression, compared to the closely related species &lt;i&gt;Drosophila simulans&lt;/i&gt;. We propose that capturing &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; sequence allowed &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; to target the &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; gene for piRNA-mediated repression and that these 2 elements are engaged in antagonistic coevolution despite the fact that &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; is serving a critical role for its host genome.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VY2O9I8cFrM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Patterns of smallpox mortality in London, England, over three centuries</title>

Smallpox is unique among infectious diseases in the degree to which it devastated human populations, its long history of control interventions, and the fact that it has been successfully eradicated. Mortality from smallpox in London, England was carefully documented, weekly, for nearly 300 years, providing a rare and valuable source for the study of ecology and evolution of infectious disease. We describe and analyze smallpox mortality in London from 1664 to 1930. We digitized the weekly records published in the London Bills of Mortality (LBoM) and the Registrar General’s Weekly Returns (RGWRs). We annotated the resulting time series with a sequence of historical events that might have influenced smallpox dynamics in London. We present a spectral analysis that reveals how periodicities in reported smallpox mortality changed over decades and centuries; many of these changes in epidemic patterns are correlated with changes in control interventions and public health policies. We also examine how the seasonality of reported smallpox mortality changed from the 17th to 20th centuries in London.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jF09DOqV7BQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for calbindin reveals a variety regions of the ventral hippocampus within the brain of the banded mongoose. These regions include the dentate gyrus (DG), cornu Ammonis regions 3 (CA3) and 1 (CA1), the ventral subiculum (VS), presubiculum (PrS), and parasubiculum (PaS). Scale bar = 1 mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing cyto‐, myelo‐, and chemoarchitectural staining techniques, we analyzed the structure of the hippocampal formation in the banded mongoose and domestic ferret, species belonging to the two carnivoran superfamilies, which have had independent evolutionary trajectories for the past 55 million years. Our observations indicate that, despite the time since sharing a last common ancestor, these species show extensive similarities. The four major portions of the hippocampal formation (cornu Ammonis, dentate gyrus, subicular complex, and entorhinal cortex) were readily observed, contained the same internal subdivisions, and maintained the topological relationships of these subdivisions that could be considered typically mammalian. In addition, adult hippocampal neurogenesis was observed in both species, occurring at a rate similar to that observed in other mammals. Despite the overall similarities, several differences to each other, and to other mammalian species, were observed. We could not find evidence for the presence of the CA2 and CA4 fields of the cornu Ammonis region. In the banded mongoose the dentate gyrus appears to be comprised of up to seven lamina, through the sublamination of the molecular and granule cell layers, which is not observed in the domestic ferret. In addition, numerous subtle variations in chemoarchitecture between the two species were observed. These differences may contribute to an overall variation in the functionality of the hippocampal formation between the species, and in comparison to other mammalian species. These similarities and variations are important to understanding to what extent phylogenetic affinities and constraints affect potential adaptive evolutionary plasticity of the hippocampal formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Low power photomicrographs of myelin staining in the basolateral amygdala of the banded mongoose (left) and domestic ferret (right). Note the overall lower density of myelin in the domestic ferret, which may relate to either a smaller brain mass or be an effect of the domestication process. Scale bars in each image = 1 mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study provides an analysis of the cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, and chemoarchitecture of the amygdaloid body of the banded mongoose (&lt;i&gt;Mungos mungo&lt;/i&gt;) and domestic ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;). Using architectural and immunohistochemical stains, we observe that the organization of the nuclear and cortical portions of the amygdaloid complex is very similar in both species. The one major difference is the presence of a cortex‐amygdala transition zone observed in the domestic ferret that is absent in the banded mongoose. In addition, the chemoarchitecture is, for the most part, quite similar in the two species, but several variances, such as differing densities of neurons expressing the calcium‐binding proteins in specific nuclei are noted. Despite this, certain aspects of the chemoarchitecture, such as the cholinergic innervation of the magnocellular division of the basal nuclear cluster and the presence of doublecortin expressing neurons in the shell division of the accessory basal nuclear cluster, appear to be consistent features of the Eutherian mammal amygdala. The domestic ferret presented with an overall lower myelin density throughout the amygdaloid body than the banded mongoose, a feature that may reflect artificial selection in the process of domestication for increased juvenile‐like behavior in the adult domestic ferret, such as a muted fear response. The shared, but temporally distant, ancestry of the banded mongoose and domestic ferret allows us to generate observations relevant to understanding the relative influence that phylogenetic constraints, adaptive evolutionary plasticity, and the domestication process may play in the organization and chemoarchitecture of the amygdaloid body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides an analysis of the cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, and chemoarchitecture of the diencephalon (dorsal thalamus, ventral thalamus, and epithalamus) of the banded mongoose (&lt;i&gt;Mungos mungo&lt;/i&gt;) and domestic ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;). Using architectural and immunohistochemical stains, we observe that the nuclear organization of the diencephalon is very similar in the two species, and similar to that reported in other carnivores, such as the domestic cat and dog. The same complement of putatively homologous nuclei were identified in both species, with only one variance, that being the presence of the perireticular nucleus in the domestic ferret, that was not observed in the banded mongoose. The chemoarchitecture was also mostly consistent between species, although there were a number of minor variations across a range of nuclei in the density of structures expressing the calcium‐binding proteins parvalbumin, calbindin, and calretinin. Thus, despite almost 53 million years since these two species of carnivores shared a common ancestor, strong phylogenetic constraints appear to limit the potential for adaptive evolutionary plasticity within the carnivore order. Apart from the presence of the perireticular nucleus, the most notable difference between the species studied was the physical inversion of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, as well as the lateral posterior and pulvinar nuclei in the domestic ferret compared to the banded mongoose and other carnivores, although this inversion appears to be a feature of the Mustelidae family. While no functional sequelae are suggested, this inversion is likely to result from the altricial birth of Mustelidae species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Leucine rich repeat transmembrane (LRRTM) proteins are synaptic adhesion molecules with roles in synapse formation and signaling. LRRTM4 was found to reside at rod bipolar cell (BC) dendritic tips, where it colocalized with the transduction channel protein, TRPM1. LRRTM4 was not detected at dendritic tips of ON‐cone BCs. Following somatic knockout of LRRTM4 in BCs by subretinal injection and electroporation of CRISPR/Cas9, LRRTM4 was abolished or reduced in the dendritic tips of transfected cells. Knockout cells had a normal complement of TRPM1 at their dendritic tips, while GPR179 accumulation was partially reduced. In experiments with heterologously expressed protein, the extracellular domain of LRRTM4 was found to engage in heparan‐sulfate dependent binding with pikachurin. These results implicate LRRTM4 in the GPR179‐pikachurin‐dystroglycan transsynaptic complex at rod synapses.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leucine rich repeat transmembrane (LRRTM) proteins are synaptic adhesion molecules with roles in synapse formation and signaling. LRRTM4 transcripts were previously shown to be enriched in rod bipolar cells (BCs), secondary neurons of the retina that form synapses with rod photoreceptors. Using two different antibodies, LRRTM4 was found to reside primarily at rod BC dendritic tips, where it colocalized with the transduction channel protein, TRPM1. LRRTM4 was not detected at dendritic tips of ON‐cone BCs. Following somatic knockout of LRRTM4 in BCs by subretinal injection and electroporation of CRISPR/Cas9, LRRTM4 was abolished or reduced in the dendritic tips of transfected cells. Knockout cells had a normal complement of TRPM1 at their dendritic tips, while GPR179 accumulation was partially reduced. In experiments with heterologously expressed protein, the extracellular domain of LRRTM4 was found to engage in heparan‐sulfate dependent binding with pikachurin. These results implicate LRRTM4 in the GPR179‐pikachurin‐dystroglycan transsynaptic complex at rod synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Functional organization and connectivity of the dorsal column nuclei complex reveals a sensorimotor integration and distribution hub</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Functional organization and connectivity of the dorsal column nuclei complex reveals a sensorimotor integration and distribution hub&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2c67f66c-a53b-4743-90bb-e426135e03d1/cne24942-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We review the neuroanatomical connections of the dorsal column nuclei complex (gracile, cuneate, external cuneate, X and Z nuclei) which highlight the connectivity to peripheral receptors as well as extensive direct connections to multiple sensorimotor brain regions. This connectivity highlights the role of the dorsal column nuclei complex in integrating and distributing somatosensory information serving discriminative touch, proprioception, and multimodal functional systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dorsal column nuclei complex (DCN‐complex) includes the dorsal column nuclei (DCN, referring to the gracile and cuneate nuclei collectively), external cuneate, X, and Z nuclei, and the median accessory nucleus. The DCN are organized by both somatotopy and modality, and have a diverse range of afferent inputs and projection targets. The functional organization and connectivity of the DCN implicate them in a variety of sensorimotor functions, beyond their commonly accepted role in processing and transmitting somatosensory information to the thalamus, yet this is largely underappreciated in the literature. To consolidate insights into their sensorimotor functions, this review examines the morphology, organization, and connectivity of the DCN and their associated nuclei. First, we briefly discuss the receptors, afferent fibers, and pathways involved in conveying tactile and proprioceptive information to the DCN. Next, we review the modality and somatotopic arrangements of the remaining constituents of the DCN‐complex. Finally, we examine and discuss the functional implications of the myriad of DCN‐complex projection targets throughout the diencephalon, midbrain, and hindbrain, in addition to their modulatory inputs from the cortex. The organization and connectivity of the DCN‐complex suggest that these nuclei should be considered a complex integration and distribution hub for sensorimotor information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Neuroarchitecture of the central complex in the brain of the honeybee: Neuronal cell types</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24941?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroarchitecture of the central complex in the brain of the honeybee: Neuronal cell types&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6cc39c0e-d29c-4523-8192-6096012e9a19/cne24941-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central complex in the insect brain is a higher order integration center and plays an important role in spatial orientation. Honeybees are excellent models to study the neuronal basis of orientation, due to their excellent homing skills. Here we present a catalogue of neurons in the honeybee central complex.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central complex (CX) in the insect brain is a higher order integration center that controls a number of behaviors, most prominently goal directed locomotion. The CX comprises the protocerebral bridge (PB), the upper division of the central body (CBU), the lower division of the central body (CBL), and the paired noduli (NO). Although spatial orientation has been extensively studied in honeybees at the behavioral level, most electrophysiological and anatomical analyses have been carried out in other insect species, leaving the morphology and physiology of neurons that constitute the CX in the honeybee mostly enigmatic. The goal of this study was to morphologically identify neuronal cell types of the CX in the honeybee &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt;. By performing iontophoretic dye injections into the CX, we traced 16 subtypes of neuron that connect a subdivision of the CX with other regions in the bee's central brain, and eight subtypes that mainly interconnect different subdivisions of the CX. They establish extensive connections between the CX and the lateral complex, the superior protocerebrum and the posterior protocerebrum. Characterized neuron classes and subtypes are morphologically similar to those described in other insects, suggesting considerable conservation in the neural network relevant for orientation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Pigment epithelium‐derived factor (PEDF) and PEDF‐receptor in the adult mouse brain: Differential spatial/temporal localization pattern</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24940?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Pigment epithelium‐derived factor (PEDF) and PEDF‐receptor in the adult mouse brain: Differential spatial/temporal localization pattern&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5c202aad-1cc0-4bcb-9084-ce00bbbe1898/cne24940-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A schematic drawing is depicted indicating of the detection of PEDF and PEDFR proteins in the mouse brain. Representative brain coronal sections to show the principal regions where PEDF (red dots on the left brain scheme) and PEDFR (blue dots on the right brain scheme) are detected by immunohistochemical study. An equal codistribution is observed for both proteins in the Cerebellum, Hippocampus and periventricular zone. CTX‐Layer VI, Layer VI of cerebral cortex; CTX‐Layer IV–V, Layer IV and V of cerebral cortex; CTX‐Layer I‐III: Layer I, II, and III of Cerebral Cortex; Layer CA1 HYP: layer CA1 of Hippocampus; Layer CA2‐3 HIP: Layer Ca2 and CA3 of hippocampus; SM, medial septum; DBN, Banda diagonal nuclei, and CEREB‐Purk, Purkinje layer of cerebellum.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pigment epithelium‐derived factor (PEDF) is a multifunctional protein which was initially described in the retina, although it is also present in other tissues. It functions as an antioxidant agent promoting neuronal survival. Recently, a PEDF receptor has shown an elevated binding affinity for PEDF. There are no relevant data regarding the distribution of both proteins in the brain, therefore the main goal of this work was to investigate the spatiotemporal presence of PEDF and PEDFR in the adult mouse brain, and to determine the PEDF blood level in mouse and human. The localization of both proteins was analyzed by different experimental methods such as immunohistochemistry, western‐blotting, and also by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. Differential expression was found in some telencephalic structures and positive signals for both proteins were detected in the cerebellum. The magnitude of the PEDFR labeling pattern was higher than PEDF and included some cortical and subventricular areas. Age‐dependent changes in intensity of both protein immunoreactions were found in the cortical and hippocampal areas with greater reactivity between 4 and 8 months of age, whilst others, like the subventricular zones, these differences were more evident for PEDFR. Although ubiquitous presence was not found in the brain for these two proteins, their relevant functions must not be underestimated. It has been described that PEDF plays an important role in neuroprotection and data provided in the present work represents the first extensive study to understand the relevance of these two proteins in specific brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Projections between visual cortex and pulvinar in the rat</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24937?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Projections between visual cortex and pulvinar in the rat&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/25a32755-d4ae-434c-82eb-c3b09b960c9d/cne24937-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the geniculocortical pathway which interconnects only between the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex (V1), the pulvinar has long been known to interconnect with most if not all of visual cortex. Here we show that pulvinar interconnectivity is actually more dominant with higher visual cortex (V2) than with V1. Thus, the pulvinocortical pathway does not likely play as big a role in directly modulating V1 activity as previously thought.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extrageniculate visual pathway, which carries visual information from the retina through the superficial layers of the superior colliculus and the pulvinar, is poorly understood. The pulvinar is thought to modulate information flow between cortical areas, and has been implicated in cognitive tasks like directing visually guided actions. In order to better understand the underlying circuitry, we performed retrograde injections of modified rabies virus in the visual cortex and pulvinar of the Long‐Evans rat. We found a relatively small population of cells projecting to primary visual cortex (V1), compared to a much larger population projecting to higher visual cortex. Reciprocal corticothalamic projections showed a similar result, implying that pulvinar does not play as big a role in directly modulating rodent V1 activity as previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Characterization of a cell bridge variant connecting the nodose and superior cervical ganglia in the mouse: Prevalence, anatomical features, and practical implications</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Characterization of a cell bridge variant connecting the nodose and superior cervical ganglia in the mouse: Prevalence, anatomical features, and practical implications&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8575f0a8-1c23-49dc-b821-d101db994373/cne24936-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study describes the anatomy of a cell bridge (CB) variant consisting of the fusion of the mouse nodose ganglion (NG) and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). This anastomosis was tubular shaped and significantly more prevalent in the ganglionic masses from males (38%) than females (21%). It contained a mixed of vagal afferents (blue, tyrosine hydroxylase [TH] positive, Hand2 negative, and isolectin B4 negative; purple, TH negative, Hand2 negative, and isolectin B4 positive; gray, TH negative, Hand2 negative, and isolectin B4 negative) and postganglionic sympathetic neurons (green, TH positive and Hand2 positive). The two populations of neurons abruptly replaced each other in the middle of the cell bridge. The practical implications of our observations are discussed with respect to studies of the mouse vagal afferents, an area of research of increasing popularity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While autonomic ganglia have been extensively studied in rats instead of mice, there is renewed interest in the anatomy of the mouse autonomic nervous system. This study examined the prevalence and anatomical features of a cell bridge linking two autonomic ganglia of the neck, namely, the nodose ganglion (NG) and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) in a cohort of C57BL/6J mice. We identified a cell bridge between the NG and the cranial pole of the SCG. This cell bridge was tubular shaped with an average length and width of 700 and 240 μm, respectively. The cell bridge was frequently unilateral and significantly more prevalent in the ganglionic masses from males (38%) than females (21%). On each of its extremities, it contained a mixed of vagal afferents and postganglionic sympathetic neurons. The two populations of neurons abruptly replaced each other in the middle of the cell bridge. We examined the mRNA expression for selected autonomic markers in samples of the NG with or without cell bridge. Our results indicated that the cell bridge was enriched in both markers of postganglionic sympathetic and vagal afferents neurons. Lastly, using FluoroGold microinjection into the NG, we found that the existence of a cell bridge may occasionally lead to the inadvertent contamination of the SCG. In summary, this study describes the anatomy of a cell bridge variant consisting of the fusion of the mouse NG and SCG. The practical implications of our observations are discussed with respect to studies of the mouse vagal afferents, an area of research of increasing popularity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Afferent and efferent connections of the nucleus prethalamicus in the yellowfin goby Acanthogobius flavimanus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8d2c3efc-7d02-4aab-9de6-13a3bceaeb80/cne24935-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleus prethalamicus of the yellowfin goby relays visual information from the optic tectum to as many as 13 regions of the telencephalon that is amazingly well compartmentalized in the goby. The goby is a promising model fish for studying telencephalic circuitries involved in the processing of visual information.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleus prethalamicus (PTh) receives fibers from the optic tectum and then projects to the dorsal telencephalon in the yellowfin goby &lt;i&gt;Acanthogobius flavimanus&lt;/i&gt;. However, it remained unclear whether the PTh is a visual relay nucleus, because the optic tectum receives not only visual but also other sensory modalities. Furthermore, precise telencephalic regions receiving prethalamic input remained unknown in the goby. We therefore investigated the full set of afferent and efferent connections of the PTh by direct tracer injections into the nucleus. Injections into the PTh labeled cells in the optic tectum, ventromedial thalamic nucleus, central and medial parts of the dorsal telencephalon, and caudal lobe of the cerebellum. We found that the somata of most tecto‐prethalamic neurons are present in the stratum periventriculare. Their dendrites ascend to reach the major retinorecipient layers of the tectum. The PTh is composed of two subnuclei (medial and lateral) and topographic organization was appreciated only for tectal projections to the lateral subnucleus (PTh‐l), which also receives sparse retinal projections. In contrast, the medial subnucleus receives fibers only from the medial tectum. We found that the PTh projects to nine subregions in the dorsal telencephalon and four in the ventral telencephalon. Furthermore, cerebellar injections revealed that cerebello‐prethalamic fibers cross the midline twice to innervate the PTh‐l on both sides. The present study is the first detailed report on the full set of the connections of PTh, which suggests that the PTh relays visual information from the optic tectum to the telencephalon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The cold‐ and menthol‐activated ion channel transient receptor potential channel subfamily M member 8 (TRPM8) is the principal detector of environmental cold in mammalian sensory nerve endings. In this study, we show, by in situ hybridization and by the analysis of two different reporter mouse strains, that TRPM8 is also expressed in the rodent central nervous system. Our results open a new window to understand potential roles of this molecular sensor within the brain. In this cartoon, we illustrate the main places of expression of TRPM8. Magenta circles indicate positive cell bodies and green circles positive fibers.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cold‐ and menthol‐activated ion channel transient receptor potential channel subfamily M member 8 (TRPM8) is the principal detector of environmental cold in mammalian sensory nerve endings. Although it is mainly expressed in a subpopulation of peripheral sensory neurons, it has also been identified in non‐neuronal tissues. Here, we show, by in situ hybridization (ISH) and by the analysis of transgenic reporter expression in two different reporter mouse strains, that TRPM8 is also expressed in the central nervous system. Although it is present at much lower levels than in peripheral sensory neurons, we found cells expressing TRPM8 in restricted areas of the brain, especially in the hypothalamus, septum, thalamic reticular nucleus, certain cortices and other limbic structures, as well as in some specific nuclei in the brainstem. Interestingly, positive fibers were also found traveling through the major limbic tracts, suggesting a role of TRPM8‐expressing central neurons in multiple aspects of thermal regulation, including autonomic and behavioral thermoregulation. Additional ISH experiments in rat brain demonstrated a conserved pattern of expression of this ion channel between rodent species. We confirmed the functional activity of this channel in the mouse brain using electrophysiological patch‐clamp recordings of septal neurons. These results open a new window in TRPM8 physiology, guiding further efforts to understand potential roles of this molecular sensor within the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Multicenter Validation of the max‐ICH Score in Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25969?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25969?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outcome prognostication unbiased by early care limitations (ECL) is essential for guiding treatment in patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The aim of this study was to determine whether the max‐ICH (maximally treated ICH) Score provides improved and clinically useful prognostic estimation of functional long‐term outcomes after ICH.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multicenter validation study compared the prognostication of the max‐ICH Score versus the ICH Score regarding diagnostic accuracy (discrimination and calibration) and clinical utility using decision curve analysis. We performed a joint investigation of individual participant data of consecutive spontaneous ICH patients (n = 4,677) from 2 retrospective German‐wide studies (RETRACE I + II; anticoagulation‐associated ICH only) conducted at 22 participating centers, one German prospective single‐center study (UKER‐ICH; nonanticoagulation‐associated ICH only), and 1 US‐based prospective longitudinal single‐center study (MGH; both anticoagulation‐ and nonanticoagulation‐associated ICH), treated between January 2006 and December 2015.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 4,677 included ICH patients, 1,017 (21.7%) were affected by ECL (German cohort: 15.6% [440 of 2,377]; MGH: 31.0% [577 of 1,283]). Validation of long‐term functional outcome prognostication by the max‐ICH Score provided good and superior discrimination in patients without ECL compared with the ICH Score (area under the receiver operating curve [AUROC], German cohort: 0.81 [0.78–0.83] vs 0.74 [0.72–0.77], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01; MGH: 0.85 [0.81–0.89] vs 0.78 [0.74–0.82], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), and for the entire cohort (AUROC, German cohort: 0.84 [0.82–0.86] vs 0.80 [0.77–0.82], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01; MGH: 0.83 [0.81–0.85] vs 0.77 [0.75–0.79], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Both scores showed no evidence of poor calibration. The clinical utility investigated by decision curve analysis showed, at high threshold probabilities (0.8, aiming to avoid false‐positive poor outcome attribution), that the max‐ICH Score provided a clinical net benefit compared with the ICH Score (14.1 vs 2.1 net predicted poor outcomes per 100 patients).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The max‐ICH Score provides valid and improved prognostication of functional outcome after ICH. The associated clinical net benefit in minimizing false poor outcome attribution might potentially prevent unwarranted care limitations in patients with ICH. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Probabilistic Mapping of Deep Brain Stimulation: Insights from 15 Years of Therapy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25975?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25975?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) depends on precise delivery of electrical current to target tissues. However, the specific brain structures responsible for best outcome are still debated. We applied probabilistic stimulation mapping to a retrospective, multidisorder DBS dataset assembled over 15 years at our institution (n&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; = 482 patients; n&lt;sub&gt;Parkinson disease&lt;/sub&gt; = 303; n&lt;sub&gt;dystonia&lt;/sub&gt; = 64; n&lt;sub&gt;tremor&lt;/sub&gt; = 39; n&lt;sub&gt;treatment‐resistant depression/anorexia nervosa&lt;/sub&gt; = 76) to identify the neuroanatomical substrates of optimal clinical response. Using high‐resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging and activation volume modeling, probabilistic stimulation maps (PSMs) that delineated areas of above‐mean and below‐mean response for each patient cohort were generated and defined in terms of their relationships with surrounding anatomical structures. Our results show that overlap between PSMs and individual patients' activation volumes can serve as a guide to predict clinical outcomes, but that this is not the sole determinant of response. In the future, individualized models that incorporate advancements in mapping techniques with patient‐specific clinical variables will likely contribute to the optimization of DBS target selection and improved outcomes for patients.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Clmp Regulates AMPA and Kainate Receptor Responses in the Neonatal Hippocampal CA3 and Kainate Seizure Susceptibility in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.567075</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.567075</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic adhesion molecules regulate synapse development through trans-synaptic adhesion and assembly of diverse synaptic proteins. Many synaptic adhesion molecules positively regulate synapse development; some, however, exert negative regulation, although such cases are relatively rare. In addition, synaptic adhesion molecules regulate the amplitude of post-synaptic receptor responses, but whether adhesion molecules can regulate the kinetic properties of post-synaptic receptors remains unclear. Here we report that Clmp, a homophilic adhesion molecule of the Ig domain superfamily that is abundantly expressed in the brain, reaches peak expression at a neonatal stage (week 1) and associates with subunits of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and kainate receptors (KARs). Clmp deletion in mice increased the frequency and amplitude of AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) and the frequency, amplitude, and decay time constant of KAR-mediated mEPSCs in hippocampal CA3 neurons. Clmp deletion had minimal impacts on evoked excitatory synaptic currents at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses but increased extrasynaptic KAR, but not AMPAR, currents, suggesting that Clmp distinctly inhibits AMPAR and KAR responses. Behaviorally, Clmp deletion enhanced novel object recognition and susceptibility to kainate-induced seizures, without affecting contextual or auditory cued fear conditioning or pattern completion-based contextual fear conditioning. These results suggest that Clmp negatively regulates hippocampal excitatory synapse development and AMPAR and KAR responses in the neonatal hippocampal CA3 as well as object recognition and kainate seizure susceptibility in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Topological Abnormalities of Functional Brain Network in Early-Stage Parkinson’s Disease Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have demonstrated structural and functional alterations in Parkinson’s disease (PD) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the topological patterns of functional brain networks in newly diagnosed PD patients with MCI are unclear so far. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and graph theory approaches to explore the functional brain network in 45 PD patients with MCI (PD-MCI), 22 PD patients without MCI (PD-nMCI), and 18 healthy controls (HC). We found that the PD-MCI, PD-nMCI, and HC groups exhibited a small-world architecture in the functional brain network. However, early-stage PD-MCI patients had decreased clustering coefficient, increased characteristic path length, and changed nodal centrality in the default mode network (DMN), control network (CN), somatomotor network (SMN), and visual network (VN), which might contribute to factors for MCI symptoms in PD patients. Our results demonstrated that PD-MCI patients were associated with disrupted topological organization in the functional network, thus providing a topological network insight into the role of information exchange in the underlying development of MCI symptoms in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to evaluate brain white matter (WM) fibers connectivity damage in stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) subjects by direct electrophysiological imaging (DELPHI) that analyzes transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked potentials (TEPs).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The study included 123 participants, out of which 53 subjects with WM-related pathologies (39 stroke, 14 TBI) and 70 healthy age-related controls. All subjects underwent DELPHI brain network evaluations of TMS-electroencephalogram (EEG)-evoked potentials and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans for quantification of WM microstructure fractional anisotropy (FA).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;DELPHI output measures show a significant difference between the healthy and stroke/TBI groups. A multidimensional approach was able to classify healthy from unhealthy with a balanced accuracy of 0.81 ± 0.02 and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 ± 0.01. Moreover, a multivariant regression model of DELPHI output measures achieved prediction of WM microstructure changes measured by FA with the highest correlations observed for fibers proximal to the stimulation area, such as frontal corpus callosum (r = 0.7 ± 0.02), anterior internal capsule (r = 0.7 ± 0.02), and fronto-occipital fasciculus (r = 0.65 ± 0.03).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These results indicate that features of TMS-evoked response are correlated to WM microstructure changes observed in pathological conditions, such as stroke and TBI, and that a multidimensional approach combining these features in supervised learning methods serves as a strong indicator for abnormalities and changes in WM integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Neuroprotective and Neurorestorative Effects of Holothuria scabra Extract in the MPTP/MPP+-Induced Mouse and Cellular Models of Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.575459</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.575459</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Extracts from Holothuria scabra (HS) have been shown to possess anti-inflammation, anti-oxidant and anti-cancer activities. More recently, it was shown to have neuroprotective potential in Caenorhabditis elegans PD model. Here, we assessed whether HS has neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects on dopaminergic neurons in both mouse and cellular models of PD. We found that both pre-treatment and post-treatment with HS improved motor deficits in PD mouse model induced with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) as determined by grid walk test. This was likely mediated by HS protective and restorative effects on maintaining the numbers of dopaminergic neurons and fibers in both substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum. In a cellular model of PD, HS significantly attenuated 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)-induced apoptosis of DAergic-like neurons differentiated from SH-SY5Y cells by enhancing the expression of Bcl-2, suppressing the expression of cleaved Caspase 3 and preventing depolarization of mitochondrial membrane. In addition, HS could stimulate the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and suppressed the formation of α-synuclein protein. Taken together, our in vivo and in vitro findings suggested that HS is an attractive candidate for the neuroprotection rather than neurorestoration in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Feature Tensor-Based Epileptic Detection Model Based on Improved Edge Removal Approach for Directed Brain Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.557095</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.557095</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalograph (EEG) plays a significant role in the diagnostics process of epilepsy, but the detection rate is unsatisfactory when the length of interictal EEG signals is relatively short. Although the deliberate attacking theories for undirected brain network based on node removal method can extract potential network features, the node removal method fails to sufficiently consider the directionality of brain electrical activities. To solve the problems above, this study proposes a feature tensor-based epileptic detection method of directed brain networks. First, a directed functional brain network is constructed by calculating the transfer entropy of EEG signals between different electrodes. Second, the edge removal method is used to imitate the disruptions of brain connectivity, which may be related to the disorder of brain diseases, to obtain a sequence of residual networks. After that, topological features of these residual networks are extracted based on graph theory for constructing a five-way feature tensor. To exploit the inherent interactions among multiple modes of the feature tensor, this study uses the Tucker decomposition method to get a core tensor which is finally reshaped into a vector and input into the support vectors machine (SVM) classifier. Experiment results suggest that the proposed method has better epileptic screening performance for short-term interictal EEG data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As the global population ages, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is also increasing. At present, there are no widely recognized drugs able to ameliorate the cognitive dysfunction caused by AD. The failure of several promising clinical trials in recent years has highlighted the urgent need for novel strategies to both prevent and treat AD. Notably, a growing body of literature supports the efficacy of acupuncture for AD. In this review, we summarize the previously reported mechanisms of acupuncture's beneficial effects in AD, including the ability of acupuncture to modulate Aβ metabolism, tau phosphorylation, neurotransmitters, neurogenesis, synapse and neuron function, autophagy, neuronal apoptosis, neuroinflammation, cerebral glucose metabolism, and brain responses. Taken together, these findings suggest that acupuncture provides therapeutic effects for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Combining Gamma With Alpha and Beta Power Modulation for Enhanced Cortical Mapping in Patients With Focal Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.555054</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;About one third of patients with epilepsy have seizures refractory to the medical treatment. Electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) is the gold standard for the identification of “eloquent” areas prior to resection of epileptogenic tissue. However, it is time-consuming and may cause undesired side effects. Broadband gamma activity (55–200 Hz) recorded with extraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) during cognitive tasks may be an alternative to ESM but until now has not proven of definitive clinical value. Considering their role in cognition, the alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (15–25 Hz) bands could further improve the identification of eloquent cortex. We compared gamma, alpha and beta activity, and their combinations for the identification of eloquent cortical areas defined by ESM. Ten patients with intractable focal epilepsy (age: 35.9 ± 9.1 years, range: 22–48, 8 females, 9 right handed) participated in a delayed-match-to-sample task, where syllable sounds were compared to visually presented letters. We used a generalized linear model (GLM) approach to find the optimal weighting of each band for predicting ESM-defined categories and estimated the diagnostic ability by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Gamma activity increased more in eloquent than in non-eloquent areas, whereas alpha and beta power decreased more in eloquent areas. Diagnostic ability of each band was close to 0.7 for all bands but depended on multiple factors including the time period of the cognitive task, the location of the electrodes and the patient’s degree of attention to the stimulus. We show that diagnostic ability can be increased by 3–5% by combining gamma and alpha and by 7.5–11% when gamma and beta were combined. We then show how ECoG power modulation from cognitive testing can be used to map the probability of eloquence in individual patients and how this probability map can be used in clinical settings to optimize ESM planning. We conclude that the combination of gamma and beta power modulation during cognitive testing can contribute to the identification of eloquent areas prior to ESM in patients with refractory focal epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Biosignal-Based Attention Monitoring to Support Nuclear Operator Safety-Relevant Tasks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.596531</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the main control room (MCR) of a nuclear power plant (NPP), the quality of an operator's performance can depend on their level of attention to the task. Insufficient operator attention accounted for more than 26% of the total causes of human errors and is the highest category for errors. It is therefore necessary to check whether operators are sufficiently attentive either as supervisors or peers during reactor operation. Recently, digital control technologies have been introduced to the operating environment of an NPP MCR. These upgrades are expected to enhance plant and operator performance. At the same time, because personal computers are used in the advanced MCR, the operators perform more cognitive works than physical work. However, operators may not consciously check fellow operators' attention in this environment indicating potentially higher importance of the role of operator attention. Therefore, remote measurement of an operator's attention in real time would be a useful tool, providing feedback to supervisors. The objective of this study is to investigate the development of quantitative indicators that can identify an operator's attention, to diagnose or detect a lack of operator attention thus preventing potential human errors in advanced MCRs. To establish a robust baseline of operator attention, this study used two of the widely used biosignals: electroencephalography (EEG) and eye movement. We designed an experiment to collect EEG and eye movements of the subjects who were monitoring and diagnosing nuclear operator safety-relevant tasks. There was a statistically significant difference between biosignals with and without appropriate attention. Furthermore, an average classification accuracy of about 90% was obtained by the k-nearest neighbors and support vector machine classifiers with a few EEG and eye movements features. Potential applications of EEG and eye movement measures in monitoring and diagnosis tasks in an NPP MCR are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Connectome-Based, Corticothalamic Model of State- and Stimulation-Dependent Modulation of Rhythmic Neural Activity and Connectivity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rhythmic activity in the brain fluctuates with behaviour and cognitive state, through a combination of coexisting and interacting frequencies. At large spatial scales such as those studied in human M/EEG, measured oscillatory dynamics are believed to arise primarily from a combination of cortical (intracolumnar) and corticothalamic rhythmogenic mechanisms. Whilst considerable progress has been made in characterizing these two types of neural circuit separately, relatively little work has been done that attempts to unify them into a single consistent picture. This is the aim of the present paper. We present and examine a whole-brain, connectome-based neural mass model with detailed long-range cortico-cortical connectivity and strong, recurrent corticothalamic circuitry. This system reproduces a variety of known features of human M/EEG recordings, including spectral peaks at canonical frequencies, and functional connectivity structure that is shaped by the underlying anatomical connectivity. Importantly, our model is able to capture state- (e.g., idling/active) dependent fluctuations in oscillatory activity and the coexistence of multiple oscillatory phenomena, as well as frequency-specific modulation of functional connectivity. We find that increasing the level of sensory drive to the thalamus triggers a suppression of the dominant low frequency rhythms generated by corticothalamic loops, and subsequent disinhibition of higher frequency endogenous rhythmic behaviour of intracolumnar microcircuits. These combine to yield simultaneous decreases in lower frequency and increases in higher frequency components of the M/EEG power spectrum during states of high sensory or cognitive drive. Building on this, we also explored the effect of pulsatile brain stimulation on ongoing oscillatory activity, and evaluated the impact of coexistent frequencies and state-dependent fluctuations on the response of cortical networks. Our results provide new insight into the role played by cortical and corticothalamic circuits in shaping intrinsic brain rhythms, and suggest new directions for brain stimulation therapies aimed at state-and frequency-specific control of oscillatory brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: A Diversity of Intrinsic Timescales Underlie Neural Computations</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural processing occurs across a range of temporal scales. To facilitate this, the brain uses fast-changing representations reflecting momentary sensory input alongside more temporally extended representations, which integrate across both short and long temporal windows. The temporal flexibility of these representations allows animals to behave adaptively. Short temporal windows facilitate adaptive responding in dynamic environments, while longer temporal windows promote the gradual integration of information across time. In the cognitive and motor domains, the brain sets overarching goals to be achieved within a long temporal window, which must be broken down into sequences of actions and precise movement control processed across much shorter temporal windows. Previous human neuroimaging studies and large-scale artificial network models have ascribed different processing timescales to different cortical regions, linking this to each region’s position in an anatomical hierarchy determined by patterns of inter-regional connectivity. However, even within cortical regions, there is variability in responses when studied with single-neuron electrophysiology. Here, we review a series of recent electrophysiology experiments that demonstrate the heterogeneity of temporal receptive fields at the level of single neurons within a cortical region. This heterogeneity appears functionally relevant for the computations that neurons perform during decision-making and working memory. We consider anatomical and biophysical mechanisms that may give rise to a heterogeneity of timescales, including recurrent connectivity, cortical layer distribution, and neurotransmitter receptor expression. Finally, we reflect on the computational relevance of each brain region possessing a heterogeneity of neuronal timescales. We argue that this architecture is of particular importance for sensory, motor, and cognitive computations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Dynamic Interhemispheric Desynchronization in Marmosets and Humans With Disorders of the Corpus Callosum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.612595</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.612595</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The corpus callosum, the principal structural avenue for interhemispheric neuronal communication, controls the brain’s lateralization. Developmental malformations of the corpus callosum (CCD) can lead to learning and intellectual disabilities. Currently, there is no clear explanation for these symptoms. Here, we used resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) to evaluate the dynamic resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in both the cingulate cortex (CG) and the sensory areas (S1, S2, A1) in three marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) with spontaneous CCD. We also performed rsfMRI in 10 CCD human subjects (six hypoplasic and four agenesic). We observed no differences in the strength of rsFC between homotopic CG and sensory areas in both species when comparing them to healthy controls. However, in CCD marmosets, we found lower strength of quasi-periodic patterns (QPP) correlation in the posterior interhemispheric sensory areas. We also found a significant lag of interhemispheric communication in the medial CG, suggesting asynchrony between the two hemispheres. Correspondingly, in human subjects, we found that the CG of acallosal subjects had a higher QPP correlation than controls. In comparison, hypoplasic subjects had a lower QPP correlation and a delay of 1.6 s in the sensory regions. These results show that CCD affects the interhemispheric synchrony of both CG and sensory areas and that, in both species, its impact on cortical communication varies along the CC development gradient. Our study shines a light on how CCD misconnects homotopic regions and opens a line of research to explain the causes of the symptoms exhibited by CCD patients and how to mitigate them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Recognition of Cognitive Impairment in Adult Moyamoya Disease: A Classifier Based on High-Order Resting-State Functional Connectivity Network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.603208</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.603208</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a common complication in adult patients with moyamoya disease (MMD), and is reversible by surgical revascularization in its early stage of mild VCI. However, accurate diagnosis of mild VCI is difficult based on neuropsychological examination alone. This study proposed a method of dynamic resting-state functional connectivity (FC) network to recognize global cognitive impairment in MMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: For MMD, 36 patients with VCI and 43 patients with intact cognition (Non-VCI) were included, as well as 26 normal controls (NCs). Using resting-state fMRI, dynamic low-order FC networks were first constructed with multiple brain regions which were generated through a sliding window approach and correlated in temporal dimension. In order to obtain more information of network interactions along the time, high-order FC networks were established by calculating correlations among each pair of brain regions. Afterwards, a sparse representation-based classifier was constructed to recognize MMD (experiment 1) and its cognitive impairment (experiment 2) with features extracted from both low- and high-order FC networks. Finally, the ten-fold cross-validation strategy was proposed to train and validate the performance of the classifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The three groups did not differ significantly in demographic features (p &amp;gt; 0.05), while the VCI group exhibited the lowest MMSE scores (p = 0.001). The Non-VCI and NCs groups did not differ significantly in MMSE scores (p = 0.054). As for the classification between MMD and NCs, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the classifier reached 90.70, 88.57, 93.67, and 73.08%, respectively. While for the classification between VCI and Non-VCI, the AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the classifier reached 91.02, 84.81, 80.56, and 88.37%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study not only develops a promising classifier to recognize VCI in adult MMD in its early stage, but also implies the significance of time-varying properties in dynamic FC networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Organotypic Brain Slice Culture Microglia Exhibit Molecular Similarity to Acutely-Isolated Adult Microglia and Provide a Platform to Study Neuroinflammation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.592005</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.592005</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are central nervous system (CNS) resident immune cells that have been implicated in neuroinflammatory pathogenesis of a variety of neurological conditions. Their manifold context-dependent contributions to neuroinflammation are only beginning to be elucidated, which can be attributed in part to the challenges of studying microglia in vivo and the lack of tractable in vitro systems to study microglia function. Organotypic brain slice cultures offer a tissue-relevant context that enables the study of CNS resident cells and the analysis of brain slice microglial phenotypes has provided important insights, in particular into neuroprotective functions. Here we use RNA sequencing, direct digital quantification of gene expression with nCounter® technology and targeted analysis of individual microglial signature genes, to characterize brain slice microglia relative to acutely-isolated counterparts and 2-dimensional (2D) primary microglia cultures, a widely used in vitro surrogate. Analysis using single cell and population-based methods found brain slice microglia exhibited better preservation of canonical microglia markers and overall gene expression with stronger fidelity to acutely-isolated adult microglia, relative to in vitro cells. We characterized the dynamic phenotypic changes of brain slice microglia over time, after plating in culture. Mechanical damage associated with slice preparation prompted an initial period of inflammation, which resolved over time. Based on flow cytometry and gene expression profiling we identified the 2-week timepoint as optimal for investigation of microglia responses to exogenously-applied stimuli as exemplified by treatment-induced neuroinflammatory changes observed in microglia following LPS, TNF and GM-CSF addition to the culture medium. Altogether these findings indicate that brain slice cultures provide an experimental system superior to in vitro culture of microglia as a surrogate to investigate microglia functions, and the impact of soluble factors and cellular context on their physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Targeting MicroRNA-125b Promotes Neurite Outgrowth but Represses Cell Apoptosis and Inflammation via Blocking PTGS2 and CDK5 in a FOXQ1-Dependent Way in Alzheimer Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.587747</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.587747</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to explore the molecular regulatory network among microRNA-125b (miR-125b), forkhead box Q1 (FOXQ1), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), as well as their effects on cell apoptosis, neurite outgrowth, and inflammation in Alzheimer disease (AD). Rat embryo cerebral cortex neurons and nerve growth factor–stimulated PC12 cells were insulted by Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1−42&lt;/sub&gt; to construct two AD cellular models. Negative control (NC) inhibitor, miR-125b inhibitor, NC siRNA, FOXQ1 siRNA, PTGS2 siRNA, and CDK5 siRNA were transferred into the two AD cellular models alone or combined. Then, cell apoptosis, neurite outgrowth, proinflammatory cytokines, miR-125b, FOXQ1, PTGS2, and CDK5 expressions were detected. MiR-125b inhibition facilitated neurite outgrowth but suppressed cell apoptosis and proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 1β, and interleukin 6); meanwhile, it upregulated FOXQ1 but downregulated PTGS2 and CDK5. Furthermore, FOXQ1 inhibition promoted cell apoptosis and proinflammatory cytokines but repressed neurite outgrowth; PTGS2 inhibition achieved the opposite effects; CDK5 inhibition attenuated cell apoptosis, whereas it less affected neurite outgrowth and inflammation. Notably, FOXQ1 inhibition attenuated, whereas PTGS2 inhibition elevated the effect of miR-125b inhibition on regulating neurite outgrowth, cell apoptosis, and proinflammatory cytokines. As for CDK5 inhibition, it enhanced the effect of miR-125b inhibition on regulating cell apoptosis, but less impacted the neurite outgrowth and proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, PTGS2 inhibition and CDK5 inhibition both reversed the effect of FOXQ1 inhibition on regulating cell apoptosis, neurite outgrowth, and proinflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, targeting miR-125b alleviates AD progression via blocking PTGS2 and CDK5 in a FOXQ1-dependent way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis and neurodegenerative diseases are two kinds of common disorders of the elderly, which often co-occur. Previous studies have shown the skeletal and central nervous systems are closely related to pathophysiology. As the main structural scaffold of the body, the bone is also a reservoir for stem cells, a primary lymphoid organ, and an important endocrine organ. It can interact with the brain through various bone-derived cells, mostly the mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The bone marrow is also a place for generating immune cells, which could greatly influence brain functions. Finally, the proteins secreted by bones (osteokines) also play important roles in the growth and function of the brain. This article reviews the latest research studying the impact of bone-derived cells, bone-controlled immune system, and bone-secreted proteins on the brain, and evaluates how these factors are implicated in the progress of neurodegenerative diseases and their potential use in the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Aggregation of Vascular Risk Factors Modulates the Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuation in Mild Cognitive Impairment Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.604246</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.604246</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Several vascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, body mass index, and smoking status are found to be associated with cognitive decline and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to investigate whether an aggregation of vascular risk factors modulates the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Forty-three MCI patients and twenty-nine healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional MRI scans, and spontaneous brain activity was measured by the ALFF technique. The vascular risk profile was represented with the Framingham Heart Study general cardiovascular disease (FHS-CVD) risk score, and each group was further divided into high and low risk subgroups. Two-way ANOVA was performed to explore the main effects of diagnosis and vascular risk and their interaction on ALFF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The main effect of diagnosis on ALFF was found in left middle temporal gyrus (LMTG) and left superior parietal gyrus (LSPG), and the main effect of risk on ALFF was detected in left fusiform gyrus (LFFG), left precuneus (LPCUN), and left cerebellum posterior lobe (LCPL). Patients with MCI exhibited increased ALFF in the LMTG and LSPG than HCs, and participants with high vascular risk showed increased ALFF in the LFFG and LCPL, while decreased ALFF in the LPCUN. An interaction between diagnosis (MCI vs. HC) and FHS-CVD risk (high vs. low) regarding ALFF was observed in the left hippocampus (LHIP). HCs with high vascular risk showed significantly increased ALFF in the LHIP than those with low vascular risk, while MCI patients with high vascular risk showed decreased ALFF in the LHIP than HCs with high vascular risk. Interestingly, the mean ALFF of LHIP positively correlated with word recall test in HCs with high vascular risk (rho = 0.630, P = 0.016), while negatively correlated with the same test in MCI patients with high vascular risk (rho = −0.607, P = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence highlighting that the aggregation of vascular risk factors modulates the spontaneous brain activity in MCI patients, and this may serve as a potential imaging mechanism underlying vascular contribution to AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease in China: An Updated Systematical Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.603854</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.603854</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are two major neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. Demographic aging is in rapid progress in China. Up-to-date estimates of AD and PD prevalence have not been provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Studies that reported the prevalence of AD and PD in China were identified via a systematic database search from 1985 to 2018. Meta-analysis, local polynomial regression and autoregressive integrated moving average model were used for analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 99 studies were included in the study with populations of 385,312 and 227,228, respectively for AD and PD. The overall prevalence of AD and PD following age standardization was 3.20% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.17–3.23] and 1.06% (95% CI = 1.02–1.10), respectively in individuals over 60 years old. The rates increased drastically for every 10-years increment of age. The yearly prevalence of AD was predicted to increase from 3.81 to 6.17% in the next 5 years. Significant differences were observed between genders [male to female odds ratio (OR) for AD = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.51–0.64; OR for PD = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.06–1.46], and between education levels (Illiterate to non-illiterate OR for AD = 2.99, 95% CI = 2.38–3.75), but not between urban and rural settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results provide an updated insight into the epidemiology of AD and PD in China and their associated rates and ratios. The findings may facilitate China policy makers and health professionals mitigate the related health issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Face Recognition Deficits in a Patient With Alzheimer's Disease: Amnesia or Agnosia? The Importance of Electrophysiological Markers for Differential Diagnosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.580609</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Face recognition deficits are frequently reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and often attributed to memory impairment. However, it has been hypothesized that failure in identifying familiar people could also be due to deficits in higher-level perceptual processes, since there is evidence showing a reduced inversion effect for faces but not for cars in AD. To address the involvement of these higher processes, we investigated event-related potential (ERP) neural correlates of faces in a patient with AD showing a face recognition deficit. Eight healthy participants were tested as a control group. Participants performed different tasks following the stimulus presentation. In experiment 1, they should indicate whether the stimulus was either a face or a house or a scrambled image. In experiments 2 and 3, they should discriminate between upright and inverted faces (in experiment 2, stimuli were faces with neutral or fearful expressions, while in experiment 3, stimuli were famous or unfamiliar faces). Electrophysiological results reveal that the typical face-specific modulation of the N170 component, which is thought to reflect the structural encoding of faces, was not present in patient MCG, despite being affected by the emotional content of the face implicitly processed by MCG. Conversely, the N400 component, which is thought to reflect the recruitment of the memory trace of the face identity, was found to be implicitly modulated in MCG. These results may identify a possible role for gnosic processes in face recognition deficits in AD and suggest the importance of adopting an integrated approach to the AD diagnosis while considering electrophysiological markers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The study aims to detect the potential relationship between iron deposition and the function of the glymphatic system in the normal aging brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We recruited 213 healthy participants. We evaluated the function of the glymphatic system using the index for diffusivity along the perivascular space (ALPS-index), assessed iron deposition on quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and analyzed their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The mean age of participants was 60.1 ± 7.3, and 107 (50.2%) were female. The mean ALPS-index was 1.4 ± 0.2. The QSM values of the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, red nucleus, substantia nigra, and dentate nucleus were all related to the ALPS-index (all P &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The main finding of the current study is that the regional brain iron deposition was related to the function of the glymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advances in knowledge: We first evaluated the relationship between deposition of brain iron and the dysfunction of the glymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Sex and age influence gonadal steroid hormone receptor distributions relative to estrogen receptor β‐containing neurons in the mouse hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/23342809-e57b-402f-9f65-9e605bc09b95/cne25093-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light and electron microscopic studies reveal that gonadal steroids may directly and indirectly influence PVN neurons via nuclear (a) and extranuclear (b) gonadal hormone receptors in a sex‐specific manner.  AR, androgen receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; GPER, G‐protein coupled estrogen receptor

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), estrogen receptor (ER) β and other gonadal hormone receptors play a role in central cardiovascular processes. However, the influence of sex and age on the cellular and subcellular relationships of ERβ with ERα, G‐protein ER (GPER1), as well as progestin and androgen receptors (PR and AR) in the PVN are uncertain. In young (2‐3 month old) females and males, ERβ‐enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) containing neurons were ~4 times greater than ERα‐labeled and PR‐labeled nuclei in the PVN. In subdivisions of the PVN, young females, compared to males, had: 1) more ERβ‐EGFP neurons in neuroendocrine rostral regions; 2) fewer ERα‐labeled nuclei in neuroendocrine and autonomic projecting medial subregions; 3) more ERα‐labeled nuclei in an autonomic projecting caudal region. In contrast, young males, compared to females, had ~20 times more AR‐labeled nuclei which often colocalized with ERβ‐EGFP in neuroendocrine (~70%) and autonomic (~50%) projecting subregions. Ultrastructurally, in soma and dendrites, PVN ERβ‐EGFP colocalized primarily with extranuclear AR (~85% soma) and GPER1 (~70% soma). Aged (12‐24 month‐old) males had more ERβ‐EGFP neurons in a rostral neuroendocrine subregion compared to aged females and females with accelerated ovarian failure (AOF), and in a caudal autonomic subregion compared to post‐AOF females. Late‐aged (18‐24 month‐old) females compared to early‐aged (12‐14 month‐old) females and AOF females had fewer AR‐labeled nuclei in neuroendrocrine and autonomic projecting subregions. These findings indicate that gonadal steroids may directly and indirectly influence PVN neurons via nuclear and extranuclear gonadal hormone receptors in a sex‐specific manner.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mammalian nervous system is a complex network of interconnected cells. We review emerging techniques that use the axonal transport of adeno‐associated virus (AAV) vectors to dissect neural circuits. These intersectional approaches specifically target AAV‐mediated gene expression to discrete neuron populations based on their axonal connectivity, including: (a) neurons with one defined output, (b) neurons with one defined input, (c) neurons with one defined input and one defined output, and (d) neurons with two defined inputs or outputs. The number of labeled neurons can be directly controlled to trace axonal projections and examine cellular morphology. These approaches can precisely target the expression of fluorescent reporters, optogenetic ion channels, chemogenetic receptors, disease‐associated proteins, and other factors to defined neural circuits in mammals ranging from mice to macaques, and thereby provide a powerful new means to understand the structure and function of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: HCN channels in the mammalian cochlea: Expression pattern, subcellular location, and age‐dependent changes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24754?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;HCN channels in the mammalian cochlea: Expression pattern, subcellular location, and age‐dependent changes&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6fec0cc2-5599-446b-97e6-a5a459503c38/jnr24754-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All HCN channel subtypes were located at subcellular level in human and compared with other mammals such as guinea pig, cat, and three mouse strains. Changes in HCN expression levels were quantified in aging mice and murine postnatal development. The widespread expression and distinct localization emphasized the importance of HCN channels for sound coding and electrical stimulation with cochlear implants&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal diversity in the cochlea is largely determined by ion channels. Among voltage‐gated channels, hyperpolarization‐activated cyclic nucleotide‐gated (HCN) channels open with hyperpolarization and depolarize the cell until the resting membrane potential. The functions for hearing are not well elucidated and knowledge about localization is controversial. We created a detailed map of subcellular location and co‐expression of all four HCN subunits across different mammalian species including CBA/J, C57Bl/6N, Ly5.1 mice, guinea pigs, cats, and human subjects. We correlated age‐related hearing deterioration in CBA/J and C57Bl/6N with expression levels of HCN1, −2, and −4 in individual auditory neurons from the same cohort. Spatiotemporal expression during murine postnatal development exposed HCN2 and HCN4 involvement in a critical phase of hair cell innervation. The huge diversity of subunit composition, but lack of relevant heteromeric pairing along the perisomatic membrane and axon initial segments, highlighted an active role for auditory neurons. Neuron clusters were found to be the hot spots of HCN1, −2, and −4 immunostaining. HCN channels were also located in afferent and efferent fibers of the sensory epithelium. Age‐related changes on HCN subtype expression were not uniform among mice and could not be directly correlated with audiometric data. The oldest mice groups revealed HCN channel up‐ or downregulation, depending on the mouse strain. The unexpected involvement of HCN channels in outer hair cell function where HCN3 overlaps prestin location emphasized the importance for auditory function. A better understanding may open up new possibilities to tune neuronal responses evoked through electrical stimulation by cochlear implants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Nutritional interventions to improve neurophysiological impairments following traumatic brain injury: A systematic review</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) accounts for significant global health burden. Effects of TBI can become chronic even following mild injury. There is a need to develop effective therapies to attenuate the damaging effects of TBI and improve recovery outcomes. This literature review using a priori criteria (PROSPERO; CRD42018100623) summarized 43 studies between January 1998 and July 2019 that investigated nutritional interventions (NUT) delivered with the objective of altering neurophysiological (NP) outcomes following TBI. Risk of bias was assessed for included studies, and NP outcomes recorded. The systematic search resulted in 43 of 3,748 identified studies met inclusion criteria. No studies evaluated the effect of a NUT on NP outcomes of TBI in humans. Biomarkers of morphological changes and apoptosis, oxidative stress, and plasticity, neurogenesis, and neurotransmission were the most evaluated NP outcomes across the 43 studies that used 2,897 animals. The risk of bias was unclear in all reviewed studies due to poorly detailed methodology sections. Taking these limitations into account, anti‐oxidants, branched chain amino acids, and ω‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown the most promising pre‐clinical results for altering NP outcomes following TBI. Refinement of pre‐clinical methodologies used to evaluate effects of interventions on secondary damage of TBI would improve the likelihood of translation to clinical populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Oral dysfunctions and cognitive impairment/dementia</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With global increases in the aging population, the number of patients with dementia is greatly increasing, which has become a big social problem. Many studies have shown strong associations between oral disorders and systemic disorders, such as diabetes, arthritis, sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, arteriosclerosis, bacterial endocarditis, and other cardiovascular diseases. Similarly, numerous cross‐sectional studies showed that patients with dementia usually have poor oral conditions and tooth loss. These have long been considered as a result of difficulty with oral care due to impaired cognitive function, memory, and physical ability in patients with dementia. Indeed, even in patients with mild cognitive impairment, oral care becomes insufficient owing to decreases in spontaneity of grooming and finger dexterity. However, recent studies have shown that tooth loss and occlusal dysfunction may affect brain function and trigger the onset of dementia found in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we highlight the relationships among aging, oral dysfunction, and the development of dementia. Increasing evidence suggests that oral dysfunction is not only a result of dementia in the elderly people, but could also be a causative factor for the onset of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Divergent membrane properties of mouse cochlear glial cells around hearing onset</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24744?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Divergent membrane properties of mouse cochlear glial cells around hearing onset&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/760fab97-8a65-457e-8d4e-1ac80a2c14d7/jnr24744-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mouse cochlear glial cells have region‐specific membrane properties. Within dissociated cultures, satellite glial cells (SGCs) have large weak inwardly rectifying currents, likely mediated by Kir4.1 channels. Presumptive Schwann cells lack these currents. Soon after birth, Kir4.1 subunits appear in both glial subtypes, but become restricted to SGCs around hearing onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are the primary afferent neurons of the auditory system, and together with their attendant glia, form the auditory nerve. Within the cochlea, satellite glial cells (SGCs) encapsulate the cell body of SGNs, whereas Schwann cells (SCs) wrap their peripherally‐ and centrally‐directed neurites. Despite their likely importance in auditory nerve function and homeostasis, the physiological properties of auditory glial cells have evaded description. Here, we characterized the voltage‐activated membrane currents of glial cells from the mouse cochlea. We identified a prominent weak inwardly rectifying current in SGCs within cochlear slice preparations (postnatal day P5‐P6), which was also present in presumptive SGCs within dissociated cultures prepared from the cochleae of hearing mice (P14‐P15). Pharmacological block by Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and desipramine suggested that channels belonging to the Kir4 family mediated the weak inwardly rectifying current, and &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; immunofluorescence implicated the involvement of Kir4.1 subunits. Additional electrophysiological profiles were identified for glial cells within dissociated cultures, suggesting that glial subtypes may have specific membrane properties to support distinct physiological roles. Immunofluorescence using fixed cochlear sections revealed that although Kir4.1 is restricted to SGCs after the onset of hearing, these channels are more widely distributed within the glial population earlier in postnatal development (i.e., within both SGCs and SCs). The decrease in Kir4.1 immunofluorescence during SC maturation was coincident with a reduction of Sox2 expression and advancing neurite myelination. The data suggest a diversification of glial properties occurs in preparation for sound‐driven activity in the auditory nerve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Increased prevalence of pathological mitochondria in astrocytic endfeet of Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)

Increased prevalence of pathological mitochondria in neuronal terminals of IIH

The mitochondria–ER contact sites distances are reduced in IIH

The postsynaptic density length is reduced in IIH




&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) primarily affects fertile, overweight women, and presents with the symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. The etiology is unknown but has been thought to relate to cerebrospinal fluid disturbance or cerebral venous stenosis. We have previously found evidence that IIH is also a disease of the brain parenchyma, evidenced by alterations at the neurogliovascular interface, including astrogliosis, pathological changes in the basement membrane and pericytes, and alterations of perivascular aquaporin‐4. The aim of this present electron microscopic study was to examine whether mitochondria phenotype was changed in IIH, particularly focusing on perivascular astrocytic endfeet and neurons (soma and pre‐ and postsynaptic terminals). Cortical brain biopsies of nine reference individuals and eight IIH patients were analyzed for subcellular distribution and phenotypical features of mitochondria using transmission electron microscopy. We found significantly increased prevalence of pathological mitochondria and reduced number of normal mitochondria in astrocytic endfeet of IIH patients. The degree of astrogliosis correlated negatively with the number of normal mitochondria in astrocytic endfoot processes. Moreover, we found significantly increased number of pathological mitochondria in pre‐ and postsynaptic neuronal terminals, as well as significantly shortened distance between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum contacts. Finally, the length of postsynaptic density, a marker of synaptic strength, was on average reduced in IIH. The present data provide evidence of pathological mitochondria in perivascular astrocytes endfeet and neurons of IIH patients, highlighting that impaired metabolism at the neurogliovascular interface may be a facet of IIH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Changes in resting‐state functional brain connectivity associated with head impacts over one men’s semi‐professional soccer season&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/faece372-2488-4f67-9548-1af05994d44d/jnr24742-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure to repetitive head impacts without concussion over one season of competitive men's soccer games was associated with increased resting‐state functional connectivity within networks involved in cognitive functions, analyzing a cohort including nine soccer players and 20 other athletes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soccer, as a contact sport, exposes players to repetitive head impacts, especially through heading the ball. The question of a long‐term brain cumulative effect remains. Our objective was to determine whether exposure to head impacts over one soccer season was associated with changes in functional brain connectivity at rest, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this prospective cohort study, 10 semi‐professional men soccer players, aged 18–25 years, and 20 age‐matched men athletes without a concussion history and who do not practice any contact sport were recruited in Bordeaux (France). Exposure to head impacts per soccer player during competitive games over one season was measured using video analysis. Resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired for both groups at two times, before and after the season. With a seed‐based analysis, resting‐state networks that have been intimately associated with aspects of cognitive functioning were investigated. The results showed a mean head impacts of 42 (±33) per soccer player over the season, mainly intentional head‐to‐ball impacts and no concussion. No head impact was found among the other athletes. The number of head impacts between the two MRI acquisitions before and after the season was associated with increased connectivity within the default mode network and the cortico‐cerebellar network. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the brain functioning changes over one soccer season in association with exposure to repetitive head impacts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Time‐restricted feeding prevents depressive‐like and anxiety‐like behaviors in male rats exposed to an experimental model of shift‐work&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a5a378e9-e82f-4f95-8822-ce4fba33dbda/jnr24741-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In male rats exposed to an experimental model of shift‐work, we reported circadian disruption, depressive and anxiety‐like behaviors as well as neuroinflammation in brain areas associated with mood regulation. Time‐restricted feeding associated with the normal activity phase prevents depressive and anxiety‐like behaviors as well as neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals who regularly shift their sleep timing, like night and/or shift‐workers suffer from circadian desynchrony and are at risk of developing cardiometabolic diseases and cancer. Also, shift‐work is are suggested to be a risk factor for the development of mood disorders such as the burn out syndrome, anxiety, and depression. Experimental and clinical studies provide evidence that food intake restricted to the normal activity phase is a potent synchronizer for the circadian system and can prevent the detrimental health effects associated with circadian disruption. Here, we explored whether adult male Wistar rats exposed to an experimental model of shift‐work (W‐AL) developed depressive and/or anxiety‐like behaviors and whether this was associated with neuroinflammation in brain areas involved with mood regulation. We also tested whether time‐restricted feeding (TRF) to the active phase could ameliorate circadian disruption and therefore would prevent depressive and anxiety‐like behaviors as well as neuroinflammation. In male Wistar rats, W‐AL induced depressive‐like behavior characterized by hypoactivity and anhedonia and induced increased anxiety‐like behavior in the open field test. This was associated with increased number of glial fibrillary acidic protein and IBA‐1‐positive cells in the prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala. Moreover W‐AL caused morphological changes in the microglia in the CA3 area of the hippocampus indicating microglial activation. Importantly, TRF prevented behavioral changes and decreased neuroinflammation markers in the brain. Present results add up evidence about the importance that TRF in synchrony with the light–dark cycle can prevent neuroinflammation leading to healthy mood states in spite of circadian disruptive conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Time‐to‐contact perception in the brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/002e3a9b-7b2b-4fd4-9d84-01d6d801f614/jnr24740-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the brain areas engaged when estimating the time to contact of an approaching ball? Patients undergoing an awake brain surgery performed the task while various areas were stimulated. The performances were assessed compared to a presurgery baseline. Results showed a direct and causal involvement of areas near the intraparietal sulcus, and indirect involvement of areas related to the language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time‐to‐contact (TTC) perception refers to the ability of an observer to estimate the remaining time before an object reaches a point in the environment, and is of crucial importance in daily life. Noninvasive correlational approaches have identified several brain areas sensitive to TTC information. Here we report the results of two studies, including one during an awake brain surgery, that aimed to identify the specific areas causally engaged in the TTC estimation process. In Study 1, we tested 40 patients with brain tumor in a TTC estimation task. The results showed that four of the six patients with impaired performance had tumors in right upper parietal cortex, although this tumoral location represented only six over 40 patients. In Study 2, 15 patients underwent awake brain surgery electrostimulation mapping to examine the implication of various brain areas in the TTC estimation process. We acquired and normalized to MNI space the coordinates of the functional areas that influenced task performance. Our results seem to demonstrate that the early stage of the TTC estimation process involved specific cortical territories in the ventral region of the right intraparietal sulcus. Downstream processing of TTC could also involve the frontal eye field (middle frontal gyrus) related to ocular search. We also found that deactivating language areas in the left hemisphere interfered with the TTC estimation process. These findings demonstrate a fine grained, cortical representation of TTC processing close to the ventral right intraparietal sulcus and complement those described in other human studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Hippocampal subregional volume changes in elders classified using positron emission tomography‐based Alzheimer's biomarkers of β‐amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f5bb9927-fad6-4974-af73-9eb7a224fb67/jnr24739-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volume of hippocampal subregions (presubiculum/subiculum) are reduced in elderly subjects presenting cortical β‐amyloid deposition and signs of neurodegeneration. In elderly subjects with no neurodegeneration, hippocampal subregional volumes are also reduced in those with cognitive decline (dementia or amnestic mild cognitive impairment) compared to cognitively intact individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in hippocampal subfield volumes (HSV) along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum have been scarcely investigated to date in elderly subjects classified based on the presence of β‐amyloid aggregation and signs of neurodegeneration. We classified patients (either sex) with mild dementia compatible with AD (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 35) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 39), and cognitively unimpaired subjects (either sex; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 26) using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PIB‐PET to assess β‐amyloid aggregation (A+) and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG‐PET to account for neurodegeneration ((N)+). Magnetic resonance imaging‐based automated methods were used for HSV and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) measurements. Significant HSV reductions were found in A+(N)+ subjects in the presubiculum/subiculum complex and molecular layer, related to worse memory performance. In both the A+(N)+ and A+(N)− categories, subicular volumes were inversely correlated with the degree of Aβ deposition. The A−(N)+ subgroup showed reduced HSV relative to the A−(N)− subgroup also in the subiculum/presubiculum. Combining all (N)− subjects, HSV were lower in subjects presenting significant cognitive decline irrespective of A+/A− classification (controlling for WMH load); these between‐group differences were detected again in the presubiculum, but also involved the CA4 and granular layer. These findings demonstrate that differential HSV reductions are detectable both in (N)+ and (N)− categories along the AD continuum, and are directly related to the severity of cognitive deficits. HSV reductions are larger both in A+(N)+ and A+(N)− subjects in direct proportion to the degree of Aβ deposition. The meaningful HSV reductions detected in the A−(N)+ subgroup highlights the strength of biomarker‐based classifications outside of the classical AD continuum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Adipose tissue stem cells in peripheral nerve regeneration—In vitro and in vivo</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells (SCs) are crucially involved in several steps of the subsequent regenerative processes, such as the Wallerian degeneration. They promote lysis and phagocytosis of myelin, secrete numbers of neurotrophic factors and cytokines, and recruit macrophages for a biological debridement. However, nerve injuries with a defect size of &amp;gt;1 cm do not show proper tissue regeneration and require a surgical nerve gap reconstruction. To find a sufficient alternative to the current gold standard—the autologous nerve transplant—several cell‐based therapies have been developed and were experimentally investigated. One approach aims on the use of adipose tissue stem cells (ASCs). These are multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells that can differentiate into multiple phenotypes along the mesodermal lineage, such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and myocytes. Furthermore, ASCs also possess neurotrophic features, that is, they secrete neurotrophic factors like the nerve growth factor, brain‐derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin‐3, ciliary neurotrophic factor, glial cell‐derived neurotrophic factor, and artemin. They can also differentiate into the so‐called Schwann cell‐like cells (SCLCs). These cells share features with naturally occurring SCs, as they also promote nerve regeneration in the periphery. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the use of ASCs in peripheral nerve regeneration and peripheral nerve tissue engineering both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. While the sustainability of differentiation of ASCs to SCLCs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; is still questionable, ASCs used with different nerve conduits, such as hydrogels or silk fibers, have been shown to promote nerve regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adolescent alcohol drinking, primarily in the form of binge‐drinking episodes, is a serious public health concern. Binge drinking in laboratory animals has been modeled by a procedure involving chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) administration, as compared with chronic intermittent water (CIW). The prolonged effects of adolescent binge alcohol exposure in adults, such as high risk of developing alcohol use disorder, are severe but available treatments in the clinic are limited. One reason is the lack of sufficient understanding about the associated neuronal alterations. The involvement of the insular cortex, particularly the anterior agranular insula (AAI), has emerged as a critical region to explain neuronal mechanisms of substance abuse. This study was designed to evaluate the functional output of the AAI by measuring the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons from male rats 2 or 21 days after adolescent or adult CIE treatment. Decreases in intrinsic excitability in AAI pyramidal neurons were detected 21 days, relative to 2 days, after adolescent CIE. Interestingly, the decreased intrinsic excitability in the AAI pyramidal neurons was observed 2 days after adult CIE, compared to adult CIW, but no difference was found between 2 versus 21 days after adult CIE. These data indicate that, although the AAI is influenced within a limited period after adult but not adolescent CIE, neuronal alterations in AAI are affected during the prolonged period of withdrawal from adolescent but not adult CIE. This may explain the prolonged vulnerability to mental disorders of subjects with an alcohol binge history during their adolescent stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Efficacy of N‐acetylcysteine in the prevention of alcohol relapse‐like drinking: Study in long‐term ethanol‐experienced male rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d06f1489-2aee-4b66-8058-0fb4a8fe361d/jnr24736-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this research, the potential anti‐relapse efficacy of N‐acetylcysteine (NAC), using the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) model in long‐term experienced male Wistar rats, has been explored. Two different experiments were performed in order to: (a) test the efficacy of NAC to prevent relapse and (b) discriminate the best administration schedule (intermittent vs. continuous) for the drug. NAC subcutaneously administered, either by continuous infusion or by intermittent injections regimen, was able to block the ADE. The best results were obtained after using 60 mg/kg NAC dose under an intermittent regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use disorders are chronic and highly relapsing disorders, thus alcoholic patients have a high rate of recidivism for drug use even after long periods of abstinence. The literature points to the potential usefulness of N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) in the management of several substance use disorders probably due to its capacity to restore brain homeostasis of the glutamate system disrupted in addiction. However, there is little evidence in the case of alcohol. The aim of this study was to explore the potential anti‐relapse efficacy of NAC using the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) model in long‐term experienced rats. Two experiments were performed in male Wistar rats to: (a) test the efficacy of NAC to prevent relapse and (b) discriminate the best administration schedule (intermittent vs. continuous) for NAC. In the first experiment, animals were implanted with mini‐osmotic pumps delivering 0 or 1 mg/hr NAC during 14 days. In a second experiment, rats received 0, 60, or 100 mg/kg once daily by subcutaneous injection. The efficacy to prevent ADE was evaluated in both experiments. NAC subcutaneously administered, either by continuous infusion or by intermittent injections regimen, is able to block the ADE. The best results were obtained after using 60 mg/kg NAC dose. Our findings support the hypothesis that NAC may represent a valuable therapy in the management of alcohol relapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Cardiovascular risk factors and APOE‐ε4 status affect memory functioning in aging via changes to temporal stem diffusion</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Cardiovascular risk factors and APOE‐ε4 status affect memory functioning in aging via changes to temporal stem diffusion&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6e0c3a18-8f0c-4133-9a72-e3365d1f4272/jnr24734-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 125 healthy older adults we highlighted the importance of routinely accounting for factors that impact cognition both directly as well as indirectly via structural brain changes. Temporal stem diffusion changes demonstrated specificity for explaining the differential impacts of a number of cognitive risk factors on memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior research investigating associations between hypertension, obesity, and apolipoprotein (&lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;) genotype status with memory performance among older adults has yielded inconsistent results. This may reflect, in part, a lack of first accounting for the effects these variables have on structural brain changes, that in turn contribute to age‐related memory impairment. The current study sought to clarify the relationships between these factors via path modeling. We hypothesized that higher body mass index (BMI), hypertension, and being an &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;‐ε4 allele carrier would predict poorer memory scores, with much of these effects accounted for by indirect effects operating via differences in the integrity of temporal stem white matter. Participants included 125 healthy older adults who underwent neuropsychological assessment and diffusion‐weighted MRI scanning. Direct effects were found for hypertension and demographic variables including age, sex, and education. Importantly, indirect effects were found for BMI, hypertension, &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;‐ε4 status, age, and sex, where these factors predicted memory scores via their impact on temporal stem diffusion measures. There was also a dual effect of sex, with a direct effect indicating that females had better memory performance overall, and an indirect effect indicating that females with greater temporal stem diffusion had poorer memory performance. Results suggest that changes to the integrity of temporal white matter in aging may underpin reduced memory performance. These results highlight that accounting for variables that not only directly impact cognition, but also for those that indirectly impact cognition via structural brain changes, is crucial for understanding the impact of risk factors on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Noradrenaline protects neurons against H2O2‐induced death by increasing the supply of glutathione from astrocytes via β3‐adrenoceptor stimulation</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Noradrenaline protects neurons against H2O2‐induced death by increasing the supply of glutathione from astrocytes via β3‐adrenoceptor stimulation&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/46a8b127-5b57-4f51-801f-324ae557f560/jnr24733-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noradrenaline stimulates β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;‐adrenoceptor in astrocytes and increases the supply of glutathione from astrocytes to neurons, thereby increasing the intracellular glutathione concentration in neurons and protecting them from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐induced cell death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress has been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Astrocytes play a significant role in maintaining survival of neurons by supplying antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH) to neurons. Recently, we found that noradrenaline increased the intracellular GSH concentration in astrocytes via β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;‐adrenoceptor stimulation. These observations suggest that noradrenaline protects neurons from oxidative stress‐induced death by increasing the supply of GSH from astrocytes to neurons via the stimulation of β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;‐adrenoceptor in astrocytes. In the present study, we examined the protective effect of noradrenaline against H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐induced neurotoxicity using two different mixed cultures: the mixed culture of human astrocytoma U‐251 MG cells and human neuroblastoma SH‐SY5Y cells, and the mouse primary cerebrum mixed culture of neurons and astrocytes. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐induced neuronal cell death was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with noradrenaline in both mixed cultures but not in single culture of SH‐SY5Y cells or in mouse cerebrum neuron‐rich culture. The neuroprotective effect of noradrenaline was inhibited by SR59230A, a selective β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;‐adrenoceptor antagonist, and CL316243, a selective β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;‐adrenoceptor agonist, mimicked the neuroprotective effect of noradrenaline. DL‐buthionine‐[S,R]‐sulfoximine, a GSH synthesis inhibitor, negated the neuroprotective effect of noradrenaline in both mixed cultures. MK571, which inhibits the export of GSH from astrocytes mediated by multidrug resistance‐associated protein 1, also prevented the neuroprotective effect of noradrenaline. These results suggest that noradrenaline protects neurons against H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐induced death by increasing the supply of GSH from astrocytes via β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;‐adrenoceptor stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Facilitation of dopamine‐dependent long‐term potentiation in the medial prefrontal cortex of male rats follows the behavioral effects of stress&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/13d8353d-e069-42b0-839b-6eb8bcb76193/jnr24732-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress enhances dopamine (DA)‐long‐term potentiation but desipramine (DMI) abolishes this effect. DA‐long‐term depression is not affected unless when stress is followed by DMI. Stress reduces anxiety, an effect abolished by DMI/ketamine while motivation is always promoted. Stress also reduces cFOS expression in the ventral tegmental area in all conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of stress on animal behavior and brain activity has been attracting growing attention in the last decades. Stress dramatically affects several aspects of animal behavior, including motivation and cognitive functioning, and has been used to model human pathologies such as post‐traumatic stress disorder. A key question is whether stress alters the plastic potential of synaptic circuits. In this work, we evaluated if stress affects dopamine (DA)‐dependent synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). On male adolescent rats, we characterized anxiety‐ and depressive‐like behaviors using behavioral testing before and after exposure to a mild stress (elevated platform, EP). After the behavioral protocols, we investigated DA‐dependent long‐term potentiation (DA‐LTP) and depression (DA‐LTD) on acute slices of mPFC and evaluated the activation of DA‐producing brain regions by western and dot blot analysis. We show that exposure to the EP stress enhances DA‐LTP and that desipramine (DMI) treatment abolishes this effect. We also found that DA‐LTD is not affected by EP stress unless when this is followed by DMI treatment. In addition, EP stress reduces anxiety, an effect abolished by both DMI and ketamine, while motivation is promoted by previous exposure to EP stress independently of pharmacological treatments. Finally, this form of stress reduces the expression of the early gene cFOS in the ventral tegmental area. These findings support the idea that mild stressors can promote synaptic plasticity in PFC through a dopaminergic mechanism, an effect that might increase the sensitivity of mPFC to subsequent stressful experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the discovery of Rett Syndrome (RTT) genetic mutations, animal models have been developed. Sleep research in RTT animal models may unravel novel neural mechanisms for this severe neurodevelopmental heritable rare disease. In this systematic literature review we summarize the findings on sleep research of 13 studies in animal models of RTT. We found disturbed efficacy and continuity of sleep in all genetically mutated models of mice, cynomolgus monkeys, and &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Models presented highly fragmented sleep with distinct differences in 24‐hr sleep/wake cyclicity and circadian arrhythmicity. Overall, animal models mimic sleep complaints reported in individuals with RTT. However, contrary to human studies, in mutant mice, attenuated sleep delta waves, and sleep apneas in non‐rapid eye movement sleep were reported. Future studies may focus on sleep structure and EEG alterations, potential central mechanisms involved in sleep fragmentation and the occurrence of sleep apnea across different sleep stages. Given that locomotor dysfunction is characteristic of individuals with RTT, studies may consider to integrate its potential impact on the behavioral analysis of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroke severely impairs quality of life and has a high mortality rate. On the other hand, dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) prevents neuronal damage. In this review, we describe the effects of dietary DHA on ischemic stroke‐associated neuronal damage and its role in stroke prevention. Recent epidemiological studies have been conducted to analyze stroke prevention through DHA intake. The effects of dietary intake and supply of DHA to neuronal cells, DHA‐mediated inhibition of neuronal damage, and its mechanism, including the effects of the DHA metabolite, neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), were investigated. These studies revealed that DHA intake was associated with a reduced risk of stroke. Moreover, studies have shown that DHA intake may reduce stroke mortality rates. DHA, which is abundant in fish oil, passes through the blood–brain barrier to accumulate as a constituent of phospholipids in the cell membranes of neuronal cells and astrocytes. Astrocytes supply DHA to neuronal cells, and neuronal DHA, in turn, activates Akt and Raf‐1 to prevent neuronal death or damage. Therefore, DHA indirectly prevents neuronal damage. Furthermore, NDP1 blocks neuronal apoptosis. DHA, together with NPD1, may block neuronal damage and prevent stroke. The inhibitory effect on neuronal damage is achieved through the antioxidant (via inducing the Nrf2/HO‐1 system) and anti‐inflammatory effects (via promoting JNK/AP‐1 signaling) of DHA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Internal jugular vein compression, by means of an externally worn neck collar (right side of image), is a potentially viable solution to intervene on the diffusion and anisotropic properties of white matter that change following a season of American tackle football. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this clinical trial was to examine whether internal jugular vein compression (JVC)—using an externally worn neck collar—modulated the relationships between differential head impact exposure levels and pre‐ to postseason changes in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)‐derived diffusivity and anisotropy metrics of white matter following a season of American tackle football. Male high‐school athletes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 284) were prospectively assigned to a non‐collar group or a collar group. Magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from participants pre‐ and postseason and head impact exposure was monitored by accelerometers during every practice and game throughout the competitive season. Athletes' accumulated head impact exposure was systematically thresholded based on the frequency of impacts of progressively higher magnitudes (10 g intervals between 20 to 150 g) and modeled with pre‐ to postseason changes in DTI measures of white matter as a function of JVC neck collar wear. The findings revealed that the JVC neck collar modulated the relationships between greater high‐magnitude head impact exposure (110 to 140 g) and longitudinal changes to white matter, with each group showing associations that varied in directionality. Results also revealed that the JVC neck collar group partially preserved longitudinal changes in DTI metrics. Collectively, these data indicate that a JVC neck collar can provide a mechanistic response to the diffusion and anisotropic properties of brain white matter following the highly diverse exposure to repetitive head impacts in American tackle football.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Iron Heterogeneity in Early Active Multiple Sclerosis Lesions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25974?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25974?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous inflammatory demyelinating disease. Iron distribution is altered in MS patients' brains, suggesting iron liberation within active lesions amplifies demyelination and neurodegeneration. Whether the amount and distribution of iron are similar or different among different MS immunopatterns is currently unknown.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used synchrotron X‐ray fluorescence imaging, histology, and immunohistochemistry to compare the iron quantity and distribution between immunopattern II and III early active MS lesions. We analyzed archival autopsy and biopsy tissue from 21 MS patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunopattern II early active lesions contain 64% more iron (95% confidence interval [CI] = 17–127%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004) than immunopattern III lesions, and 30% more iron than the surrounding periplaque white matter (95% CI = 3–64%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). Iron in immunopattern III lesions is 28% lower than in the periplaque white matter (95% CI = −40 to −14%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). When normalizing the iron content of early active lesions to that of surrounding periplaque white matter, the ratio is significantly higher in immunopattern II (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Microfocused X‐ray fluorescence imaging shows that iron in immunopattern II lesions localizes to macrophages, whereas macrophages in immunopattern III lesions contain little iron.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron distribution and content are heterogeneous in early active MS lesions. Iron accumulates in macrophages in immunopattern II, but not immunopattern III lesions. This heterogeneity in the two most common MS immunopatterns may be explained by different macrophage polarization, origin, or different demyelination mechanisms, and paves the way for developing new or using existing iron‐sensitive magnetic resonance imaging techniques to differentiate among immunopatterns in the general nonbiopsied MS patient population.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Forebrain projection neurons target functionally diverse respiratory control areas in the midbrain, pons and medulla oblongata</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Forebrain projection neurons target functionally diverse respiratory control areas in the midbrain, pons and medulla oblongata&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9081be27-8f7e-4724-8cda-e2b294fe9757/cne25091-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiratory motor activity can be modulated by higher brain inputs. We hypothesized that forebrain regions send descending inputs to the respiratory control areas in the midbrain, pons, and medulla. Our data implies that i) volitional motor commands for vocalization are specifically relayed via the midbrain periaqueductal gray; ii) commands to coordinate breathing with other orofacial behaviors (e.g. sniffing, whisking, swallowing) target the pontine Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus, predominantly; iii) limbic or autonomic (interoceptive) systems are connected to broadly distributed downstream brainstem respiratory networks, including the medullary Bötzinger complex (BötC), pre‐Bötzinger complex (pre‐BötC), and caudal raphé nuclei. We provide a neural substrate to explain how volitional, state‐dependent, and emotional modulation of breathing is regulated by the forebrain.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eupnea is generated by neural circuits located in the ponto‐medullary brainstem, but can be modulated by higher brain inputs which contribute to volitional control of breathing and the expression of orofacial behaviors, such as vocalization, sniffing, coughing and swallowing. Surprisingly, the anatomical organization of descending inputs that connect the forebrain with the brainstem respiratory network remains poorly defined. We hypothesized that descending forebrain projections target multiple distributed respiratory control nuclei across the neuroaxis. To test our hypothesis, we made discrete unilateral microinjections of the retrograde tracer Cholera toxin subunit B (CT‐B) in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), the pontine Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus (KFn), the medullary Bötzinger complex (BötC), pre‐Bötzinger complex (pre‐BötC) or caudal midline raphé nuclei. We quantified the regional distribution of retrogradely‐labeled neurons in the forebrain 12‐14 days post‐injection. Overall, our data reveals that descending inputs from cortical areas predominantly target the PAG and KFn. Differential forebrain regions innervating the PAG (prefrontal, cingulate cortices, and lateral septum) and KFn (rhinal, piriform, and somatosensory cortices) imply that volitional motor commands for vocalization are specifically relayed via the PAG, while the KFn may receive commands to coordinate breathing with other orofacial behaviors (e.g. sniffing, swallowing). Additionally, we observed that the limbic or autonomic (interoceptive) systems are connected to broadly distributed downstream bulbar respiratory networks. Collectively, these data provide a neural substrate to explain how volitional, state‐dependent, and emotional modulation of breathing is regulated by the forebrain.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Strokectomy means surgical excision of infarcted brain tissue post-stroke with preservation of skull integrity, distinguishing it from decompressive hemicraniectomy. Both can mitigate malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) syndrome but evidence regarding strokectomy is sparse. Here, we report our data and meta-analysis of strokectomy compared to hemicraniectomy for malignant MCA infarction. All malignant MCA stroke cases requiring surgical intervention in a large tertiary centre (January 2012–December 2017, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 24) were analysed for craniotomy diameter, complications, length of follow-up and outcome measured using the modified Rankin score (mRS). Good outcome was defined as mRS 0–3 at 12 months. In a meta-analysis, outcome from strokectomy (pooled from our cohort and published strokectomy studies) was compared with hemicraniectomy (our cohort pooled with published DECIMAL, DESTINY and HAMLET clinical trial data). In our series (N = 24, 12/12 F/M; mean age: 45.83 ± 8.91, range 29–63 years), 4 patients underwent strokectomy (SC) and 20 hemicraniectomy (HC). Among SC patients, craniotomy diameter was smaller, relative to HC patients (86 ± 13.10 mm, 120 ± 4.10 mm, respectively; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003), complications were less common (25%, 55%) and poor outcomes were less common (25%, 70%). In the pooled data (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 41 SC, 71 HC), strokectomy tended towards good outcome more than hemicraniectomy (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.99–4.7; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.051). In conclusion, strokectomy may be non-inferior, lower risk and cost saving relative to hemicraniectomy sufficiently to be worthy of further investigation and maybe a randomised trial.

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemical synapse is the principal form of contact between neurons of the central nervous system. These synapses are typically configured as presynaptic axon terminations onto postsynaptic dendrites or somata, giving rise to axo‐dendritic and axo‐somatic synapses, respectively. Beyond these common synapse configurations are less‐studied, non‐canonical synapse types that are prevalent throughout the brain and significantly contribute to neural circuit function. Among these are the axo‐axonic synapses, which consist of an axon terminating on another axon or axon terminal. Here, we review evidence for axo‐axonic synapse contributions to neural signaling in the mammalian nervous system and survey functional neural circuit motifs enabled by these synapses. We also detail how recent advances in microscopy, transgenics, and biological sensors may be used to identify and functionally assay axo‐axonic synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Cardiac hypertrophy is a context-dependent phenomenon wherein a myriad of biochemical and biomechanical factors regulate myocardial growth through a complex large-scale signaling network. Although numerous studies have investigated hypertrophic signaling pathways, less is known about hypertrophy signaling as a whole network and how this network acts in a context-dependent manner. Here, we developed a systematic approach, CLASSED (Context-specific Logic-bASed Signaling nEtwork Development), to revise a large-scale signaling model based on context-specific data and identify main reactions and new crosstalks regulating context-specific response. CLASSED involves four sequential stages with an automated validation module as a core which builds a logic-based ODE model from the interaction graph and outputs the model validation percent. The context-specific model is developed by estimation of default parameters, classified qualitative validation, hybrid Morris-Sobol global sensitivity analysis, and discovery of missing context-dependent crosstalks. Applying this pipeline to our prior-knowledge hypertrophy network with context-specific data revealed key signaling reactions which distinctly regulate cell response to isoproterenol, phenylephrine, angiotensin II and stretch. Furthermore, with CLASSED we developed a context-specific model of β-adrenergic cardiac hypertrophy. The model predicted new crosstalks between calcium/calmodulin-dependent pathways and upstream signaling of Ras in the ISO-specific context. Experiments in cardiomyocytes validated the model’s predictions on the role of CaMKII-Gβγ and CaN-Gβγ interactions in mediating hypertrophic signals in ISO-specific context and revealed a difference in the phosphorylation magnitude and translocation of ERK1/2 between cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. CLASSED is a systematic approach for developing context-specific large-scale signaling networks, yielding insights into new-found crosstalks in β-adrenergic cardiac hypertrophy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TlW4AIWo_BY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Ten simple rules for creating a brand-new virtual academic meeting (even amid a pandemic)</title>

The increased democratization of the creation, implementation, and attendance of academic conferences has been a serendipitous benefit of the movement toward virtual meetings. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the transition to online conferences and, in parallel, their democratization, by necessity. This manifests not just in the mitigation of barriers to attending traditional physical conferences but also in the presentation of new, and more importantly attainable, opportunities for young scientists to carve out a niche in the landscape of academic meetings. Here, we describe an early “proof of principle” of this democratizing power via our experience organizing the Canadian Computational Neuroscience Spotlight (CCNS; crowdcast.io/e/CCNS), a free 2-day virtual meeting that was built entirely amid the pandemic using only virtual tools. While our experience was unique considering the obstacles faced in creating a conference during a pandemic, this was not the only factor differentiating both our experience and the resulting meeting from other contemporary online conferences. Specifically, CCNS was crafted entirely by early career researchers (ECRs) without any sponsors or partners, advertised primarily using social media and “word of mouth,” and designed specifically to highlight and engage trainees. From this experience, we have distilled “10 simple rules” as a blueprint for the design of new virtual academic meetings, especially in the absence of institutional support or partnerships, in this unprecedented environment. By highlighting the lessons learned in implementing our meeting under these arduous circumstances, we hope to encourage other young scientists to embrace this challenge, which would serve as a critical next step in further democratizing academic meetings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1ireKZLGZ0I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Boolean logic and arithmetic through DNA excision (BLADE) is a recently developed platform for implementing inducible and logical control over gene expression in mammalian cells, which has the potential to revolutionise cell engineering for therapeutic applications. This 2-input 2-output platform can implement 256 different logical circuits that exploit the specificity and stability of DNA recombination. Here, we develop the first mechanistic mathematical model of the 2-input BLADE platform based on Cre- and Flp-mediated DNA excision. After calibrating the model on experimental data from two circuits, we demonstrate close agreement between model outputs and data on the other 111 circuits that have so far been experimentally constructed using the 2-input BLADE platform. Model simulations of the remaining 143 circuits that have yet to be tested experimentally predict excellent performance of the 2-input BLADE platform across the range of possible circuits. Circuits from both the tested and untested subsets that perform less well consist of a disproportionally high number of STOP sequences. Model predictions suggested that circuit performance declines with a decrease in recombinase expression and new experimental data was generated that confirms this relationship.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HRamH5rpeLo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Adult neurogenesis alters response to an aversive distractor in a labyrinth maze without affecting spatial learning or memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23267?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult neurogenesis has been implicated in learning and memory of complex spatial environments. However, new neurons also play a role in nonmnemonic behavior, including the stress response and attention shifting. Many commonly used spatial tasks are very simple, and unsuitable for detecting neurogenesis effects, or are aversively motivated, making it difficult to dissociate effects on spatial learning and memory from effects on stress. We have therefore created a novel complex spatial environment, the flex maze, to enable reward‐mediated testing of spatial learning in a flexibly configurable labyrinth. Using a pharmacogenetic method to completely inhibit neurogenesis in adulthood, we found that rats lacking new neurons (TK rats) and wild type controls completed and remembered most mazes equally well. However, control rats were slower to complete peppermint‐scented mazes than other mazes, while neurogenesis‐deficient rats showed no effect of mint on maze behavior, completing these mazes significantly faster than control rats. Additional testing found that wild type and TK rats showed similar detection of, avoidance of, and glucocorticoid response to the mint odor. These results suggest that spatial learning and memory in a labyrinth task is unaffected by the loss of new neurons, but that these cells affect the ability of an aversive stimulus to distract rats from completing the maze.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Environmental deformations dynamically shift human spatial memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23265?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place and grid cells in the hippocampal formation are commonly thought to support a unified and coherent cognitive map of space. This mapping mechanism faces a challenge when a navigator is placed in a familiar environment that has been deformed from its original shape. Under such circumstances, many transformations could plausibly serve to map a navigator's familiar cognitive map to the deformed space. Previous empirical results indicate that the firing fields of rodent place and grid cells stretch or compress in a manner that approximately matches the environmental deformation, and human spatial memory exhibits similar distortions. These effects have been interpreted as evidence that reshaping a familiar environment elicits an analogously reshaped cognitive map. However, recent work has suggested an alternative explanation, whereby deformation‐induced distortions of the grid code are attributable to a mechanism that dynamically anchors grid fields to the most recently experienced boundary, thus causing history‐dependent shifts in grid phase. This interpretation raises the possibility that human spatial memory will exhibit similar history‐dependent dynamics. To test this prediction, we taught participants the locations of objects in a virtual environment and then probed their memory for these locations in deformed versions of this environment. Across three experiments with variable access to visual and vestibular cues, we observed the predicted pattern, whereby the remembered locations of objects were shifted from trial to trial depending on the boundary of origin of the participant's movement trajectory. These results provide evidence for a dynamic anchoring mechanism that governs both neuronal firing and spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is known to play a critical role in a variety of complex abilities, including visual‐spatial reasoning, social functioning, and math. Nonverbal learning disability (NVLD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in visual‐spatial reasoning that are accompanied by impairment in social function or mathematics, as well as motor or executive function skills. Despite the overlap between behaviors supported by the hippocampus and impairments in NVLD, the structure and function of the hippocampus in NVLD has not been studied. To address this gap in the literature, we first compared hippocampal volume and resting‐state functional connectivity in children with NVLD (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 24) and typically developing (TD) children (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20). We then explored associations between hippocampal structure, connectivity, and performance on measures of spatial, social, and mathematical ability. Relative to TD children, those with NVLD showed significant reductions in left hippocampal volume and greater hippocampal‐cerebellar connectivity. In children with NVLD, reduced hippocampal volume associated with worse mathematical problem solving. Although children with NVLD exhibited more social problems (social responsiveness scale [SRS]) and higher hippocampal‐cerebellar connectivity relative to TD children, greater connectivity was associated with fewer social problems among children with NVLD but not TD children. Such an effect may suggest a compensatory mechanism. These structural and functional alterations of the hippocampus may disrupt its putative role in organizing conceptual frameworks through cognitive mapping, thus contributing to the cross‐domain difficulties that characterize NVLD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Chronic activation of fear engrams induces extinction‐like behavior in ethanol‐exposed mice</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol withdrawal directly impacts the brain's stress and memory systems, which may underlie individual susceptibility to persistent drug and alcohol‐seeking behaviors. Numerous studies demonstrate that forced alcohol abstinence, which may lead to withdrawal, can impair fear‐related memory processes in rodents such as extinction learning; however, the underlying neural circuits mediating these impairments remain elusive. Here, we tested an optogenetic strategy aimed at mitigating fear extinction retrieval impairments in male c57BL/6 mice following exposure to alcohol (i.e., ethanol) and forced abstinence. In the first experiment, extensive behavioral extinction training in a fear‐conditioned context was impaired in ethanol‐exposed mice compared to controls. In the second experiment, neuronal ensembles processing a contextual fear memory in the dorsal hippocampus were tagged and optogenetically reactivated repeatedly in a distinct context in ethanol‐exposed and control mice. Chronic activation of these cells resulted in a context‐specific, extinction‐like reduction in fear responses in both control and ethanol‐exposed mice. These findings suggest that while ethanol can impair the retrieval an extinction memory, optogenetic manipulation of a fear engram is sufficient to induce an extinction‐like reduction in fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: New boundaries and dissociation of the mouse hippocampus along the dorsal‐ventral axis based on glutamatergic, GABAergic and catecholaminergic receptor densities</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23262?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23262?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rodents, gene‐expression, neuronal tuning, connectivity and neurogenesis studies have postulated that the dorsal, the intermediate and the ventral hippocampal formation (HF) are distinct entities. These findings are underpinned by behavioral studies showing a dissociable role of dorsal and ventral HF in learning, memory, stress and emotional processing. However, up to now, the molecular basis of such differences in relation to discrete boundaries is largely unknown. Therefore, we analyzed binding site densities for glutamatergic AMPA, NMDA, kainate and mGluR&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;, GABAergic GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (including benzodiazepine binding sites), GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, dopaminergic D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt; and noradrenergic α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors as key modulators for signal transmission in hippocampal functions, using quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography along the dorsal‐ventral axis of the mouse HF. Beside general different receptor profiles of the dentate gyrus (DG) and Cornu Ammonis fields (CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4/hilus), we detected substantial differences between dorsal, intermediate and ventral subdivisions and individual layers for all investigated receptor types, except GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, striking higher densities of α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors were detected in the ventral DG, while the dorsal DG possesses higher numbers of kainate, NMDA, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. CA1 dorsal and intermediate subdivisions showed higher AMPA, NMDA, mGluR&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, while kainate receptors are higher expressed in ventral CA1, and noradrenergic α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the intermediate region of CA1. CA2 dorsal was distinguished by higher kainate, α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the intermediate region, while CA3 showed a more complex dissociation. Our findings resulted not only in a clear segmentation of the mouse hippocampus along the dorsal‐ventral axis, but also provides insights into the neurochemical basis and likely associated physiological processes in hippocampal functions. Therein, the presented data has a high impact for future studies modeling and investigating dorsal, intermediate and ventral hippocampal dysfunction in relation to neurodegenerative diseases or psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: In the temporal organization of episodic memory, the hippocampus supports the experience of elapsed time</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23261?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23261?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Space and time are both essential features of episodic memory, for which the hippocampus is critical (Howard &amp;amp; Eichenbaum, 2015). Spatial tasks have been used effectively to study the behavioral relevance of place cells. However, the behavioral paradigms utilized for the study of time cells have not used time duration as a variable that animals need to be aware of to solve the task. Therefore, the behavioral relevance of this cell firing is unclear. In order to directly study the role of the hippocampus in processing elapsed time, we created a novel time duration discrimination task. Rats learned to make a decision to turn left or right depending on the preceding tone duration (10 s, left turn; 20 s, right turn). Once the rats reached criterion performance of 90% correct on two out of three consecutive days, they received either an excitotoxic hippocampal lesion or a sham‐lesion surgery. After recovery, rats were tested to determine hippocampal involvement in discriminating time duration. Rats with hippocampal lesions performed at chance level on their first testing day postlesion, and they were impaired relative to the sham‐lesioned rats. Although the hippocampal‐lesioned rats began discriminating at above chance level, their performance never returned to criterion even with 50 days of postoperative testing. Furthermore, while sham rats showed no difference in the number of errors they made on 10‐ versus 20‐s delay trials, hippocampal lesion rats similarly improved their performance under the 10‐s delay condition, but not under the 20‐s delay condition. Results indicate that hippocampal lesions resulted in a selective impairment in discriminating elapsed time only during the longer delay trials. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to the limits of working‐memory capacity and to the role of sustained hippocampal time cell activity in memory performance depending on the perceived relevance of the delay period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Reminders activate the prefrontal‐medial temporal cortex and attenuate forgetting of event memory</title>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23260?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replicas of an aspect of an experienced event can serve as effective reminders, yet little is known about the neural basis of such reminding effects. Here we examined the neural activity underlying the memory‐enhancing effect of reminders 1 week after encoding of naturalistic film clip events. We used fMRI to determine differences in network activity associated with recently reactivated memories relative to comparably aged, non‐reactivated memories. Reminders were effective in facilitating overall retrieval of memory for film clips, in an all‐or‐none fashion. Prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were activated during both reminders and retrieval. Peak activation in ventro‐lateral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) preceded peak activation in the right hippocampus during the reminders. For film clips that were successfully retrieved after 7 days, pre‐retrieval reminders did not enhance the quality of the retrieved memory or the number of details retrieved, nor did they more strongly engage regions of the recollection network than did successful retrieval of a non‐reminded film clip. These results suggest that reminders prior to retrieval are an effective means of boosting retrieval of otherwise inaccessible episodic events, and that the inability to recall certain events after a delay of a week largely reflects a retrieval deficit, rather than a storage deficit for this information. The results extend other evidence that vPFC drives activation of the hippocampus to facilitate memory retrieval and scene construction, and show that this facilitation also occurs when reminder cues precede successful retrieval attempts. The time course of vPFC‐hippocampal activity during the reminder suggests that reminders may first engage schematic information meditated by vPFC followed by a recollection process mediated by the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Age‐related alterations in functional connectivity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus and its subfields</title>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23259?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal circuit alterations that differentially affect hippocampal subfields are associated with age‐related memory decline. Additionally, functional organization along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus has revealed distinctions between anterior and posterior (A‐P) connectivity. Here, we examined the functional connectivity (FC) differences between young and older adults at high‐resolution within the medial temporal lobe network (entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices), allowing us to explore how hippocampal subfield connectivity across the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus changes with age. Overall, we found reliably greater connectivity for younger adults than older adults between the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and perirhinal cortex (PRC). This drop in functional connectivity was more pronounced in the anterior regions of the hippocampus than the posterior ones, consistent for each of the hippocampal subfields. Further, intra‐hippocampal connectivity also reflected an age‐related decrease in functional connectivity within the anterior hippocampus in older adults that was offset by an increase in posterior hippocampal functional connectivity. Interestingly, the anterior–posterior dysfunction in older adults between hippocampus and PHC was predictive of lure discrimination performance on the Mnemonic similarity task (MST), suggesting a role in memory performance. While age‐related dysfunction within the hippocampal subfields has been well‐documented, these results suggest that the age‐related dysfunction in hippocampal connectivity across the longitudinal axis may also contribute significantly to memory decline in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Visual opsin expression and morphological characterisation of retinal photoreceptors in the pouched lamprey (Geotria australis, Gray)</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Visual opsin expression and morphological characterisation of retinal photoreceptors in the pouched lamprey (Geotria australis, Gray)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8ab52caa-30c6-468f-a878-6324ca514db9/cne25092-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multidisciplinary approach was applied to assign the expression of different visual opsin classes to specific photoreceptor subtypes in &lt;i&gt;G. australis&lt;/i&gt;. Five discrete photoreceptor subtypes were identified in the retina, each containing one of five classes of visual opsin. This suggests that &lt;i&gt;G. australis&lt;/i&gt; has the potential for complex colour vision.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lampreys are extant members of the agnathan (jawless) vertebrates that diverged ~500 million years ago (MYA), during a critical stage of vertebrate evolution when image‐forming eyes first emerged. Amongst lamprey species assessed thus far, the retina of the southern hemisphere pouched lamprey, &lt;i&gt;Geotria australis&lt;/i&gt;, is unique, in that it possesses morphologically‐distinct photoreceptors and expresses five visual photopigments. This study focused on determining the number of different photoreceptors present in the retina of &lt;i&gt;G. australis&lt;/i&gt; and whether each cell type expresses a single opsin class. Five photoreceptor subtypes were identified based on ultrastructure and differential expression of one of each of the five different visual opsin classes (&lt;i&gt;lws&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sws1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sws2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;rh1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;rh2&lt;/i&gt;) known to be expressed in the retina. This suggests, therefore, that the retina of &lt;i&gt;G. australis&lt;/i&gt; possesses five spectrally and morphologically‐distinct photoreceptors, with the potential for complex colour vision. Each photoreceptor subtype was shown to have a specific spatial distribution in the retina, which is potentially associated with changes in spectral radiance across different lines of sight. These results suggest that there have been strong selection pressures for &lt;i&gt;G. australis&lt;/i&gt; to maintain broad spectral sensitivity for the brightly‐lit surface waters that this species inhabits during its marine phase. These findings provide important insights into the functional anatomy of the early vertebrate retina and the selection pressures that may have led to the evolution of complex colour vision.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: SynapsEM: Computer-Assisted Synapse Morphometry</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The structural features of a synapse help determine its function. Synapses are extremely small and tightly packed with vesicles and other organelles. Visualizing synaptic structure requires imaging by electron microscopy, and the features in micrographs must be quantified, a process called morphometry. Three parameters are typically assessed from each specimen: (1) the sizes of individual vesicles and organelles; (2) the absolute number and densities of organelles; and (3) distances between organelles and key features at synapses, such as active zone membranes and dense projections. For data to be meaningful, the analysis must be repeated from hundreds to thousands of images from several biological replicates, a daunting task. Here we report a custom computer program to analyze key structural features of synapses: SynapsEM. In short, we developed ImageJ/Fiji macros to record x,y-coordinates of segmented structures. The coordinates are then exported as text files. Independent investigators can reload the images and text files to reexamine the segmentation using ImageJ. The Matlab program then calculates and reports key synaptic parameters from the coordinates. Since the values are calculated from coordinates, rather than measured from each micrograph, other parameters such as locations of docked vesicles relative to the center of an active zone can be extracted in Matlab by additional scripting. Thus, this program can accelerate the morphometry of synapses and promote a more comprehensive analysis of synaptic ultrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: GABA Measurement in a Neonatal Fragile X Syndrome Mouse Model Using 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.612685</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenetic cause of autism spectrum disorder and inherited cause of intellectual disability that affects approximately one in 7,000 males and one in 11,000 females. In FXS, the Fmr1 gene is silenced and prevents the expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) that directly targets mRNA transcripts of multiple GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; subunits. Therefore, FMRP loss adversely impacts the neuronal firing of the GABAergic system which creates an imbalance in the excitatory/inhibitory ratio within the brain. Current FXS treatment strategies focus on curing symptoms, such as anxiety or decreased social function. While treating symptoms can be helpful, incorporating non-invasive imaging to evaluate how treatments change the brain’s biology may explain what molecular aberrations are associated with disease pathology. Thus, the GABAergic system is suitable to explore developing novel therapeutic strategies for FXS. To understand how the GABAergic system may be affected by this loss-of-function mutation, GABA concentrations were examined within the frontal cortex and thalamus of 5-day-old wild type and Fmr1 knockout mice using both &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H magnetic resonance imaging (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Our objective was to develop a reliable scanning method for neonatal mice in vivo and evaluate whether &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS is suitable to capture regional GABA concentration differences at the front end of the critical cortical period where abnormal neurodevelopment occurs due to FMRP loss is first detected. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS quantified GABA concentrations in both frontal cortex and thalamus of wild type and Fmr1 knockout mice. To substantiate the results of our &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS studies, in vitro LC-MS/MS was also performed on brain homogenates from age-matched mice. We found significant changes in GABA concentration between the frontal cortex and thalamus within each mouse from both wild type and Fmr1 knockout mice using &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS and LC-MS/MS. Significant GABA levels were also detected in these same regions between wild type and Fmr1 knockout mice by LC-MS/MS, validating that FMRP loss directly affects the GABAergic system. Thus, these new findings support the need to develop an effective non-invasive imaging method to monitor novel GABAergic strategies aimed at treating patients with FXS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vision impairment and blindness in humans are most frequently caused by the degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells in the outer retina, as is the case for age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, retinal detachment and many other diseases. While inner retinal neurons survive degeneration, they undergo fundamental pathophysiological changes, collectively known as “remodeling.” Inner retinal remodeling downstream to photoreceptor death occurs across mammalian retinas from mice to humans, independently of the cause of degeneration. It results in pervasive spontaneous hyperactivity and membrane hyperpermeability in retinal ganglion cells, which funnel all retinal signals to the brain. Remodeling reduces light detection in vision-impaired patients and precludes meaningful vision restoration in blind individuals. In this review, we summarize current hypotheses proposed to explain remodeling and their potential medical significance highlighting the important role played by retinoic acid and its receptor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Role of NDE1 in the Development and Evolution of the Gyrified Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.617513</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An expanded cortex is a hallmark of human neurodevelopment and endows increased cognitive capabilities. Recent work has shown that the cell cycle-related gene NDE1 is essential for proper cortical development. Patients who have mutations in NDE1 exhibit congenital microcephaly as a primary phenotype. At the cellular level, NDE1 is essential for interkinetic nuclear migration and mitosis of radial glial cells, which translates to an indispensable role in neurodevelopment. The nuclear migration function of NDE1 is well conserved across Opisthokonta. In mammals, multiple isoforms containing alternate terminal exons, which influence the functionality of NDE1, have been reported. It has been noted that the pattern of terminal exon usage mirrors patterns of cortical complexity in mammals. To provide context to these findings, here, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature regarding NDE1, its molecular biology and physiological relevance at the cellular and organismal levels. In particular, we outline the potential roles of NDE1 in progenitor cell behavior and explore the spectrum of NDE1 pathogenic variants. Moreover, we assessed the evolutionary conservation of NDE1 and interrogated whether the usage of alternative terminal exons is characteristic of species with gyrencephalic cortices. We found that gyrencephalic species are more likely to express transcripts that use the human-associated terminal exon, whereas lissencephalic species tend to express transcripts that use the mouse-associated terminal exon. Among gyrencephalic species, the human-associated terminal exon was preferentially expressed by those with a high order of gyrification. These findings underscore phylogenetic relationships between the preferential usage of NDE1 terminal exon and high-order gyrification, which provide insight into cortical evolution underlying high-order brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is usually based on clinical symptoms and signs of damage to the central nervous system, which is assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. The correct interpretation of these data requires excellent clinical expertise and experience. Deep neural networks aim to assist clinicians in identifying MS using imaging data. However, before such networks can be integrated into clinical workflow, it is crucial to understand their classification strategy. In this study, we propose to use a convolutional neural network to identify MS patients in combination with attribution algorithms to investigate the classification decisions. The network was trained using images acquired with susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), which is known to be sensitive to the presence of paramagnetic iron components and is routinely applied in imaging protocols for MS patients. Different attribution algorithms were used to the trained network resulting in heatmaps visualizing the contribution of each input voxel to the classification decision. Based on the quantitative image perturbation method, we selected DeepLIFT heatmaps for further investigation. Single-subject analysis revealed veins and adjacent voxels as signs for MS, while the population-based study revealed relevant brain areas common to most subjects in a class. This pattern was found to be stable across different echo times and also for a multi-echo trained network. Intensity analysis of the relevant voxels revealed a group difference, which was found to be primarily based on the T1w magnitude images, which are part of the SWI calculation. This difference was not observed in the phase mask data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta and formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Microglia activation and neuroinflammation play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD; Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)—a key component of the innate immune system—in microglia is also thought to be involved based on the observed association between TLR gene polymorphisms and AD risk. TLR4 has been shown to exert both detrimental and beneficial effects on AD-related pathologies. In preclinical models, experimental manipulations targeting TLR4 were shown to improve learning and memory, which was related to inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine release and reduction of oxidative stress. In this review, we summarize the key evidence supporting TLR4 as a promising therapeutic target in AD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Prefrontal Asymmetry BCI Neurofeedback Datasets</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.601402</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prefrontal cortex (PFC) asymmetry is an important marker in affective neuroscience and has attracted significant interest, having been associated with studies of motivation, eating behavior, empathy, risk propensity, and clinical depression. The data presented in this paper are the result of three different experiments using PFC asymmetry neurofeedback (NF) as a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) paradigm, rather than a therapeutic mechanism aiming at long-term effects, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) which is known to be particularly well-suited to the study of PFC asymmetry and is less sensitive to artifacts. From an experimental perspective the BCI context brings more emphasis on individual subjects' baselines, successful and sustained activation during epochs, and minimal training. The subject pool is also drawn from the general population, with less bias toward specific behavioral patterns, and no inclusion of any patient data. We accompany our datasets with a detailed description of data formats, experiment and protocol designs, as well as analysis of the individualized metrics for definitions of success scores based on baseline thresholds as well as reference tasks. The work presented in this paper is the result of several experiments in the domain of BCI where participants are interacting with continuous visual feedback following a real-time NF paradigm, arising from our long-standing research in the field of affective computing. We offer the community access to our fNIRS datasets from these experiments. We specifically provide data drawn from our empirical studies in the field of affective interactions with computer-generated narratives as well as interfacing with algorithms, such as heuristic search, which all provide a mechanism to improve the ability of the participants to engage in active BCI due to their realistic visual feedback. Beyond providing details of the methodologies used where participants received real-time NF of left-asymmetric increase in activation in their dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), we re-establish the need for carefully designing protocols to ensure the benefits of NF paradigm in BCI are enhanced by the ability of the real-time visual feedback to adapt to the individual responses of the participants. Individualized feedback is paramount to the success of NF in BCIs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: CT-Guided Pulsed Radiofrequency at Different Voltages in the Treatment of Postherpetic Neuralgia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.579486</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.579486</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a form of long-lasting neuropathic pain that can severely affect patients’ quality of life. Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) has been proven to be effective in treating PHN, but the optimal radiofrequency parameters are still not well defined. This retrospective study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of CT-guided PRF at three different voltages for the treatment of PHN patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This study included 109 patients with PHN involving the thoracic dermatome who were treated in the Department of Pain Management of Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, from January 2017 to May 2019. They were divided into three groups based on the PRF voltage used: group A (45 V), group B (55 V), and group C (65 V). The PRF therapy (voltage 45, 55, and 65 V) was performed in all patients by targeting the thoracic dorsal root ganglion. After surgery, patients were followed at 3 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Observation at each follow-up included basic patient characteristics, visual analog scale (VAS), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores, patient satisfaction, complications, and side effects.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Visual analog scale scores decreased and SF-36 scores increased for all patients in the three groups at each post-operative time point (1, 3, 6, and 12 months; all P &amp;lt; 0.01). Pain relief, improvement in quality of life, and overall satisfaction were more significant for patients in group C than for those in groups A and B at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups (all P &amp;lt; 0.05). Patients in group B had lower VAS scores and higher overall satisfaction levels than those in group A (both P &amp;lt; 0.01). A small number of patients from each group (n ≤ 3) experienced mild intraoperative and post-operative complications, which bore no relationship with group assignment (all P &amp;gt; 0.05). At post-operative day 3, patients in group C had skin numbness affecting a larger area than patients in the other two groups (both P &amp;lt; 0.05), but the differences were no longer statistically significant at day 30 after the operation. All patients experienced a drop in numbness area of more than 30% after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Compared with PFR at 45 and 55 V, PFR at 65 V had superior efficacy in treating PNH, with a favorable safety profile.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Sensorimotor Functional Connectivity: A Neurophysiological Factor Related to BCI Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.575081</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.575081</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems that allow users to control devices using brain activity alone. However, the ability of participants to command BCIs varies from subject to subject. About 20% of potential users of sensorimotor BCIs do not gain reliable control of the system. The inefficiency to decode user's intentions requires the identification of neurophysiological factors determining “good” and “poor” BCI performers. One of the important neurophysiological aspects in BCI research is that the neuronal oscillations, used to control these systems, show a rich repertoire of spatial sensorimotor interactions. Considering this, we hypothesized that neuronal connectivity in sensorimotor areas would define BCI performance. Analyses for this study were performed on a large dataset of 80 inexperienced participants. They took part in a calibration and an online feedback session recorded on the same day. Undirected functional connectivity was computed over sensorimotor areas by means of the imaginary part of coherency. The results show that post- as well as pre-stimulus connectivity in the calibration recording is significantly correlated to online feedback performance in μ and feedback frequency bands. Importantly, the significance of the correlation between connectivity and BCI feedback accuracy was not due to the signal-to-noise ratio of the oscillations in the corresponding post and pre-stimulus intervals. Thus, this study demonstrates that BCI performance is not only dependent on the amplitude of sensorimotor oscillations as shown previously, but that it also relates to sensorimotor connectivity measured during the preceding training session. The presence of such connectivity between motor and somatosensory systems is likely to facilitate motor imagery, which in turn is associated with the generation of a more pronounced modulation of sensorimotor oscillations (manifested in ERD/ERS) required for the adequate BCI performance. We also discuss strategies for the up-regulation of such connectivity in order to enhance BCI performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effect of Bilingualism on Cue-Based vs. Memory-Based Task Switching in Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.610548</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.610548</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest a positive impact of bilingualism on cognition, including the later onset of dementia. However, it is not clear to what extent these effects are influenced by variations in attentional control demands in response to specific task requirements. In this study, 20 bilingual and 20 monolingual older adults performed a task-switching task under explicit task-cuing vs. memory-based switching conditions. In the cued condition, task switches occurred in random order and a visual cue signaled the next task to be performed. In the memory-based condition, the task alternated after every second trial in a predictable sequence without presenting a cue. The performance of bilinguals did not vary across experimental conditions, whereas monolinguals experienced a pronounced increase in response latencies and error rates in the cued condition. Both groups produced similar switch costs (difference in performance on switch trials as opposed to repeating trials within the mixed-task block) and mixing costs (difference in performance on repeat trials of a mixed-task block as opposed to trials of a single-task block), but bilinguals produced them with lower response latencies. The cognitive benefits of bilingualism seem not to apply to executive functions per se but to affect specific cognitive processes that involve task-relevant context processing. The present results suggest that lifelong bilingualism could promote in older adults a flexible adjustment to environmental cues, but only with increased task demands. However, due to the small sample size, the results should be interpreted with caution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Signal-Space Projection Suppresses the tACS Artifact in EEG Recordings</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.536070</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.536070</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;To probe the functional role of brain oscillations, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has proven to be a useful neuroscientific tool. Because of the excessive tACS-caused artifact at the stimulation frequency in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, tACS + EEG studies have been mostly limited to compare brain activity between recordings before and after concurrent tACS. Critically, attempts to suppress the artifact in the data cannot assure that the entire artifact is removed while brain activity is preserved. The current study aims to evaluate the feasibility of specific artifact correction techniques to clean tACS-contaminated EEG data.&lt;/p&gt;New Method&lt;p&gt;In the first experiment, we used a phantom head to have full control over the signal to be analyzed. Driving pre-recorded human brain-oscillation signals through a dipolar current source within the phantom, we simultaneously applied tACS and compared the performance of different artifact-correction techniques: sine subtraction, template subtraction, and signal-space projection (SSP). In the second experiment, we combined tACS and EEG on one human subject to demonstrate the best-performing data-correction approach in a proof of principle.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The tACS artifact was highly attenuated by SSP in the phantom and the human EEG; thus, we were able to recover the amplitude and phase of the oscillatory activity. In the human experiment, event-related desynchronization could be restored after correcting the artifact.&lt;/p&gt;Comparison With Existing Methods&lt;p&gt;The best results were achieved with SSP, which outperformed sine subtraction and template subtraction.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate the feasibility of SSP by applying it to a phantom measurement with pre-recorded signal and one human tACS + EEG dataset. For a full validation of SSP, more data are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Ion Channel and GPCR Toolkit of Brain Capillary Pericytes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.601324</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.601324</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain pericytes reside on the abluminal surface of capillaries, and their processes cover ~90% of the length of the capillary bed. These cells were first described almost 150 years ago (Eberth, 1871; Rouget, 1873) and have been the subject of intense experimental scrutiny in recent years, but their physiological roles remain uncertain and little is known of the complement of signaling elements that they employ to carry out their functions. In this review, we synthesize functional data with single-cell RNAseq screens to explore the ion channel and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) toolkit of mesh and thin-strand pericytes of the brain, with the aim of providing a framework for deeper explorations of the molecular mechanisms that govern pericyte physiology. We argue that their complement of channels and receptors ideally positions capillary pericytes to play a central role in adapting blood flow to meet the challenge of satisfying neuronal energy requirements from deep within the capillary bed, by enabling dynamic regulation of their membrane potential to influence the electrical output of the cell. In particular, we outline how genetic and functional evidence suggest an important role for G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled GPCRs and ATP-sensitive potassium (K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;) channels in this context. We put forth a predictive model for long-range hyperpolarizing electrical signaling from pericytes to upstream arterioles, and detail the TRP and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;, and G&lt;sub&gt;12/13&lt;/sub&gt; signaling processes that counterbalance this. We underscore critical questions that need to be addressed to further advance our understanding of the signaling topology of capillary pericytes, and how this contributes to their physiological roles and their dysfunction in disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Pregnancy Changes the Response of the Vomeronasal and Olfactory Systems to Pups in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.593309</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.593309</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motherhood entails changes in behavior with increased motivation for pups, induced in part by pregnancy hormones acting upon the brain. This work explores whether this alters sensory processing of pup-derived chemosignals. To do so, we analyse the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) in the vomeronasal organ (VNO; Egr1) and centers of the olfactory and vomeronasal brain pathways (cFos) in virgin and late-pregnant females exposed to pups, as compared to buttons (socially neutral control). In pup-exposed females, we quantified diverse behaviors including pup retrieval, sniffing, pup-directed attack, nest building and time in nest or on nest, as well as time off nest. Pups induce Egr1 expression in the VNO of females, irrespective of their physiological condition, thus suggesting the existence of VNO-detected pup chemosignals. A similar situation is found in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) and posteromedial part of the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTMPM). By contrast, in the medial amygdala and posteromedial cortical amygdala (PMCo), responses to pups-vs-buttons are different in virgin and late-pregnant females, thus suggesting altered sensory processing during late pregnancy. The olfactory system also shows changes in sensory processing with pregnancy. In the main olfactory bulbs, as well as the anterior and posterior piriform cortex, buttons activate cFos expression in virgins more than in pregnant females. By contrast, in the anterior and especially posterior piriform cortex, pregnant females show more activation by pups than buttons. Correlation between IEGs expression and behavior suggests the existence of two vomeronasal subsystems: one associated to pup care (with PMCo as its main center) and another related to pup-directed aggression observed in some pregnant females (with the BSTMPM as the main nucleus). Our data also suggest a coactivation of the olfactory and vomeronasal systems during interaction with pups in pregnant females.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Parvalbumin Hypothesis of Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.577525</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.577525</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)—a type of neurodevelopmental disorder—is increasing and is around 2% in North America, Asia, and Europe. Besides the known genetic link, environmental, epigenetic, and metabolic factors have been implicated in ASD etiology. Although highly heterogeneous at the behavioral level, ASD comprises a set of core symptoms including impaired communication and social interaction skills as well as stereotyped and repetitive behaviors. This has led to the suggestion that a large part of the ASD phenotype is caused by changes in a few and common set of signaling pathways, the identification of which is a fundamental aim of autism research. Using advanced bioinformatics tools and the abundantly available genetic data, it is possible to classify the large number of ASD-associated genes according to cellular function and pathways. Cellular processes known to be impaired in ASD include gene regulation, synaptic transmission affecting the excitation/inhibition balance, neuronal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling, development of short-/long-range connectivity (circuits and networks), and mitochondrial function. Such alterations often occur during early postnatal neurodevelopment. Among the neurons most affected in ASD as well as in schizophrenia are those expressing the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding protein parvalbumin (PV). These mainly inhibitory interneurons present in many different brain regions in humans and rodents are characterized by rapid, non-adaptive firing and have a high energy requirement. PV expression is often reduced at both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels in human ASD brain samples and mouse ASD (and schizophrenia) models. Although the human PVALB gene is not a high-ranking susceptibility/risk gene for either disorder and is currently only listed in the SFARI Gene Archive, we propose and present supporting evidence for the Parvalbumin Hypothesis, which posits that decreased PV level is causally related to the etiology of ASD (and possibly schizophrenia).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: A Systematic Approach to Dissection of the Equine Brain–Evaluation of a Species-Adapted Protocol for Beginners and Experts</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.614929</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.614929</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction of new imaging modalities for the equine brain have refocused attention on the horse as a natural model for ethological, neuroanatomical, and neuroscientific investigations. As opposed to imaging studies, strategies for equine neurodissection still lack a structured approach, standardization and reproducibility. In contrast to other species, where adapted protocols for sampling have been published, no comparable guideline is currently available for equids. Hence, we developed a species-specific slice protocol for whole brain vs. hemispheric dissection and tested its applicability and practicability in the field, as well as its neuroanatomical accuracy and reproducibility. Dissection steps are concisely described and depicted by schematic illustrations, photographs and instructional videos. Care was taken to show the brain in relation to the raters' hands, cutting devices and bench surface. Guidance is based on a minimum of external anatomical landmarks followed by geometric instructions that led to procurement of 14 targeted slabs. The protocol was performed on 55 formalin-fixed brains by three groups of investigators with different neuroanatomical skills. Validation of brain dissection outcomes addressed the aptitude of slabs for neuroanatomical studies as opposed to simplified routine diagnostic purposes. Across all raters, as much as 95.2% of slabs were appropriate for neuroanatomical studies, and 100% of slabs qualified for a routine diagnostic setting. Neither autolysis nor subfixation significantly affected neuroanatomical accuracy score, while a significant negative effect was observed with brain extraction artifacts. Procedure times ranged from 14 to 66 min and reached a mean duration of 23.25 ± 7.93 min in the last of five trials in inexperienced raters vs. 16 ± 2.83 min in experts, while acceleration of the dissection did not negatively impact neuroanatomical accuracy. This protocol, derived analogously to the consensus report of the International Veterinary Epilepsy Task Force in dogs and cats, allows for systematic, quick and easy dissection of the equine brain, even for inexperienced investigators. Obtained slabs feature virtually all functional subcompartments at suitable planes for both diagnostic and neuroscientific investigations and complement the data obtained from imaging studies. The instructive protocol and brain dissection videos are available in Supplementary Material.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Identification of Circular RNA hsa_Circ_0003391 in Peripheral Blood Is Potentially Associated With Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.601965</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.601965</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have recently been discovered as a novel type of endogenous non-coding RNA that may regulate gene expression in mammals. In the central nervous system (CNS), circRNAs are relevant to many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we attempted to identify an aberrant circRNA, hsa_circ_0003391, which is significantly downregulated in the peripheral blood of patients with AD, and to explore the relationship between hsa_circ_0003391 and the clinical manifestation of AD. The expression of hsa_circ_0003391 had a specific decrease in the peripheral blood of patients with AD compared to those with other types of dementia. To evaluate the potential diagnostic value of the circRNA, we performed a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) value was 0.7283 for hsa_circ_0003391, which was statistically significant. The natural form of hsa_circ_0003391 in the peripheral blood was a loop structure with good stability. We found a potential correlation between the expression of hsa_circ_0003391 and the clinical manifestations of AD. Bioinformatic analysis was carried out to predict the latent target microRNAs (miRNA) of hsa_circ_0003391. Furthermore, microRNAs targeted by hsa_circ_0003391 were successfully detected, and miR-574-5p had an expected elevation in the AD groups, suggesting that miR-574-5p might be a potential microRNA target for hsa_circ_0003391. Our results suggest that the downregulation of hsa_circ_0003391 in the peripheral blood has a potential relationship with AD. Our findings not only provide an important latent biomarker but also highlight an important perspective for the following study into AD pathogenesis. This may promote the process of novel therapeutics targeting non-coding RNA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to describe clinical features, [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]‐fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)‐positron emission tomography (PET) metabolism and digital pathology in patients with logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) and pathologic diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD) and compare to patients with LPA with other pathologies, as well as patients with classical features of probable dementia with Lewy bodies (pDLB).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a clinicopathologic case‐control study of 45 patients, including 20 prospectively recruited patients with LPA among whom 6 were diagnosed with LPA‐DLBD. We analyzed clinical features and compared FDG‐PET metabolism in LPA‐DLBD to an independent group of patients with clinical pDLB and regional α‐synuclein burden on digital pathology to a second independent group of autopsied patients with DLBD pathology and antemortem pDLB (DLB‐DLBD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All patients with LPA‐DLBD were men. Neurological, speech, and neuropsychological characteristics were similar across LPA‐DLBD, LPA‐Alzheimer's disease (LPA‐AD), and LPA‐frontotemporal lobar degeneration (LPA‐FTLD). Genetic screening of AD, DLBD, and FTLD linked genes were negative with the exception of &lt;i&gt;APOE ε4&lt;/i&gt; allele present in 83% of LPA‐DLBD patients. Seventy‐five percent of the patients with LPA‐DLBD showed a parietal‐dominant pattern of hy pometabolism; LPA‐FTLD – temporal‐dominant pattern, whereas LPA‐AD showed heterogeneous patterns of hypometabolism. LPA‐DLBD had more asymmetrical hypometabolism affecting frontal lobes, with relatively spared occipital lobe in the nondominantly affected hemisphere, compared to pDLB. LPA‐DLBD had minimal atrophy on gross brain examination, higher cortical Lewy body counts, and higher α‐synuclein burden in the middle frontal and inferior parietal cortices compared to DLB‐DLBD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas AD is the most frequent underlying pathology of LPA, DLBD can also be present and may contribute to the LPA phenotype possibly due to α‐synuclein‐associated functional impairment of the dominant parietal lobe. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Late onset of Synaptotagmin 2a expression at synapses relevant to social behavior&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/52452531-7cd0-4c9e-8325-0d104b85d5e9/cne25084-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During brain development, synapses form and are refined through the accumulation of different proteins. Here we examined the dynamic distribution of Synaptotagmin 2a (Syt2a) in the developing forebrain of zebrafish larvae with a focus on regions associated with social behavior. We show that Syt2a colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase, a protein important for behavior. Further, we found that Syt2a localizes to synapses onto neurons implicated in social behavior, with an increase of Syt2a expression coinciding with the emergence of social behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they form, synapses go through various stages of maturation and refinement. These steps are linked to significant changes in synaptic function, potentially resulting in emergence and maturation of behavioral outputs. Synaptotagmins are calcium‐sensing proteins of the synaptic vesicle exocytosis machinery, and changes in Synaptotagmin proteins at synapses have significant effects on vesicle release and synaptic function. Here, we examined the distribution of the synaptic vesicle protein Synaptotagmin 2a (Syt2a) during development of the zebrafish nervous system. Syt2a is widely distributed throughout the midbrain and hindbrain early during larval development but very weakly expressed in the forebrain. Later in development, Syt2a expression levels in the forebrain increase, particularly in regions associated with social behavior, and most intriguingly, around the time social behavior becomes apparent. We provide evidence that Syt2a localizes to synapses onto neurons implicated in social behavior in the ventral forebrain and show that Syt2a is colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase, a biosynthetic enzyme in the dopamine pathway. Our results suggest a developmentally important role for Syt2a in maturing synapses in the forebrain, coinciding with the emergence of social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pediatric Ischemic Stroke: An Infrequent Complication of SARS‐CoV‐2</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25991?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25991?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe complications of SARS‐CoV‐2 include arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) in adults and pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Whether stroke is a frequent complication of pediatric SARS‐CoV‐2 is unknown. This study aimed to determine the proportion of pediatric SARS‐CoV‐2 cases with ischemic stroke and the proportion of pediatric strokes with SARS‐CoV‐2 in the first three months of the pandemic in an international cohort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We surveyed 61 international sites with pediatric stroke expertise. Survey questions included: numbers of hospitalized pediatric (≤18 years) SARS‐CoV‐2 patients; numbers of incident neonatal and childhood ischemic strokes; frequency of SARS‐CoV‐2 testing for pediatric stroke patients; and numbers of stroke cases positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 March 1–May 31, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 42 centers with SAR‐CoV‐2 hospitalization numbers, 8/971 (0.82%) with SARS‐CoV‐2 had ischemic strokes. Proportions of stroke cases positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 from March–May 2020 were: 1/108 neonatal AIS (0.9%), 0/33 neonatal cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT; 0%), 6/166 childhood AIS (3.6%), and 1/54 childhood CSVT (1.9%) cases. However, only 30.5% of neonates and 60% of children with strokes were tested for SARS‐CoV‐2. Therefore, these proportions represent 2.9%, 0%, 6.1%, and 3.0% of stroke cases tested for SARS‐CoV‐2. Seven of eight with SARS‐CoV‐2 had additional established stroke risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in adults, pediatric stroke is an infrequent complication of SARS‐CoV‐2, and SARS‐CoV‐2 was detected in only 4.7% of pediatric ischemic stroke patients tested. However, &amp;lt;50% of strokes were tested. SARS‐CoV‐2 testing should be considered in pediatric stroke patients as the pandemic continues to determine SARS‐CoV‐2’s role in pediatric stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

Reverse transcription, an essential event in the HIV-1 life cycle, requires deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) to fuel DNA synthesis, thus requiring penetration of dNTPs into the viral capsid. The central cavity of the capsid protein (CA) hexamer reveals itself as a plausible channel that allows the passage of dNTPs into assembled capsids. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of nucleotide import into the capsid remains unknown. Employing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we established that cooperative binding between nucleotides inside a CA hexamer cavity results in energetically favorable conditions for passive translocation of dNTPs into the HIV-1 capsid. Furthermore, binding of the host cell metabolite inositol hexakisphosphate (IP&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) enhances dNTP import, while binding of synthesized molecules like benzenehexacarboxylic acid (BHC) inhibits it. The enhancing effect on reverse transcription by IP&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and the consequences of interactions between CA and nucleotides were corroborated using atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and virological assays. Collectively, our results provide an atomistic description of the permeability of the HIV-1 capsid to small molecules and reveal a novel mechanism for the involvement of metabolites in HIV-1 capsid stabilization, nucleotide import, and reverse transcription.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CpYzL7eAJF4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Daptomycin treatment impacts resistance in off-target populations of vancomycin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecium&lt;/i&gt;</title>

The antimicrobial resistance crisis has persisted despite broad attempts at intervention. It has been proposed that an important driver of resistance is selection imposed on bacterial populations that are not the intended target of antimicrobial therapy. But to date, there has been limited quantitative measure of the mean and variance of resistance following antibiotic exposure. Here we focus on the important nosocomial pathogen &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecium&lt;/i&gt; in a hospital system where resistance to daptomycin is evolving despite standard interventions. We hypothesized that the intravenous use of daptomycin generates off-target selection for resistance in transmissible gastrointestinal (carriage) populations of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;faecium&lt;/i&gt;. We performed a cohort study in which the daptomycin resistance of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;faecium&lt;/i&gt; isolated from rectal swabs from daptomycin-exposed patients was compared to a control group of patients exposed to linezolid, a drug with similar indications. In the daptomycin-exposed group, daptomycin resistance of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;faecium&lt;/i&gt; from the off-target population was on average 50% higher than resistance in the control group (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 428 clones from 22 patients). There was also greater phenotypic diversity in daptomycin resistance within daptomycin-exposed patients. In patients where multiple samples over time were available, a wide variability in temporal dynamics were observed, from long-term maintenance of resistance to rapid return to sensitivity after daptomycin treatment stopped. Sequencing of isolates from a subset of patients supports the argument that selection occurs within patients. Our results demonstrate that off-target gastrointestinal populations rapidly respond to intravenous antibiotic exposure. Focusing on the off-target evolutionary dynamics may offer novel avenues to slow the spread of antibiotic resistance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Kkmye7te-0c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Infection-induced 5′-half molecules of tRNA&lt;sup&gt;HisGUG&lt;/sup&gt; activate Toll-like receptor 7</title>

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role in the innate immune response. Although endosomal TLR7 recognizes single-stranded RNAs, their endogenous RNA ligands have not been fully explored. Here, we report 5′-tRNA half molecules as abundant activators of TLR7. Mycobacterial infection and accompanying surface TLR activation up-regulate the expression of 5′-tRNA half molecules in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs). The abundant accumulation of 5′-tRNA halves also occur in HMDM-secreted extracellular vehicles (EVs); the abundance of EV-5′-tRNA&lt;sup&gt;HisGUG&lt;/sup&gt; half molecules is &amp;gt;200-fold higher than that of the most abundant EV-microRNA (miRNA). Sequence identification of the 5′-tRNA halves using cP-RNA-seq revealed abundant and selective packaging of specific 5′-tRNA half species into EVs. The EV-5′-tRNA&lt;sup&gt;HisGUG&lt;/sup&gt; half was experimentally demonstrated to be delivered into endosomes in recipient cells and to activate endosomal TLR7. Up-regulation of the 5′-tRNA half molecules was also observed in the plasma of patients infected with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;. These results unveil a novel tRNA-engaged pathway in the innate immune response and assign the role of “immune activators” to 5′-tRNA half molecules.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tpa9O3HlOqo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Gpr37l1/prosaposin receptor regulates Ptch1 trafficking, Shh production, and cell proliferation in cerebellar primary astrocytes&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4c70874a-1089-4feb-bb57-ecb5e47a5e41/jnr24775-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic ablation of G protein‐coupled receptor 37‐like 1 results in increased patched 1 expression and internalization. This leads to the intracellular accumulation of cholesterol, with concomitant stimulation of sonic hedgehog (Shh) production and activation of Shh‐induced proliferative signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mammalian cerebellar astrocytes critically regulate the differentiation and maturation of neuronal Purkinje cells and granule precursors. The G protein‐coupled receptor 37‐like 1 (Gpr37l1) is expressed by Bergmann astrocytes and interacts with patched 1 (Ptch1) at peri‐ciliary membranes. Cerebellar primary astrocyte cultures from wild‐type and &lt;i&gt;Gpr37l1&lt;/i&gt; null mutant mouse pups were established and studied. Primary cilia were produced by cultures of both genotypes, as well as Ptch1 and smoothened (Smo) components of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) mitogenic pathway. Compared to wild‐type cells, &lt;i&gt;Gpr37l1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; astrocytes displayed striking increases in proliferative activity, Ptch1 protein expression and internalization, intracellular cholesterol content, ciliary localization of Smo, as well as a marked production of active Shh. Similar effects were reproduced by treating wild‐type astrocytes with a putative prosaptide ligand of Gpr37l1. These findings indicate that Gpr37l1–Ptch1 interactions specifically regulate Ptch1 internalization and trafficking, with consequent stimulation of Shh production and activation of proliferative signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Modulation of the Acetylcholine Receptor Clustering Pathway Improves Neuromuscular Junction Structure and Muscle Strength in a Mouse Model of Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.594220</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.594220</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a diverse group of inherited neuromuscular disorders characterized by a failure of synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). CMS often present early with fatigable weakness and can be fatal through respiratory complications. The AGRN gene is one of over 30 genes known to harbor mutations causative for CMS. In this study, we aimed to determine if a compound (NT1654), developed to stimulate the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering pathway, would benefit a mouse model of CMS caused by a loss-of-function mutation in Agrn (Agrn&lt;sup&gt;nmf380&lt;/sup&gt; mouse).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:Agrn&lt;sup&gt;nmf380&lt;/sup&gt; mice received an injection of either NT1654 or vehicle compound daily, with wild-type litter mates used for comparison. Animals were weighed daily and underwent grip strength assessments. After 30 days of treatment animals were sacrificed, and muscles collected. Investigations into NMJ and muscle morphology were performed on collected tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: While minimal improvements in NMJ ultrastructure were observed with electron microscopy, gross NMJ structure analysis using fluorescent labelling and confocal microscopy revealed extensive postsynaptic improvements in Agrn&lt;sup&gt;nmf380&lt;/sup&gt; mice with NT1654 administration, with variables frequently returning to wild type levels. An improvement in muscle weight and myofiber characteristics helped increase forelimb grip strength and body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: We conclude that NT1654 restores NMJ postsynaptic structure and improves muscle strength through normalization of muscle fiber composition and the prevention of atrophy. We hypothesize this occurs through the AChR clustering pathway in Agrn&lt;sup&gt;nmf380&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Future studies should investigate if this may represent a viable treatment option for patients with CMS, especially those with mutations in proteins of the AChR clustering pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Beyond Technologies of Electroencephalography-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces: A Systematic Review From Commercial and Ethical Aspects</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.611130</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.611130</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The deployment of electroencephalographic techniques for commercial applications has undergone a rapid growth in recent decades. As they continue to expand in the consumer markets as suitable techniques for monitoring the brain activity, their transformative potential necessitates equally significant ethical inquiries. One of the main questions, which arises then when evaluating these kinds of applications, is whether they should be aligned or not with the main ethical concerns reported by scholars and experts. Thus, the present work attempts to unify these disciplines of knowledge by performing a comprehensive scan of the major electroencephalographic market applications as well as their most relevant ethical concerns arising from the existing literature. In this literature review, different databases were consulted, which presented conceptual and empirical discussions and findings about commercial and ethical aspects of electroencephalography. Subsequently, the content was extracted from the articles and the main conclusions were presented. Finally, an external assessment of the outcomes was conducted in consultation with an expert panel in some of the topic areas such as biomedical engineering, biomechatronics, and neuroscience. The ultimate purpose of this review is to provide a genuine insight into the cutting-edge practical attempts at electroencephalography. By the same token, it seeks to highlight the overlap between the market needs and the ethical standards that should govern the deployment of electroencephalographic consumer-grade solutions, providing a practical approach that overcomes the engineering myopia of certain ethical discussions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: N2b Reflects the Cognitive Changes in Executive Functioning After Concussion: A Scoping Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.601370</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.601370</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: The N2b is an event-related potential (ERP) component thought to index higher-order executive function. While the impact of concussion on executive functioning is frequently discussed in the literature, limited research has been done on the role of N2b in evaluating executive functioning in patients with concussion. The aims of this review are to consolidate an understanding of the cognitive functions reflected by the N2b and to account for discrepancies in literature findings regarding the N2b and concussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A scoping review was conducted on studies that used the N2b to measure cognitive functioning in healthy control populations, as well as in people with concussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Sixty-six articles that met inclusion criteria demonstrated that the N2b effectively represents stimulus-response conflict management, response selection, and response inhibition. However, the 19 included articles investigating head injury (using terms such as concussion, mild head injury, and mild traumatic brain injury) found widely varied results: some studies found the amplitude of the N2b to be increased in the concussion group, while others found it to be decreased or unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Based on the available evidence, differences in the amplitude of the N2b have been linked to response selection, conflict, and inhibition deficits in concussion. However, due to large variations in methodology across studies, findings about the directionality of this effect remain inconclusive. The results of this review suggest that future research should be conducted with greater standardization and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Researcher Perspectives on Data Sharing in Deep Brain Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578687</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The expansion of research on deep brain stimulation (DBS) and adaptive DBS (aDBS) raises important neuroethics and policy questions related to data sharing. However, there has been little empirical research on the perspectives of experts developing these technologies. We conducted semi-structured, open-ended interviews with aDBS researchers regarding their data sharing practices and their perspectives on ethical and policy issues related to sharing. Researchers expressed support for and a commitment to sharing, with most saying that they were either sharing their data or would share in the future and that doing so was important for advancing the field. However, those who are sharing reported a variety of sharing partners, suggesting heterogeneity in sharing practices and lack of the broad sharing that would reflect principles of open science. Researchers described several concerns and barriers related to sharing, including privacy and confidentiality, the usability of shared data by others, ownership and control of data (including potential commercialization), and limited resources for sharing. They also suggested potential solutions to these challenges, including additional safeguards to address privacy issues, standardization and transparency in analysis to address issues of data usability, professional norms and heightened cooperation to address issues of ownership and control, and streamlining of data transmission to address resource limitations. Researchers also offered a range of views on the sensitivity of neural activity data (NAD) and data related to mental health in the context of sharing. These findings are an important input to deliberations by researchers, policymakers, neuroethicists, and other stakeholders as they navigate ethics and policy questions related to aDBS research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Frontal Theta Oscillation as a Mechanism for Implicit Gender Stereotype Control: Electrophysiological Evidence From an Extrinsic Affective Simon Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.573187</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.573187</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous research has indicated that frontal midline theta (FMθ) reflects a domain-general cognitive control mechanism of the prefrontal cortex. Brain imaging studies have shown that the inhibition of implicit stereotypes was dependent on this domain-general cognitive control mechanism. Based on this knowledge, the present study investigated the neural oscillatory correlates of implicit gender stereotype control in an extrinsic affective Simon task (EAST) using electrophysiological methods. Participants in this task conducted verification to white gender names and colored gender traits, and their behavioral response and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded during their performances. As predicted, stereotype-inconsistent trials resulted in reduced response accuracies and slower response times than stereotype-consistent trials. For the event-related potential (ERP) results, the enhanced performance of stereotype-inconsistent trials was accompanied by an enhanced N400 amplitude but an attenuated late positive potential amplitude. In contrast, early attentional components such as P2 and N2 as well as their amplitudes were impacted by the experimental manipulations and individual differences in gender factors. In addition, based on time–frequency (TF) analysis, we found that the enhanced performance of stereotype-inconsistent trials was also accompanied by an event-related synchronization on the frontal theta oscillation. This frontal theta appeared at a late processing stage and persisted across a time window from N400 to late positive potential. Additionally, this enhanced frontal theta effect was not modulated by the experimental manipulations and individual differences in gender factors. Based on these findings, the feature of frontal theta oscillation in the implicit gender stereotype control process was discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Prefrontal Disinhibition in Social Fear: A Vital Action of Somatostatin Interneurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.611732</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.611732</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social fear and avoidance of social partners and social situations represent the core behavioral symptom of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), a prevalent psychiatric disorder worldwide. The pathological mechanism of SAD remains elusive and there are no specific and satisfactory therapeutic options currently available. With the development of appropriate animal models, growing studies start to unravel neuronal circuit mechanisms underlying social fear, and underscore a fundamental role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Prefrontal cortical functions are implemented by a finely wired microcircuit composed of excitatory principal neurons (PNs) and diverse subtypes of inhibitory interneurons (INs). Disinhibition, defined as a break in inhibition via interactions between IN subtypes that enhances the output of excitatory PNs, has recently been discovered to serve as an efficient strategy in cortical information processing. Here, we review the rodent animal models of social fear, the prefrontal IN diversity, and their circuits with a particular emphasis on a novel disinhibitory microcircuit mediated by somatostatin-expressing INs in gating social fear behavior. The INs subtype distinct and microcircuit-based mechanism advances our understanding of the etiology of social fear and sheds light on developing future treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with social fear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dysfunctional Autophagy and Endolysosomal System in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Relevance and Therapeutic Options</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.602116</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.602116</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autophagy and endolysosomal trafficking are crucial in neuronal development, function and survival. These processes ensure efficient removal of misfolded aggregation-prone proteins and damaged organelles, such as dysfunctional mitochondria, thus allowing the maintenance of proper cellular homeostasis. Beside this, emerging evidence has pointed to their involvement in the regulation of the synaptic proteome needed to guarantee an efficient neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. Along this line, an intimate interplay between the molecular machinery regulating synaptic vesicle endocytosis and synaptic autophagy is emerging, suggesting that synaptic quality control mechanisms need to be tightly coupled to neurosecretion to secure release accuracy. Defects in autophagy and endolysosomal pathway have been associated with neuronal dysfunction and extensively reported in Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis among other neurodegenerative diseases, with common features and emerging genetic bases. In this review, we focus on the multiple roles of autophagy and endolysosomal system in neuronal homeostasis and highlight how their defects probably contribute to synaptic default and neurodegeneration in the above-mentioned diseases, discussing the most recent options explored for therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Dependent Activation and Neuronal Differentiation of Lgr5+ Basal Cells in Injured Olfactory Epithelium via Notch Signaling Pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.602688</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.602688</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging is an important factor affecting function of smell, leading to the degeneration of mature olfactory sensory neurons and inducing the occurrence of smell loss. The mammalian olfactory epithelium (OE) can regenerate when subjected to chemical assaults. However, this capacity is not limitless. Inactivation of globose basal cells and failure to generate sensory neurons are the main obstacles to prevent the OE regeneration. Here, we found the significant attenuation in mature sensory neuronal generation and apparent transcriptional alternation in the OE from aged mice compared with young ones. The recruitment of leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5)-positive cells in injured OE was weakened in aged mice, and more Lgr5+ cells remained quiescence in aged OE postinjury. Lineage-traced progenies from Lgr5+ cells were significantly fewer in the OE with aging. Moreover, Notch activation enhanced the neuronal regeneration in aged OE, making the regenerative capacity of aged OE comparable with that of young animals after injury. The growth and morphology of three-dimensional (3D)-cultured organoids from the OE of young and aged mice varied and was modulated by small molecules regulating the Notch signaling pathway. Thus, we concluded that activation of Lgr5+ cells in injured OE was age dependent and Notch activation could enhance the capacity of neuronal generation from Lgr5+ cells in aged OE after injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: An Integrative Nomogram for Identifying Early-Stage Parkinson's Disease Using Non-motor Symptoms and White Matter-Based Radiomics Biomarkers From Whole-Brain MRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.548616</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.548616</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: To develop and validate an integrative nomogram based on white matter (WM) radiomics biomarkers and nonmotor symptoms for the identification of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical characteristics of 336 subjects, including 168 patients with PD, were collected from the Parkinson's Progress Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. All subjects were randomly divided into training and test sets. According to the baseline MRI scans of patients in the training set, the WM was segmented to extract the radiomic features of each patient and develop radiomics biomarkers, which were then combined with nonmotor symptoms to build an integrative nomogram using machine learning. Finally, the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of the nomogram were evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic curve and test data, respectively. In addition, we investigated 58 patients with atypical PD who had imaging scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD) to verify whether the nomogram was able to distinguish patients with typical PD from patients with SWEDD. A decision curve analysis was also performed to validate the clinical practicality of the nomogram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The area under the curve values of the integrative nomogram for the training, testing and verification sets were 0.937, 0.922, and 0.836, respectively; the specificity values were 83.8, 88.2, and 91.38%, respectively; and the sensitivity values were 84.6, 82.4, and 70.69%, respectively. A significant difference in the number of patients with PD was observed between the high-risk group and the low-risk group based on the nomogram (P &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This integrative nomogram is a new potential method to identify patients with early-stage PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Retinal Thickness Predicts the Risk of Cognitive Decline in Parkinson Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25944?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25944?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was undertaken to analyze longitudinal changes of retinal thickness and their predictive value as biomarkers of disease progression in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with Lewy body diseases were enrolled and prospectively evaluated at 3 years, including patients with iPD (n = 42), dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 4), E46K‐&lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; mutation carriers (n = 4), and controls (n = 17). All participants underwent Spectralis retinal optical coherence tomography and Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score was obtained in patients. Macular ganglion cell–inner plexiform layer complex (GCIPL) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness reduction rates were estimated with linear mixed models. Risk ratios were calculated to evaluate the association between baseline GCIPL and pRNFL thicknesses and the risk of subsequent cognitive and motor worsening, using clinically meaningful cutoffs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCIPL thickness in the parafoveal region (1‐ to 3‐mm ring) presented the largest reduction rate. The annualized atrophy rate was 0.63μm in iPD patients and 0.23μm in controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). iPD patients with lower parafoveal GCIPL and pRNFL thickness at baseline presented an increased risk of cognitive decline at 3 years (relative risk [RR] = 3.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10–11.1, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03 and RR = 3.28, 95% CI = 1.03–10.45, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.045, respectively). We did not identify significant associations between retinal thickness and motor deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results provide evidence of the potential use of optical coherence tomography–measured parafoveal GCIPL thickness to monitor neurodegeneration and to predict the risk of cognitive worsening over time in iPD. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:165–176&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Discordant Monozygotic Parkinson Disease Twins: Role of Mitochondrial Integrity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25942?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25942?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though genetic predisposition has proven to be an important element in Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology, monozygotic (MZ) twins with PD displayed a concordance rate of only about 20% despite their shared identical genetic background.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recruited 5 pairs of MZ twins discordant for idiopathic PD and established skin fibroblast cultures to investigate mitochondrial phenotypes in these cellular models against the background of a presumably identical genome. To test for genetic differences, we performed whole genome sequencing, deep mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing, and tested for mitochondrial deletions by multiplex real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the fibroblast cultures. Further, the fibroblast cultures were tested for mitochondrial integrity by immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, flow cytometry, and real‐time PCR to quantify gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome sequencing did not identify any genetic difference. We found decreased mitochondrial functionality with reduced cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, altered mitochondrial morphology, elevated protein levels of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), and increased levels of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐gamma coactivator‐α (&lt;i&gt;PPARGC1A&lt;/i&gt;) messenger RNA (mRNA) in skin fibroblast cultures from the affected compared to the unaffected twins. Further, there was a tendency for a higher number of somatic mtDNA variants among the affected twins.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate disease‐related differences in mitochondrial integrity in the genetically identical twins. Of note, the clinical expression matches functional alterations of the mitochondria. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:158–164&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Regional Brain Growth Trajectories in Fetuses with Congenital Heart Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25940?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25940?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congenital heart disease (CHD) is associated with abnormal brain development in utero. We applied innovative fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to determine whether reduced fetal cerebral substrate delivery impacts the brain globally, or in a region‐specific pattern. Our novel design included two control groups, one with and the other without a family history of CHD, to explore the contribution of shared genes and/or fetal environment to brain development.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2014 to 2018, we enrolled 179 pregnant women into 4 groups: “HLHS/TGA” fetuses with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) or transposition of the great arteries (TGA), diagnoses with lowest fetal cerebral substrate delivery; “CHD‐other,” with other CHD diagnoses; “CHD‐related,” healthy with a CHD family history; and “optimal control,” healthy without a family history. Two MRIs were obtained between 18 and 40 weeks gestation. Random effect regression models assessed group differences in brain volumes and relationships to hemodynamic variables.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HLHS/TGA (n = 24), CHD‐other (50), and CHD‐related (34) groups each had generally smaller brain volumes than the optimal controls (71). Compared with CHD‐related, the HLHS/TGA group had smaller subplate (−13.3% [standard error = 4.3%], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and intermediate (−13.7% [4.3%], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) zones, with a similar trend in ventricular zone (−7.1% [1.9%], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.07). These volumetric reductions were associated with lower cerebral substrate delivery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fetuses with CHD, especially those with lowest cerebral substrate delivery, show a region‐specific pattern of small brain volumes and impaired brain growth before 32 weeks gestation. The brains of fetuses with CHD were more similar to those of CHD‐related than optimal controls, suggesting genetic or environmental factors also contribute.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Scalp Ripples Can Predict Development of Epilepsy After First Unprovoked Seizure in Childhood</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25939?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25939?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identification of children at risk of developing epilepsy after a first unprovoked seizure can be challenging. Interictal epileptiform discharges are associated with higher risk but have limited sensitivity and specificity. High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are newer biomarkers for epileptogenesis. We prospectively evaluated the predictive value of HFOs for developing epilepsy in scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) of children after a first unprovoked seizure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After their first seizure, 56 children were followed prospectively over 12 months and then grouped in “epilepsy” or “no epilepsy.” Initial EEGs were visually analyzed for spikes, spike ripples, and ripples. Inter‐group comparisons of spike‐rates and HFO‐rates were done by Mann–Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; test. Predictive values and optimal thresholds were calculated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the epilepsy group (n = 26, 46%), mean rates of ripples (0.3 vs 0.09 / minute, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and spike ripples (0.6 vs 0.06 / minute, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) were significantly higher, with no difference in spike rates (1.7 vs 3.0 / minute, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.38). Of those 3 markers, ripples showed the best predictive value (area under the curve [AUC]&lt;sub&gt;ripples&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.88). The optimal threshold for ripples was calculated to be ≥ 0.125 / minute with a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 85%. Ripple rates were negatively correlated to days passing before epilepsy‐diagnosis (R = −0.59, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and time to a second seizure (R = −0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] = −0.77 to 0.43, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could show that in a cohort of children with a first unprovoked seizure, ripples predict the development of epilepsy better than spikes or spike ripples and might be useful biomarkers in the estimation of prognosis and question of treatment.

Developments in the genome organisation field has resulted in the recent methodology to infer spatial conformations of the genome directly from experimentally measured genome contacts (Hi-C data). This provides are detailed description of both intra- and inter-chromosomal arrangements. Chromosomal intermingling is an important driver for radiation-induced DNA mis-repair. Which is a key biological endpoint of relevance to the fields of cancer therapy (radiotherapy), public health (biodosimetry) and space travel. For the first time, we leverage these methods of inferring genome organisation and couple them to nano-dosimetric radiation track structure modelling to predict quantities and distribution of DNA damage within cell-type specific geometries. These nano-dosimetric simulations are highly dependent on geometry and are benefited from the inclusion of experimentally driven chromosome conformations. We show how the changes in Hi-C contract maps impact the inferred geometries resulting in significant differences in chromosomal intermingling. We demonstrate how these differences propagate through to significant changes in the distribution of DNA damage throughout the cell nucleus, suggesting implications for DNA repair fidelity and subsequent cell fate. We suggest that differences in the geometric clustering for the chromosomes between the cell-types are a plausible factor leading to changes in cellular radiosensitivity. Furthermore, we investigate changes in cell shape, such as flattening, and show that this greatly impacts the distribution of DNA damage. This should be considered when comparing &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; results to &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; systems. The effect may be especially important when attempting to translate radiosensitivity measurements at the experimental &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; level to the patient or human level.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/16j4LgRB3pA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Approximating complex musculoskeletal biomechanics using multidimensional autogenerating polynomials</title>

Computational models of the musculoskeletal system are scientific tools used to study human movement, quantify the effects of injury and disease, plan surgical interventions, or control realistic high-dimensional articulated prosthetic limbs. If the models are sufficiently accurate, they may embed complex relationships within the sensorimotor system. These potential benefits are limited by the challenge of implementing fast and accurate musculoskeletal computations. A typical hand muscle spans over 3 degrees of freedom (DOF), wrapping over complex geometrical constraints that change its moment arms and lead to complex posture-dependent variation in torque generation. Here, we report a method to accurately and efficiently calculate musculotendon length and moment arms across all physiological postures of the forearm muscles that actuate the hand and wrist. Then, we use this model to test the hypothesis that the functional similarities of muscle actions are embedded in muscle structure. The posture dependent muscle geometry, moment arms and lengths of modeled muscles were captured using autogenerating polynomials that expanded their optimal selection of terms using information measurements. The iterative process approximated 33 musculotendon actuators, each spanning up to 6 DOFs in an 18 DOF model of the human arm and hand, defined over the full physiological range of motion. Using these polynomials, the entire forearm anatomy could be computed in &amp;lt;10 μs, which is far better than what is required for real-time performance, and with low errors in moment arms (below 5%) and lengths (below 0.4%). Moreover, we demonstrate that the number of elements in these autogenerating polynomials does not increase exponentially with increasing muscle complexity of muscles; complexity increases linearly instead. Dimensionality reduction using the polynomial terms alone resulted in clusters comprised of muscles with similar functions, indicating the high accuracy of approximating models. We propose that this novel method of describing musculoskeletal biomechanics might further improve the applications of detailed and scalable models to describe human movement.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TXbRwUlakJA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Characterization of the GABRB2 associated neurodevelopmental disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25985</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25985?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
We aimed to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and functional consequences associated with variants in the gene GABRB2, coding for the GABAA receptor subunit β2.


Methods
We recruited and systematically evaluated 25 individuals with variants in GABRB2, 17 of whom are newly described and 8 previously reported with additional clinical data. Functional analysis was performed using a Xenopus laevis oocyte model system.


Results
Our cohort of 25 individuals from 22 families with variants in GABRB2 demonstrated a range of epilepsy phenotypes from genetic generalized epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Fifty‐eight percent of individuals had pharmaco‐resistant epilepsy; response to medications targeting the GABAergic pathway was inconsistent. Developmental disability (present in 84%) ranged from mild intellectual disability to severe global disability; movement disorders (present in 44%) included choreoathetosis, dystonia and ataxia. Disease‐associated variants cluster in the extracellular N‐terminus and transmembrane domains 1–3, with more severe phenotypes seen in association with variants in transmembrane domains 1 and 2 and the allosteric binding site between transmembrane domains 2 and 3. Functional analysis of 4 variants in transmembrane domains 1 or 2 (p.Ile246Thr, p.Pro252Leu, p.Ile288Ser, p.Val282Ala) revealed strongly reduced amplitudes of GABA‐evoked anionic currents.


Interpretation
GABRB2‐related epilepsy ranges broadly in severity from genetic generalized epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. Developmental disability and movement disorder are key features. The phenotypic spectrum is comparable to other GABAA receptor‐encoding genes. Phenotypic severity varied by protein domain. Experimental evidence supports loss of GABA‐ergic inhibition as the mechanism underlying GABRB2‐associated neurodevelopmental disorders.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we investigate the usage of machine learning for interpreting
measured sensor values in sensor modules. In particular we analyze the
potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) on low-cost micro-controllers
with a few kilobytes of memory to semantically enrich data captured by sensors.
The focus is on classifying temporal data series with a high level of
reliability. Design and implementation of ANNs are analyzed considering Feed
Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We
validate the developed ANNs in a case study of optical hand gesture recognition
on an 8-bit micro-controller. The best reliability was found for an FFNN with
two layers and 1493 parameters requiring an execution time of 36 ms. We propose
a workflow to develop ANNs for embedded devices.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based inference on battery-powered devices
can be made more energy-efficient by restricting the synaptic weights to be
binary, hence eliminating the need to perform multiplications. An alternative,
emerging, approach relies on the use of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs),
biologically inspired, dynamic, event-driven models that enhance energy
efficiency via the use of binary, sparse, activations. In this paper, an SNN
model is introduced that combines the benefits of temporally sparse binary
activations and of binary weights. Two learning rules are derived, the first
based on the combination of straight-through and surrogate gradient techniques,
and the second based on a Bayesian paradigm. Experiments validate the
performance loss with respect to full-precision implementations, and
demonstrate the advantage of the Bayesian paradigm in terms of accuracy and
calibration.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tangled Program Graph (TPG) is a reinforcement learning technique based on
genetic programming concepts. On state-of-the-art learning environments, TPGs
have been shown to offer comparable competence with Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs), for a fraction of their computational and storage cost. This lightness
of TPGs, both for training and inference, makes them an interesting model to
implement Artificial Intelligences (AIs) on embedded systems with limited
computational and storage resources. In this paper, we introduce the Gegelati
library for TPGs. Besides introducing the general concepts and features of the
library, two main contributions are detailed in the paper: 1/ The
parallelization of the deterministic training process of TPGs, for supporting
heterogeneous Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chips (MPSoCs). 2/ The support for
customizable instruction sets and data types within the genetically evolved
programs of the TPG model. The scalability of the parallel training process is
demonstrated through experiments on architectures ranging from a high-end
24-core processor to a low-power heterogeneous MPSoC. The impact of
customizable instructions on the outcome of a training process is demonstrated
on a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning environment. CCS Concepts:
$\bullet$ Computer systems organization $\rightarrow$ Embedded systems;
$\bullet$ Computing methodologies $\rightarrow$ Machine learning.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this short note, we describe our submission to the NeurIPS 2020 BBO
challenge. Motivated by the fact that different optimizers work well on
different problems, our approach \emph{switches} between different
optimizers.\footnote{Switching between algorithms also relates to work on
\emph{chaining} or \emph{algorithm schedules}.} Since the team names on the
competition's leaderboard were randomly generated &quot;alliteration nicknames&quot;,
consisting of an adjective and an animal with the same initial letter, we
called our approach the \emph{Switching Squirrel}, or here, short,
\emph{Squirrel}. Our reference implementation of Squirrel is available at
\url{https://github.com/automl/Squirrel-Optimizer-BBO-NeurIPS20-automlorg}.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To handle different types of Many-Objective Optimization Problems (MaOPs),
Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MaOEAs) need to simultaneously maintain
convergence and population diversity in the high-dimensional objective space.
In order to balance the relationship between diversity and convergence, we
introduce a Kernel Matrix and probability model called Determinantal Point
Processes (DPPs). Our Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm with Determinantal
Point Processes (MaOEADPPs) is presented and compared with several
state-of-the-art algorithms on various types of MaOPs \textcolor{blue}{with
different numbers of objectives}. The experimental results demonstrate that
MaOEADPPs is competitive.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain is composed of electrically excitable neuronal networks regulated
by the activity of voltage-gated ion channels. Further portraying the molecular
composition of the brain, however, will not reveal anything remotely
reminiscent of a feeling, a sensation or a conscious experience. In classical
physics, addressing the mind-brain problem is a formidable task because no
physical mechanism is able to explain how the brain generates the unobservable,
inner psychological world of conscious experiences and how in turn those
conscious experiences steer the underlying brain processes toward desired
behavior. Yet, this setback does not establish that consciousness is
non-physical. Modern quantum physics affirms the interplay between two types of
physical entities in Hilbert space: unobservable quantum states, which are
vectors describing what exists in the physical world, and quantum observables,
which are operators describing what can be observed in quantum measurements.
Quantum no-go theorems further provide a framework for studying quantum brain
dynamics, which has to be governed by a physically admissible Hamiltonian.
Comprising consciousness of unobservable quantum information integrated in
quantum brain states explains the origin of the inner privacy of conscious
experiences and revisits the dynamic timescale of conscious processes to
picosecond conformational transitions of neural biomolecules. The observable
brain is then an objective construction created from classical bits of
information, which are bound by Holevo's theorem, and obtained through the
measurement of quantum brain observables. Thus, quantum information theory
clarifies the distinction between the unobservable mind and the observable
brain, and supports a solid physical foundation for consciousness research.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Joint analysis of structural connectivity and cortical surface features: correlates with mild traumatic brain injury. (arXiv:2012.03671v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03671</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03671</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a complex syndrome that affects up to
600 per 100,000 individuals, with a particular concentration among military
personnel. About half of all mTBI patients experience a diverse array of
chronic symptoms which persist long after the acute injury. Hence, there is an
urgent need for better understanding of the white matter and gray matter
pathologies associated with mTBI to map which specific brain systems are
impacted and identify courses of intervention. Previous works have linked mTBI
to disruptions in white matter pathways and cortical surface abnormalities.
Herein, we examine these hypothesized links in an exploratory study of joint
structural connectivity and cortical surface changes associated with mTBI and
its chronic symptoms. Briefly, we consider a cohort of 12 mTBI and 26 control
subjects. A set of 588 cortical surface metrics and 4,753 structural
connectivity metrics were extracted from cortical surface regions and diffusion
weighted magnetic resonance imaging in each subject. Principal component
analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of each metric set. We
then applied independent component analysis (ICA) both to each PCA space
individually and together in a joint ICA approach. We identified a stable
independent component across the connectivity-only and joint ICAs which
presented significant group differences in subject loadings (p&amp;lt;0.05,
corrected). Additionally, we found that two mTBI symptoms, slowed thinking and
forgetfulness, were significantly correlated (p&amp;lt;0.05, corrected) with mTBI
subject loadings in a surface-only ICA. These surface-only loadings captured an
increase in bilateral cortical thickness.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning on tree data has been mostly focused on trees as input. Much
less research has investigates trees as output, like in molecule optimization
for drug discovery or hint generation for intelligent tutoring systems. In this
work, we propose a novel autoencoder approach, called recursive tree grammar
autoencoder (RTG-AE), which encodes trees via a bottom-up parser and decodes
trees via a tree grammar, both controlled by neural networks that minimize the
variational autoencoder loss. The resulting encoding and decoding functions can
then be employed in subsequent tasks, such as optimization and time series
prediction. RTG-AE combines variational autoencoders, grammatical knowledge,
and recursive processing. Our key message is that this combination improves
performance compared to only combining two of these three components. In
particular, we show experimentally that our proposed method improves the
autoencoding error, training time, and optimization score on four benchmark
datasets compared to baselines from the literature.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16262</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16262</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In today's clinical practice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely
accelerated through subsampling of the associated Fourier domain. Currently,
the construction of these subsampling strategies - known as experimental design
- relies primarily on heuristics. We propose to learn experimental design
strategies for accelerated MRI with policy gradient methods. Unexpectedly, our
experiments show that a simple greedy approximation of the objective leads to
solutions nearly on-par with the more general non-greedy approach. We offer a
partial explanation for this phenomenon rooted in greater variance in the
non-greedy objective's gradient estimates, and experimentally verify that this
variance hampers non-greedy models in adapting their policies to individual MR
images. We empirically show that this adaptivity is key to improving
subsampling designs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a new class of time-continuous recurrent neural network models.
Instead of declaring a learning system's dynamics by implicit nonlinearities,
we construct networks of linear first-order dynamical systems modulated via
nonlinear interlinked gates. The resulting models represent dynamical systems
with varying (i.e., liquid) time-constants coupled to their hidden state, with
outputs being computed by numerical differential equation solvers. These neural
networks exhibit stable and bounded behavior, yield superior expressivity
within the family of neural ordinary differential equations, and give rise to
improved performance on time-series prediction tasks. To demonstrate these
properties, we first take a theoretical approach to find bounds over their
dynamics and compute their expressive power by the trajectory length measure in
latent trajectory space. We then conduct a series of time-series prediction
experiments to manifest the approximation capability of Liquid Time-Constant
Networks (LTCs) compared to classical and modern RNNs. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/raminmh/liquid_time_constant_networks

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Analogy is core to human cognition. It allows us to solve problems based on
prior experience, it governs the way we conceptualize new information, and it
even influences our visual perception. The importance of analogy to humans has
made it an active area of research in the broader field of artificial
intelligence, resulting in data-efficient models that learn and reason in
human-like ways. While cognitive perspectives of analogy and deep learning have
generally been studied independently of one another, the integration of the two
lines of research is a promising step towards more robust and efficient
learning techniques. As part of a growing body of research on such an
integration, we introduce the Analogical Matching Network: a neural
architecture that learns to produce analogies between structured, symbolic
representations that are largely consistent with the principles of
Structure-Mapping Theory.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Feed-forward and noise-tolerant detection of feature homogeneity in spiking networks with a latency code. (arXiv:1806.03881v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In studies of the visual system as well as in computer vision, the focus is
often on contrast edges. However, the primate visual system contains a large
number of cells that are insensitive to spatial contrast and, instead, respond
to uniform homogeneous illumination of their visual field. The purpose of this
information remains unclear. Here, we propose a mechanism that detects feature
homogeneity in visual areas, based on latency coding and spike time
coincidence, in a purely feed-forward and therefore rapid manner. We
demonstrate how homogeneity information can interact with information on
contrast edges to potentially support rapid image segmentation. Furthermore, we
analyze how neuronal crosstalk (noise) affects the mechanism's performance. We
show that the detrimental effects of crosstalk can be partly mitigated through
delayed feed-forward inhibition that shapes bi-phasic post-synaptic events. The
delay of the feed-forward inhibition allows effectively controlling the size of
the temporal integration window and, thereby, the coincidence threshold. The
proposed model is based on single-spike latency codes in a purely feed-forward
architecture that supports low-latency processing, making it an attractive
scheme of computation in spiking neuronal networks where rapid responses and
low spike counts are desired.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Neuronal Correlates of Cognitive Control Are Altered in Women With Endometriosis and Chronic Pelvic Pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.593581</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.593581</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Endometriosis is a debilitating women's health condition and is the most common cause of chronic pelvic pain. Impaired cognitive control is common in chronic pain conditions, however, it has not yet been investigated in endometriosis. The aim of this study was to explore the neuronal correlates of cognitive control in women with endometriosis. Using a cross-sectional study design with data collected at a single time-point, event-related potentials were elicited during a cued continuous performance test from 20 women with endometriosis (mean age = 28.5 ± 5.2 years) and 20 age- and gender-matched controls (mean age = 28.5 ± 5.2 years). Event-related potential components were extracted and P3 component amplitudes were derived with temporal principal components analysis. Behavioral and ERP outcomes were compared between groups and subjective pain severity was correlated with ERP component amplitudes. No significant behavioral differences were seen in task performance between the groups (all p &amp;gt; 0.094). Target P3b (all p &amp;lt; 0.034) and SW (all p &amp;lt; 0.040), and non-target early P3a (eP3a; all p &amp;lt; 0.023) and late P3a (lP3a; all p &amp;lt; 0.035) amplitudes were smaller for the endometriosis compared to the healthy control group. Lower non-target eP3a (p &amp;lt; 0.001), lP3a (p = 0.013), and SW (p = 0.019) amplitudes were correlated with higher pain severity scores. Findings suggest that endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain is linked to alterations in stimulus-response processing and inhibitory control networks, but not impaired behavioral performance, due to compensatory neuroplastic changes in overlapping cognitive control and pain networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Accumulation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Glycerophospholipids and Sphingolipids in Cognitively Healthy Participants With Alzheimer’s Biomarkers Precedes Lipolysis in the Dementia Stage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.611393</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.611393</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Insight into lipids’ roles in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiology is limited because brain membrane lipids have not been characterized in cognitively healthy (CH) individuals. Since age is a significant risk factor of AD, we hypothesize that aging renders the amyloid precursor protein (APP) more susceptible to abnormal processing because of deteriorating membrane lipids. To reflect brain membranes, we studied their lipid components in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain-derived CSF nanoparticle membranes. Based on CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;/Tau levels established biomarkers of AD, we define a subset of CH participants with normal Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;/Tau (CH-NAT) and another group with abnormal or pathological Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;/Tau (CH-PAT). We report that glycerophospholipids are differentially metabolized in the CSF supernatant fluid and nanoparticle membrane fractions from CH-NAT, CH-PAT, and AD participants. Phosphatidylcholine molecular species from the supernatant fraction of CH-PAT were higher than in the CH-NAT and AD participants. Sphingomyelin levels in the supernatant fraction were lower in the CH-PAT and AD than in the CH-NAT group. The decrease in sphingomyelin corresponded with an increase in ceramide and dihydroceramide and an increase in the ceramide to sphingomyelin ratio in AD. In contrast to the supernatant fraction, sphingomyelin is higher in the nanoparticle fraction from the CH-PAT group, accompanied by lower ceramide and dihydroceramide and a decrease in the ratio of ceramide to sphingomyelin in CH-PAT compared with CH-NAT. On investigating the mechanism for the lipid changes in AD, we observed that phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) activity was higher in the AD group than the CH groups. Paradoxically, acid and neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase) activities were lower in AD compared to the CH groups. Considering external influences on lipids, the clinical groups did not differ in their fasting blood lipids or dietary lipids, consistent with the CSF lipid changes originating from brain pathophysiology. The lipid accumulation in a prodromal AD biomarker positive stage identifies perturbation of lipid metabolism and disturbances in APP/Amyloid beta (Aβ) as early events in AD pathophysiology. Our results identify increased lipid turnover in CH participants with AD biomarkers, switching to a predominantly lipolytic state in dementia. This knowledge may be useful for targeting and testing new AD treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Interactions between two brains constitute the essence of social communication. Daily movements are commonly executed during social interactions and are determined by different mental states that may express different positive or negative behavioral intent. In this context, the effective recognition of festive or violent intent before the action execution remains crucial for survival. Here, we hypothesize that the EEG signals contain the distinctive features characterizing movement intent already expressed before movement execution and that such distinctive information can be identified by state-of-the-art classification algorithms based on Riemannian geometry. We demonstrated for the first time that a classifier based on covariance matrices and Riemannian geometry can effectively discriminate between neutral, festive, and violent mental states only on the basis of non-invasive EEG signals in both the actor and observer participants. These results pave the way for new electrophysiological discrimination of mental states based on non-invasive EEG recordings and cutting-edge machine learning techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural and Genetic Bases for Human Ability Traits</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The judgement of human ability is ubiquitous, from school admissions to job performance reviews. The exact make-up of ability traits, however, is often narrowly defined and lacks a comprehensive basis. We attempt to simplify the spectrum of human ability, similar to how five personality traits are widely believed to describe most personalities. Finding such a basis for human ability would be invaluable since neuropsychiatric disease diagnoses and symptom severity are commonly related to such differences in performance. Here, we identified four underlying ability traits within the National Institutes of Health Toolbox normative data (n = 1, 369): (1) Motor-endurance, (2) Emotional processing, (3) Executive and cognitive function, and (4) Social interaction. We used the Human Connectome Project young adult dataset (n = 778) to show that Motor-endurance and Executive and cognitive function were reliably associated with specific brain functional networks (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.305 ± 0.021), and the biological nature of these ability traits was also shown by calculating their heritability (31 and 49%, respectively) from twin data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Emotional Reactivity and Regulation in Preschool-Age Children Who Do and Do Not Stutter: Evidence From Autonomic Nervous System Measures</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.600790</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.600790</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: This experimental cross-sectional research study examined the emotional reactivity and emotion regulation in preschool-age children who do (CWS) and do not stutter (CWNS) by assessing their psychophysiological response during rest and while viewing pictures from the International Affective Picture System (Lang et al., 2008).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Participants were 18 CWS (16 boys and two girls; mean age 4 years, 5 months) and 18 age- and gender-matched CWNS. Participants' psychophysiological responses were measured during two baselines and two picture viewing conditions. Skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate were measured to assess emotional reactivity. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was measured to assess emotional regulation. Participants' shyness and executive function were assessed via parent report and considered for their effects on participants' psychophysiological responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: First, CWNS and CWS did not differ in their initial baseline SCL, heart rate, or RSA, but all participants had higher SCL and lower RSA in the second baseline, subsequent to the first challenge condition, compared to the first baseline. Second, during the challenge conditions, CWS did not differ from CWNS in their SCL, but showed a significantly higher heart rate than CWNS. Third, CWS exhibited a significantly lower RSA during the challenge conditions compared to CWNS. Lastly, the temperamental quality of shyness was associated with preschool-age children's SCL, such that participants who were rated higher in shyness had a higher SCL during the challenge conditions. Participants' executive function had a marginally significant effect on the RSA, such that the participants who had higher executive function composite scores exhibited lower RSA during the challenge conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings suggest that CWS and CWNS did not differ in their emotional reactivity and emotional regulation abilities at rest. During challenge conditions, however, CWS tended to be more emotionally reactive, as indicated by a higher heart rate, and also employed more emotional regulation, indexed by a greater decrease in RSA, compared to CWNS. Preschool-age children's behavior is largely dominated by reactivity, but there is the emergence of regulation, which can help children adjust to various contextual demands. For CWS who are more emotionally reactive, regulatory skills may be particularly critical to their prognosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the human-computer interaction (HCI), electroencephalogram (EEG) access for automatic emotion recognition is an effective way for robot brains to perceive human behavior. In order to improve the accuracy of the emotion recognition, a method of EEG access for emotion recognition based on a deep hybrid network was proposed in this paper. Firstly, the collected EEG was decomposed into four frequency band signals, and the multiscale sample entropy (MSE) features of each frequency band were extracted. Secondly, the constructed 3D MSE feature matrices were fed into a deep hybrid network for autonomous learning. The deep hybrid network was composed of a continuous convolutional neural network (CNN) and hidden Markov models (HMMs). Lastly, HMMs trained with multiple observation sequences were used to replace the artificial neural network classifier in the CNN, and the emotion recognition task was completed by HMM classifiers. The proposed method was applied to the DEAP dataset for emotion recognition experiments, and the average accuracy could achieve 79.77% on arousal, 83.09% on valence, and 81.83% on dominance. Compared with the latest related methods, the accuracy was improved by 0.99% on valence and 14.58% on dominance, which verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been widely utilized in research settings and modulates brain activity. The application of anodal tDCS on the prefrontal cortex has indicated improvement in cognitive functioning. The cingulate cortex, situated in the medial aspect of the prefrontal cortex, has been identified as a core region performing cognitive functions. Most of the previous studies investigating the impact of stimulation on the prefrontal cortex stimulated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), however, the impact of stimulation on cingulate has not been explored. The current study investigates the effect of stimulation on the resting-state functional connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex with other regions of the brain and changes in behavioral results in a color-word Stroop task, which has repeatedly elicited activation in different regions of the cingulate. Twenty subjects were randomly assigned to the experimental and sham group, and their medial prefrontal area was stimulated using MRI compatible tDCS. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and cognitive Stroop task were monitored before, during, and after the stimulation. Neuroimaging results indicated a significant decrease in resting-state functional connectivity in the experimental group during and after stimulation as compared to before stimulation in two clusters including right insular cortex, right central operculum cortex, right frontal operculum cortex and right planum polare with the left anterior cingulate cortex (L-ACC) selected as the seed. The behavioral results indicated a significant decrease in reaction time (RT) following stimulation in the experimental group compared to the sham group. Moreover, the change in functional connectivity in subcortical regions with L-ACC as the seed and change in RT was positively correlated. The results demonstrated that ACC has a close functional relationship with the subcortical regions, and stimulation of ACC can modulate these connections, which subsequently improves behavioral performance, thus, providing another potential target of stimulation for cognitive enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04318522.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Comparing Theories for the Maintenance of Late LTP and Long-Term Memory: Computational Analysis of the Roles of Kinase Feedback Pathways and Synaptic Reactivation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.569349</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental neuroscience question is how memories are maintained from days to a lifetime, given turnover of proteins that underlie expression of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) or “tag” synapses as eligible for LTP. A likely solution relies on synaptic positive feedback loops, prominently including persistent activation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) and self-activated synthesis of protein kinase M ζ (PKMζ). Data also suggest positive feedback based on recurrent synaptic reactivation within neuron assemblies, or engrams, is necessary to maintain memories. The relative importance of these mechanisms is controversial. To explore the likelihood that each mechanism is necessary or sufficient to maintain memory, we simulated maintenance of LTP with a simplified model incorporating persistent kinase activation, synaptic tagging, and preferential reactivation of strong synapses, and analyzed implications of recent data. We simulated three model variants, each maintaining LTP with one feedback loop: autonomous, self-activated PKMζ synthesis (model variant I); self-activated CamKII (model variant II); and recurrent reactivation of strengthened synapses (model variant III). Variant I predicts that, for successful maintenance of LTP, either 1) PKMζ contributes to synaptic tagging, or 2) a low constitutive tag level persists during maintenance independent of PKMζ, or 3) maintenance of LTP is independent of tagging. Variant II maintains LTP and suggests persistent CaMKII activation could maintain PKMζ activity, a feedforward interaction not previously considered. However, we note data challenging the CaMKII feedback loop. In Variant III synaptic reactivation drives, and thus predicts, recurrent or persistent activation of CamKII and other necessary kinases, plausibly contributing to persistent elevation of PKMζ levels. Reactivation is thus predicted to sustain recurrent rounds of synaptic tagging and incorporation of plasticity-related proteins. We also suggest (model variant IV) that synaptic reactivation and autonomous kinase activation could synergistically maintain LTP. We propose experiments that could discriminate these maintenance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Electrophysiological Profile Remodeling via Selective Suppression of Voltage-Gated Currents by CLN1/PPT1 Overexpression in Human Neuronal-Like Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.569598</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;CLN1 disease (OMIM #256730) is an inherited neurological disorder of early childhood with epileptic seizures and premature death. It is associated with mutations in CLN1 coding for Palmitoyl-Protein Thioesterase 1 (PPT1), a lysosomal enzyme which affects the recycling and degradation of lipid-modified (S-acylated) proteins by removing palmitate residues. Transcriptomic evidence from a neuronal-like cellular model derived from differentiated SH-SY5Y cells disclosed the potential negative roles of CLN1 overexpression, affecting the elongation of neuronal processes and the expression of selected proteins of the synaptic region. Bioinformatic inquiries of transcriptomic data pinpointed a dysregulated expression of several genes coding for proteins related to voltage-gated ion channels, including subunits of calcium and potassium channels (VGCC and VGKC). In SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing CLN1 (SH-CLN1 cells), the resting potential and the membrane conductance in the range of voltages close to the resting potential were not affected. However, patch-clamp recordings indicated a reduction of Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; currents through VGCC of SH-CLN1 cells; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging revealed reduced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx in the same cellular setting. The results of the biochemical and morphological investigations of CACNA2D2/α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-2, an accessory subunit of VGCC, were in accordance with the downregulation of the corresponding gene and consistent with the hypothesis that a lower number of functional channels may reach the plasma membrane. The combined use of 4-AP and NS-1643, two drugs with opposing effects on K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;11 and K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;12 subfamilies of VGKC coded by the KCNH gene family, provides evidence for reduced functional K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;12 channels in SH-CLN1 cells, consistent with transcriptomic data indicating the downregulation of KCNH4. The lack of compelling evidence supporting the palmitoylation of many ion channels subunits investigated in this study stimulates inquiries about the role of PPT1 in the trafficking of channels to the plasma membrane. Altogether, these results indicate a reduction of functional voltage-gated ion channels in response to CLN1/PPT1 overexpression in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and provide new insights into the altered neuronal excitability which may underlie the severe epileptic phenotype of CLN1 disease. It remains to be shown if remodeling of such functional channels on plasma membrane can occur as a downstream effect of CLN1 disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Systematic and Comprehensive Automated Ventricle Segmentation on Ventricle Images of the Elderly Patients: A Retrospective Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.618538</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.618538</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background and Objective: Ventricle volume is closely related to hydrocephalus, brain atrophy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's syndrome, and other diseases. To accurately measure the volume of the ventricles for elderly patients, we use deep learning to establish a systematic and comprehensive automated ventricle segmentation framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The study participation included 20 normal elderly people, 20 patients with cerebral atrophy, 64 patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus, and 51 patients with acquired hydrocephalus. Second, get their imaging data through the picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) system. Then use ITK software to manually label participants' ventricular structures. Finally, extract imaging features through machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: This automated ventricle segmentation method can be applied not only to CT and MRI images but also to images with different scan slice thicknesses. More importantly, it produces excellent segmentation results (Dice &amp;gt; 0.9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This automated ventricle segmentation method has wide applicability and clinical practicability. It can help clinicians find early disease, diagnose disease, understand the patient's disease progression, and evaluate the patient's treatment effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Brain NAD Is Associated With ATP Energy Production and Membrane Phospholipid Turnover in Humans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain requires a large amount of energy, mostly derived from the metabolism of glucose, which decreases substantially with age and neurological diseases. While mounting evidence in model organisms illustrates the central role of brain nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) for maintaining energy homeostasis, similar data are sparse in humans. This study explores the correlations between brain NAD, energy production and membrane phospholipid metabolism by 31-phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-MRS) across 50 healthy participants including a young (mean age 27.1-year-old) and middle-aged (mean age 56.4-year-old) group. The analysis revealed that brain NAD level and NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/NADH redox ratio were positively associated with ATP level and the rate of energy production, respectively. Moreover, a metabolic network linking NAD with membrane phospholipid metabolism, energy production, and aging was identified. An inverted trend between age and NAD level was detected. These results pave the way for the use of &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-MRS as a powerful non-invasive tool to support the development of new therapeutic interventions targeting NAD associated phospho-metabolic pathways in brain aging and neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Senescent Cell-Secreted Netrin-1 Modulates Aging-Related Disorders by Recruiting Sympathetic Fibers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.507140</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cellular senescence is implicated in several lines of aging-related disorders. However, the potential molecular mechanisms by which cellular senescence modulates age-related pathologies remain largely unexplored. Herein, we report that the density of sympathetic fibers (SFs) is significantly elevated in naturally aged mouse tissues and human colon adenoma tissues compared to the SFs densities in the corresponding young mouse tissues and human non-lesion colon tissues. A dorsal root ganglion (DRG)-human diploid fibroblast coculture assay revealed that senescent cells promote the outgrowth of SFs, indicating that the senescent cells induce recruitment of SFs in vitro. Additionally, subcutaneous transplantation of 2BS fibroblasts in nude mice shows that transplanted senescent 2BS fibroblasts promote SFs infiltration. Intra-articular senolytic molecular injection can reduce SFs density and inhibit SFs infiltration caused by senescent cells in osteoarthritis (OA), suggesting senescent cells promote the infiltration of SFs in vivo in aged tissues. Notably, the elevated level of SFs contributes to impaired cognitive function in naturally aged mice, which can be reversed by treatment with propranolol hydrochloride, a non-selective β receptor blocker that inhibits sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) by blocking non-selective β receptors. Additionally, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced sympathectomy improved hepatic sympathetic overactivity mediated hepatic steatosis in high fat diet (HFD)-fed APOE knockout mice (APOE&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice) by reducing hepatic SNA. Taken together, this study concludes that senescent cell-secreted netrin-1 mediated SFs outgrowth and infiltration, which contributes to aging-related disorders, suggesting that clearing senescent cells or inhibiting SNA is a promising therapeutic strategy for improving sympathetic nervous system (SNS) hyperactivity-induced aging-related pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Time from I.V. Thrombolysis to Thrombectomy and Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25978</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25978?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Whether the time from intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) to endovascular treatment (EVT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke has an effect on the functional outcome is unknown.


Methods
The Endovascular Treatment in Ischemic Stroke (ETIS) registry is an ongoing, prospective, multicenter, observational study that perform EVT in France. Data were analyzed from patients treated by IVT and EVT between October 2013 and December 2018 in 6 comprehensive stroke centers. In the primary analysis, we assessed the association of time from IVT administration to start of EVT with functional outcome (measured with the modified Rankin Scale [mRS]), by means of ordinal logistic regression. Secondary end points included angiographic and safety outcomes.


Results
We analyzed 1,986 patients with acute ischemic stroke due to anterior circulation large vessel occlusion who underwent IVT and EVT. An increased IVT to start of EVT time was associated with a worse functional outcome at 90 days (mRS = 0–2, adjusted odds ratio [OR] per 30 minutes increase in time = 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.86–0.96; mRS = 0–1, adjusted OR per 30 minutes increase in time = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.84–0.94), a lower chance of modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) grade 2b to 3 reperfusion (adjusted OR per 30 minutes increase in time = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.87–0.98), and an increased probability of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (adjusted OR per 30 minutes increase in time = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.99–1.18).


Interpretation
These findings provide a basis for further studies to determine if the functional outcome of patients with stroke can be greatly improved by optimizing IVT to EVT times. ANN NEUROL 2020</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: EIF2AK2 Missense Variants Associated with Early Onset Generalized Dystonia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25973</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25973?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The study was undertaken to identify a monogenic cause of early onset, generalized dystonia.


Methods
Methods consisted of genome‐wide linkage analysis, exome and Sanger sequencing, clinical neurological examination, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and protein expression studies in skin fibroblasts from patients.


Results
We identified a heterozygous variant, c.388G&amp;gt;A, p.Gly130Arg, in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 2 (EIF2AK2) gene, segregating with early onset isolated generalized dystonia in 5 patients of a Taiwanese family. EIF2AK2 sequencing in 191 unrelated patients with unexplained dystonia yielded 2 unrelated Caucasian patients with an identical heterozygous c.388G&amp;gt;A, p.Gly130Arg variant, occurring de novo in one case, another patient carrying a different heterozygous variant, c.413G&amp;gt;C, p.Gly138Ala, and one last patient, born from consanguineous parents, carrying a third, homozygous variant c.95A&amp;gt;C, p.Asn32Thr. These 3 missense variants are absent from gnomAD, and are located in functional domains of the encoded protein. In 3 patients, additional neurological manifestations were present, including intellectual disability and spasticity. EIF2AK2 encodes a kinase (protein kinase R [PKR]) that phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), which orchestrates the cellular stress response. Our expression studies showed abnormally enhanced activation of the cellular stress response, monitored by PKR‐mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α, in fibroblasts from patients with EIF2AK2 variants. Intriguingly, PKR can also be regulated by PRKRA (protein interferon‐inducible double‐stranded RNA‐dependent protein kinase activator A), the product of another gene causing monogenic dystonia.


Interpretation
We identified EIF2AK2 variants implicated in early onset generalized dystonia, which can be dominantly or recessively inherited, or occur de novo. Our findings provide direct evidence for a key role of a dysfunctional eIF2α pathway in the pathogenesis of dystonia. ANN NEUROL 2020</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: The relationship between hippocampal subfield volumes and autobiographical memory persistence</title>

	<description>Abstract
Structural integrity of the human hippocampus is widely acknowledged to be necessary for the successful encoding and retrieval of autobiographical memories. However, evidence for an association between hippocampal volume and the ability to recall such memories in healthy individuals is mixed. Here we examined this issue further by combining two approaches. First, we focused on the anatomically distinct subregions of the hippocampus where more nuanced associations may be expressed compared to considering the whole hippocampal volume. A manual segmentation protocol of hippocampal subregions allowed us to separately calculate the volumes of the dentate gyrus/CA4, CA3/2, CA1, subiculum, pre/parasubiculum and uncus. Second, a critical feature of autobiographical memories is that they can span long time periods, and so we sought to consider how memory details persist over time by conducting a longitudinal study whereby participants had to recall the same autobiographical memories on two visits spaced 8 months apart. Overall, we found that there was no difference in the total number of internal (episodic) details produced at Visits 1 and 2. However, further probing of detail subcategories revealed that specifically the amount of subjective thoughts and emotions included during recall had declined significantly by the second visit. We also observed a strong correlation between left pre/parasubiculum volume and the amount of autobiographical memory internal details produced over time. This positive relationship was evident for particular facets of the memories, with remembered events, perceptual observations and thoughts and emotions benefitting from greater volume of the left pre/parasubiculum. These preliminary findings expand upon existing functional neuroimaging evidence by highlighting a potential link between left pre/parasubiculum volume and autobiographical memory. A larger pre/parasubiculum appears not only to protect against memory decay, but may possibly enhance memory persistence, inviting further scrutiny of the role of this brain region in remote autobiographical memory retrieval.</description>

	<description>Abstract
Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with hippocampal alterations that can increase the risk of short‐term memory impairments later in life. Despite the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in learning and memory, research into the long‐lasting impact of IUGR on these processes is limited. We aimed to determine the effects of IUGR on neuronal proliferation, differentiation and morphology, and on memory function at adolescent equivalent age. At embryonic day (E) 18 (term ∼E22), placental insufficiency was induced in pregnant Wistar rats via bilateral uterine vessel ligation to generate IUGR offspring (n = 10); control offspring (n = 11) were generated via sham surgery. From postnatal day (P) 36–44, spontaneous location recognition (SLR), novel object location and recognition (NOL, NOR), and open field tests were performed. Brains were collected at P45 to assess neurogenesis (immunohistochemistry), dendritic morphology (Golgi staining), and brain‐derived neurotrophic factor expression (BDNF; Western blot analysis). In IUGR versus control rats there was no difference in object preference in the NOL or NOR, the similar and dissimilar condition of the SLR task, or in locomotion and anxiety‐like behavior in the open field. There was a significant increase in the linear density of immature neurons (DCX+) in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG), but no difference in the linear density of proliferating cells (Ki67+) in the SGZ, nor in areal density of mature neurons (NeuN+) or microglia (Iba‐1+) in the DG in IUGR rats compared to controls. Dendritic morphology of dentate granule cells did not differ between groups. Protein expression of the BDNF precursor (pro‐BDNF), but not mature BDNF, was increased in the hippocampus of IUGR compared with control rats. These findings highlight that while the long‐lasting prenatal hypoxic environment may impact brain development, it may not impact hippocampal‐dependent learning and memory in adolescence.</description>

Protein expression of the BDNF precursor (pro‐BDNF), but not mature BDNF, was increased in the hippocampus of IUGR compared with control rats. These findings highlight that while the long‐lasting prenatal hypoxic environment may impact brain development, it may not impact hippocampal‐dependent learning and memory in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The brain of the African wild dog. II. The olfactory system&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b06e2ab9-d3db-45ad-ade8-a31237cf63dd/cne25007-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 reveals the glomeruli in the main olfactory bulb of the brain of the African wild dog. Stereological estimates of the numbers of glomeruli reveal that the African wild dog has up to 1700 glomeruli. Scale bar = 250 μm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing a range of neuroanatomical stains, we detail the organization of the main and accessory olfactory systems of the African wild dog. The organization of both these systems follows that typically observed in mammals, but variations of interest were noted. Within the main olfactory bulb, the size of the glomeruli, at approximately 350 μm in diameter, are on the larger end of the range observed across mammals. In addition, we estimate that approximately 3,500 glomeruli are present in each main olfactory bulb. This larger main olfactory bulb glomerular size and number of glomeruli indicates that enhanced peripheral processing of a broad range of odorants is occurring in the main olfactory bulb of the African wild dog. Within the accessory olfactory bulb, the glomeruli did not appear distinct, rather forming a homogenous syncytia‐like arrangement as seen in the domestic dog. In addition, the laminar organization of the deeper layers of the accessory olfactory bulb was indistinct, perhaps as a consequence of the altered architecture of the glomeruli. This arrangement of glomeruli indicates that rather than parcellating the processing of semiochemicals peripherally, these odorants may be processed in a more nuanced and combinatorial manner in the periphery, allowing for more rapid and precise behavioral responses as required in the highly social group structure observed in the African wild dog. While having a similar organization to that of other mammals, the olfactory system of the African wild dog has certain features that appear to correlate to their environmental niche.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Lateral view of the brain of the African wild dog showing the location of the various visual cortical areas and regions identified anatomically in the current study. We could identify the four occipital visual areas 17, 18, 19 and 21, as well as suprasylvian, parietal and temporal regions likely comprised of multiple cortical areas. Scale bar = 1 cm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variegated pelage and social complexity of the African wild dog (&lt;i&gt;Lycaon pictus&lt;/i&gt;) hint at the possibility of specializations of the visual system. Here, using a range of architectural and immunohistochemical stains, we describe the systems‐level organization of the image‐forming, nonimage forming, oculomotor, and accessory optic, vision‐associated systems in the brain of one representative individual of the African wild dog. For all of these systems, the organization, in terms of location, parcellation and topology (internal and external), is very similar to that reported in other carnivores. The image‐forming visual system consists of the superior colliculus, visual dorsal thalamus (dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, pulvinar and lateral posterior nucleus) and visual cortex (occipital, parietal, suprasylvian, temporal and splenial visual regions). The nonimage forming visual system comprises the suprachiasmatic nucleus, ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, pretectal nuclear complex and the Edinger–Westphal nucleus. The oculomotor system incorporates the oculomotor, trochlear and abducens cranial nerve nuclei as well as the parabigeminal nucleus, while the accessory optic system includes the dorsal, lateral and medial terminal nuclei. The extent of similarity to other carnivores in the systems‐level organization of these systems indicates that the manner in which these systems process visual information is likely to be consistent with that found, for example, in the well‐studied domestic cat. It would appear that the sociality of the African wild dog is dependent upon the processing of information extracted from the visual system in the higher‐order cognitive and affective neural systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Photograph of the lateral surface of the African wild dog brain. The African wild dog has a relatively large brain, but this appears to be related to a reduction in body mass during its evolutionary history, rather than an increase in brain mass in response to a complex social environment. In this image dorsal is to the top and rostral toward the left. Scale bar = 1 cm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The African wild dog is endemic to sub‐Saharan Africa and belongs to the family Canidae which includes domestic dogs and their closest relatives (i.e., wolves, coyotes, jackals, dingoes, and foxes). The African wild dog is known for its highly social behavior, co‐ordinated pack predation, and striking vocal repertoire, but little is known about its brain and whether it differs in any significant way from that of other canids. We employed gross anatomical observation, magnetic resonance imaging, and classical neuroanatomical staining to provide a broad overview of the structure of the African wild dog brain. Our results reveal a mean brain mass of 154.08 g, with an encephalization quotient of 1.73, indicating that the African wild dog has a relatively large brain size. Analysis of the various structures that comprise their brains and their topological inter‐relationships, as well as the areas and volumes of the corpus callosum, ventricular system, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum and the gyrification index, all reveal that the African wild dog brain is, in general, similar to that of other mammals, and very similar to that of other carnivorans. While at this level of analysis we do not find any striking specializations within the brain of the African wild dog, apart from a relatively large brain size, the observations made indicate that more detailed analyses of specific neural systems, particularly those involved in sensorimotor processing, sociality or cognition, may reveal features that are either unique to this species or shared among the Canidae to the exclusion of other Carnivora.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Morphological identification and systematic classification of mammalian retinal ganglion cells. I. Rabbit retinal ganglion cells&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c7f64479-9979-4a40-a869-ba3cdb7a5610/cne24998-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1,142 ganglion cells from 26 Golgi‐impregnated rabbit retinas were analyzed morphometrically and classified according to cell body size, dendritic field size, and dendritic branching pattern, based upon camera lucida drawings, and level of dendritic stratification, with reference to overlapping starburst amacrine and fiducial ganglion cells. 91 morphologies were characterized, distributed in four classes, composed of more than 60 types.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) convey visual signals to 50 regions of the brain. For reasons of interest and convenience, they constitute an excellent system for the study of brain structure and function. There is general agreement that, absent a complete “parts list,” understanding how the nervous system processes information will remain an elusive goal. Recent studies indicate that there are 30–50 types of ganglion cell in mouse retina, whereas only a few years ago it was still written that mice and the more visually oriented lagomorphs had less than 20 types of RGC. More than 30 years ago, I estimated that rabbits have about 40 types of RGC. The present study indicates that this number is much too low. I have employed the old but powerful method of Golgi‐impregnation to rabbit retina, studying the range of component neurons in this already well‐studied retinal system. Close quantitative and qualitative analyses of 1,142 RGCs in 26 retinas take into account cell body and dendritic field size, level(s) of dendritic stratification in the retina's inner plexiform layer, and details of dendritic branching. Ninety‐one morphologies are recognized. Of these, at least 32 can be correlated with physiologically studied RGCs, dye‐injected for morphological analysis. It is unlikely that rabbits have 91 types of RGC, but is argued here that this number lies between 60 and 70. The present study provides a “yardstick” for measuring the output of future molecular studies that may be more definitive in fixing the number of RGC types in rabbit retina.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for parvalbumin reveals the various nuclei of the superior olivary complex and trapezoid body within the brain of the African wild dog. We could identify the medial and lateral superior olivary nuclei, the superior, medioventral, and lateroventral periolivary nuclei, the nucleus of the trapezoid body (Tz), and the fiber bundles forming the trapezoid body (tz). Scale bar = 1 mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large external pinnae and extensive vocal repertoire of the African wild dog (&lt;i&gt;Lycaon pictus&lt;/i&gt;) has led to the assumption that the auditory system of this unique canid may be specialized. Here, using cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, and a range of immunohistochemical stains, we describe the systems‐level anatomy of the auditory system of the African wild dog. We observed the cochlear nuclear complex, superior olivary nuclear complex, lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body, and auditory cortex all being in their expected locations, and exhibiting the standard subdivisions of this system. While located in the ectosylvian gyri, the auditory cortex includes several areas, resembling the parcellation observed in cats and ferrets, although not all of the auditory areas known from these species could be identified in the African wild dog. These observations suggest that, broadly speaking, the systems‐level anatomy of the auditory system, and by extension the processing of auditory information, within the brain of the African wild dog closely resembles that observed in other carnivores. Our findings indicate that it is likely that the extraction of the semantic content of the vocalizations of African wild dogs, and the behaviors generated, occurs beyond the classically defined auditory system, in limbic or association neocortical regions involved in cognitive functions. Thus, to obtain a deeper understanding of how auditory stimuli are processed, and how communication is achieved, in the African wild dog compared to other canids, cortical regions beyond the primary sensory areas will need to be examined in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Halgurd Taher, Alessandro Torcini, Simona Olmi&lt;/p&gt;

A synaptic theory of Working Memory (WM) has been developed in the last decade as a possible alternative to the persistent spiking paradigm. In this context, we have developed a neural mass model able to reproduce exactly the dynamics of heterogeneous spiking neural networks encompassing realistic cellular mechanisms for short-term synaptic plasticity. This population model reproduces the macroscopic dynamics of the network in terms of the firing rate and the mean membrane potential. The latter quantity allows us to gain insight of the Local Field Potential and electroencephalographic signals measured during WM tasks to characterize the brain activity. More specifically synaptic facilitation and depression integrate each other to efficiently mimic WM operations via either synaptic reactivation or persistent activity. Memory access and loading are related to stimulus-locked transient oscillations followed by a steady-state activity in the &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; band, thus resembling what is observed in the cortex during vibrotactile stimuli in humans and object recognition in monkeys. Memory juggling and competition emerge already by loading only two items. However more items can be stored in WM by considering neural architectures composed of multiple excitatory populations and a common inhibitory pool. Memory capacity depends strongly on the presentation rate of the items and it maximizes for an optimal frequency range. In particular we provide an analytic expression for the maximal memory capacity. Furthermore, the mean membrane potential turns out to be a suitable proxy to measure the memory load, analogously to event driven potentials in experiments on humans. Finally we show that the &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; power increases with the number of loaded items, as reported in many experiments, while &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; power reveal non monotonic behaviours. In particular, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; rhythms are crucially sustained by the inhibitory activity, while the &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt; rhythm is controlled by excitatory synapses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XLh34phg_eg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A mechanistic framework for &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; pharmacokinetic predictions of orally inhaled drugs</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Niklas Hartung, Jens Markus Borghardt&lt;/p&gt;

The fate of orally inhaled drugs is determined by pulmonary pharmacokinetic processes such as particle deposition, pulmonary drug dissolution, and mucociliary clearance. Even though each single process has been systematically investigated, a quantitative understanding on the interaction of processes remains limited and therefore identifying optimal drug and formulation characteristics for orally inhaled drugs is still challenging. To investigate this complex interplay, the pulmonary processes can be integrated into mathematical models. However, existing modeling attempts considerably simplify these processes or are not systematically evaluated against (clinical) data. In this work, we developed a mathematical framework based on physiologically-structured population equations to integrate all relevant pulmonary processes mechanistically. A tailored numerical resolution strategy was chosen and the mechanistic model was evaluated systematically against data from different clinical studies. Without adapting the mechanistic model or estimating kinetic parameters based on individual study data, the developed model was able to predict simultaneously (i) lung retention profiles of inhaled insoluble particles, (ii) particle size-dependent pharmacokinetics of inhaled monodisperse particles, (iii) pharmacokinetic differences between inhaled fluticasone propionate and budesonide, as well as (iv) pharmacokinetic differences between healthy volunteers and asthmatic patients. Finally, to identify the most impactful optimization criteria for orally inhaled drugs, the developed mechanistic model was applied to investigate the impact of input parameters on both the pulmonary and systemic exposure. Interestingly, the solubility of the inhaled drug did not have any relevant impact on the local and systemic pharmacokinetics. Instead, the pulmonary dissolution rate, the particle size, the tissue affinity, and the systemic clearance were the most impactful potential optimization parameters. In the future, the developed prediction framework should be considered a powerful tool for identifying optimal drug and formulation characteristics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Nd2hBwz2pI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The outer epithelial layer of zebrafish retinae contains a crystalline array of cone photoreceptors, called the cone mosaic. As this mosaic grows by mitotic addition of new photoreceptors at the rim of the hemispheric retina, topological defects, called “Y-Junctions”, form to maintain approximately constant cell spacing. The generation of topological defects due to growth on a curved surface is a distinct feature of the cone mosaic not seen in other well-studied biological patterns like the R8 photoreceptor array in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; compound eye. Since defects can provide insight into cell-cell interactions responsible for pattern formation, here we characterize the arrangement of cones in individual Y-Junction cores as well as the spatial distribution of Y-junctions across entire retinae. We find that for individual Y-junctions, the distribution of cones near the core corresponds closely to structures observed in physical crystals. In addition, Y-Junctions are organized into lines, called grain boundaries, from the retinal center to the periphery. In physical crystals, regardless of the initial distribution of defects, defects can coalesce into grain boundaries via the mobility of individual particles. By imaging in live fish, we demonstrate that grain boundaries in the cone mosaic instead appear during initial mosaic formation, without requiring defect motion. Motivated by this observation, we show that a computational model of repulsive cell-cell interactions generates a mosaic with grain boundaries. In contrast to paradigmatic models of fate specification in mostly motionless cell packings, this finding emphasizes the role of cell motion, guided by cell-cell interactions during differentiation, in forming biological crystals. Such a route to the formation of regular patterns may be especially valuable in situations, like growth on a curved surface, where the resulting long-ranged, elastic, effective interactions between defects can help to group them into grain boundaries.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jYa-B1VXVpk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

With the ongoing COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), there is a need for sensitive, specific, and affordable diagnostic tests to identify infected individuals, not all of whom are symptomatic. The most sensitive test involves the detection of viral RNA using RT-qPCR (quantitative reverse transcription PCR), with many commercial kits now available for this purpose. However, these are expensive, and supply of such kits in sufficient numbers cannot always be guaranteed. We therefore developed a multiplex assay using well-established SARS-CoV-2 targets alongside a human cellular control (&lt;i&gt;RPP30&lt;/i&gt;) and a viral spike-in control (Phocine Herpes Virus 1 [PhHV-1]), which monitor sample quality and nucleic acid extraction efficiency, respectively. Here, we establish that this test performs as well as widely used commercial assays, but at substantially reduced cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate &amp;gt;1,000-fold variability in material routinely collected by combined nose and throat swabbing and establish a statistically significant correlation between the detected level of human and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. The inclusion of the human control probe in our assay therefore provides a quantitative measure of sample quality that could help reduce false-negative rates. We demonstrate the feasibility of establishing a robust RT-qPCR assay at approximately 10% of the cost of equivalent commercial assays, which could benefit low-resource environments and make high-volume testing affordable.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/u-B-e7NOqno&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The recent outbreak of betacoronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic, has created great challenges in viral diagnosis. The existing methods for nucleic acid detection are of high sensitivity and specificity, but the need for complex sample manipulation and expensive machinery slow down the disease detection. Thus, there is an urgent demand to develop a rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive diagnostic test to aid point-of-care viral detection for disease monitoring. In this study, we developed a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated proteins (Cas) 12a-based diagnostic method that allows the results to be visualized by the naked eye. We also introduced a rapid sample processing method, and when combined with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), the sample to result can be achieved in 50 minutes with high sensitivity (1–10 copies per reaction). This accurate and portable detection method holds a great potential for COVID-19 control, especially in areas where specialized equipment is not available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ktmyB7R6Rkc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Microstructural changes in the middle brain.

Abstract
A recent randomized controlled trial in young patients with long‐term post‐concussion symptoms showed that a novel behavioral intervention “Get going After concussIoN” is superior to enhanced usual care in terms of symptom reduction. It is unknown whether these interventional effects are associated with microstructural brain changes. The aim of this study was to examine whether diffusion‐weighted MRI indices, which are sensitive to the interactions between cellular structures and water molecules' Brownian motion, respond differently to the interventions of the above‐mentioned trial and whether such differences correlate with the improvement of post‐concussion symptoms. Twenty‐three patients from the intervention group (mean age 22.8, 18 females) and 19 patients from the control group (enhanced usual care) (mean age 23.9, 14 females) were enrolled. The primary outcome measure was the mean kurtosis tensor, which is sensitive to the microscopic complexity of brain tissue. The mean kurtosis tensor was significantly increased in the intervention group (p = 0.003) in the corpus callosum but not in the thalamus (p = 0.78) and the hippocampus (p = 0.34). An increase in mean kurtosis tensor in the corpus callosum tended to be associated with a reduction in symptoms, but this association did not reach significance (p = 0.059). Changes in diffusion tensor imaging metrics did not differ between intervention groups and were not associated with symptoms. The current study found different diffusion‐weighted MRI responses from the microscopic cellular structures of the corpus callosum between patients receiving a novel behavioral intervention and patients receiving enhanced usual care. Correlations with improvement of post‐concussion symptoms were not evident.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Experimental diffuse brain injury and a model of Alzheimer's disease exhibit disease‐specific changes in sleep and incongruous peripheral inflammation</title>

	<description>In similarly aged individuals, traumatic brain injury (TBI) induced more profound sleep alterations than Alzheimer's disease (AD), with incongruous inflammation. Altered sleep may be associated with deleterious pathological processes and unique pathological sleep pathways may exist in older individuals that incur TBI compared with similarly aged individuals that have AD.

Abstract
Elderly populations (≥65 years old) have the highest risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and/or obtaining a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Using translational mouse models, we investigated sleep disturbances and inflammation associated with normal aging, TBI and aging, and AD. We hypothesized that aging results in marked changes in sleep compared with adult mice, and that TBI and aging would result in sleep and inflammation levels similar to AD mice. We used female 16‐month‐old wild‐type (WT Aged) and 3xTg‐AD mice, as well as a 2‐month‐old reference group (WT Adult), to evaluate sleep changes. WT Aged mice received diffuse TBI by midline fluid percussion, and blood was collected from both WT Aged (pre‐ and post‐TBI) and 3xTg‐AD mice to evaluate inflammation. Cognitive behavior was tested, and tissue was collected for histology. Bayesian generalized additive and mixed‐effects models were used for analyses. Both normal aging and AD led to increases in sleep compared with adult mice. WT Aged mice with TBI slept substantially more, with fragmented shorter bouts, than they did pre‐TBI and compared with AD mice. However, differences between WT Aged and 3xTg‐AD mice in immune cell populations and plasma cytokine levels were incongruous, cognitive deficits were similar, and cumulative sleep was not predictive of inflammation or behavior for either group. Our results suggest that in similarly aged individuals, TBI immediately induces more profound sleep alterations than in AD, although both diseases likely include cognitive impairments. Unique pathological sleep pathways may exist in elderly individuals who incur TBI compared with similarly aged individuals who have AD, which may warrant disease‐specific treatments in clinical settings.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Acetylcholine Muscarinic Receptors in Ventral Hippocampus Modulate Stress-Induced Anxiety-Like Behaviors in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.598811</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress exposure increases the risk of developing various neuropsychiatric illnesses. The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is central to affective and cognitive processing and displays a high density of acetylcholine (ACh) muscarinic receptors (mAChRs). However, the precise role of vHPC mAChRs in anxiety remains to be fully investigated. In this study, we found that chronic restraint stress (CRS) induced social avoidance and anxiety-like behaviors in mice and increased mAChR expression in the vHPC. CRS increased the vHPC ACh release in behaving mice. Moreover, CRS altered the synaptic activities and enhanced neuronal activity of the vHPC neurons. Using pharmacological and viral approaches, we showed that infusing the antagonist of mAChRs or decreasing their expression in the vHPC attenuated the anxiety-like behavior and rescued the social avoidance behaviors in mice probably due to suppression of vHPC neuronal activity and its excitatory synaptic transmission. Our results suggest that the changes of neuronal activity and synaptic transmission in the vHPC mediated by mAChRs may play an important role in stress-induced anxiety-like behavior, providing new insights into the pathological mechanism and potential pharmacological target for anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tau is a microtubule-associated protein (MAPT) that is highly expressed in neurons and implicated in several cellular processes. Tau misfolding and self-aggregation give rise to proteinaceous deposits known as neuro-fibrillary tangles. Tau tangles play a key role in the genesis of a group of diseases commonly referred to as tauopathies; notably, these aggregates start to form decades before any clinical symptoms manifest. Advanced imaging methodologies have clarified important structural and functional aspects of tau and could have a role as diagnostic tools in clinical research. In the present review, recent progresses in tau imaging will be discussed. We will focus mainly on super-resolution imaging methods and the development of near-infrared fluorescent probes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Preventing Neurodegeneration by Controlling Oxidative Stress: The Role of OXR1</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease, diabetic retinopathy, hyperoxia induced retinopathy, and neuronal damage resulting from ischemia are among the notable neurodegenerative diseases in which oxidative stress occurs shortly before the onset of neurodegeneration. A shared feature of these diseases is the depletion of OXR1 (oxidation resistance 1) gene products shortly before the onset of neurodegeneration. In animal models of these diseases, restoration of OXR1 has been shown to reduce or eliminate the deleterious effects of oxidative stress induced cell death, delay the onset of symptoms, and reduce overall severity. Moreover, increasing OXR1 expression in cells further increases oxidative stress resistance and delays onset of disease while showing no detectable side effects. Thus, restoring or increasing OXR1 function shows promise as a therapeutic for multiple neurodegenerative diseases. This review examines the role of OXR1 in oxidative stress resistance and its impact on neurodegenerative diseases. We describe the potential of OXR1 as a therapeutic in light of our current understanding of its function at the cellular and molecular level and propose a possible cascade of molecular events linked to OXR1’s regulatory functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Brain Functional Interaction of Acupuncture Effects in Diarrhea-Dominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine treatment that has widely been used to modulate gastrointestinal dysfunction caused by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and to alleviate the resulting pain. Recent studies have shown that gastrointestinal dysfunction caused by IBS is associated with dysregulation of the brain's central and peripheral nervous system, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) helps explore functional abnormality of the brain. However, previous studies rarely used fMRI to study the correlations between brain functional connection, interaction, or segregation (e.g., network degree and clustering coefficient) and acupuncture stimulation in IBS. To bridge this knowledge gap, we study the changed brain functional connection, interaction, and segregation before and after acupuncture stimulation for diarrhea-dominant IBS (IBS-D) with the help of complex network methods based on fMRI. Our results indicate that the abnormal functional connections (FCs) in the right hippocampus, right superior occipital gyrus, left lingual gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, and the cerebellum, and abnormal network degree in right middle occipital gyrus, where normal controls are significantly different from IBS-D patients, are improved after acupuncture stimulation. These changed FCs and the network degree before and after acupuncture stimulation have significant correlations with the changed clinical information including IBS symptom severity score (r = −0.54, p = 0.0065) and IBS quality of life (r = 0.426, p = 0.038). We conclude that the changes of the brain functional connection, interaction, and segregation in the hippocampus, middle and superior occipital gyrus, cerebellum, and the lingual gyrus may be related to acupuncture stimulation. The abnormal functional connection, interaction, and segregation in IBS-D may be improved after acupuncture stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Transcriptional, Behavioral and Biochemical Profiling in the 3xTg-AD Mouse Model Reveals a Specific Signature of Amyloid Deposition and Functional Decline in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related degenerative decline is associated to the presence of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque lesions and neuro fibrillary tangles (NFT). However, the precise molecular mechanisms linking Aβ deposition and neurological decline are still unclear. Here we combine genome-wide transcriptional profiling of the insular cortex of 3xTg-AD mice and control littermates from early through to late adulthood (2–14 months of age), with behavioral and biochemical profiling in the same animals to identify transcriptional determinants of functional decline specifically associated to build-up of Aβ deposits. Differential expression analysis revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the cortex long before observed onset of behavioral symptoms in this model. Using behavioral and biochemical data derived from the same mice and samples, we found that down but not up-regulated DEGs show a stronger average association with learning performance than random background genes in control not seen in AD mice. Conversely, these same genes were found to have a stronger association with Aβ deposition than background genes in AD but not in control mice, thereby identifying these genes as potential intermediaries between abnormal Aβ/NFT deposition and functional decline. Using a complementary approach, gene ontology analysis revealed a highly significant enrichment of learning and memory, associative, memory, and cognitive functions only among down-regulated, but not up-regulated, DEGs. Our results demonstrate wider transcriptional changes triggered by the abnormal deposition of Aβ/NFT occurring well before behavioral decline and identify a distinct set of genes specifically associated to abnormal Aβ protein deposition and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mild behavioral deficits, which are part of normal aging, can be early indicators of an impending Alzheimer's disease. Using the APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, we utilized the Morris water maze spatial learning paradigm to systematically evaluate mild behavioral deficits that occur during the early stages of disease pathogenesis. Conventional behavioral analysis using this model indicates that spatial memory is intact at 2 months of age. In this study, we used an alternative method to analyze the behavior of mice, aiming to gain a better understanding of the nature of cognitive deficits by focusing on the unsuccessful trials during water maze learning rather than on the successful ones. APP/PS1 mice displayed a higher number of unsuccessful trials during the initial days of training, unlike their wild-type counterparts. However, with repeated trial and error, learning in APP/PS1 reached levels comparable to that of the wild-type mice during the later days of training. Individual APP/PS1 mice preferred a non-cognitive search strategy called circling, which led to abrupt learning transitions and an increased number of unsuccessful trials. These findings indicate the significance of subtle intermediate readouts as early indicators of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After fitting the double-exponential model, slow ADC (Ds) and the fraction of fast ADC (f) values of the whole brain were obtained, which then were compared in a voxelwise manner by two-sample t-test. Multiple comparisons were corrected by the family-wise error (FWE) method with a corrected threshold of P &amp;lt; 0.05. Pearson correlations between IVIM parameters in altered brain regions and blood pressure, glucose, lipid, and homocysteine were calculated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;For the test group, the Z-normalized Ds values were significantly higher in the left median cingulate and paracingulate gyrus (DCG.L), posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG. L), and left precuneus gyrus (PCUN.L) (cluster size = 156) and in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG.L), orbital middle frontal gyrus (ORBmid.L), and superior frontal gyrus (SFG.L) (cluster size = 165); the Z-normalized Ds values were significantly lower in the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG.R) and inferior temporal gyrus (ITG.R) (cluster size = 116); and the Z-normalized f-values were significantly lower in the MTG.R and ITG.R (cluster size = 85) (p &amp;lt; 0.05, FWE correction). LDL-C was negatively correlated with the Z-normalized Ds values in the DCG.L, PCG.L, and PCUN.L (r = 0.601, p = 0.002). LDL-C was positively correlated with the Z-normalized f-value in the MTG.R and ITG.R (r = 0.405, p = 0.05). Systolic blood pressure was positively correlated with the Z-normalized Ds values in the MFG.L, ORBmid.L, and SFG.L (r = 0.433, p = 0.035).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study was the first to detect subclinical brain alterations in asymptomatic carotid vulnerable plaque group through IVIM using whole-brain voxelwise comparisons, which were partially correlated with blood pressure and lipids. Thus, IVIM might be utilized as a noninvasive biomarker of microvascular and microstructural brain changes in the asymptomatic carotid vulnerable plaque group.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an example of age-related dementia, and there are still no known preventive or curative measures for this disease. Obesity and associated metabolic changes are widely accepted as risk factors of age-related cognitive decline. Insulin is the prime mediator of metabolic homeostasis, which is impaired in obesity, and this impairment potentiates amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Obesity is also linked with functional and morphological alterations in brain mitochondria leading to brain insulin resistance (IR) and memory deficits associated with AD. Also, increased peripheral inflammation and oxidative stress due to obesity are the main drivers that increase an individual’s susceptibility to cognitive deficits, thus doubling the risk of AD. This enhanced risk of AD is alarming in the context of a rapidly increasing global incidence of obesity and overweight in the general population. In this review, we summarize the risk factors that link obesity with AD and emphasize the point that the treatment and management of obesity may also provide a way to prevent AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
