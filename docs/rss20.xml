	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-subject fMRI studies are challenging due to the high variability of
both brain anatomy and functional brain topographies across participants. An
effective way of aggregating multi-subject fMRI data is to extract a shared
representation that filters out unwanted variability among subjects. Some
recent work has implemented probabilistic models to extract a shared
representation in task fMRI. In the present work, we improve upon these models
by incorporating temporal information in the common latent structures. We
introduce a new model, Shared Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (S-GPFA), that
discovers shared latent trajectories and subject-specific functional
topographies, while modelling temporal correlation in fMRI data. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our model in revealing ground truth latent structures using
simulated data, and replicate experimental performance of time-segment matching
and inter-subject similarity on the publicly available Raider dataset. We
further test the utility of our model by analyzing its learned model parameters
in the large multi-site SPINS dataset, on a social cognition task from
participants with and without schizophrenia.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pruning the parameters of deep neural networks has generated intense interest
due to potential savings in time, memory and energy both during training and at
test time. Recent works have identified, through an expensive sequence of
training and pruning cycles, the existence of winning lottery tickets or sparse
trainable subnetworks at initialization. This raises a foundational question:
can we identify highly sparse trainable subnetworks at initialization, without
ever training, or indeed without ever looking at the data? We provide an
affirmative answer to this question through theory driven algorithm design. We
first mathematically formulate and experimentally verify a conservation law
that explains why existing gradient-based pruning algorithms at initialization
suffer from layer-collapse, the premature pruning of an entire layer rendering
a network untrainable. This theory also elucidates how layer-collapse can be
entirely avoided, motivating a novel pruning algorithm Iterative Synaptic Flow
Pruning (SynFlow). This algorithm can be interpreted as preserving the total
flow of synaptic strengths through the network at initialization subject to a
sparsity constraint. Notably, this algorithm makes no reference to the training
data and consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art pruning algorithms
at initialization over a range of models (VGG and ResNet), datasets
(CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny ImageNet), and sparsity constraints (up to 99.9
percent). Thus our data-agnostic pruning algorithm challenges the existing
paradigm that data must be used to quantify which synapses are important.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A variety of methods have been applied to the architectural configuration and
learning or training of artificial deep neural networks (DNN). These methods
play a crucial role in the success or failure of the DNN for most problems and
applications. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are gaining momentum as a
computationally feasible method for the automated optimisation and training of
DNNs. Neuroevolution is a term which describes these processes of automated
configuration and training of DNNs using EAs. While many works exist in the
literature, no comprehensive surveys currently exist focusing exclusively on
the strengths and limitations of using neuroevolution approaches in DNNs.
Prolonged absence of such surveys can lead to a disjointed and fragmented field
preventing DNNs researchers potentially adopting neuroevolutionary methods in
their own research, resulting in lost opportunities for improving performance
and wider application within real-world deep learning problems. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey, discussion and evaluation of the
state-of-the-art works on using EAs for architectural configuration and
training of DNNs. Based on this survey, the paper highlights the most pertinent
current issues and challenges in neuroevolution and identifies multiple
promising future research directions.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The recent advent of single cell RNA-sequencing and other high-throughput
technologies has led to an explosion of cell type definitions across multiple
organ systems. Consortia like the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN)
and the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) have begun to standardize and centralize the
intake of data and associated metadata from these projects; however, the naming
and organization of cell types has largely been left to individual
investigators, resulting in widely varying nomenclature and limited alignment
between taxonomies derived from overlapping datasets. To facilitate
cross-dataset alignment and comparison, we created a working nomenclature
convention for matching and tracking cell types across studies. The convention
is qualitatively similar to how gene transcripts are tracked across different
versions of GENCODE genome builds, allowing comparison of matched types with a
common reference or any other taxonomy. It augments but does not change
existing cell type names provided in original publications and can be directly
applied to data from new or published studies. We applied this nomenclature to
a series of published cell type data from the Allen Institute, highlighting its
extensibility to classifications defined using multiple quantifiable
modalities. Finally, we propose conventions for assigning accurate yet flexible
cell types names in the mammalian cortex as a step towards a much larger
community-wide effort to organize multi-source, data-driven information related
to cell types. The convention presented here can be easily applied to cell type
taxonomies from any organ system or organism.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide state-of-the-art performances in a
wide variety of tasks that require memory. These performances can often be
achieved thanks to gated recurrent cells such as gated recurrent units (GRU)
and long short-term memory (LSTM). Standard gated cells share a layer internal
state to store information at the network level, and long term memory is shaped
by network-wide recurrent connection weights. Biological neurons on the other
hand are capable of holding information at the cellular level for an arbitrary
long amount of time through a process called bistability. Through bistability,
cells can stabilize to different stable states depending on their own past
state and inputs, which permits the durable storing of past information in
neuron state. In this work, we take inspiration from biological neuron
bistability to embed RNNs with long-lasting memory at the cellular level. This
leads to the introduction of a new bistable biologically-inspired recurrent
cell that is shown to strongly improves RNN performance on time-series which
require very long memory, despite using only cellular connections (all
recurrent connections are from neurons to themselves, i.e. a neuron state is
not influenced by the state of other neurons). Furthermore, equipping this cell
with recurrent neuromodulation permits to link them to standard GRU cells,
taking a step towards the biological plausibility of GRU.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: What takes the brain so long: Object recognition at the level of minimal images develops for up to seconds of presentation time. (arXiv:2006.05249v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rich empirical evidence has shown that visual object recognition in the brain
is fast and effortless, with relevant brain signals reported to start as early
as 80 ms. Here we study the time trajectory of the recognition process at the
level of minimal recognizable images (termed MIRC). These are images that can
be recognized reliably, but in which a minute change of the image (reduction by
either size or resolution) has a drastic effect on recognition. Subjects were
assigned to one of nine exposure conditions: 200, 500, 1000, 2000 ms with or
without masking, as well as unlimited time. The subjects were not limited in
time to respond after presentation. The results show that in the masked
conditions, recognition rates develop gradually over an extended period, e.g.
average of 18% for 200 ms exposure and 45% for 500 ms, increasing significantly
with longer exposure even above 2 secs. When presented for unlimited time
(until response), MIRC recognition rates were equivalent to the rates of
full-object images presented for 50 ms followed by masking. What takes the
brain so long to recognize such images? We discuss why processes involving
eye-movements, perceptual decision-making and pattern completion are unlikely
explanations. Alternatively, we hypothesize that MIRC recognition requires an
extended top-down process complementing the feed-forward phase.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deformable convolutional networks have demonstrated outstanding performance
in object recognition tasks with an effective feature extraction. Unlike
standard convolution, the deformable convolution decides the receptive field
size using dynamically generated offsets, which leads to an irregular memory
access. Especially, the memory access pattern varies both spatially and
temporally, making static optimization ineffective. Thus, a naive
implementation would lead to an excessive memory footprint. In this paper, we
present a novel approach to accelerate deformable convolution on FPGA. First,
we propose a novel training method to reduce the size of the receptive field in
the deformable convolutional layer without compromising accuracy. By optimizing
the receptive field, we can compress the maximum size of the receptive field by
12.6 times. Second, we propose an efficient systolic architecture to maximize
its efficiency. We then implement our design on FPGA to support the optimized
dataflow. Experimental results show that our accelerator achieves up to 17.25
times speedup over the state-of-the-art accelerator.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mining human-brain networks to discover patterns that can be used to
discriminate between healthy individuals and patients affected by some
neurological disorder, is a fundamental task in neuroscience. Learning simple
and interpretable models is as important as mere classification accuracy. In
this paper we introduce a novel approach for classifying brain networks based
on extracting contrast subgraphs, i.e., a set of vertices whose induced
subgraphs are dense in one class of graphs and sparse in the other. We formally
define the problem and present an algorithmic solution for extracting contrast
subgraphs. We then apply our method to a brain-network dataset consisting of
children affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder and children Typically Developed.
Our analysis confirms the interestingness of the discovered patterns, which
match background knowledge in the neuroscience literature. Further analysis on
other classification tasks confirm the simplicity, soundness, and high
explainability of our proposal, which also exhibits superior classification
accuracy, to more complex state-of-the-art methods.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Urban environments manifest a high level of complexity, and therefore it is
of vital importance for safety systems embedded within autonomous vehicles
(AVs) to be able to accurately predict the short-term future motion of nearby
agents. This problem can be further understood as generating a sequence of
future coordinates for a given agent based on its past motion data e.g.
position, velocity, acceleration etc, and whilst current approaches demonstrate
plausible results they have a propensity to neglect a scene's physical
constrains. In this paper we propose the model based on a combination of the
CNN and LSTM encoder-decoder architecture that learns to extract a relevant
road features from semantic maps as well as general motion of agents and uses
this learned representation to predict their short-term future trajectories. We
train and validate the model on the publicly available dataset that provides
data from urban areas, allowing us to examine it in challenging and uncertain
scenarios. We show that our model is not only capable of anticipating future
motion whilst taking into consideration road boundaries, but can also
effectively and precisely predict trajectories for a longer time horizon than
initially trained for.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitively inspired NLP leverages human-derived data to teach machines about
language processing mechanisms. Recently, neural networks have been augmented
with behavioral data to solve a range of NLP tasks spanning syntax and
semantics. We are the first to exploit neuroscientific data, namely
electroencephalography (EEG), to inform a neural attention model about language
processing of the human brain with direct cognitive measures. Part of the
challenge in working with EEG is that features are exceptionally rich and need
extensive pre-processing to isolate signals specific to text processing. We
devise a method for finding such EEG features to supervise machine attention
through combining theoretically motivated cropping with random forest tree
splits. This method considerably reduces the number of dimensions of the EEG
data. We employ the method on a publicly available EEG corpus and demonstrate
that the pre-processed EEG features are capable of distinguishing two reading
tasks. We apply these features to regularise attention on relation
classification and show that EEG is more informative than strong baselines.
This improvement, however, is dependent on both the cognitive load of the task
and the EEG frequency domain. Hence, informing neural attention models through
EEG signals has benefits but requires further investigation to understand which
dimensions are most useful across NLP tasks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hardware-based spiking neural networks (SNNs) are regarded as promising
candidates for the cognitive computing system due to low power consumption and
highly parallel operation. In this work, we train the SNN in which the firing
time carries information using temporal backpropagation. The temporally encoded
SNN with 512 hidden neurons showed an accuracy of 96.90% for the MNIST test
set. Furthermore, the effect of the device variation on the accuracy in
temporally encoded SNN is investigated and compared with that of the
rate-encoded network. In a hardware configuration of our SNN, NOR-type analog
memory having an asymmetric floating gate is used as a synaptic device. In
addition, we propose a neuron circuit including a refractory period generator
for temporally encoded SNN. The performance of the 2-layer neural network
consisting of synapses and proposed neurons is evaluated through circuit
simulation using SPICE. The network with 128 hidden neurons showed an accuracy
of 94.9%, a 0.1% reduction compared to that of the system simulation of the
MNIST dataset. Finally, the latency and power consumption of each block
constituting the temporal network is analyzed and compared with those of the
rate-encoded network depending on the total time step. Assuming that the total
time step number of the network is 256, the temporal network consumes 15.12
times lower power than the rate-encoded network and can make decisions 5.68
times faster.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04720</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are pairs of artificial neural
networks that are trained one against each other. The outputs from a generator
are mixed with the real-world inputs to the discriminator and both networks are
trained until an equilibrium is reached, where the discriminator cannot
distinguish generated inputs from real ones. Since their introduction, GANs
have allowed for the generation of impressive imitations of real-life films,
images and texts, whose fakeness is barely noticeable to humans. Despite their
impressive performance, training GANs remains to this day more of an art than a
reliable procedure, in a large part due to training process stability.
Generators are susceptible to mode dropping and convergence to random patterns,
which have to be mitigated by computationally expensive multiple restarts.
Curiously, GANs bear an uncanny similarity to a co-evolution of a pathogen and
its host's immune system in biology. In a biological context, the majority of
potential pathogens indeed never make it and are kept at bay by the hots'
immune system. Yet some are efficient enough to present a risk of a serious
condition and recurrent infections. Here, we explore that similarity to propose
a more robust algorithm for GANs training. We empirically show the increased
stability and a better ability to generate high-quality images while using less
computational power.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a diffractive neural network with strong robustness based on
Weight Noise Injection training, which achieves accurate and fast optical-based
classification while diffraction layers have a certain amount of surface shape
error. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that using injection
weight noise during training to reduce the impact of external interference on
deep learning inference results. In the proposed method, the diffractive neural
network learns the mapping between the input image and the label in Weight
Noise Injection mode, making the network's weight insensitive to modest
changes, which improve the network's noise resistance at a lower cost. By
comparing the accuracy of the network under different noise, it is verified
that the proposed network (SRNN) still maintains a higher accuracy under
serious noise.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00853</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A decent number of lower bounds for non-elitist population-based evolutionary
algorithms has been shown by now. Most of them are technically demanding due to
the (hard to avoid) use of negative drift theorems -- general results which
translate an expected progress away from the target into a high hitting time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose a simple negative drift theorem for multiplicative drift scenarios
and show that it can simplify existing analyses. We discuss in more detail
Lehre's (PPSN 2010) \emph{negative drift in populations} method, one of the
most general tools to prove lower bounds on the runtime of non-elitist
mutation-based evolutionary algorithms for discrete search spaces. Together
with other arguments, we obtain an alternative and simpler proof, which also
strengthens and simplifies this method. In particular, now only three of the
five technical conditions of the previous result have to be verified. The lower
bounds we obtain are explicit instead of only asymptotic. This allows to
compute concrete lower bounds for concrete algorithms, but also enables us to
show that super-polynomial runtimes appear already when the reproduction rate
is only a $(1 - \omega(n^{-1/2}))$ factor below the threshold. As one
particular result, we apply this method and a novel domination argument to show
an exponential lower bound for the runtime of the mutation-only simple GA on
\onemax for arbitrary population size.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a novel black box optimization algorithm called Hessian Estimation
Evolution Strategy. The algorithm updates the covariance matrix of its sampling
distribution by directly estimating the curvature of the objective function.
This algorithm design is targeted at twice continuously differentiable
problems. For this, we extend the cumulative step-size adaptation algorithm of
the CMA-ES to mirrored sampling. We demonstrate that our approach to covariance
matrix adaptation is efficient by evaluation it on the BBOB/COCO testbed. We
also show that the algorithm is surprisingly robust when its core assumption of
a twice continuously differentiable objective function is violated. The
approach yields a new evolution strategy with competitive performance, and at
the same time it also offers an interesting alternative to the usual covariance
matrix update mechanism.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a solution to the weight transport problem, which questions the
biological plausibility of the backpropagation algorithm. We derive our method
based upon a theoretical analysis of the (approximate) dynamics of leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons. We show that the use of spike timing alone
outcompetes existing biologically plausible methods for synaptic weight
inference in spiking neural network models. Furthermore, our proposed method is
more flexible, being applicable to any spiking neuron model, is conservative in
how many parameters are required for implementation and can be deployed in an
online-fashion with minimal computational overhead. These features, together
with its biological plausibility, make it an attractive mechanism underlying
weight inference at single synapses.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In reinforcement learning, agents that consider the context, or current
state, when selecting source policies for transfer have been shown to
outperform context-free approaches. However, none of the existing approaches
transfer knowledge contextually from model-based learners to a model-free
learner. This could be useful, for instance, when source policies are
intentionally learned on diverse simulations with plentiful data but
transferred to a real-world setting with limited data. In this paper, we assume
knowledge of estimated source task dynamics and policies, and common sub-goals
but different dynamics. We introduce a novel deep mixture-of-experts
formulation for learning state-dependent beliefs over source task dynamics that
match the target dynamics using state trajectories collected from the target
task. The mixture model is easy to interpret, demonstrates robustness to
estimation errors in dynamics, and is compatible with most learning algorithms.
We then show how this model can be incorporated into standard policy reuse
frameworks, and demonstrate its effectiveness on benchmarks from OpenAI-Gym.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a class of deep models that operate on data
with arbitrary topology represented as graphs. We introduce an efficient memory
layer for GNNs that can jointly learn node representations and coarsen the
graph. We also introduce two new networks based on this layer: memory-based GNN
(MemGNN) and graph memory network (GMN) that can learn hierarchical graph
representations. The experimental results shows that the proposed models
achieve state-of-the-art results in eight out of nine graph classification and
regression benchmarks. We also show that the learned representations could
correspond to chemical features in the molecule data. Code and reference
implementations are released at: https://github.com/amirkhas/GraphMemoryNet

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We study the learning of an external signal by a neural network and the time
to forget it when this network is submitted to noise. The presentation of an
external stimulus to the recurrent network of binary neurons may change the
state of the synapses. Multiple presentations of a unique signal leads to its
learning. Then, during the forgetting time, the presentation of other signals
(noise) may also modify the synaptic weights. We construct an estimator of the
initial signal thanks to the synaptic currents and define by this way a
probability of error. In our model, these synaptic currents evolve as Markov
chains. We study the dynamics of these Markov chains and obtain a lower bound
on the number of external stimuli that the network can receive before the
initial signal is considered as forgotten (probability of error above a given
threshold). Our results hold for finite size networks as well as in the large
size asymptotic. Our results are based on a finite time analysis rather than
large time asymptotic. We finally present numerical illustrations of our
results.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electrical stimulation of neural systems is a key tool for understanding
neural dynamics and ultimately for developing clinical treatments. Many
applications of electrical stimulation affect large populations of neurons.
However, computational models of large networks of spiking neurons are
inherently hard to simulate and analyze. We evaluate a reduced mean-field model
of excitatory and inhibitory adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx)
neurons which can be used to efficiently study the effects of electrical
stimulation on large neural populations. The rich dynamical properties of this
basic cortical model are described in detail and validated using large network
simulations. Bifurcation diagrams reflecting the network's state reveal
asynchronous up- and down-states, bistable regimes, and oscillatory regions
corresponding to fast excitation-inhibition and slow excitation-adaptation
feedback loops. The biophysical parameters of the AdEx neuron can be coupled to
an electric field with realistic field strengths which then can be propagated
up to the population description.We show how on the edge of bifurcation, direct
electrical inputs cause network state transitions, such as turning on and off
oscillations of the population rate. Oscillatory input can frequency-entrain
and phase-lock endogenous oscillations. Relatively weak electric field
strengths on the order of 1 V/m are able to produce these effects, indicating
that field effects are strongly amplified in the network. The effects of
time-varying external stimulation are well-predicted by the mean-field model,
further underpinning the utility of low-dimensional neural mass models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A deep neural network is a parametrization of a multilayer mapping of signals
in terms of many alternatively arranged linear and nonlinear transformations.
The linear transformations, which are generally used in the fully connected as
well as convolutional layers, contain most of the variational parameters that
are trained and stored. Compressing a deep neural network to reduce its number
of variational parameters but not its prediction power is an important but
challenging problem toward the establishment of an optimized scheme in training
efficiently these parameters and in lowering the risk of overfitting. Here we
show that this problem can be effectively solved by representing linear
transformations with matrix product operators (MPOs), which is a tensor network
originally proposed in physics to characterize the short-range entanglement in
one-dimensional quantum states. We have tested this approach in five typical
neural networks, including FC2, LeNet-5, VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet on two
widely used data sets, namely, MNIST and CIFAR-10, and found that this MPO
representation indeed sets up a faithful and efficient mapping between input
and output signals, which can keep or even improve the prediction accuracy with
a dramatically reduced number of parameters. Our method greatly simplifies the
representations in deep learning, and opens a possible route toward
establishing a framework of modern neural networks which might be simpler and
cheaper, but more efficient.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a preference neural network (PNN) to address the problem
of indifference preferences orders with new activation function. PNN also
solves the Multi-label ranking problem, where labels may have indifference
preference orders or subgroups are equally ranked. PNN follows a multi-layer
feedforward architecture with fully connected neurons. Each neuron contains a
novel smooth stairstep activation function based on the number of preference
orders. PNN inputs represent data features and output neurons represent label
indexes. The proposed PNN is evaluated using new preference mining dataset that
contains repeated label values which have not experimented before. PNN
outperforms five previously proposed methods for strict label ranking in terms
of accurate results with high computational efficiency.

Two sites of Rad51 are responsible for DNA binding, but the function of these sites has proven elusive. Here, the authors employ real-time assays to reveal catalytic roles for the two DNA binding sites of Rad51.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/pkQl1DZxmHY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Neurofilament-Light Chain as Biomarker of Neurodegenerative and Rare Diseases With High Translational Value</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00579</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurofilament-light chain (NF-L) is a well-known clinical biomarker of many neurodegenerative diseases. By analyzing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or plasma, progression of NF-L levels can forecast conversion from the presymptomatic to symptomatic stage and time of survival. The use of plasma for NF-L measurement makes this biomarker exceptionally valuable for clinical studies since sample collection can be performed repeatedly without causing much harm. Detailed analyses of NF-L expression in neurodegenerative disease patient’s samples were already performed, while NF-L levels of preclinical models of ALS, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease as well as lysosomal storage diseases are still widely unknown. We therefore evaluated NF-L levels in the plasma of the ALS models SOD1-G93A low expressor and TAR6/6 mice, the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model 5xFAD, the Parkinson’s disease model Line 61 and the Gaucher disease (GD) model 4L/PS-NA and the CSF of selected models. Our results show that NF-L levels are highly increased in the plasma of ALS, Alzheimer’s and GD models, while in the analyzed Parkinson’s disease model NF-L plasma levels barely changed. Most analyzed models show a progressive increase of NF-L levels. NF-L measurements in the plasma of the neurodegenerative disease mouse models of ALS and AD are thus a good tool to evaluate disease progression. Compared to analyses in human tissues, our results suggest a high translation value of murine NF-L levels and their progression. Furthermore, our data indicate that NF-L might also be a good biomarker for disorders with a neuronal component like some lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: HspB5 Activates a Neuroprotective Glial Cell Response in Experimental Tauopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00574</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Progressive neuronal death during tauopathies is associated with aggregation of modified, truncated or mutant forms of tau protein. Such aggregates are neurotoxic, promote spreading of tau aggregation, and trigger release of pro-inflammatory factors by glial cells. Counteracting such pathogenic effects of tau by simultaneously inhibiting protein aggregation as well as pro-inflammatory glial cell responses would be of significant therapeutic interest. Here, we examined the use of the small heat-shock protein HspB5 for this purpose. As a molecular chaperone, HspB5 counteracts aggregation of a wide range of abnormal proteins. As a TLR2 agonist, it selectively activates protective responses by CD14-expressing myeloid cells including microglia. We show that intracerebral infusion of HspB5 in transgenic mice with selective neuronal expression of mutant human P301S tau has significant neuroprotective effects in the superficial, frontal cortical layers. Underlying these effects at least in part, HspB5 induces several potent neuroprotective mediators in both astrocytes and microglia including neurotrophic factors and increased potential for removal of glutamate. Together, these findings highlight the potentially broad therapeutic potential of HspB5 in neurodegenerative proteinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: TDP-43 Is Efficiently Transferred Between Neuron-Like Cells in a Manner Enhanced by Preservation of Its N-Terminus but Independent of Extracellular Vesicles</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The misfolding of transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of TDP-43 proteinopathies, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions, but also plays a role in other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease. It is thought that different truncations at the N- and C-termini of TDP-43 contribute to its misfolding and aggregation in the brain, and that these aberrant TDP-43 fragments contribute to disease. Despite this, little is known about whether different truncation events influence the protein’s transmissibility between cells and how this cell-to-cell transfer occurs. In this study, we use a well-established cellular model to study the efficiency by which full-length and truncated TDP-43 fragments are transferred between neuron-like cells. We demonstrate that preservation of the N-terminus of TDP-43 enhances its transmissibility between cells and that this protein transmission occurs in a manner exclusive of extracellular vesicles, instead requiring cellular proximity for efficient propagation. These data indicate that the N-terminus of TDP-43 might be a useful target in the generation of therapeutics to limit the spread of TDP-43 pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: The Profiles of Non-stationarity and Non-linearity in the Time Series of Resting-State Brain Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The linearity and stationarity of fMRI time series need to be understood due to their important roles in the choice of approach for brain network analysis. In this paper, we investigated the stationarity and linearity of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) time-series data from the Midnight Scan Club datasets. The degree of stationarity (DS) and the degree of non-linearity (DN) were, respectively, estimated for the time series of all gray matter voxels. The similarity and difference between the DS and DN were assessed in terms of voxels and intrinsic brain networks, including the visual network, somatomotor network, dorsal attention network, ventral attention network, limbic network, frontoparietal network, and default-mode network. The test-retest scans were utilized to quantify the reliability of DS and DN. We found that DS and DN maps had overlapping spatial distribution. Meanwhile, the probability density estimate function of DS had a long tail, and that of DN had a more normal distribution. Specifically, stronger DS was present in the somatomotor, limbic, and ventral attention networks compared to other networks, and stronger DN was found in the somatomotor, visual, limbic, ventral attention, and default-mode networks. The percentage of overlapping voxels between DS and DN in different networks demonstrated a decreasing trend in the order default mode, ventral attention, somatomotor, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, visual, and limbic. Furthermore, the ICC values of DS were higher than those of DN. Our results suggest that different functional networks have distinct properties of non-stationarity and non-linearity owing to the complexity of rs-fMRI time series. Thus, caution should be taken when analyzing fMRI data (both resting-state and task-activation) using simplified models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: A Machine Learning Approach for the Differential Diagnosis of Alzheimer and Vascular Dementia Fed by MRI Selected Features</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Among dementia-like diseases, Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD) are two of the most frequent. AD and VD may share multiple neurological symptoms that may lead to controversial diagnoses when using conventional clinical and MRI criteria. Therefore, other approaches are needed to overcome this issue. Machine learning (ML) combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to improve the diagnostic accuracy of several neurodegenerative diseases, including dementia. To this end, in this study, we investigated, first, whether different kinds of ML algorithms, combined with advanced MRI features, could be supportive in classifying VD from AD and, second, whether the developed approach might help in predicting the prevalent disease in subjects with an unclear profile of AD or VD. Three ML categories of algorithms were tested: artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Multiple regional metrics from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 60 subjects (33 AD, 27 VD) were used as input features to train the algorithms and find the best feature pattern to classify VD from AD. We then used the identified VD–AD discriminant feature pattern as input for the most performant ML algorithm to predict the disease prevalence in 15 dementia patients with a “mixed VD–AD dementia” (MXD) clinical profile using their baseline MRI data. ML predictions were compared with the diagnosis evidence from a 3-year clinical follow-up. ANFIS emerged as the most efficient algorithm in discriminating AD from VD, reaching a classification accuracy greater than 84% using a small feature pattern. Moreover, ANFIS showed improved classification accuracy when trained with a multimodal input feature data set (e.g., DTI + rs-fMRI metrics) rather than a unimodal feature data set. When applying the best discriminant pattern to the MXD group, ANFIS achieved a correct prediction rate of 77.33%. Overall, results showed that our approach has a high discriminant power to classify AD and VD profiles. Moreover, the same approach also showed potential in predicting earlier the prevalent underlying disease in dementia patients whose clinical profile is uncertain between AD and VD, therefore suggesting its usefulness in supporting physicians' diagnostic evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: mPFC spindle cycles organize sparse thalamic activation and recently active CA1 cells during non-REM sleep</title>

	<description>Sleep oscillations in the neocortex and hippocampus are critical for the integration of new memories into stable generalized representations in neocortex. However, the role of the thalamus in this process is poorly understood. To determine the thalamic contribution to non-REM oscillations (sharp-wave ripples, SWRs; slow/delta; spindles), we recorded units and local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously in the limbic thalamus, mPFC, and CA1 in rats. We report that the cycles of neocortical spindles provide a key temporal window that coordinates CA1 SWRs with sparse but consistent activation of thalamic units. Thalamic units were phase-locked to delta and spindles in mPFC, and fired at consistent lags with other thalamic units within spindles, while CA1 units that were active during spatial exploration were engaged in SWR-coupled spindles after behavior. The sparse thalamic firing could promote an incremental integration of recently acquired memory traces into neocortical schemas through the interleaved activation of thalamocortical cells.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Comparison of manual and automated ventricle segmentation in the maternal immune stimulation rat model of schizophrenia</title>

	<description>Maternal immune stimulation (MIS) is strongly implicated in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies provide evidence for brain structural abnormalities in rodents following prenatal exposure to MIS. Reported volumetric changes in adult MIS offspring comprise among others larger ventricular volumes, consistent with alterations found in patients with schizophrenia. Linking rodent models of MIS with non-invasive small animal neuroimaging modalities thus represents a powerful tool for the investigation of structural endophenotypes. Traditionally manual segmentation of regions-of-interest, which is laborious and prone to low intra- and inter-rater reliability, was employed for data analysis. Recently automated analysis platforms in rodent disease models are emerging. However, none of these has been found to reliably detect ventricular volume changes in MIS nor directly compared manual and automated data analysis strategies. The present study was thus conducted to establish an automated, structural analysis method focused on lateral ventricle segmentation. It was applied to ex-vivo rat brain MRI scans. Performance was validated for phenotype induction following MIS and preventive treatment data and compared to manual segmentation. In conclusion, we present an automated analysis platform to investigate ventricular volume alterations in rodent models thereby encouraging their preclinical use in the search for new urgently needed treatments.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Entraining corticocortical plasticity changes oscillatory activity in action control and inhibition</title>

	<description>Oscillatory activity may reflect interactions between brain areas[1]. Here we tested whether inducing corticocortical plasticity in a specific set of connections changes oscillatory activity and cortico-cortical interactions and, if this is the case, whether the changes manifest in a manner that is behaviour state-dependent. We either increased or decreased the influence of activity in human ventral premotor cortex (PMv) over activity in primary motor cortex (M1) using cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS)[2, 3]. Before and after stimulation participants performed a Go/No-Go task. While M1 TMS pulses revealed the excitatory state of the motor system at specific time points, the electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed the evolution of oscillatory activity dynamics in the motor system over several hundreds of milliseconds before, during, and after each movement. Augmenting cortical connectivity between PMv and M1, by evoking synchronous pre- and postsynaptic activity in the PMv-M1 pathways, led to a state-dependent modulation of the causal influence of PMv over M1, and at the same time, enhanced oscillatory beta and theta rhythms in Go and No-Go trials, respectively. No changes were observed in the alpha rhythm. The plasticity induction effect was dependent on PMv-M1 stimulation order; the opposite patterns of results were observed after an equal amount of stimulation of PMv and M1 but applied in a temporal pattern that did not augment the influence of PMv over M1. These results are consistent with Hebbian principles of synaptic plasticity[4] and show that artificial manipulation of cortico-cortical connectivity produces state-dependent functional changes in the spectral fingerprints of the motor circuit.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Functional Analysis of Distinct Populations of Subthalamic Nucleus Neurons on Parkinson Disease and OCD-like Behaviors in Mice</title>

	<description>The Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) is a component of the basal ganglia and plays a key role to control movement and limbic-associative functions. STN modulation with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) improves the symptoms of Parkinson Disease (PD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) patients. However, DBS does not allow for cell-type specific modulation of the STN. While extensive work has focused on understanding STN functionality, the understanding of its cellular components is limited. Here, we first performed an anatomical characterization of molecular markers for specific STN neurons. These studies revealed that most STN neurons express Pitx2, and that different overlapping subsets express Gabrr3, Ndnf or Nos1. Next, we used neuronal modulatory tools to demonstrate their roles in regulating locomotor and limbic functions in mice. Specifically, we showed that optogenetic photoactivation of STN neurons in Pitx2-Cre mice or of the Gabrr3- expressing subpopulation induces locomotor changes, and improves locomotion in a PD mouse model. Additionally, photoactivation of Pitx2 and Gabrr3 cells induced repetitive grooming, a phenotype associated with OCD. Repeated stimulation prompted a persistent increase in grooming that could be reversed by fluoxetine treatment, a first-line drug therapy for OCD. Conversely, repeated inhibition of STNGabrr3 neurons suppressed grooming in Sapap3-KO mice, a model for OCD. Finally, circuit and functional mapping of STNGabrr3 neurons showed that these effects are mediated via projections to the globus pallidus/entopeduncular nucleus and substantia nigra reticulata. Altogether, these data identify Gabrr3 neurons as a key population in mediating the beneficial effects of STN modulation thus providing a new molecular handle for PD and OCD drug discovery.</description>

	<description>The maternal brain undergoes structural and functional plasticity during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Little is known about functional plasticity outside caregiving-specific contexts, and whether changes persist across the lifespan. Structural neuroimaging studies suggest that parenthood may confer a protective effect against the ageing process, however it is unknown whether parenthood is associated with functional brain differences in late-life. We examined the relationship between resting state functional connectivity and number of children parented in 220 healthy older females (73.82+/-3.53years) and 252 healthy older males (73.95+/-3.50years). We compared patterns of resting state functional connectivity with three different models of age-related functional change to assess whether these effects may be functionally neuroprotective for the ageing human parental brain. No relationship between functional connectivity and number of children was obtained for males. For females, we found widespread decreasing functional connectivity with increasing number of children parented, with increased segregation between networks, decreased connectivity between hemispheres, and decreased connectivity between anterior and posterior regions. The patterns of functional connectivity related to the number of children an older woman has parented were in the opposite direction to those usually associated with age-related cognitive decline, suggesting that motherhood may be beneficial for brain function in late-life.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Speech-in-noise intelligibility difficulties with age: the role of cochlear synaptopathy</title>

	<description>Damage to auditory-nerve-fiber synapses (i.e. cochlear synaptopathy) degrades the neural coding of sound and is predicted to impair sound perception in noisy listening environments. However, establishing a causal relationship between synaptopathy and speech intelligibility is difficult because we have no direct access to synapse counts in humans. Hence, we rely on the quality of noninvasive auditory-evoked potential (AEP) markers developed in rodent studies of histologically-verified synaptopathy. However, there are a number of reasons which render the interpretation of these markers in humans difficult. To bridge this translational gap, we apply a multi-method approach to enable a meaningful interpretation of the relationship between the histopathology of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and speech perception. We first selected a synaptopathy-sensitive AEP marker and verified its sensitivity (i) in an animal model using a Kainic-acid induced synaptopathy, and (ii), via auditory model simulations which connect the histopathology of SNHL to the source generators of AEPs. Secondly, we restricted the frequency content of the speech-material to ensure that both AEP and speech metrics targeted similar cochlear frequency regions and associated auditory coding mechanisms. Following this approach, we studied the relative contribution of AEP markers of synaptopathy and hearing sensitivity to speech recognition thresholds in 44 listeners (24 women) of different ages and SNHL profiles. Our analysis shows that synaptopathy plays an important role for speech intelligibility in noise, but that outer-hair-cell integrity predicts performance in the absence of noise. Our results corroborate conclusions from animal studies regarding the prevalence of age-related synaptopathy, and its occurrence before outer-hair-cell loss damage.</description>

	<description>NMDA receptors (NMDAR) are glutamate-gated ion channels that mediate the majority of fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the nervous system. A central feature of NMDAR physiology is the opening of the ion channel driven by presynaptically-released glutamate. Using glutamate applications to outside-out patches containing a single NMDAR in the continuous presence of the co-agonist glycine, we find that agonist-bound receptors transition to the open state via two conformations, an &quot;unconstrained pre-active&quot; state that can rapidly transition to the open state and contributes to synaptic events, and a &quot;constrained pre-active&quot; state that requires more energy and hence time to open and does not contribute to fast signaling. To define how agonist binding might drive these conformations, we decoupled the ligand-binding domains from specific transmembrane segments for the GluN1 and GluN2A subunits. Displacements of the central pore-forming M3 segments define the energy of fast channel opening. However, to enter the unconstrained conformation and contribute to fast signaling, a peripheral helix, the GluN2 pre-M1, must be displaced before the M3 segments move. This pre-M1 displacement is facilitated by the flexibility of another nearby peripheral element, the GluN1 and GluN2A S2-M4. We conclude that peripheral structural elements, pre-M1 and S2-M4, work in concert to remove constraints and prime the channel for rapid opening, thus facilitating fast synaptic transmission.</description>

	<description>Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) has the potential to add a layer of understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying brain diseases, disease progression, and treatment efficacy. Limitations related to metabolite fitting of low SNR data, signal variations due to partial volume effects, acquisition and extra-cranial lipid artefacts, along with clinically relevant aspects such as scan-time constraints, are among the factors that hinder the widespread implementation of in vivo MRSI. The aim of this work was to address these factors and to develop an acquisition, reconstruction and post-processing pipeline to derive lipid suppressed metabolite values based on Free Induction Decay (FID-MRSI) measurements made using a 7 tesla MR scanner. Anatomical images were used to perform high-resolution (1mm3) partial-volume correction to account for grey matter, white matter and cerebral-spinal fluid signal contributions. Implementation of automatic quality control thresholds and normalization of metabolic maps from 23 subjects to the MNI standard atlas facilitated the creation of high-resolution average metabolite maps of several clinically relevant metabolites in central brain regions, while accounting for macromolecular distributions. Reported metabolite values include glutamate, choline, (phospo)creatine, myo-inositol, glutathione, N-acetyl aspartyl glutamate(and glutamine) and N-acetyl aspartate. MNI-registered average metabolite maps facilitate group-based analysis; thus offering the possibility to mitigate uncertainty in variable MRSI.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Directed information exchange between cortical layers in macaque V1 and V4 and its modulation by selective attention</title>

	<description>Achieving behavioral goals requires integration of sensory and cognitive information, across cortical laminae and cortical regions. How this computation is performed remains unknown. Using local field potential recordings and spectrally resolved conditional Granger causality (cGC) analysis, we mapped visual information flow, and its attentional modulation, between cortical layers within and between macaque areas V1 and V4. Stimulus induced inter-laminar information flow within V1 dominated upwardly, channeling information towards supragranular cortico-cortical output layers. Within V4, information flow dominated from granular to supragranular layers, but interactions between supragranular and infragranular layers dominated downwardly. Low-frequency across-area communication was stronger from V4 to V1, with little layer specificity. Gamma-band communication was stronger in the feedforward V1 to V4 direction. Attention to the receptive field of V1 decreased communication between all V1 layers, except for granular to supragranular layers interactions. Communication within V4, and from V1 to V4, increased with attention across all frequencies. While communication from V4 to V1 was stronger in lower frequency bands (4-25 Hz), attention modulated cGCs from V4 to V1 across all investigated frequencies. Our data show that top down cognitive processes result in reduced communication within cortical areas, increased feedforward communication across all frequency bands and increased gamma band feedback communication.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Modeling the variability of the electromotor commandsystem of pulse mormyrids</title>

	<description>The electromotor neural system in weakly electric fish is a network responsible for active electroreception and electrolocation. This system controls the timing of pulse generation in the electrical signals used by these fish for extracting information from the environment and communicating with other specimens. Ethological studies related to fish mating, exploratory, submissive or aggressive behaviors have described distinct sequences of pulse intervals (SPIs). Accelerations, scallops, rasps, and cessations are four patterns of SPIs reported in pulse mormyrids, each showing characteristic temporal structures and large variability both in timing and duration. This paper presents a biologically plausible computational model of the electromotor command circuit that reproduces these four SPI patterns as a function of the input to the model while keeping the same internal parameter configuration. The topology of the model is based on a simplified representation of the network as described by morphological and electrophysiological studies. An initial ad hoc tuned configuration (S-T) was build to reproduce all four SPI patterns. Then, starting from S-T, a genetic algorithm (GA) was developed to automatically find the parameters of the model connectivity. Two different configurations obtained from the GA are presented here: one optimized to a set of synthetic examples of SPI patterns based on experimental observations in mormyrids (S-GA), and another configuration adjusted to patterns recorded from freely-behaving Gnathonemus Petersii specimens (R-GA). A robustness analysis to input variability of these model configurations was performed to discard overfitting and assess validity. Results showed that the four SPI patterns are consistently reproduced, both with synthetic (S-GA) data and with signals recorded from behaving animals (R-GA). This new model can be used as a tool to analyze the electromotor command chain during electrogeneration and assess the role of temporal structure in electroreception.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Cytoplasmic accumulation of FUS triggers early behavioral alterations linked to cortical neuronal hyperactivity and defects in inhibitory synapses</title>

	<description>Gene mutations causing cytoplasmic mislocalization of the RNA-binding protein FUS, lead to severe forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Cytoplasmic accumulation of FUS is also observed in other diseases, with unknown consequences. Here, we show that cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS drives behavioral abnormalities in knock-in mice, including locomotor hyperactivity and alterations in social interactions, in the absence of widespread neuronal loss. Mechanistically, we identified a profound increase in neuronal activity in the frontal cortex of Fus knock-in mice in vivo. Importantly, RNAseq analysis suggested involvement of defects in inhibitory neurons, that was confirmed by ultrastructural and morphological defects of inhibitory synapses and increased synaptosomal levels of mRNAs involved in inhibitory neurotransmission. Thus, cytoplasmic FUS triggers inhibitory synaptic deficits, leading to increased neuronal activity and behavioral phenotypes. FUS mislocalization may trigger deleterious phenotypes beyond motor neuron impairment in ALS, but also in other neurodegenerative diseases with FUS mislocalization.</description>

Understanding cellular remodeling in response to mechanical stimuli is a critical step in elucidating mechanical activation of biochemical signaling pathways. Experimental evidence indicates that external stress-induced subcellular adaptation is accomplished through dynamic cytoskeletal reorganization. To study the interactions between subcellular structures involved in transducing mechanical signals, we combined experimental and computational simulations to evaluate real-time mechanical adaptation of the actin cytoskeletal network. Actin cytoskeleton was imaged at the same time as an external tensile force was applied to live vascular smooth muscle cells using a fibronectin-functionalized atomic force microscope probe. Moreover, we performed computational simulations of active cytoskeletal networks under an external tensile force. The experimental data and simulation results suggest that mechanical structural adaptation occurs before chemical adaptation during filament bundle formation: actin filaments first align in the direction of the external force by initializing anisotropic filament orientations, then the chemical evolution of the network follows the anisotropic structures to further develop the bundle-like geometry. Our findings present an alternative two-step explanation for the formation of actin bundles due to mechanical stimulation and provide new insights into the mechanism of mechanotransduction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JNg99gy_cCc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Mitochondrial metabolic remodeling is a hallmark of the &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/i&gt; digenetic life cycle because the insect stage utilizes a cost-effective oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) to generate ATP, while bloodstream cells switch to aerobic glycolysis. Due to difficulties in acquiring enough parasites from the tsetse fly vector, the dynamics of the parasite’s metabolic rewiring in the vector have remained obscure. Here, we took advantage of in vitro–induced differentiation to follow changes at the RNA, protein, and metabolite levels. This multi-omics and cell-based profiling showed an immediate redirection of electron flow from the cytochrome-mediated pathway to an alternative oxidase (AOX), an increase in proline consumption, elevated activity of complex II, and certain tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, which led to mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Interestingly, these ROS molecules appear to act as signaling molecules driving developmental progression because ectopic expression of catalase, a ROS scavenger, halted the in vitro–induced differentiation. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of the parasite’s mitochondrial rewiring and reinforce the emerging concept that mitochondria act as signaling organelles through release of ROS to drive cellular differentiation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/1GfoirEEJbI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: IRE1α regulates macrophage polarization, PD-L1 expression, and tumor survival</title>

In the tumor microenvironment, local immune dysregulation is driven in part by macrophages and dendritic cells that are polarized to a mixed proinflammatory/immune-suppressive phenotype. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is emerging as the possible origin of these events. Here we report that the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1α) branch of the UPR is directly involved in the polarization of macrophages in vitro and in vivo, including the up-regulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-23, Arginase1, as well as surface expression of CD86 and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Macrophages in which the IRE1α/X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1) axis is blocked pharmacologically or deleted genetically have significantly reduced polarization and CD86 and PD-L1 expression, which was induced independent of IFNγ signaling, suggesting a novel mechanism in PD-L1 regulation in macrophages. Mice with IRE1α- but not Xbp1-deficient macrophages showed greater survival than controls when implanted with B16.F10 melanoma cells. Remarkably, we found a significant association between the IRE1α gene signature and &lt;i&gt;CD274&lt;/i&gt; gene expression in tumor-infiltrating macrophages in humans. RNA sequencing (RNASeq) analysis showed that bone marrow–derived macrophages with IRE1α deletion lose the integrity of the gene connectivity characteristic of regulated IRE1α-dependent decay (RIDD) and the ability to activate &lt;i&gt;CD274&lt;/i&gt; gene expression. Thus, the IRE1α/Xbp1 axis drives the polarization of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment initiating a complex immune dysregulation leading to failure of local immune surveillance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/BN5X2l_bEwY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Clinico‐Genetic, Imaging and Molecular Delineation of COQ8A‐Ataxia: A Multicenter Study of 59 Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25751?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;Objective: &lt;/b&gt; To foster trial‐readiness of coenzyme Q8A (COQ8A)‐ataxia, we map the clinicogenetic, molecular, and neuroimaging spectrum of COQ8A‐ataxia in a large worldwide cohort, and provide first progression data, including treatment response to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10).&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;Methods: &lt;/b&gt; Cross‐modal analysis of a multicenter cohort of 59 COQ8A patients, including genotype–phenotype correlations, 3D‐protein modeling, in vitro mutation analyses, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers, disease progression, and CoQ10 response data.&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;Results: &lt;/b&gt; Fifty‐nine patients (39 novel) with 44 pathogenic &lt;i&gt;COQ8A &lt;/i&gt; variants (18 novel) were identified. Missense variants demonstrated a pleiotropic range of detrimental effects upon protein modeling and in vitro analysis of purified variants. COQ8A‐ataxia presented as variable multisystemic, early‐onset cerebellar ataxia, with complicating features ranging from epilepsy (32%) and cognitive impairment (49%) to exercise intolerance (25%) and hyperkinetic movement disorders (41%), including dystonia and myoclonus as presenting symptoms. Multisystemic involvement was more prevalent in missense than biallelic loss‐of‐function variants (82–93% vs 53%; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.029). Cerebellar atrophy was universal on MRI (100%), with cerebral atrophy or dentate and pontine T2 hyperintensities observed in 28%. Cross‐sectional (n = 34) and longitudinal (n = 7) assessments consistently indicated mild‐to‐moderate progression of ataxia (SARA: 0.45/year). CoQ10 treatment led to improvement by clinical report in 14 of 30 patients, and by quantitative longitudinal assessments in 8 of 11 patients (SARA: −0.81/year). Explorative sample size calculations indicate that ≥48 patients per arm may suffice to demonstrate efficacy for interventions that reduce progression by 50%.&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;Interpretation: &lt;/b&gt; This study provides a deeper understanding of the disease, and paves the way toward large‐scale natural history studies and treatment trials in COQ8A‐ataxia.&lt;/h2&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Data‐driven integration of hippocampal CA1 synaptic physiology in silico</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anatomy and physiology of monosynaptic connections in rodent hippocampal CA1 have been extensively studied in recent decades. Yet, the resulting knowledge remains disparate and difficult to reconcile. Here, we present a data‐driven approach to integrate the current state‐of‐the‐art knowledge on the synaptic anatomy and physiology of rodent hippocampal CA1, including axo‐dendritic innervation patterns, number of synapses per connection, quantal conductances, neurotransmitter release probability, and short‐term plasticity into a single coherent resource. First, we undertook an extensive literature review of paired recordings of hippocampal neurons and compiled experimental data on their synaptic anatomy and physiology. The data collected in this manner is sparse and inhomogeneous due to the diversity of experimental techniques used by different groups, which necessitates the need for an integrative framework to unify these data. To this end, we extended a previously developed workflow for the neocortex to constrain a unifying in silico reconstruction of the synaptic physiology of CA1 connections. Our work identifies gaps in the existing knowledge and provides a complementary resource toward a more complete quantification of synaptic anatomy and physiology in the rodent hippocampal CA1 region.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Shaping the Cortical Landscape: Functions and Mechanisms of Top-Down Cortical Feedback Pathways</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00033</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00033</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical feedback pathways are proposed to guide cognition and behavior according to context and goal-direction. At the cellular level, cortical feedback pathways target multiple excitatory and inhibitory populations. However, we currently lack frameworks that link how the cellular mechanisms of cortical feedback pathways underlie their cognitive/behavioral functions. To establish this link, we expand on the framework of signal routing, the ability of cortical feedback pathways to proactively modulate how feedforward signals are propagated throughout the cortex. We propose that cortical feedback modulates routing through multiple mechanisms: preparing intended motor representations, setting the trigger conditions for evoking cortical outputs, altering coupling strengths between cortical regions, and suppressing expected sensory representations. In developing this framework, we first define the anatomy of cortical feedback pathways and identify recent advances in studying their functions at high specificity and resolution. Second, we review the diverse functions of cortical feedback pathways throughout the cortical hierarchy and evaluate these functions from the framework of signal routing. Third, we review the conserved cellular targets and circuit impacts of cortical feedback. Fourth, we introduce the concept of the “cortical landscape,” a graphical depiction of the routes through cortex that are favored at a specific moment in time. We propose that the cortical landscape, analogous to energy landscapes in physics and chemistry, can capture important features of signal routing including coupling strength, trigger conditions, and preparatory states. By resolving the cortical landscape, we may be able to quantify how the cellular processes of cortical feedback ultimately shape cognition and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Retinal and Optic Nerve Integrity Following Monocular Inactivation for the Treatment of Amblyopia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00032</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In animal models, monocular deprivation (MD) by lid closure mimics the effects of unilateral amblyopia in humans. Temporary inactivation of one or both eyes with intraocular administration of tetrodotoxin (TTX) has recently been shown to promote recovery from the anatomical effects of MD at post-critical period ages when standard recovery strategies fail. In the current study, the retinae and optic nerves of animals subjected to 10 days of monocular retinal inactivation were assessed for pathological changes as a means of assessing the viability of this potential new amblyopia therapy. Retinal sections from both eyes were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining and were then examined for cell density and soma size in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). Sections of the optic nerve from each eye were examined for neurofilament protein, myelin, glial cell density, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Our study revealed no evidence of gross histopathological abnormalities following inactivation for 10 days, nor was there evidence of degeneration of axons or loss of myelin in the optic nerve serving inactivated eyes. On all measurements, the inactivated eye was indistinguishable from the fellow eye, and both were comparable to normal controls. We confirmed that our inactivation protocol obliterated visually-evoked potentials for 10 consecutive days, but visual responses were restored to normal after the effects of inactivation wore off. Notwithstanding the critical need for further assessment of ocular and retinal health following inactivation, these results provide evidence that retinal inactivation as a treatment for amblyopia does not produce significant retinal damage or degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Arhgef5 Binds α-Dystrobrevin 1 and Regulates Neuromuscular Junction Integrity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) connect muscle fibers with motor neurons and enable the coordinated contraction of skeletal muscles. The dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DGC) is an essential component of the postsynaptic machinery of the NMJ and is important for the maintenance of NMJ structural integrity. To identify novel proteins that are important for NMJ organization, we performed a mass spectrometry-based screen for interactors of α-dystrobrevin 1 (aDB1), one of the components of the DGC. The guanidine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Arhgef5 was found to be one of the aDB1 binding partners that is recruited to Tyr-713 in a phospho-dependent manner. We show here that Arhgef5 localizes to the NMJ and that its genetic depletion in the muscle causes the fragmentation of the synapses in conditional knockout mice. Arhgef5 loss in vivo is associated with a reduction in the levels of active GTP-bound RhoA and Cdc42 GTPases, highlighting the importance of actin dynamics regulation for the maintenance of NMJ integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: The Effects of an Ocular Direct Electrical Stimulation on Pattern-Reversal Electroretinogram</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00588</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00588</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Studies on transcranial current stimulation have shown that a direct current stimulation of the occipital cortex can influence the amplitude size of a visual evoked potential (VEP). The current direction (cathodal or anodal) determines whether the VEP amplitudes increase or decrease. The aim of this study was to design a new experimental setup that will enable a simultaneous ocular direct current stimulation and electroretinogram (ERG) recording which will broaden our understanding of current stimulation effects on the visual system. Furthermore, we examined whether a direct current stimulation on the eye has a similar effect on an ERG as on a VEP. The pattern-reversal ERG was measured with sintered Ag/AgCl skin-electrodes, positioned on the lower eyelid (active), the earlobe (reference), and the forehead (ground). Direct current was applied through a ring rubber electrode placed around the eye and a 5 cm × 5 cm rubber electrode placed at the ipsilateral temple with a current strength of 500 μA and a duration time of 5 min. Fifty-seven healthy volunteers were divided into three groups depending on the current direction (cathodal, anodal, and sham stimulation, n = 19 each). One ERG measurement (ERG 1) was performed before and another (ERG 2) during the direct current stimulation. The difference between ERG 1 and ERG 2 measurements for the characteristic P50, N95 and N95′ (N95 minimum measured from zero line) amplitudes were evaluated by both confidence interval analysis and t-test for related samples (α = 0.05, after Bonferroni correction p&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0055). The P50 amplitude was significantly decreased for ERG 2 measurement in the cathodal and anodal stimulation group (cathodal p = 0.001, anodal p = 0.000). No significant changes could be found in the N95 and N95′ amplitudes as well as in the sham-stimulation group. Additionally, the latencies did not undergo any significant changes. In conclusion, the newly designed experimental setup enables simultaneous current stimulation and ERG recording. The current influenced P50 amplitude although not the N95 and N95′ amplitudes. Furthermore, the amplitude size decreased for both current directions and did not lead to contrary effects as expected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: How Much Do Strategy Reports Tell About the Outcomes of Neurofeedback Training? A Study on the Voluntary Up-Regulation of the Sensorimotor Rhythm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00218</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00218</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The core learning mechanisms of neurofeedback (NF) training are associative, implicit, and, consequently, largely impervious to consciousness. Many other aspects of training that determine training outcomes, however, are accessible to conscious processing. The outcomes of sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) up-regulation training are related to the strategies reported by participants. The classification methods of individual strategies employed hitherto were possibly under influence of the idiosyncratic interpretation of the rater. To measure and possibly overcome this limitation, we employed independent raters to analyze strategies reported during SMR up-regulation training. Sixty-two healthy young participants took part in a single session of SMR up-regulation training. After completing six blocks of training, in which they received either simple visual feedback or a gamified version thereof, participants were required to report the strategies employed. Their individual learning outcomes were computed as well. Results point out that individual strategies as well as NF learning outcomes were not particularly sensitive to the presence of gamified elements in training the SMR up-regulation. A high degree of consistency across independent raters classifying strategy reports was observed. Some strategies were more typical of responders while other ones were more common among non-responders. In summary, we demonstrate a more objective and transparent way to analyze individual mental strategies to shed more light on the differences between NF responders and non-responders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy to Assess Brain Activation Evoked by Guilt and Shame</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising brain imaging modality for studying the neural substrates of moral emotions. However, the feasibility of using fNIRS to measure moral emotions has not been established. In the present study, we used fNIRS to detect the brain activation evoked by two typical moral emotions—guilt and shame. We presented the participants with guilt and shame context to evoke emotional responses and measured the brain activity by using fNIRS. The univariate general linear model analysis showed significant activations for both emotions in the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and middle temporal gyrus, and specific activation for guilt in the right temporoparietal junction. The multivariate classification analysis showed an overall recognition accuracy of 52.50%, which was significantly higher than the chance level in classifying the guilt, shame, and neutral emotions. These results suggested the feasibility of using fNIRS to assess the brain activation evoked by guilt and shame and demonstrated the potentials of fNIRS in studying the neural correlates of moral emotions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Aberrant Gray Matter Networks in Non-comorbid Medication-Naive Patients With Major Depressive Disorder and Those With Social Anxiety Disorder</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Major depressive disorder (MDD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) are among the most prevalent and frequently co-occurring psychiatric disorders in adults and may have, at least in part, a common etiology. However, the unique and the shared neuroanatomical characteristics of the two disorders have not been fully identified. The aim of this study was to compare the topological organization of gray matter networks between non-comorbid medication-naive MDD patients and SAD patients. High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired from 37 non-comorbid medication-naive MDD patients, 24 non-comorbid medication-naive SAD patients, and 41 healthy controls. Single-subject gray matter graphs were extracted from structural MRI scans, and whole-brain neuroanatomic organization was compared across the three groups. The relationships between brain network measures and clinical characteristics were analyzed. Relative to healthy controls, both the MDD and the SAD patients showed global decreases in clustering coefficient, normalized clustering coefficient, and small-worldness and locally decreased nodal centralities and morphological connections in the left insular, lingual, and calcarine cortices. Compared with healthy controls, the SAD patients exhibited increased nodal centralities and morphological connections mainly involving the prefrontal cortex and the sensorimotor network. Furthermore, compared to the SAD patients, the MDD patients showed increased characteristic path length, reduced global efficiency, and decreased nodal centralities and morphological connections in the right middle occipital gyrus and the right postcentral gyrus. Our findings provide new evidence for shared and specific similarity-based gray matter network alterations in MDD and SAD and emphasize that the psychopathological changes in the right middle occipital gyrus and the right postcentral gyrus might be different between the two disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: APOE Alleles and Diet in Brain Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The APOE gene alleles modify human aging and the response to the diet at many levels with diverse pleotropic effects from gut to brain. To understand the interactions of APOE isoforms and diet, we analyze how cellular trafficking of apoE proteins affects energy metabolism, the immune system, and reproduction. The age-accelerating APOE4 allele alters the endosomal trafficking of cell surface receptors that mediate lipid and glucose metabolism. The APOE4 allele is the ancestral human allele, joined by APOE3 and then APOE2 in the human species. Under conditions of high infection, uncertain food, and shorter life expectancy, APOE4 may be adaptive for reducing mortality. As humans transitioned into modern less-infectious environments and longer life spans, APOE4 increased risks of aging-related diseases, particularly impacting arteries and the brain. The association of APOE4 with glucose dysregulation and body weight promotes many aging-associated diseases. Additionally, the APOE gene locus interacts with adjacent genes on chromosome 19 in haplotypes that modify neurodegeneration and metabolism, for which we anticipate complex gene-environment interactions. We summarize how diet and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk are altered by APOE genotype in both animal and human studies and identify gaps. Much remains obscure in how APOE alleles modify nutritional factors in human aging. Identifying risk variant haplotypes in the APOE gene complex will clarify homeostatic adaptive responses to environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Globus pallidus dynamics reveal covert strategies for behavioral inhibition</title>

	<description>Flexible behavior requires restraint of actions that are no longer appropriate. This behavioral inhibition critically relies on frontal cortex - basal ganglia circuits. Within the basal ganglia the globus pallidus pars externa (GPe), has been hypothesized to mediate selective proactive inhibition: being prepared to stop a specific action, if needed. Here we investigate population dynamics of rat GPe neurons during preparation-to-stop, stopping, and going. Rats selectively engaged proactive inhibition towards specific actions, as shown by slowed reaction times (RTs). Under proactive inhibition, GPe population activity occupied state-space locations farther from the trajectory followed during normal movement initiation. Furthermore, the state-space locations were predictive of distinct types of errors: failures-to-stop, failures-to-go, and incorrect choices. Slowed RTs on correct proactive trials reflected starting bias towards the alternative action, which was overcome before progressing towards action initiation. Our results demonstrate that rats can exert cognitive control via strategic adjustments to their GPe network state.</description>

	<title>eLife: Different neuronal populations mediate inflammatory pain analgesia by exogenous and endogenous opioids</title>

	<description>Mu-opioid receptors (MORs) are crucial for analgesia by both exogenous and endogenous opioids. However, the distinct mechanisms underlying these two types of opioid analgesia remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that analgesic effects of exogenous and endogenous opioids on inflammatory pain are mediated by MORs expressed in distinct subpopulations of neurons in mouse. We found that the exogenous opioid-induced analgesia of inflammatory pain is mediated by MORs in Vglut2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; glutamatergic but not GABAergic neurons. In contrast, analgesia by endogenous opioids is mediated by MORs in GABAergic rather than Vglut2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; glutamatergic neurons. Furthermore, MORs expressed at the spinal level is mainly involved in the analgesic effect of morphine in acute pain, but not in endogenous opioid analgesia during chronic inflammatory pain. Thus, our study revealed distinct mechanisms underlying analgesia by exogenous and endogenous opioids, and laid the foundation for further dissecting the circuit mechanism underlying opioid analgesia.</description>

	<title>eLife: CRISPR-Cas12a exploits R-loop asymmetry to form double-strand breaks</title>

	<description>Type V CRISPR-Cas interference proteins use a single RuvC active site to make RNA-guided breaks in double-stranded DNA substrates, an activity essential for both bacterial immunity and genome editing. The best-studied of these enzymes, Cas12a, initiates DNA cutting by forming a 20-nucleotide R-loop in which the guide RNA displaces one strand of a double-helical DNA substrate, positioning the DNase active site for first-strand cleavage. However, crystal structures and biochemical data have not explained how the second strand is cut to complete the double-strand break. Here, we detect intrinsic instability in DNA flanking the RNA-3′ side of R-loops, which Cas12a can exploit to expose second-strand DNA for cutting. Interestingly, DNA flanking the RNA-5′ side of R-loops is not intrinsically unstable. This asymmetry in R-loop structure may explain the uniformity of guide RNA architecture and the single-active-site cleavage mechanism that are fundamental features of all type V CRISPR-Cas systems.</description>

	<description>Dopamine (DA) neurons are known to encode reward prediction error (RPE), in addition to other signals, such as salience. While RPE is known to support learning, the role of salience in supporting learning remains less clear. To address this, we recorded and manipulated VTA DA neurons in mice during fear extinction, a behavior we observed to generate spatially segregated RPE and salience signals. We applied deep learning to classify mouse freezing behavior, eliminating the need for human scoring. Our fiber photometry recordings showed that DA neurons in medial and lateral VTA have distinct activity profiles during fear extinction: medial VTA activity more closely reflected RPE, while lateral VTA activity more closely reflected a salience-like signal. Optogenetic inhibition of DA neurons in either region slowed fear extinction, with the relevant time period for inhibition differing across regions. Our results indicate that salience-like signals can have similar downstream consequences to RPE-like signals, although with different temporal dependencies.</description>

	<description>Despite evidence that context promotes the visual recognition of objects, decades of research have led to the pervasive notion that the object processing pathway in primate cortex consists of multiple areas that each process the intrinsic features of a few particular categories (e.g. faces, bodies, hands, objects, and scenes). Here we report that such category-selective neurons do not in fact code individual categories in isolation but are also sensitive to object relationships that reflect statistical regularities of the experienced environment. We show by direct neuronal recording that face-selective neurons respond not just to an image of a face, but also to parts of an image where contextual cues—for example a body—indicate a face ought to be, even if what is there is not a face.</description>

	<description>Petersen et al. demonstrate that cooling of the medial septum slows theta oscillation and increases choice errors without affecting spatial features of pyramidal neurons. Cooling affects distance-time, but not distance-theta phase, compression. The findings reveal that cell assemblies are organized by theta phase and not by external (clock) time.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Corticocortical Connections of the Rostral Forelimb Area in Rats: A Quantitative Tract-Tracing Study</title>

	<description>The rostral forelimb area (RFA) in the rat is considered to be a premotor cortical region based primarily on its efferent projections to the primary motor cortex. The purpose of the present study was to identify corticocortical connections of RFA, and to describe the relative strength of connections with other cortical areas. This will allow us to better understand the broader cortical network in which RFA participates, and thus, determine its function in motor behavior. In the present study, the RFA of adult male Long-Evans rats (n=6) was identified using intracortical microstimulation techniques and injected with the tract tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA). In post-mortem tissue, location of BDA-labeled terminal boutons and neuronal somata were plotted and superimposed on cortical field boundaries. The results demonstrated that the RFA has dense to moderate reciprocal connections with primary motor cortex, the frontal cortex medial and lateral to RFA, primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and lateral somatosensory areas. Importantly, S1 connections were dense to moderate in dysgranular zones, but sparse to negligible in granular zones. Cortical connections of RFA in rat are strikingly similar to cortical connections of the ventral premotor cortex in non-human primates, suggesting that these areas share similar functions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Molecular Basis of Sex Difference in Neuroprotection induced by Hypoxia preconditioning in zebrafish</title>

	<description>Hypoxia the major cause of ischemia leads to debilitating disease in infants via birth asphyxia and cerebral palsy whereas in adults via heart attack and stroke. A widespread natural protective phenomenon termed Hypoxic Preconditioning occurs when prior exposures to hypoxia eventually results in robust hypoxia resistance. Accordingly we have developed a novel model of sex-specific hypoxic preconditioning in adult zebrafish to mimic the tolerance of mini strokes in human which appears to protect against the severe damage inflicted by a major stroke event. Remarkable difference in the progression pattern of neuroprotection between preconditioning hypoxia followed by acute hypoxia (PH) group, and acute hypoxia (AH) group were observed with noticeable sex difference. Since gender difference has been reported in stroke it was pertinent to investigate whether any such sex difference also exists in PHs protective mechanism against acute ischemic stroke. In order to elucidate the neural molecular mechanisms behind sex difference in neuroprotection induced by PH, a high throughput proteomics approach utilizing iTRAQ was performed, followed by protein enrichment analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Out of thousands of altered proteins in zebrafish brain the ones having critical role either in neuroglial proliferation/differentiation or neurotrophic functions, were validated by analyzing their expression levels in PH, AH and normoxia groups. Results indicate that female zebrafish brains are more protected against the severity of AH. The study also sheds light on the involvement of many signaling pathways underlying sex difference in pre-conditioning induced neuroprotective mechanism, which can be further validated for the therapeutic approach.</description>

	<description>Maternal schizotypic personality is thought to influence childhood risk for mental health and is a personality dimension elevated among schizophrenia-spectrum patients and their first-degree relatives, in whom neuro-oscillatory deficits have been observed. The current study investigated whether 6-month-old infants ( n  =46), and a subset of their biological mothers ( n  =34), who identified as either schizotypic ( n  =14) non-schizotypic ( n  =14), or an intermediate group ( n  =6), displayed reduced evoked-oscillatory activity. All mothers completed the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences as an index of schizotypy dimensionality. An auditory paired-tone paradigm was used to probe oscillatory activity, revealing that although the infants evoked-oscillations displayed differences between  Stimulus 1  and  2 , there were no group differences between infants of schizotypic and control mothers. Their mothers, however, displayed differences, with reduced amplitudes toward  Stimulus 1 in schizotypic mothers; consistent with literature on early sensory processes, showing sensory gating is impaired in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.</description>

	<description>The neural mechanisms underpinning empathy for pain are still a matter of debate. One of the major questions is whether empathy-related pain responses indicate domain-general vs. pain-specific affective responses. Using fMRI and psychopharmacological experiments, we investigated if placebo analgesia reduces first-hand and empathic experiences of affective touch, and compared them to the effects on pain. Placebo analgesia also affected the first-hand and empathic experience of unpleasant touch, implicating domain-general effects. However, and in contrast to pain and pain empathy, administering an opioid antagonist did not block these effects. Moreover, placebo analgesia reduced neural activity related to both modalities in the bilateral insular cortex, while it specifically modulated activity in the anterior midcingulate cortex for pain and pain empathy. These findings provide causal evidence that one of the major neurochemical systems for pain regulation is involved in pain empathy, and crucially substantiate the role of shared representations in empathy.</description>

	<description>FUS is a primarily nuclear RNA-binding protein with important roles in RNA processing and transport. FUS mutations disrupting its nuclear localization characterize a subset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS-FUS) patients, through an unidentified pathological mechanism. FUS regulates nuclear RNAs, but its role at the synapse is poorly understood. Here, we used super-resolution imaging to determine the physiological localization of extranuclear, neuronal FUS and found it predominantly near the vesicle reserve pool of presynaptic sites. Using CLIP-seq on synaptoneurosome preparations, we identified synaptic RNA targets of FUS that are associated with synapse organization and plasticity. Synaptic FUS was significantly increased in a knock-in mouse model of ALS-FUS, at presymptomatic stages, accompanied by alterations in density and size of GABAergic synapses. RNA-seq of synaptoneurosomes highlighted age-dependent dysregulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Our study indicates that FUS accumulation at the synapse in early stages of ALS-FUS results in synaptic impairment, potentially representing an initial trigger of neurodegeneration.</description>

	<description>Rapid execution of motor sequences is believed to depend upon the fusing of movement elements into cohesive units that are executed holistically. We sought to determine the contribution of motor cortex activity to this ability. Two monkeys performed highly practiced two-reach sequences, interleaved with matched reaches performed alone or separated by a delay. We partitioned neural population activity into components pertaining to preparation, initiation, and execution. The hypothesis that movement elements fuse makes specific predictions regarding all three forms of activity. We observed none of these predicted effects. Instead, two-reach sequences involved the same set of neural events as individual reaches, but with a remarkable temporal compression: preparation for the second reach occurred as the first was in flight. Thus, at the level of motor cortex, skillfully executing a rapid sequence depends not on fusing elements, but on the ability to perform two computations at the same time.</description>

	<description>In ambiguous or conflicting sensory situations, perception is often 'multistable' in that it changes abruptly at irregular intervals, shifting perpetually between distinct alternatives. Intriguingly, the interval statistics of these alternations exhibits quasi-universal characteristics, suggesting a general mechanism. Here we show that the stereotypical features of multistable perception, exemplified by binocular rivalry, are reproduced in detail by a hierarchical dynamics operating out of equilibrium. Its constitutive elements are discretely stochastic and idealize the metastability of cortical networks. Independent elements accumulate visual evidence at one level, while groups of coupled elements compete for dominance at another level. As soon as one group dominates perception, feedback inhibition suppresses supporting evidence. This mechanism is corroborated compellingly by unexpected serial dependencies of perceptual alternations. Moreover, it satisfies normative constraints of continuous decision-making. We conclude that multistable perception reflects decision-making in a volatile world: integrating evidence over space and time, choosing categorically between hypotheses, while concurrently evaluating alternatives.</description>

	<description>Episodic memory is thought to depend on interactions between the hippocampus and a set of closely interconnected regions that comprise the default mode network (DMN)--a large-scale network that has been identified with resting-state fMRI. Here, using data-driven analyses of resting-state fMRI data to characterize cortico-hippocampal network connectivity, we identified a discrete set of subnetworks that interact with the hippocampus. Specifically, we found that the hippocampus closely affiliated with the DMN and with a &quot;Medial Temporal Network&quot; (MTN) that included regions in the medial temporal lobe and retrosplenial cortex. The DMN could be further subdivided into three subnetworks: a &quot;Posterior Medial&quot; Subnetwork comprised of regions in the posterior cingulate, lateral parietal, and dorsal prefrontal cortex, an &quot;Anterior Temporal: Subnetwork comprised of regions in the temporopolar, lateral orbitofrontal, and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, and a &quot;Medial Prefrontal&quot; Subnetwork comprised of regions in the ventral medial prefrontal, and entorhinal cortex. These cortico-hippocampal networks vary in their functional connectivity along the hippocampal long-axis, and analyses of an independent task-fMRI dataset revealed that the three DMN subnetworks represent different kinds of information during memory-guided decision-making. Finally, a data-driven meta-analysis of functional imaging studies of cognition suggests new hypotheses regarding the functions of the MTN and DMN subnetworks, thus providing a framework to guide future research on the neural architecture of episodic memory.</description>

	<description>To form and modify synaptic connections and store information, neurons continuously remodel their proteomes. The impressive length of dendrites and axons imposes unique logistical challenges to maintain synaptic proteins at locations remote from the transcription source (the nucleus). The discovery of thousands of mRNAs near synapses suggested that neurons overcome distance and gain autonomy by producing proteins locally1. It is not known, however if, how and when localized mRNAs are translated into protein. To investigate the translational landscape in neuronal subregions, we performed simultaneous RNA-seq and Ribo-seq from microdissected rodent brain slices to identify and quantify the transcriptome and translatome in cell bodies as well as dendrites and axons (neuropil). More than 4800 transcripts were translated in synaptic regions. Thousands of transcripts were differentially translated between somatic and synaptic regions, with scaffold and signaling molecules mostly arising from local sources. Furthermore, specific mRNA features were identified that regulate the efficiency of mRNA translation. The findings overturn the view that local translation is a minor source of synaptic protein2 and indicate that on-site translational control is an important mechanism to control synaptic strength.</description>

Here we pursue the idea that different individual factors differently contribute to the amount of explicit and implicit intermanual transfer of sensorimotor adaptation. In particular we tested a group of judo athletes who show enhanced right-hemispheric involvement in motor control and a group of equally trained athletes as control participants. After adaptation to a 60 deg visual rotation, we estimated awareness of the perturbation and transfer to the untrained, non-dominant left hand in two experiments. We measured the total amount of intermanual transfer (explicit plus implicit) by telling the participants to repeat what was learned during adaptation and the amount of implicit transfer by instructing the participants to refrain from using what was learned but to perform movements as during baseline. We found no difference between the total intermanual transfer of judokas and running experts, with mean absolute transfer values of 42.4 deg and 47.0 deg. Implicit intermanual transfer was very limited but larger in judo than in general sports athletes, with mean values of 5.2 deg and 1.6 deg. A multiple linear regression analysis further revealed that total intermanual transfer, which largely represents the explicit transfer, is related to awareness of the perturbation while implicit intermanual transfer can be predicted by judo training, amount of total training, speed of adaptation and handedness scores. The findings are discussed in relation to neuronal mechanisms such as hemispheric interactions and functional specialization underlying intermanual transfer of motor learning.</description>

	<description>Previous studies have identified a crucial role of the gut microbiome in modifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. However, the mechanisms of microbiome-brain interaction in AD, including the microbial mediators and their cellular targets in the brain, were so far unknown. Here, we identify microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids (SCFA) as key metabolites along the gut-brain axis in AD. Germ-free (GF) AD mice exhibit a substantially reduced A{beta} plaque load and markedly reduced SCFA plasma concentrations; conversely, SCFA supplementation to GF AD mice was sufficient to increase the A{beta} plaque load to levels of conventionally colonized animals. While A{beta} generation was only mildly affected, we observed strong microglial activation and upregulation of ApoE upon the SCFA supplementation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that microbiota-derived SCFA are the key mediators along the gut-brain axis resulting in increased microglial activation, ApoE upregulation and A{beta} deposition.</description>

	<description>Perinatal protein malnourishment is a leading cause for mental and physical retardation in children with poor socioeconomic conditions. Such malnourished children are vulnerable to additional stressors, that may synergistically act to cause neurological disorders at adulthood. In this study, the above mentioned condition is mimicked via a multi-hit rat model in which pups born to protein malnourished mothers (LP) were co-injected with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C; viral mimetic) at Postnatal day (PND) 3 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS; bacterial mimetic) at PND 9. Individual exposure of Poly I:C and LPS was also given to LP pups to correlate chronicity of stress. Similar treatments were also given to control pups. Hippocampal cellular apoptosis, {beta} III tubulin catastrophe, altered neuronal profiling and spatial memory impairments were assessed at PND 180, using specific immunohistochemical markers (active caspase 3, {beta} III tubulin, doublecortin), Golgi studies and cognitive mazes (Morris Water Maze and T maze). Increase in cellular apoptosis, loss of dendritic arborization and spatial memory impairments were higher in multi-hit group, than the single-hit groups. Such impairments observed due to multi-hit stress, mimic conditions similar to many neurological disorders and hence it is hypothesized that later life neurological disorders might be an outcome of multiple early life hits.</description>

	<description>Making accurate decisions often involves the integration of current as well as past evidence. How the brain achieves this is largely unknown, but the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown to represent immediate conflict in evidence, specifically via theta and beta oscillations. Here we examine the neural correlates of evidence conflict and integration during sequential decision making. Patients implanted with electrodes for deep brain stimulation (DBS) and age-matched healthy controls performed an expanded judgement task, in which they were free to choose how much evidence (cues) to sample before making a decision. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and STN local field potentials (in patients) were recorded. We found that beta oscillations signalled conflict between cues within a sequence. Specifically, beta power in the STN and cortex first decreased and then increased following cues in the sequence that differed from previous cues. Cortical activity preceded STN activity and premotor cortical-STN coherence was increased in the beta band following the onset of a conflicting cue. Furthermore, the conflict signal in the STN was more persistent over time. These results extend our understanding of cortico-subcortical dynamics of conflict processing, and do so in a context where evidence must be accumulated in discrete steps, much like in real life.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.09.141432v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Purpose: This study investigated changes in small-world topology and brain functional connectivity in patients with optic neuritis (ON) by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and based on graph theory. Methods: A total of 21 patients with ON (8 males and 13 females) and 21 matched healthy control subjects (8 males and 13 females) were enrolled at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University and underwent rs-fMRI. Data were preprocessed and the brain was divided into 116 regions of interest. Small-world network parameters and area under the integral curve (AUC) were calculated from pairwise brain interval correlation coefficients. Differences in brain network parameter AUCs between the 2 groups were evaluated with the independent sample t-test, and changes in brain connection strength between ON patients and control subjects were assessed by network-based statistical analysis. Results: In the sparsity range from 0.08 to 0.48, both groups exhibited small-world attributes. Compared to the control group, global network efficiency, normalized clustering coefficient, and small-world value were higher whereas the clustering coefficient value was lower in ON patients. There were no differences in characteristic path length, local network efficiency, and normalized characteristic path length between groups. In addition, ON patients had lower brain functional connectivity strength among the rolandic operculum, medial superior frontal gyrus, insula, median cingulate and paracingulate gyri, amygdala, superior parietal gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, lenticular nucleus, pallidum, superior temporal gyrus, cerebellum_Crus1_L, and left cerebellum_Crus6_L compared to the control group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The brain network in ON has a small-world attributes but shows reduced and abnormal connectivity compared to normal subjects. These findings provide a further insight into the neural pathogenesis of ON and reveal specific fMRI findings that can serve as diagnostic and prognostic indices.

	<description>The biological mechanisms that allow the brain to balance flexibility and integration remain poorly understood. A potential solution to this mystery may lie in a unique aspect of neurobiology, which is that numerous brain systems contain diffuse synaptic connectivity. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that increasing diffuse cortical coupling within a validated biophysical corticothalamic model traverses the system through a quasi-critical regime in which spatial heterogeneities in input noise support transient critical dynamics in distributed sub-regions. We then demonstrate that the presence of quasi-critical states coincides with known signatures of complex, adaptive brain network dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of similar dynamic signatures in empirical whole brain human neuroimaging data. Together, our results establish that modulating the balance between local and diffuse synaptic coupling in a thalamocortical model subtends the emergence of quasi-critical brain states that act to flexibly transition the brain between unique modes of information processing.</description>

	<description>Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia in elderly individuals, slowly and progressively diminishes cognitive function. Mild cognitive impairment is also a significant risk factor to the parthenogenesis of AD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images have become widely used to detection and understand the natural progression not only AD but also neurodegenerative disorders. For this purpose, construct a reliable cognitive normal database is important. However, differences in magnetic field strength, sex, and age between normal databese and evaluation data-set can affect the accuracy of detection and evaluation of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. To solve this problem, we suggest a harmonized Z-score considering differences filed strength, sex and age derived from large (over 1,000 subjects) cognitive normal database including 1.5 T and 3T T1 brain MRI. And we evaluate our harmonized Z-score of discriminative power of AD and classification accuracy between stable MCI and progressive MCI. The harmonized Z-score of the hippocampus achieved high accuracy (AUC=0.96) for detection AD and moderate accuracy (AUC=0.70) for classification stable MCI and progressive MCI. These results show that our method not only can detect AD with high accuracy and high generalization capability but also can be valid to classify stable MCI and progressive MCI.</description>

In this paper, we present a functional spiking-neuron model of human working memory (WM). This model combines neural firing for encoding of information with activity-silent maintenance. While it used to be widely assumed that information in WM is maintained through persistent recurrent activity, recent studies have shown that information can be maintained without persistent firing; instead, information can be stored in activity-silent states. A candidate mechanism underlying this type of storage is short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP), by which the strength of connections between neurons rapidly changes to encode new information. To demonstrate that STSP can lead to functional behavior, we integrated STSP by means of calcium-mediated synaptic facilitation in a large-scale spiking-neuron model and added a decision mechanism. The model was used to simulate a recent study that measured behavior and EEG activity of participants in three delayed-response tasks. In these tasks, one or two visual gratings had to be maintained in WM, and compared to subsequent probes. The original study demonstrated that WM contents and its priority status could be decoded from neural activity elicited by a task-irrelevant stimulus displayed during the activity-silent maintenance period. In support of our model, we show that it can perform these tasks, and that both its behavior as well as its neural representations are in agreement with the human data. We conclude that information in WM can be effectively maintained in activity-silent states by means of calcium-mediated STSP.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-YEmivJgBl0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A longstanding goal of regulatory genetics is to understand how variants in genome sequences lead to changes in gene expression. Here we present a method named Bayesian Annotation Guided eQTL Analysis (BAGEA), a variational Bayes framework to model cis-eQTLs using directed and undirected genomic annotations. We used &lt;i&gt;BAGEA&lt;/i&gt; to integrate directed genomic annotations with eQTL summary statistics from tissues of various origins. This analysis revealed epigenetic marks that are relevant for gene expression in different tissues and cell types. We estimated the predictive power of the models that were fitted based on directed genomic annotations. This analysis showed that, depending on the underlying eQTL data used, the directed genomic annotations could predict up to 1.5% of the variance observed in the expression of genes with top nominal eQTL association p-values &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;. For genes with estimated effect sizes in the top 25% quantile, up to 5% of the expression variance could be predicted. Based on our results, we recommend the use of &lt;i&gt;BAGEA&lt;/i&gt; for the analysis of cis-eQTL data to reveal annotations relevant to expression biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LH4CA4aXWNY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Modern electrophysiological recordings and optical imaging techniques have revealed a diverse spectrum of spatiotemporal neural activities underlying fundamental cognitive processing. Oscillations, traveling waves and other complex population dynamical patterns are often concomitant with sensory processing, information transfer, decision making and memory consolidation. While neural population models such as neural mass, population density and kinetic theoretical models have been used to capture a wide range of the experimentally observed dynamics, a full account of how the multi-scale dynamics emerges from the detailed biophysical properties of individual neurons and the network architecture remains elusive. Here we apply a recently developed coarse-graining framework for reduced-dimensional descriptions of neuronal networks to model visual cortical dynamics. We show that, without introducing any new parameters, how a sequence of models culminating in an augmented system of spatially-coupled ODEs can effectively model a wide range of the observed cortical dynamics, ranging from visual stimulus orientation dynamics to traveling waves induced by visual illusory stimuli. In addition to an efficient simulation method, this framework also offers an analytic approach to studying large-scale network dynamics. As such, the dimensional reduction naturally leads to mesoscopic variables that capture the interplay between neuronal population stochasticity and network architecture that we believe to underlie many emergent cortical phenomena.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cH8b_BlTI7M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

F. Mauriello&lt;/p&gt;

The development of multicellularity is a key evolutionary transition allowing for differentiation of physiological functions across a cell population that confers survival benefits; among unicellular bacteria, this can lead to complex developmental behaviors and the formation of higher-order community structures. Herein, we demonstrate that in the social δ-proteobacterium &lt;i&gt;Myxococcus xanthus&lt;/i&gt;, the secretion of a novel biosurfactant polysaccharide (BPS) is spatially modulated within communities, mediating swarm migration as well as the formation of multicellular swarm biofilms and fruiting bodies. BPS is a type IV pilus (T4P)-inhibited acidic polymer built of randomly acetylated β-linked tetrasaccharide repeats. Both BPS and exopolysaccharide (EPS) are produced by dedicated Wzx/Wzy-dependent polysaccharide-assembly pathways distinct from that responsible for spore-coat assembly. While EPS is preferentially produced at the lower-density swarm periphery, BPS production is favored in the higher-density swarm interior; this is consistent with the former being known to stimulate T4P retraction needed for community expansion and a function for the latter in promoting initial cell dispersal. Together, these data reveal the central role of secreted polysaccharides in the intricate behaviors coordinating bacterial multicellularity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4YmZR26DMMQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Inherited prion diseases are caused by autosomal dominant coding mutations in the human prion protein (PrP) gene (&lt;i&gt;PRNP&lt;/i&gt;) and account for about 15% of human prion disease cases worldwide. The proposed mechanism is that the mutation predisposes to conformational change in the expressed protein, leading to the generation of disease-related multichain PrP assemblies that propagate by seeded protein misfolding. Despite considerable experimental support for this hypothesis, to-date spontaneous formation of disease-relevant, transmissible PrP assemblies in transgenic models expressing only mutant human PrP has not been demonstrated. Here, we report findings from transgenic mice that express human PrP 117V on a mouse PrP null background (117VV Tg30 mice), which model the &lt;i&gt;PRNP&lt;/i&gt; A117V mutation causing inherited prion disease (IPD) including Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease phenotypes in humans. By studying brain samples from uninoculated groups of mice, we discovered that some mice (≥475 days old) spontaneously generated abnormal PrP assemblies, which after inoculation into further groups of 117VV Tg30 mice, produced a molecular and neuropathological phenotype congruent with that seen after transmission of brain isolates from IPD A117V patients to the same mice. To the best of our knowledge, the 117VV Tg30 mouse line is the first transgenic model expressing only mutant human PrP to show spontaneous generation of transmissible PrP assemblies that directly mirror those generated in an inherited prion disease in humans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7pN5DjjPHiU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Autophagy is an intracellular degradation pathway targeting organelles and macromolecules, thereby regulating various cellular functions. Phosphorylation is a key posttranscriptional protein modification implicated in the regulation of biological function including autophagy. Under asynchronous conditions, autophagy activity is predominantly suppressed by mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, but whether autophagy-related genes (ATG) proteins are phosphorylated differentially throughout the sequential phases of the cell cycle remains unclear. In this issue, Li and colleagues report that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) phosphorylates the ULK complex during mitosis. This phosphorylation induces autophagy and, surprisingly, is shown to drive cell cycle progression. This work reveals a yet-unappreciated role for autophagy in cell cycle progression and enhances our understanding of the specific phase-dependent autophagy regulation during cellular growth and proliferation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tFg0FHdgWlk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1)–autophagy-related 13 (ATG13) is the most upstream autophagy initiation complex that is phosphorylated by mammalian target-of-rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to induce autophagy in asynchronous conditions. However, their phospho-regulation and functions in mitosis and cell cycle remain unknown. Here we show that ULK1-ATG13 complex is differentially regulated throughout the cell cycle, especially in mitosis, in which both ULK1 and ATG13 are highly phosphorylated by the key cell cycle machinery cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)/cyclin B. Combining mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis, we found that CDK1-induced ULK1-ATG13 phosphorylation promotes mitotic autophagy and cell cycle progression. Moreover, double knockout (DKO) of ULK1 and ATG13 could block cell cycle progression and significantly decrease cancer cell proliferation in cell line and mouse models. Our results not only bridge the mutual regulation between the core machinery of autophagy and mitosis but also illustrate the positive function of ULK1-ATG13 and their phosphorylation by CDK1 in mitotic autophagy regulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/K9geLmzvZ_w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Living biological systems display a fascinating ability to self-organize their metabolism. This ability ultimately determines the metabolic robustness that is fundamental to controlling cellular behavior. However, fluctuations in metabolism can affect cellular homeostasis through transient oscillations. For example, yeast cultures exhibit rhythmic oscillatory behavior in high cell-density continuous cultures. Oscillatory...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/oIoWCnq0j4U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Randomized Clinical Trial of First‐Line Genome Sequencing in Pediatric White Matter Disorders</title>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25757?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome sequencing (GS) is promising for unsolved leukodystrophies, but its efficacy has not been prospectively studied.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prospective time‐delayed crossover design trial of GS to assess the efficacy of GS as a first‐line diagnostic tool for genetic white matter disorders took place between December 1, 2015 and September 27, 2017. Patients were randomized to receive GS immediately with concurrent standard of care (SoC) testing, or to receive SoC testing for 4 months followed by GS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐four individuals were assessed at interim review. The genetic origin of 2 patient's leukoencephalopathy was resolved before randomization. Nine patients were stratified to the immediate intervention group and 23 patients to the delayed‐GS arm. The efficacy of GS was significant relative to SoC in the immediate (5/9 [56%] vs 0/9 [0%]; Wild–Seber, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.005) and delayed (control) arms (14/23 [61%] vs 5/23 [22%]; Wild–Seber, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.005). The time to diagnosis was significantly shorter in the immediate‐GS group (log‐rank test, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.04). The overall diagnostic efficacy of combined GS and SoC approaches was 26 of 34 (76.5%, 95% confidence interval = 58.8–89.3%) in &amp;lt;4 months, greater than historical norms of &amp;lt;50% over 5 years. Owing to loss of clinical equipoise, the trial design was altered to a single‐arm observational study.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, first‐line GS provided earlier and greater diagnostic efficacy in white matter disorders. We provide an evidence‐based diagnostic testing algorithm to enable appropriate clinical GS utilization in this population. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infection has the potential for targeting the central nervous system, and several neurological symptoms have been described in patients with severe respiratory distress. Here, we described the case of a 60‐year‐old patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection but only mild respiratory abnormalities who developed an akinetic mutism attributable to encephalitis. Magnetic resonance imaging was negative, whereas electroencephalography showed generalized theta slowing. Cerebrospinal fluid analyses during the acute stage were negative for SARS‐CoV‐2, positive for pleocytosis and hyperproteinorrachia, and showed increased interleukin‐8 and tumor necrosis factor‐α concentrations. Other infectious or autoimmune disorders were excluded. A progressive clinical improvement along with a reduction of cerebrospinal fluid parameters was observed after high‐dose steroid treatment, thus arguing for an inflammatory‐mediated brain involvement related to COVID‐19.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Longitudinal Development of Peripapillary Hyper‐Reflective Ovoid Masslike Structures Suggests a Novel Pathological Pathway in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25782?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25782?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peripapillary hyper‐reflective ovoid masslike structures (PHOMS) are a new spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) finding.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prospective, longitudinal study included patients (n = 212) with multiple sclerosis (MS; n = 418 eyes), 59 healthy controls (HCs; n = 117 eyes), and 267 non‐MS disease controls (534 eyes). OCT and diffusion tensor imaging were used.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no PHOMS in HC eyes (0/117, 0%). The prevalence of PHOMS was significantly higher in patients with MS (34/212, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) and MS eyes (45/418, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.0002) when compared to HCs (0/59, 0/117). The inter‐rater agreement for PHOMS was 97.9% (kappa = 0.951). PHOMS were present in 16% of patients with relapsing–remitting, 16% of patients with progressive, and 12% of patients with secondary progressive disease course (2% of eyes). There was no relationship of PHOMS with age, disease duration, disease course, disability, or disease‐modifying treatments. The fractional anisotropy of the optic radiations was lower in patients without PHOMS (0.814) when compared to patients with PHOMS (0.845, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). The majority of PHOMS remained stable, but increase in size and de novo development of PHOMS were also observed. In non‐MS disease controls, PHOMS were observed in intracranial hypertension (62%), optic disc drusen (47%), anomalous optic discs (44%), isolated optic neuritis (19%), and optic atrophy (12%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data suggest that PHOMS are a novel finding in MS pathology. Future research is needed to determine whether development of PHOMS in MS is due to intermittently raised intracranial pressure or an otherwise impaired “glymphatic” outflow from eye to brain.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Locomotion is a crucial challenge for legged robots that is addressed
&quot;effortlessly&quot; by biological networks abundant in nature, named central pattern
generators (CPG). The multitude of CPG network models that have so far become
biomimetic robotic controllers is not applicable to the emerging neuromorphic
hardware, depriving mobile robots of a robust walking mechanism that would
result in inherently energy-efficient systems. Here, we propose a brain-morphic
CPG controler based on a comprehensive spiking neural-astrocytic network that
generates two gait patterns for a hexapod robot. Building on the recently
identified astrocytic mechanisms for neuromodulation, our proposed CPG
architecture is seamlessly integrated into Intel's Loihi neuromorphic chip by
leveraging a real-time interaction framework between the chip and the robotic
operating system (ROS) environment, that we also propose. Here, we demonstrate
that a Loihi-run CPG can be used to control a walking robot with robustness to
sensory noise and varying speed profiles. Our results pave the way for scaling
this and other approaches towards Loihi-controlled locomotion in autonomous
mobile robots.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Searching for biomarkers has been a chief pursuit of the field of psychiatry.
Toward this end, studies have catalogued candidate resting-state biomarkers in
nearly all forms of mental disorder. However, it is becoming increasingly clear
that these biomarkers lack specificity, limiting their capacity to yield
clinical impact. We discuss three avenues of research that are overcoming this
limitation: (i) the adoption of transdiagnostic research designs, which involve
studying and explicitly comparing multiple disorders from distinct diagnostic
axes of psychiatry; (ii) dimensional models of psychopathology that map the
full spectrum of symptomatology and that cut across traditional disorder
boundaries; and (iii) modeling individuals' unique functional connectomes
throughout development. We provide a framework for tying these subfields
together that draws on tools from machine learning and network science.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04182</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Backpropagation of error (backprop) is a powerful algorithm for training
machine learning architectures through end-to-end differentiation. However,
backprop is often criticised for lacking biological plausibility. Recently, it
has been shown that backprop in multilayer-perceptrons (MLPs) can be
approximated using predictive coding, a biologically-plausible process theory
of cortical computation which relies only on local and Hebbian updates. The
power of backprop, however, lies not in its instantiation in MLPs, but rather
in the concept of automatic differentiation which allows for the optimisation
of any differentiable program expressed as a computation graph. Here, we
demonstrate that predictive coding converges asymptotically (and in practice
rapidly) to exact backprop gradients on arbitrary computation graphs using only
local learning rules. We apply this result to develop a straightforward
strategy to translate core machine learning architectures into their predictive
coding equivalents. We construct predictive coding CNNs, RNNs, and the more
complex LSTMs, which include a non-layer-like branching internal graph
structure and multiplicative interactions. Our models perform equivalently to
backprop on challenging machine learning benchmarks, while utilising only local
and (mostly) Hebbian plasticity. Our method raises the potential that standard
machine learning algorithms could in principle be directly implemented in
neural circuitry, and may also contribute to the development of completely
distributed neuromorphic architectures.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Active inference is a Bayesian framework for understanding biological
intelligence. The underlying theory brings together perception and action under
one single imperative: minimizing free energy. However, despite its theoretical
utility in explaining intelligence, computational implementations have been
restricted to low-dimensional and idealized situations. In this paper, we
present a neural architecture for building deep active inference agents
operating in complex, continuous state-spaces using multiple forms of
Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. For this, we introduce a number of techniques, novel
to active inference. These include: i) selecting free-energy-optimal policies
via MC tree search, ii) approximating this optimal policy distribution via a
feed-forward `habitual' network, iii) predicting future parameter belief
updates using MC dropouts and, finally, iv) optimizing state transition
precision (a high-end form of attention). Our approach enables agents to learn
environmental dynamics efficiently, while maintaining task performance, in
relation to reward-based counterparts. We illustrate this in a new toy
environment, based on the dSprites data-set, and demonstrate that active
inference agents automatically create disentangled representations that are apt
for modeling state transitions. In a more complex Animal-AI environment, our
agents (using the same neural architecture) are able to simulate future state
transitions and actions (i.e., plan), to evince reward-directed navigation -
despite temporary suspension of visual input. These results show that deep
active inference - equipped with MC methods - provides a flexible framework to
develop biologically-inspired intelligent agents, with applications in both
machine learning and cognitive science.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Active inference offers a first principle account of sentient behaviour, from
which special and important cases can be derived, e.g., reinforcement learning,
active learning, Bayes optimal inference, Bayes optimal design, etc. Active
inference resolves the exploitation-exploration dilemma in relation to prior
preferences, by placing information gain on the same footing as reward or
value. In brief, active inference replaces value functions with functionals of
(Bayesian) beliefs, in the form of an expected (variational) free energy. In
this paper, we consider a sophisticated kind of active inference, using a
recursive form of expected free energy. Sophistication describes the degree to
which an agent has beliefs about beliefs. We consider agents with beliefs about
the counterfactual consequences of action for states of affairs and beliefs
about those latent states. In other words, we move from simply considering
beliefs about 'what would happen if I did that' to 'what would I believe about
what would happen if I did that'. The recursive form of the free energy
functional effectively implements a deep tree search over actions and outcomes
in the future. Crucially, this search is over sequences of belief states, as
opposed to states per se. We illustrate the competence of this scheme, using
numerical simulations of deep decision problems.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04039</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain produces rhythms in a variety of frequency bands. Some are likely
by-products of neuronal processes; others are thought to be top-down. Produced
entirely naturally, these rhythms have clearly recognizable beats, but they are
very far from periodic in the sense of mathematics. They produce signals that
are broad-band, episodic, wandering in magnitude, in frequency and in phase;
the rhythm comes and goes, degrading and regenerating. Rhythms with these
characteristics do not match standard dynamical systems paradigms of
periodicity, quasi-periodicity, or periodic motion in the presence of a
Brownian noise. Thus far they have been satisfactorily reproduced only using
networks of hundreds of integrate-and-fire neurons. In this paper, we tackle
the mathematical question of whether signals with these properties can be
generated from simpler dynamical systems. Using an ODE with two variables
inspired by the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, and varying randomly three parameters
that control the magnitude, frequency and degree of degradation, we were able
to replicate the qualitative characteristics of these natural brain rhythms.
Viewing the two variables as Excitatory and Inhibitory conductances of a
typical neuron in a local population, our model produces results that closely
resemble gamma-band activity in real cortex, including the moment-to-moment
balancing of E and I-currents seen in experiments.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Graph Neural Network Encoding for Community Detection in Attribute Networks. (arXiv:2006.03996v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03996</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03996</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we first propose a graph neural network encoding method for
multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to handle the community detection problem
in complex attribute networks. In the graph neural network encoding method,
each edge in an attribute network is associated with a continuous variable.
Through non-linear transformation, a continuous valued vector (i.e. a
concatenation of the continuous variables associated with all edges) is
transferred to a discrete valued community grouping solution. Further, two new
objective functions for single- and multi-attribute network are proposed to
evaluate the attribute homogeneity of the nodes in communities, respectively.
Based on the new encoding method and the two new objectives, a multiobjective
evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based upon NSGA-II, termed as continuous encoding
MOEA, is developed for the transformed community detection problem with
continuous decision variables. Experimental results on single- and
multi-attribute real-life networks with different types show that the developed
algorithm performs significantly better than some well-known evolutionary and
non-evolutionary based algorithms. The fitness landscape analysis verifies that
the transformed community detection problems have smoother landscapes than
those of the original problems, which justifies the effectiveness of the
proposed graph neural network encoding method.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: The Convergence Indicator: Improved and completely characterized parameter bounds for actual convergence of Particle Swarm Optimization. (arXiv:2006.03944v1 [math.OC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a meta-heuristic for continuous
black-box optimization problems. In this paper we focus on the convergence of
the particle swarm, i.e., the exploitation phase of the algorithm. We introduce
a new convergence indicator that can be used to calculate whether the particles
will finally converge to a single point or diverge. Using this convergence
indicator we provide the actual bounds completely characterizing parameter
regions that lead to a converging swarm. Our bounds extend the parameter
regions where convergence is guaranteed compared to bounds induced by
converging variance which are usually used in the literature. To evaluate our
criterion we describe a numerical approximation using cubic spline
interpolation. Finally we provide experiments showing that our concept,
formulas and the resulting convergence bounds represent the actual behavior of
PSO.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Postnatal Development of Visual Cortical Function in the Mammalian Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This review aims to discuss (1) the refinement of mammalian visual cortical circuits and the maturation of visual functions they subserve in primary visual cortex (V1) and other visual cortical areas, and (2) existing evidence supporting the notion of differential rates of maturation of visual functions in different species. It is well known that different visual functions and their underlying circuitry mature and attain adultlike characteristics at different stages in postnatal development with varying growth rates. The developmental timecourse and duration of refinement varies significantly both in V1 of various species and among different visual cortical areas; while basic visual functions like spatial acuity mature earlier requiring less time, higher form perception such as contour integration is more complex and requires longer postnatal time to refine. This review will highlight the importance of systematic comparative analysis of the differential rates of refinement of visual circuitry and function as that may help reveal underlying key mechanisms necessary for healthy visual development during infancy and adulthood. This type of approach will help future studies to establish direct links between various developmental aspects of different visual cortical areas in both human and animal models; thus enhancing our understanding of vision related neurological disorders and their potential therapeutic remedies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Ion Channel Contributions to Morphological Development: Insights From the Role of Kir2.1 in Bone Development</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The role of ion channels in neurons and muscles has been well characterized. However, recent work has demonstrated both the presence and necessity of ion channels in diverse cell types for morphological development. For example, mutations that disrupt ion channels give rise to abnormal structural development in species of flies, frogs, fish, mice, and humans. Furthermore, medications and recreational drugs that target ion channels are associated with higher incidence of birth defects in humans. In this review we establish the effects of several teratogens on development including epilepsy treatment drugs (topiramate, valproate, ethosuximide, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine), nicotine, heat, and cannabinoids. We then propose potential links between these teratogenic agents and ion channels with mechanistic insights from model organisms. Finally, we talk about the role of a particular ion channel, Kir2.1, in the formation and development of bone as an example of how ion channels can be used to uncover important processes in morphogenesis. Because ion channels are common targets of many currently used medications, understanding how ion channels impact morphological development will be important for prevention of birth defects. It is becoming increasingly clear that ion channels have functional roles outside of tissues that have been classically considered excitable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that targets motor neurons (MNs) in the brain and spinal cord. It leads to gradual loss of motor signals to muscles leading to atrophy and weakness. Most patients do not survive for more than 3–5 years after disease onset. Current ALS treatments provide only a small delay of disease progression. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to explore new therapeutic approaches. One of the major hindrances in achieving this goal is poor understanding of causes of the disease. ALS has complex pathophysiological mechanisms in its genetic and sporadic forms. Protein aggregates are a common hallmark of ALS regardless of cause making protein pathways attractive therapeutic targets in ALS. Here, we provide an overview of compounds in different stages of pharmacological development and their protein pathway targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Persistent Neurovascular Unit Dysfunction: Pathophysiological Substrate and Trigger for Late-Onset Neurodegeneration After Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents one of the major causes of death worldwide and leads to persisting neurological deficits in many of the survivors. One of the most significant long-term sequelae deriving from TBI is neurodegenerative disease, which is a group of incurable diseases that impose a heavy socio-economic burden. However, mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility of TBI to neurodegenerative disease remain elusive. The neurovascular unit (NVU) is a functional unit composed of neurons, neuroglia, vascular cells, and the basal lamina matrix. The key role of NVU dysfunction in many central nervous system diseases has been revealed. Studies have proved the presence of prolonged structural and functional abnormalities of the NVU after TBI. Moreover, growing evidence suggests impaired NVU function is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we propose the Neurovascular Unit Dysfunction (NVUD) Hypothesis, in which the persistent NVU dysfunction is thought to underlie the development of post-TBI neurodegeneration. We deduce NVUD Hypothesis through relational inference and supporting evidence, and suggest continued NVU abnormalities following TBI serve as the pathophysiological substrate and trigger yielding chronic neuroinflammation, proteinopathies and oxidative stress, consequently leading to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The NVUD Hypothesis may provide potential treatment and prevention strategies for TBI and late-onset neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Polyglutamine spinocerebellar ataxias (polyQ SCAs) include SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17 and constitute a group of adult onset neurodegenerative disorders caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat sequence located within the coding region of specific genes, which translates into polyglutamine tract in the corresponding proteins. PolyQ SCAs are characterized by degeneration of the cerebellum and its associated structures and lead to progressive ataxia and other diverse symptoms. In recent years, gene and epigenetic deregulations have been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of polyQ SCAs. Here, we provide an overview of the functions of wild type and pathogenic polyQ SCA proteins in gene regulation, describe the extent and nature of gene expression changes and their pathological consequences in diseases, and discuss potential avenues to further investigate converging and distinct disease pathways and to develop therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Central nervous system (CNS) disorders especially neurodegenerative disorders are the major challenge for public health and demand the great attention of researchers to protect people against them. In past few decades, different treatment strategies have been adopted, but their therapeutic efficacy are not enough and have only shown partial mitigation of symptoms. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BSCFB) guard the CNS from harmful substances and pose as the major challenges in delivering drugs into CNS for treatment of CNS complications such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), stroke, epilepsy, brain tumors, multiple sclerosis (MS), and encephalitis, etc. Nanotechnology has come out as an exciting and promising new platform of treating neurological disorders and has shown great potential to overcome problems related to the conventional treatment approaches. Molecules can be nanoengineered to carry out multiple specific functions such as to cross the BBB, target specific cell or signaling pathway, respond to endogenous stimuli, and act as a vehicle for gene delivery, support nerve regeneration and cell survival.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stroke has a debilitating effect on the human body and a serious negative effect on society, with a global incidence of one in every six people. According to the World Health Organization, 15 million people suffer stroke worldwide each year. Of these, 5 million die and another 5 million are permanently disabled. Motor and cognitive deficits like hemiparesis, paralysis, chronic pain, and psychomotor and behavioral symptoms can persist long term and prevent the patient from fully reintegrating into society, therefore continuing to add to the costly healthcare burden of stroke. Regenerative medicine using stem cells seems to be a panacea for sequelae after stroke. Stem cell-based therapy aids neuro-regeneration and neuroprotection for neurological recovery in patients. However, the use of stem cells as a therapy in stroke patients still needs a lot of research at both basic and translational levels. As well as the mode of action of stem cells in reversing the symptoms not being clear, there are several clinical parameters that need to be addressed before establishing stem cell therapy in stroke, such as the type of stem cells to be administered, the number of stem cells, the timing of dosage, whether dose-boosters are required, the route of administration, etc. There are upcoming prospects of cell-free therapy also by using exosomes derived from stem cells. There are several ongoing pre-clinical studies aiming to answer these questions. Despite still being in the development stage, stem cell therapy holds great potential for neurological rehabilitation in patients suffering from stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effect of Directional Deep Brain Stimulation on Sensory Thresholds in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00217</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00217</link>
	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Previous studies showed that deep brain stimulation (DBS) relieves pain symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD) patients when programmed for motor-symptom relief. One factor involved in pain processing is sensory perception of stimuli. With the advent of directional leads, we explore whether directional DBS affects quantitative sensory testing (QST) metrics acutely.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;PD patients with subthalamic (STN) DBS and directional leads were tested in 5 settings (DBS-OFF, DBS-ON with omnidirectional stimulation, and DBS-ON) for each of three directional segments of contact used for clinical programming. The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) assessed patient’s motor skills at time of study visit at clinical contact and at contact which produced optimal sensory threshold (defined by the greatest tolerance to mechanical stimuli). Correlation analyses were performed between stimulation parameters [amplitude, frequency, pulse width (PW), total electrical energy delivered (TEED)] and outcome metrics.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Sensory thresholds were obtained in nine patients. Directional stimulation did not significantly alter patient perceptions of sensory stimulus [cold pain (p = 0.69), warm pain (p = 0.99), Von frey fibers (p = 0.09), pin-prick (p = 0.88), vibration (p = 0.40), pressure (p = 0.98)]. With correlation analysis, increasing PW at the posterior contact increased pin prick and vibration sensitivity (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Additionally, an increase in TEED caused a decrease in sensitivity to warm detection when using the anterior (p = 0.04), lateral (p = 0.02), and medial contacts (p = 0.03), and also caused a decrease in sensitivity to cold detection when using the medial contact (p = 0.03). UPDRS-III remained stable during testing.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Motor benefit can be acutely maintained at directional contacts, whereas directional stimulation can modulate thermal and mechanical sensitivity. Further investigation will determine whether these changes are maintained chronically or can be improved with optimized programming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Identifying the Epileptogenic Zone With the Relative Strength of High-Frequency Oscillation: A Stereoelectroencephalography Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00186</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00186</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;High-frequency oscillation (HFO) represents a promising biomarker of epileptogenicity. However, the significant interindividual differences among patients limit its application in clinical practice. Here, we applied and evaluated an individualized, frequency-based approach of HFO analysis in stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) data for localizing the epileptogenic zones (EZs).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Clinical and SEEG data of 19 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy were retrospectively analyzed. The individualized spectral power of all signals recorded by electrode array, i.e., the relative strength of HFO, was computed with a wavelet method for each patient. Subsequently, the clinical value of the relative strength of HFO for identifying the EZ was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Focal increase in the relative strength of HFO in SEEG recordings were identified in all 19 patients. HFOs identified inside the clinically identified seizure onset zone had more spectral power than those identified outside (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and HFOs in 250–500 Hz band (fast ripples) seemed to be more specific identifying the EZ than in those in 80–250 Hz band (ripples) (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The resection of brain regions generating HFOs resulted in a favorable seizure outcome in 17 patients (17/19; 89.5%), while in the cases of other patients with poor outcomes, the brain regions generating HFOs were not removed completely.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The relative strength of HFO, especially fast ripples, is a promising effective biomarker for identifying the EZ and can lead to a favorable seizure outcome if used to guide epilepsy surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neuro-Immunity Controls Obesity-Induced Pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00181</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00181</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of obesity skyrocketed over the past decades to become a significant public health problem. Obesity is recognized as a low-grade inflammatory disease and is linked with several comorbidities such as diabetes, circulatory disease, common neurodegenerative diseases, as well as chronic pain. Adipocytes are a major neuroendocrine organ that continually, and systemically, releases pro-inflammatory factors. While the exact mechanisms driving obesity-induced pain remain poorly defined, nociceptor hypersensitivity may result from the systemic state of inflammation characteristic of obesity as well as weight surplus-induced mechanical stress. Obesity and pain also share various genetic mutations, lifestyle risk factors, and metabolic pathways. For instance, fat pads are often found hyper-innervated and rich in immune cell types of multiple origins. These immunocytes release cytokines, amplifying nociceptor function, which, in turn, via locally released neuropeptides, sustain immunocytes’ function. Here, we posit that along with mechanical stress stemming from extra weight, the local neuro-immune interplay occurring within the fat pads maintains the state of chronic low-grade inflammation and heightens sensory hypersensitivity. Overall, stopping such harmful neuro-immune crosstalk may constitute a novel pathway to prevent obesity-associated comorbidities, including neuronal hypersensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Independent Low-Rank Matrix Analysis-Based Automatic Artifact Reduction Technique Applied to Three BCI Paradigms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00173</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00173</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can potentially enable people to non-invasively and directly communicate with others using brain activities. Artifacts generated from body activities (e.g., eyeblinks and teeth clenches) often contaminate EEGs and make EEG-based classification/identification hard. Although independent component analysis (ICA) is the gold-standard technique for attenuating the effects of such contamination, the estimated independent components are still mixed with artifactual and neuronal information because ICA relies only on the independence assumption. The same problem occurs when using independent vector analysis (IVA), an extended ICA method. To solve this problem, we designed an independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA)-based automatic artifact reduction technique that clearly models sources from observations under the independence assumption and a low-rank nature in the frequency domain. For automatic artifact reduction, we combined the signal separation technique with an independent component classifier for EEGs named ICLabel. To assess the comparative efficiency of the proposed method, the discriminabilities of artifact-reduced EEGs using ICA, IVA, and ILRMA were determined using an open-access EEG dataset named OpenBMI, which contains EEG data obtained through three BCI paradigms [motor-imagery (MI), event-related potential (ERP), and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)]. BCI performances were obtained using these three paradigms after applying artifact reduction techniques, and the results suggested that our proposed method has the potential to achieve higher discriminability than ICA and IVA for BCIs. In addition, artifact reduction using the ILRMA approach clearly improved (by over 70%) the averaged BCI performances using artifact-reduced data sufficiently for most needs of the BCI community. The extension of ICA families to supervised separation that leaves the discriminative ability would further improve the usability of BCIs for real-life environments in which artifacts frequently contaminate EEGs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Common Principles in Functional Organization of VIP/Calretinin Cell-Driven Disinhibitory Circuits Across Cortical Areas</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00032</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the brain, there is a vast diversity of different structures, circuitries, cell types, and cellular genetic expression profiles. While this large diversity can often occlude a clear understanding of how the brain works, careful analyses of analogous studies performed across different brain areas can hint at commonalities in neuronal organization. This in turn can yield a fundamental understanding of necessary circuitry components that are crucial for how information is processed across the brain. In this review, we outline recent in vivo and in vitro studies that have been performed in different cortical areas to characterize the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)- and/or calretinin (CR)-expressing cells that specialize in inhibiting GABAergic interneurons. In doing so, we make the case that, across cortical structures, interneuron-specific cells commonly specialize in the synaptic disinhibition of excitatory neurons, which can ungate the integration and plasticity of external inputs onto excitatory neurons. In line with this, activation of interneuron- specific cells enhances animal performance across a variety of behavioral tasks that involve learning, memory formation, and sensory discrimination, and may represent a key target for therapeutic interventions under different pathological conditions. As such, interneuron-specific cells across different cortical structures are an essential network component for information processing and normal brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Neurophotonics Approaches for the Study of Pattern Separation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00026</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Successful memory involves not only remembering over time but also keeping memories distinct. Computational models suggest that pattern separation appears as a highly efficient process to discriminate between overlapping memories. Furthermore, lesion studies have shown that the dentate gyrus (DG) participates in pattern separation. However, these manipulations did not allow identifying the neuronal mechanism underlying pattern separation. The development of different neurophotonics techniques, together with other genetic tools, has been useful for the study of the microcircuit involved in this process. It has been shown that less-overlapped information would generate distinct neuronal representations within the granule cells (GCs). However, because glutamatergic or GABAergic cells in the DG are not functionally or structurally homogeneous, identifying the specific role of the different subpopulations remains elusive. Then, understanding pattern separation requires the ability to manipulate a temporal and spatially specific subset of cells in the DG and ideally to analyze DG cells activity in individuals performing a pattern separation dependent behavioral task. Thus, neurophotonics and calcium imaging techniques in conjunction with activity-dependent promoters and high-resolution microscopy appear as important tools for this endeavor. In this work, we review how different neurophotonics techniques have been implemented in the elucidation of a neuronal network that supports pattern separation alone or in combination with traditional techniques. We discuss the limitation of these techniques and how other neurophotonic techniques could be used to complement the advances presented up to this date.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Sialylation and Galectin-3 in Microglia-Mediated Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00162</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are brain macrophages that mediate neuroinflammation and contribute to and protect against neurodegeneration. The terminal sugar residue of all glycoproteins and glycolipids on the surface of mammalian cells is normally sialic acid, and addition of this negatively charged residue is known as “sialylation,” whereas removal by sialidases is known as “desialylation.” High sialylation of the neuronal cell surface inhibits microglial phagocytosis of such neurons, via: (i) activating sialic acid receptors (Siglecs) on microglia that inhibit phagocytosis and (ii) inhibiting binding of opsonins C1q, C3, and galectin-3. Microglial sialylation inhibits inflammatory activation of microglia via: (i) activating Siglec receptors CD22 and CD33 on microglia that inhibit phagocytosis and (ii) inhibiting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), complement receptor 3 (CR3), and other microglial receptors. When activated, microglia release a sialidase activity that desialylates both microglia and neurons, activating the microglia and rendering the neurons susceptible to phagocytosis. Activated microglia also release galectin-3 (Gal-3), which: (i) further activates microglia via binding to TLR4 and TREM2, (ii) binds to desialylated neurons opsonizing them for phagocytosis via Mer tyrosine kinase, and (iii) promotes Aβ aggregation and toxicity in vivo. Gal-3 and desialylation may increase in a variety of brain pathologies. Thus, Gal-3 and sialidases are potential treatment targets to prevent neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Differential Susceptibility and Vulnerability of Brain Cells in C57BL/6 Mouse to Mitochondrial Dysfunction Induced by Short-Term Cuprizone Exposure</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00030</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00030</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cuprizone (CPZ) is a chemical chelator toxic to mitochondria of cells. While inducing oligodendrocyte (OL) loss and demyelination, CPZ caused no fatal damage to the other brain cells (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia) in previous studies, suggesting differential susceptibility and vulnerability of brain cells to the CPZ intoxication. To demonstrate this interpretation, C57BL/6 mice were fed rodent chow without or with CPZ (0.2%, w/w) for 7 days. One day later, mitochondrial function of brain cells was assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS) and biochemical analysis. Another batch of mice were processed to localize the CPZ-induced damage to mitochondrial DNA, label brain cells, and identify apoptotic cells. Compared to controls, CPZ-exposed mice showed significantly lower levels of N-acetyl-L-aspartate, phosphocreatine, and ATP detected by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction in brain cells. Susceptibility analysis showed an order of OLs, microglia, and astrocytes from high to low, in terms of the proportion of 8-OHdG labeled cells in each type of these cells in corpus callosum. Vulnerability analysis showed the highest proportion of caspase-3 positive cells in labeled OLs in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, where neurons showed no caspase-3 labeling, but the highest proportion of 8-OHdG labeling, indicating a lowest vulnerability but highest susceptibility to CPZ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Immature OLs, microglia, and astrocytes showed adaptive changes in proliferation and activation in response to CPZ-exposure. These data for the first time demonstrated the CPZ-induced mitochondria dysfunction in brain cells of living mouse and specified the differential susceptibility and vulnerability of brain cells to the CPZ intoxication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Neurexin and Neuroligins Maintain the Balance of Ghost and Satellite Boutons at the Drosophila Neuromuscular Junction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00019</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurexins and neuroligins are common synaptic adhesion molecules that are associated with autism and interact with each other in the synaptic cleft. The Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) bouton is a well-known model system in neuroscience, and ghost and satellite boutons, respectively, indicate the poor development and overgrowth of the NMJ boutons. However, the Drosophila neurexin (DNrx) and Drosophila neuroligins (DNlgs) are mainly observed in type Ib boutons, indicating the ultrastructural and developmental phenotypes of the Drosophila NMJ. Here, we identified the ultrastructural and developmental features of ghost and satellite boutons by utilizing dneurexin (dnrx) and dneuroligins (dnlgs) fly mutants and other associated fly strains. Ghost boutons contain synaptic vesicles with multiple diameters but very rarely contain T-bar structures and swollen or thin subsynaptic reticulum (SSR) membranes. The muscle cell membrane is invaginated at different sites, stretches to the ghost bouton from different directions, forms several layers that enwrap the ghost bouton, and then branches into the complex SSR. Satellite boutons share a common SSR membrane and present either a typical profile in which a main bouton is encircled by small boutons or two atypical profiles in which the small boutons are grouped together or distributed in beads without a main bouton. Electron and confocal microscopy data showed that dnrx, dnlg1, dnlg2, dnlg3, and dnlg4 mutations led to ghost boutons; the overexpression of dnrx, dnlg1, dnlg2, dnlg3, and dnlg4 led to satellite boutons; and the dnlg2;dnlg3 double mutation also led to satellite boutons. These results suggested that DNrx and DNlgs jointly maintain the development and function of NMJ boutons by regulating the balance of ghost and satellite boutons in Drosophila.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Dependent Heterogeneity of Murine Olfactory Bulb Astrocytes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes have a high impact on the structure of the central nervous system, as they control neural activity, development, and plasticity. Heterogeneity of astrocytes has been shown before, but so far only a few studies have demonstrated heterogeneous morphology of astrocytes concerning aging. In this study, we examined morphologic differences of astrocyte subpopulations in adult mice and the progression of these differences with age. We surveyed astrocytes in olfactory bulb slices of mice aged 3 months, 1 year and 2 years (three animals each age group), based on their appearance in anti-GFAP immunostaining. Based on this data we established three different types of astrocytes: type I (stellate), type II (elliptic), and type III (squid-like). We found that with the advanced age of the mice, astrocytes grow in size and complexity. Major changes occurred between the ages of 3 months and 1 year, while between 1 and 2 years no significant development in cell size and complexity could be detected. Our results show that astrocytes in the olfactory bulb are heterogeneous and undergo morphological transformation until late adolescence but not upon senescence. Structural plasticity is further substantiated by the expression of vimentin in some astrocyte processes in all age groups.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)- associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) is a disease of neurologic impairment that involves mechanisms of damage similar to other degenerative neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In the current era of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-1 replication is well-suppressed, and yet, HIV-1-infected patients still have high levels of chronic inflammation, indicating that factors other than viral replication are contributing to the development of neurocognitive impairment in these patients. The underlying mechanisms of HAND are still unknown, but the HIV-1 protein, Tat, has been highlighted as a potential viral product that contributes to the development of cognitive impairment. In AD, the presence of senescent cells in the CNS has been discussed as a contributing factor to the progression of cognitive decline and may be a mechanism also involved in the development of HAND. This mini-review discusses the viral protein HIV-1 Tat, and its potential to induce senescence in the CNS, contributing to the development of HAND.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate the effect of telmisartan, rosuvastatin, or their combination on dementia and to understand the impact of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype on the effect of the medications in older patients with hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This is a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial using a 2 × 2 factorial design. Between April 2008 and November 2010, 1,244 hypertensive patients aged ≥60 years without cognitive impairment were recruited from communities in six cities in Shandong area, China. Patients were randomized into telmisartan and rosuvastatin administration after a 2-week washout period. APOE genotype was identified at the baseline. Possible dementia was determined using the combination of the global cognitive function and Assessment of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Over an average follow-up of 7 [interquartile range (IQR): 6.7–7.2] years, telmisartan and rosuvastatin significantly reduced the cognitive impairment progression and the incidence of dementia. There was a synergistic interaction between telmisartan and rosuvastatin to reduce the cognitive impairment and the incidence of dementia (P&lt;sub&gt;adjusted&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The cognitive impairment progression and the risk of dementia were higher in the hypertensive patients with APOE ε4 allele than in those without APOE ε4 allele. Rosuvastatin medication significantly alleviated the cognitive impairment progression and the risks of dementia in patients with APOE ε4 allele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The combination of telmisartan and rosuvastatin might be an effective prevention and/or treatment strategy for cognitive impairment and dementia, especially in hypertensive patients with the APOE ε4 allele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, ChiCTR.org.cn, identifier ChiCTR-IOR-17013557.

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Astrocyte Senescence and Alzheimer’s Disease: A Review</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes are the largest group of glial cells in the brain and participate in several essential functions of the central nervous system (CNS). Disruption of their normal physiological function can lead to metabolism disequilibrium and the pathology of CNS. As an important mechanism of aging, cellular senescence has been considered as a primary inducing factor of age-associated neurodegenerative disorders. Senescent astrocytes showed decreased normal physiological function and increased secretion of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors, which contribute to Aβ accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Astrocyte senescence also leads to a number of detrimental effects, including induced glutamate excitotoxicity, impaired synaptic plasticity, neural stem cell loss, and blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. In this review article, we have summarized the growing findings regarding astrocyte senescence and its putative role in the pathologic progress of AD. Additionally, we also focus on the significance of targeting astrocyte senescence as a novel and feasible therapeutic approach for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Dl-3-n-Butylphthalide Promotes Remyelination and Suppresses Inflammation by Regulating AMPK/SIRT1 and STAT3/NF-κB Signaling in Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Demyelination in vascular dementia (VD) is partly attributable to inflammation induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Remyelination contributes to the recovery of cognitive impairment by inducing the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. It was previously reported that Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) promotes cognitive improvement. However, whether NBP can stimulate remyelination and suppress inflammation after CCH remains unclear. To answer this question, the present study investigated the effects of NBP on remyelination in a rat model of CCH established by bilateral carotid artery occlusion. Functional recovery was evaluated with the Morris water maze (MWM) test, and myelin integrity, regeneration of mature oligodendrocytes, and inhibition of astrocyte proliferation were assessed by immunohistochemistry and histologic analysis. Additionally, activation of 5′ AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/Sirtuin (SIRT)1 and Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3/nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathways was evaluated by western blotting. The results showed that NBP treatment improved memory and learning performance in CCH rats, which was accompanied by increased myelin integrity and oligodendrocyte regeneration, and reduced astrocyte proliferation and inflammation. Additionally, NBP induced the activation of AMPK/SIRT1 signaling while inhibiting the STAT3/NF-κB pathway. These results indicate that NBP alleviates cognitive impairment following CCH by promoting remyelination and suppressing inflammation via modulation of AMPK/SIRT1 and STAT3/NF-κB signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58039</link>
	<description>GPCRs are increasingly recognized to initiate signaling via heterotrimeric G proteins as they move through the endocytic network, but little is known about how relevant G protein effectors are localized. Here we report selective trafficking of adenylyl cyclase type 9 (AC9) from the plasma membrane to endosomes while adenylyl cyclase type 1 (AC1) remains in the plasma membrane, and stimulation of AC9 trafficking by ligand-induced activation of Gs-coupled GPCRs. AC9 transits a similar, dynamin-dependent early endocytic pathway as ligand-activated GPCRs. However, unlike GPCR traffic control which requires β-arrestin but not Gs, AC9 traffic control requires Gs but not β-arrestin. We also show that AC9, but not AC1, mediates cAMP production stimulated by endogenous receptor activation in endosomes. These results reveal dynamic and isoform-specific trafficking of adenylyl cyclase in the endocytic network, and a discrete role of a heterotrimeric G protein in regulating the subcellular distribution of a relevant effector.</description>

	<title>eLife: The testis protein ZNF165 is a SMAD3 cofactor that coordinates oncogenic TGFβ signaling in triple-negative breast cancer</title>

	<description>Cancer/testis (CT) antigens are proteins whose expression is normally restricted to germ cells yet aberrantly activated in tumors, where their functions remain relatively cryptic. Here we report that ZNF165, a CT antigen frequently expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), associates with SMAD3 to modulate transcription of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-dependent genes and thereby promote growth and survival of human TNBC cells. In addition, we identify the KRAB zinc finger protein, ZNF446, and its associated tripartite motif protein, TRIM27, as obligate components of the ZNF165-SMAD3 complex that also support tumor cell viability. Importantly, we find that TRIM27 alone is necessary for ZNF165 transcriptional activity and is required for TNBC tumor growth &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;using an orthotopic xenograft model in immunocompromised mice. Our findings indicate that aberrant expression of a testis-specific transcription factor is sufficient to co-opt somatic transcriptional machinery to drive a pro-tumorigenic gene expression program in TNBC.</description>

	<title>eLife: An ECF-type transporter scavenges heme to overcome iron-limitation in Staphylococcus lugdunensis</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57322</link>
	<description>Energy-coupling factor type (ECF-transporters) represent trace nutrient acquisition systems. Substrate binding components of ECF-transporters are membrane proteins with extraordinary affinity, allowing them to scavenge trace amounts of ligand. A number of molecules have been described as substrates of ECF-transporters, but an involvement in iron-acquisition is unknown. Host-induced iron limitation during infection represents an effective mechanism to limit bacterial proliferation. We identified the iron-regulated ECF-transporter Lha in the opportunistic bacterial pathogen &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus lugdunensis&lt;/i&gt; and show that the transporter is specific for heme. The recombinant substrate-specific subunit LhaS accepted heme from diverse host-derived hemoproteins. Using isogenic mutants and recombinant expression of Lha, we demonstrate that its function is independent of the canonical heme acquisition system Isd and allows proliferation on human cells as sources of nutrient iron. Our findings reveal a unique strategy of nutritional heme acquisition and provide the first example of an ECF-transporter involved in overcoming host-induced nutritional limitation.</description>

	<title>eLife: Cohesion is established during DNA replication utilising chromosome associated cohesin rings as well as those loaded de novo onto nascent DNAs</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56611</link>
	<description>Sister chromatid cohesion essential for mitotic chromosome segregation is thought to involve the co-entrapment of sister DNAs within cohesin rings. Although cohesin can load onto chromosomes throughout the cell cycle, it only builds cohesion during S phase. A key question is whether cohesion is generated by conversion of cohesin complexes associated with un-replicated DNAs ahead of replication forks into cohesive structures behind them, or from nucleoplasmic cohesin that is loaded de novo onto nascent DNAs associated with forks, a process that would be dependent on cohesin’s Scc2 subunit. We show here that in &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, both mechanisms exist and that each requires a different set of replisome-associated proteins. Cohesion produced by cohesin conversion requires Tof1/Csm3, Ctf4 and Chl1 but not Scc2 while that created by Scc2-dependent de novo loading at replication forks requires the Ctf18-RFC complex. The association of specific replisome proteins with different types of cohesion establishment opens the way to a mechanistic understanding of an aspect of DNA replication unique to eukaryotic cells.</description>

	<title>eLife: Acute disruption of the synaptic vesicle membrane protein synaptotagmin 1 using knockoff in mouse hippocampal neurons</title>

	<description>The success of comparative cell biology for determining protein function relies on quality disruption techniques. Long-lived proteins, in postmitotic cells, are particularly difficult to eliminate. Moreover, cellular processes are notoriously adaptive; for example, neuronal synapses exhibit a high degree of plasticity. Ideally, protein disruption techniques should be both rapid and complete. Here, we describe knockoff, a generalizable method for the druggable control of membrane protein stability. We developed knockoff for neuronal use but show it also works in other cell types. Applying knockoff to synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1) results in acute disruption of this protein, resulting in loss of synchronous neurotransmitter release with a concomitant increase in the spontaneous release rate, measured optically. Thus, SYT1 is not only the proximal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor for fast neurotransmitter release but also serves to clamp spontaneous release. Additionally, knockoff can be applied to protein domains as we show for another synaptic vesicle protein, synaptophysin 1.</description>

	<description>In 2016, to address the historical overrepresentation of male subjects in biomedical research, the US National Institutes of Health implemented a policy requiring investigators to consider sex as a biological variable. In order to assess the impact of this policy, we conducted a bibliometric analysis across nine biological disciplines for papers published in 34 journals in 2019, and compared our results with those of a similar study carried out by Beery and Zucker in 2009. There was a significant increase in the proportion of studies that included both sexes across all nine disciplines, but in eight of the disciplines there was no change in the proportion studies that included data analyzed by sex. The majority of studies failed to provide rationale for single-sex studies or the lack of sex-based analyses, and those that did relied on misconceptions surrounding the hormonal variability of females. Together, these data demonstrate that while sex-inclusive research practices are more commonplace, there are still gaps in analyses and reporting of data by sex in many biological disciplines.</description>

	<title>eLife: Delineating the early transcriptional specification of the mammalian trachea and esophagus</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55526</link>
	<description>The genome-scale transcriptional programs that specify the mammalian trachea and esophagus are unknown. Though NKX2-1 and SOX2 are hypothesized to be co-repressive master regulators of tracheoesophageal fates, this is untested at a whole transcriptomic scale and their downstream networks remain unidentified. By combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with bulk RNA-sequencing of &lt;i&gt;Nkx2-1&lt;/i&gt; mutants and NKX2-1 ChIP-sequencing in mouse embryos, we delineate the NKX2-1 transcriptional program in tracheoesophageal specification, and discover that the majority of the tracheal and esophageal transcriptome is NKX2-1 independent. To decouple the NKX2-1 transcriptional program from regulation by SOX2, we interrogate the expression of newly-identified tracheal and esophageal markers in &lt;i&gt;Sox2&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Nkx2-1&lt;/i&gt; compound mutants. Finally, we discover that NKX2-1 binds directly to &lt;i&gt;Shh&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wnt7b&lt;/i&gt; and regulates their expression to control mesenchymal specification to cartilage and smooth muscle, coupling epithelial identity with mesenchymal specification. These findings create a new framework for understanding early tracheoesophageal fate specification at the genome-wide level.</description>

	<description>Defensive system activation promotes heightened perception of threat signals, and excessive attention to threat signals has been discussed as a contributory factor in the etiology of anxiety disorders. However, a mechanistic account of attentional modulation during fear-relevant processes, especially during fear generalization remains elusive. To test the hypothesis that social fear generalization prompts sharpened tuning in the visuocortical representation of social threat cues, 67 healthy participants underwent differential fear conditioning, followed by a generalization test in which participants viewed faces varying in similarity with the threat-associated face. We found that generalization of social threat sharpens visuocortical tuning of social threat cues, whereas ratings of fearfulness showed generalization, linearly decreasing with decreasing similarity to the threat-associated face. Moreover, individuals who reported greater anxiety in social situations also showed heightened sharpened tuning of visuocortical neurons to facial identity cues, indicating the behavioral relevance of visuocortical tuning during generalization learning.</description>

	<title>eLife: Activin A forms a non-signaling complex with ACVR1 and type II Activin/BMP receptors via its finger 2 tip loop</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54582</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54582</link>
	<description>Activin A functions in BMP signaling in two ways: it either engages ACVR1B to activate Smad2/3 signaling or binds ACVR1 to form a non-signaling complex (NSC). Although the former property has been studied extensively, the roles of the NSC remain unexplored. The genetic disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) provides a unique window into ACVR1/Activin A signaling because in that disease Activin can either signal through FOP-mutant ACVR1 or form NSCs with wild type ACVR1. To explore the role of the NSC, we generated 'agonist-only' Activin A muteins that activate ACVR1B but cannot form the NSC with ACVR1. Using one of these muteins we demonstrate that failure to form the NSC in FOP results in more severe disease pathology. These results provide the first evidence for a biological role for the NSC &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and pave the way for further exploration of the NSC's physiological role in corresponding knock-in mice.</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53370</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53370</link>
	<description>The kisspeptin system is a central modulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in vertebrates. Its existence outside the vertebrate lineage remains largely unknown. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the kisspeptin system in the sea cucumber &lt;i&gt;Apostichopus japonicus.&lt;/i&gt; The gene encoding the kisspeptin precursor generates two mature neuropeptides, AjKiss1a and AjKiss1b. The receptors for these neuropeptides, AjKissR1 and AjKissR2, are strongly activated by synthetic &lt;i&gt;A. japonicus&lt;/i&gt; and vertebrate kisspeptins, triggering a rapid intracellular mobilization of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, followed by receptor internalization. AjKissR1 and AjKissR2 share similar intracellular signaling pathways via G&lt;sub&gt;αq&lt;/sub&gt;/PLC/PKC/MAPK cascade, when activated by C-terminal decapeptide. The &lt;i&gt;A. japonicus&lt;/i&gt; kisspeptin system functions in multiple tissues that are closely related to seasonal reproduction and metabolism. Overall, our findings uncover for the first time the existence and function of the kisspeptin system in a non-chordate species and provide new evidence to support the ancient origin of intracellular signaling and physiological functions that are mediated by this molecular system.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53367</link>
	<description>The identification of clinically viable strategies for overcoming resistance to platinum chemotherapy in lung adenocarcinoma has previously been hampered by inappropriately tailored in vitro assays of drug response. Therefore, using a pulse model that closely mimics the in vivo pharmacokinetics of platinum therapy, we profiled cisplatin-induced signalling, DNA-damage and apoptotic responses across a panel of human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. By coupling this data to real-time, single-cell imaging of cell cycle and apoptosis we provide a fine-grained stratification of response, where a P70S6K-mediated signalling axis promotes resistance on a &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; wildtype or null background, but not a mutant &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; background. This finding highlights the value of in vitro models that match the physiological pharmacokinetics of drug exposure. Furthermore, it also demonstrates the importance of a mechanistic understanding of the interplay between somatic mutations and the signalling networks that govern drug response for the implementation of any consistently effective, patient-specific therapy.</description>

	<title>eLife: Squalene-based adjuvants stimulate CD8 T cell, but not antibody responses, through a RIPK3-dependent pathway</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52687</link>
	<description>The squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion (SE) vaccine adjuvant MF59 has been administered to more than 100 million people in more than 30 countries, in both seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. Despite its wide use and efficacy, its mechanisms of action remains unclear. In this study we demonstrate that immunization of mice with MF59 or its mimetic AddaVax (AV) plus soluble antigen results in robust antigen-specific antibody and CD8 T cell responses in lymph nodes and non-lymphoid tissues. Immunization triggered rapid RIPK3-kinase dependent necroptosis in the lymph node which peaked at 6 hours, followed by a sequential wave of apoptosis. Immunization with alum plus antigen did not induce RIPK3 kinase-dependent signaling. RIPK3-dependent signaling induced by MF59 or AV was essential for cross-presentation of antigen to CD8&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;T cells by Batf3-dependent CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DCs. Consistent with this, RIPK3-kinase deficient or Batf3 deficient mice were impaired in their ability to mount adjuvant-enhanced CD8&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;T cell responses. However, CD8 T cell responses were unaffected in mice deficient in MLKL, a downstream mediator of necroptosis. Surprisingly, antibody responses were unaffected in RIPK3-kinase or Batf3 deficient mice. In contrast, antibody responses were impaired by in vivo administration of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, but normal in caspase-1 deficient mice, suggesting a contribution from apoptotic caspases, in the induction of antibody responses. These results demonstrate that squalene-based vaccine adjuvants induce antigen-specific CD8 T cell and antibody responses, through RIPK3-dependent and-independent pathways, respectively.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51735</link>
	<description>Myelin destruction is followed by resident glia activation and mobilization of endogenous progenitors (OPC) which participate in myelin repair. Here we show that in response to demyelination, mature oligodendrocytes (OLG) bordering the lesion express Ndst1, a key enzyme for heparan sulfates (HS) synthesis. Ndst1+ OLG form a belt that demarcates lesioned from intact white matter. Mice with selective inactivation of Ndst1 in the OLG lineage display increased lesion size, sustained microglia and OPC reactivity. HS production around the lesion allows Sonic hedgehog (Shh) binding and favors the local enrichment of this morphogen involved in myelin regeneration. In MS patients, Ndst1 is also found overexpressed in oligodendroglia and the number of Ndst1-expressing oligodendroglia is inversely correlated with lesion size and positively correlated with remyelination potential. Our study suggests that mature OLG surrounding demyelinated lesions are not passive witnesses but contribute to protection and regeneration by producing HS.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51140</link>
	<description>Cells in the hippocampus tuned to spatial location (place cells) typically change their tuning when an animal changes context, a phenomenon known as remapping. A fundamental challenge to understanding remapping is the fact that what counts as a ‘‘context change’’ has never been precisely defined. Furthermore, different remapping phenomena have been classified on the basis of how much the tuning changes after different types and degrees of context change, but the relationship between these variables is not clear. We address these ambiguities by formalizing remapping in terms of hidden state inference. According to this view, remapping does not directly reflect objective, observable properties of the environment, but rather subjective beliefs about the hidden state of the environment. We show how the hidden state framework can resolve a number of puzzles about the nature of remapping.</description>

	<title>eLife: Modulation of dopamine D1 receptors via histamine H3 receptors is a novel therapeutic target for Huntington's disease</title>

	<description>Early Huntington’s disease (HD) include over-activation of dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R), producing an imbalance in dopaminergic neurotransmission and cell death. To reduce D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R over-activation, we present a strategy based on targeting complexes of D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R and histamine H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R). Using an HD mouse striatal cell model and HD mouse organotypic brain slices we found that D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R-induced cell death signaling and neuronal degeneration, are mitigated by an H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist. We demonstrate that the D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R-H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R heteromer is expressed in HD mice at early but not late stages of HD, correlating with HD progression. In accordance, we found this target expressed in human control subjects and low-grade HD patients. Finally, treatment of HD mice with an H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist prevented cognitive and motor learning deficits and the loss of heteromer expression. Taken together, our results indicate that D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R - H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R heteromers play a pivotal role in dopamine signaling and represent novel targets for treating HD.</description>

	<description>Using high-resolution calcium imaging and machine learning techniques, Stefanini et al. studied how information about position, direction of motion, and speed is represented in the hippocampus. They show that neurons cooperate to encode this information, and that cells with easily interpretable responses are not necessarily the most important ones.</description>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)30724-5?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Lo et al. demonstrate that PRMT8 is localized at neuronal synapses and methylates the dendritic RNA-binding protein G3BP1. This promotes synapse maturation by regulating Rac1 and synaptic actin dynamics. Therefore, arginine methylation, a well-known protein modification in the nucleus, also acts in dendrites to control neuronal development.</description>

	<description>Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) preferentially originates from ER-negative luminal stem/progenitor cells (LSPCs). Christin et al. show that the transcription factor SOX9 acts as a key regulator for these LSPCs. Inactivation of BLBC tumor suppressors co-opt SOX9 upregulation to promote luminal-basal reprogramming and tumor progression.</description>

	<description>Jackson-Weaver et al. show that PRMT1 drives epicardial invasion and differentiation in heart development. PRMT1 regulates splicing of Mdm4 and decreases p53 stability, which enhances Slug degradation to block epicardial EMT. The PRMT1-p53 axis is required for epicardial invasion and formation of epicardial-derived lineages during development.</description>

	<description>Jones and Sheets show that a nerve injury model of chronic pain produces distinct changes to separate, but major, subclasses of GABAergic neurons in the prelimbic cortex. These changes are different between male and female mice and provide insight into how chronic pain alters brain circuits in a sex-specific manner.</description>

	<description>Nyitrai et al. show that the small GTPase Rab6 is associated with mobile axonal cargo. ELKS1 is a broadly distributed presynaptic protein that captures cargo via binding to Rab6. Hence, nerve terminals have adapted a Golgin-like mechanism for vesicle capture and have spatially separated capture from exocytotic sites for regulation.</description>

	<description>Gök et al. comprehensively define the cellular control and molecular consequences of NCX1 palmitoylation. They identify the binding site for the endogenous XIP domain in the NCX1 regulatory loop and demonstrate that, by changing XIP binding to this site, palmitoylation controls NCX1-mediated transmembrane Ca flux and hence cytosolic Ca levels.</description>

	<description>Neuronal network dysfunction is a hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD). However, the underlying pathomechanisms remain unknown. We analyzed the hippocampal micronetwork in a rat model of AD at an early disease stage at the beginning of extracellular amyloid beta (A{beta}) deposition. We established two-photon Ca2+-imaging in vivo in the hippocampus of rats and found hyperactivity of CA1 neurons. Patch-clamp recordings in brain slices in vitro revealed changes in the passive properties and intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, we observed increased neuronal input resistance and prolonged action potential width in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Surprisingly, all parameters measured to quantify synaptic inhibition and excitation onto CA1 pyramidal neurons were intact suggesting a cell immanent deficit. Our data support the view that altered intrinsic excitability of CA1 neurons may precede inhibitory dysfunction at an early stage of disease progression.</description>

	<description>The dentate gyrus (DG) plays critical roles in cognitive functions such as learning, memory, and spatial coding, and its dysfunction is implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders. However, it remains largely unknown how information is represented in this region. Here, we recorded neuronal activity in the DG using Ca2+ imaging in freely moving mice and analysed this activity using machine learning. Although each individual neuron was weakly and diversely tuned to multiple information types, the activity patterns of populations of DG neurons enabled us to successfully decode position, speed, and motion direction in an open field as well as current and future location in a T-maze. In CaMKII heterozygous knockout mice, which have deficits in spatial learning and working memory, the decoding accuracy of position in the open field and future location in the T-maze were selectively reduced. These results suggest that multiple types of information are diffusely and independently distributed in DG neurons.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Convergence of distinct subpopulations of mechanosensory neurons onto a neural circuit that elicits grooming</title>

	<description>Diverse subpopulations of mechanosensory neurons detect different mechanical forces and influence behavior. How these subpopulations connect with central circuits to influence behavior remains an important area of study. We previously discovered a neural circuit that elicits grooming of the Drosophila melanogaster antennae that is activated by an antennal mechanosensory chordotonal organ, the Johnstons organ (JO) (Hampel et al., 2015). Here, we describe anatomically and physiologically distinct JO mechanosensory neuron subpopulations and define how they interface with the circuit that elicits antennal grooming. We show that the subpopulations project to distinct zones in the brain and differ in their responses to mechanical stimulation of the antennae. Each subpopulation elicits grooming through direct synaptic connections with a single interneuron in the circuit, the dendrites of which span the different mechanosensory afferent projection zones. Thus, distinct JO subpopulations converge onto the same neural circuit to elicit a common behavioral response.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Attention differentially affects acoustic and phonetic feature encoding in a multispeaker environment.</title>

	<description>Humans have the remarkable ability to selectively focus on a single talker in the midst of other competing talkers. The neural mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon remain incompletely understood. In particular, there has been longstanding debate over whether attention operates at an early or late stage in the speech processing hierarchy. One way to better understand this is to examine how attention might differentially affect neurophysiological indices of hierarchical acoustic and linguistic speech representations. In this study, we do this by using encoding models to identify neural correlates of speech processing at various levels of representation. Specifically, using EEG recorded during a &quot;cocktail party&quot; attention experiment, we show that phonetic feature processing is evident for attended, but not unattended speech. Furthermore, we show that attention specifically enhances isolated indices of phonetic feature processing, but that such attention effects are not apparent for isolated measures of acoustic processing. These results provide new insights into the effects of attention on different pre-lexical representations of speech, insights that complement recent anatomical accounts of the hierarchical encoding of attended speech. Furthermore, our findings support the notion that - for attended speech - phonetic features are processed as a distinct stage, separate from the processing of the speech acoustics.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Non-canonical RNA-DNA differences and other human genomic features are enriched within very short tandem repeats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007968</guid>

Very short tandem repeats bear substantial genetic, evolutional, and pathological significance in genome analyses. Here, we compiled a census of tandem mono-nucleotide/di-nucleotide/tri-nucleotide repeats (MNRs/DNRs/TNRs) in GRCh38, which we term “polytracts” in general. Of the human genome, 144.4 million nucleotides (4.7%) are occupied by polytracts, and 0.47 million single nucleotides are identified as polytract hinges, i.e., break-points of tandem polytracts. Preliminary exploration of the census suggested polytract hinge sites and boundaries of AAC polytracts may bear a higher mapping error rate than other polytract regions. Further, we revealed landscapes of polytract enrichment with respect to nearly a hundred genomic features. We found MNRs, DNRs, and TNRs displayed noticeable difference in terms of locational enrichment for miscellaneous genomic features, especially RNA editing events. Non-canonical and C-to-U RNA-editing events are enriched inside and/or adjacent to MNRs, while all categories of RNA-editing events are under-represented in DNRs. A-to-I RNA-editing events are generally under-represented in polytracts. The selective enrichment of non-canonical RNA-editing events within MNR adjacency provides a negative evidence against their authenticity. To enable similar locational enrichment analyses in relation to polytracts, we developed a software Polytrap which can handle 11 reference genomes. Additionally, we compiled polytracts of four model organisms into a Tract Hub which can be integrated into USCS Genome Browser as an official track for convenient visualization of polytracts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TC2yPlj2Td4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Measurable health effects associated with the daylight saving time shift</title>

The transition to daylight saving time (DST) is beneficial for energy conservation but at the same time it has been reported to increase the risk of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular problems. Here, we evaluate the effect of the DST shift on a whole spectrum of diseases—an analysis we hope will be helpful in weighing the risks and benefits of DST shifts. Our study relied on a population-based, cross-sectional analysis of the IBM Watson Health MarketScan insurance claim dataset, which incorporates over 150 million unique patients in the US, and the Swedish national inpatient register, which incorporates more than nine million unique Swedes. For hundreds of sex- and age-specific diseases, we assessed effects of the DST shifts forward and backward by one hour in spring and autumn by comparing the observed and expected diagnosis rates after DST shift exposure. We found four prominent, elevated risk clusters, including cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks), injuries, mental and behavioral disorders, and immune-related diseases such as noninfective enteritis and colitis to be significantly associated with DST shifts in the United States and Sweden. While the majority of disease risk elevations are modest (a few percent), a considerable number of diseases exhibit an approximately ten percent relative risk increase. We estimate that each spring DST shift is associated with negative health effects–with 150,000 incidences in the US, and 880,000 globally. We also identify for the first time a collection of diseases with relative risks that appear to decrease immediately after the spring DST shift, enriched with infections and immune system-related maladies. These diseases’ decreasing relative risks might be driven by the documented boosting effect of a short-term stress (such as that experienced around the spring DST shift) on the immune system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_88UCXPIUkI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;* algorithm provably approximates partition functions for a set of states (e.g., protein, ligand, and protein-ligand complex) to a user-specified accuracy &lt;i&gt;ε&lt;/i&gt;. Often, reaching an &lt;i&gt;ε&lt;/i&gt;-approximation for a particular set of partition functions takes a prohibitive amount of time and space. To alleviate some of this cost, we introduce two new algorithms into the osprey suite for protein design: fries, a Fast Removal of Inadequately Energied Sequences, and &lt;i&gt;EWAK&lt;/i&gt;*, an Energy Window Approximation to &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;*. fries pre-processes the sequence space to limit a design to only the most stable, energetically favorable sequence possibilities. &lt;i&gt;EWAK&lt;/i&gt;* then takes this pruned sequence space as input and, using a user-specified energy window, calculates &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;* scores using the lowest energy conformations. We expect fries/&lt;i&gt;EWAK&lt;/i&gt;* to be most useful in cases where there are many unstable sequences in the design sequence space and when users are satisfied with enumerating the low-energy ensemble of conformations. In combination, these algorithms provably retain calculational accuracy while limiting the input sequence space and the conformations included in each partition function calculation to only the most energetically favorable, effectively reducing runtime while still enriching for desirable sequences. This combined approach led to significant speed-ups compared to the previous state-of-the-art multi-sequence algorithm, &lt;i&gt;BBK&lt;/i&gt;*, while maintaining its efficiency and accuracy, which we show across 40 different protein systems and a total of 2,826 protein design problems. Additionally, as a proof of concept, we used these new algorithms to redesign the protein-protein interface (PPI) of the c-Raf-RBD:KRas complex. The Ras-binding domain of the protein kinase c-Raf (c-Raf-RBD) is the tightest known binder of KRas, a protein implicated in difficult-to-treat cancers. fries/&lt;i&gt;EWAK&lt;/i&gt;* accurately retrospectively predicted the effect of 41 different sets of mutations in the PPI of the c-Raf-RBD:KRas complex. Notably, these mutations include mutations whose effect had previously been incorrectly predicted using other computational methods. Next, we used fries/&lt;i&gt;EWAK&lt;/i&gt;* for prospective design and discovered a novel point mutation that improves binding of c-Raf-RBD to KRas in its active, GTP-bound state (KRas&lt;sup&gt;GTP&lt;/sup&gt;). We combined this new mutation with two previously reported mutations (which were highly-ranked by osprey) to create a new variant of c-Raf-RBD, c-Raf-RBD(RKY). fries/&lt;i&gt;EWAK&lt;/i&gt;* in osprey computationally predicted that this new variant binds even more tightly than the previous best-binding variant, c-Raf-RBD(RK). We measured the binding affinity of c-Raf-RBD(RKY) using a bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assay, and found that this new variant exhibits single-digit nanomolar affinity for KRas&lt;sup&gt;GTP&lt;/sup&gt;, confirming the computational predictions made with fries/&lt;i&gt;EWAK&lt;/i&gt;*. This new variant binds roughly five times more tightly than the previous best known binder and roughly 36 times more tightly than the design starting point (wild-type c-Raf-RBD). This study steps through the advancement and development of computational protein design by presenting theory, new algorithms, accurate retrospective designs, new prospective designs, and biochemical validation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pDB664ObOSc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The genetic adaptation of humans to the consumption of milk from dairying animals is one of the most emblematic cases of recent human evolution. While the phenotypic change under selection, lactase persistence (LP), is known, the evolutionary advantage conferred to persistent individuals remains obscure. One informative but underappreciated observation is that not all populations whose ancestors had access to milk genetically adapted to become lactase persistent. Indeed, Central Asian herders are mostly lactase nonpersistent, despite their significant dietary reliance on dairy products. Investigating the temporal dynamic of the −13.910:C&amp;gt;T Eurasian mutation associated with LP, we found that, after its emergence in Ukraine 5,960 before present (BP), the T allele spread between 4,000 BP and 3,500 BP throughout Eurasia, from Spain to Kazakhstan. The timing and geographical progression of the mutation coincides well with the migration of steppe populations across and outside of Europe. After 3,000 BP, the mutation strongly increased in frequency in Europe, but not in Asia. We propose that Central Asian herders have adapted to milk consumption culturally, by fermentation, and/or by colonic adaptation, rather than genetically. Given the possibility of a nongenetic adaptation to avoid intestinal symptoms when consuming dairy products, the puzzle then becomes this: why has LP been selected for at all?&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vh1UQAS97XI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Is an artificial limb embodied as a hand? Brain decoding in prosthetic limb users</title>

The potential ability of the human brain to represent an artificial limb as a body part (embodiment) has been inspiring engineers, clinicians, and scientists as a means to optimise human–machine interfaces. Using functional MRI (fMRI), we studied whether neural embodiment actually occurs in prosthesis users’ occipitotemporal cortex (OTC). Compared with controls, different prostheses types were visually represented more similarly to each other, relative to hands and tools, indicating the emergence of a dissociated prosthesis categorisation. Greater daily life prosthesis usage correlated positively with greater prosthesis categorisation. Moreover, when comparing prosthesis users’ representation of their own prosthesis to controls’ representation of a similar looking prosthesis, prosthesis users represented their own prosthesis more dissimilarly to hands, challenging current views of visual prosthesis embodiment. Our results reveal a use-dependent neural correlate for wearable technology adoption, demonstrating adaptive use–related plasticity within the OTC. Because these neural correlates were independent of the prostheses’ appearance and control, our findings offer new opportunities for prosthesis design by lifting restrictions imposed by the embodiment theory for artificial limbs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/H1ArChGLDVo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Lymphatic filariasis (LF) afflicts over 60 million people worldwide and leads to severe pathological outcomes in chronic cases. The nematode parasites (Nematoda: Filarioidea) that cause LF require both arthropod (mosquito) intermediate hosts and mammalian definitive hosts for their propagation. The invasion and migration of filarial worms through host tissues are complex and critical to survival, yet little is known about the receptors and signaling pathways that mediate directed migration in these medically important species. In order to better understand the role of chemosensory signaling in filarial worm taxis, we employ comparative genomics, transcriptomics, reverse genetics, and chemical approaches to identify putative chemosensory receptor proteins and perturb chemotaxis phenotypes in filarial worms. We find that chemoreceptor family size is correlated with the presence of environmental (extrahost) stages in nematode life cycles, and that filarial worms contain compact and highly diverged chemoreceptor complements and lineage-specific ion channels that are predicted to operate downstream of chemoreceptor activation. In &lt;i&gt;Brugia malayi&lt;/i&gt;, an etiological agent of LF, chemoreceptor expression patterns correspond to distinct parasite migration events across the life cycle. To interrogate the role of chemosensation in the migration of larval worms, arthropod and mammalian infectious stage &lt;i&gt;Brugia&lt;/i&gt; parasites were incubated in nicotinamide, an agonist of the nematode transient receptor potential (TRP) channel OSM-9. Exposure of microfilariae to nicotinamide alters intramosquito migration, and exposure of L3s reduces chemotaxis toward host-associated cues in vitro. Nicotinamide also potently modulates thermosensory responses in L3s, suggesting a polymodal sensory role for &lt;i&gt;Brugia osm-9&lt;/i&gt;. Reverse genetic studies implicate both &lt;i&gt;Brugia osm-9&lt;/i&gt; and the cyclic nucleotide–gated (CNG) channel subunit &lt;i&gt;tax-4&lt;/i&gt; in larval chemotaxis toward host serum, and these ion channel subunits partially rescue sensory defects in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans osm-9&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;tax-4&lt;/i&gt; knock-out strains. Together, these data reveal genetic and functional diversification of chemosensory signaling proteins in filarial worms and encourage a more thorough investigation of clade- and parasite-specific facets of nematode sensory receptor biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8K0z3sNB4sE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) infections, such as those responsible for the current severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, cause grave international public health concern. In infected cells, the CoV RNA-synthesizing machinery associates with modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes that are transformed into the viral replication organelle (RO). Although double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) appear to be a pan-CoV RO element, studies to date describe an assortment of additional CoV-induced membrane structures. Despite much speculation, it remains unclear which RO element(s) accommodate viral RNA synthesis. Here we provide detailed 2D and 3D analyses of CoV ROs and show that diverse CoVs essentially induce the same membrane modifications, including the small open double-membrane spherules (DMSs) previously thought to be restricted to gamma- and delta-CoV infections and proposed as sites of replication. Metabolic labeling of newly synthesized viral RNA followed by quantitative electron microscopy (EM) autoradiography revealed abundant viral RNA synthesis associated with DMVs in cells infected with the beta-CoVs Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV and the gamma-CoV infectious bronchitis virus. RNA synthesis could not be linked to DMSs or any other cellular or virus-induced structure. Our results provide a unifying model of the CoV RO and clearly establish DMVs as the central hub for viral RNA synthesis and a potential drug target in CoV infection.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vq0kB884ydE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Poon, Tse Hsien Koh, Peter Bergman, Chwee Ming Lim, Lin-Fa Wang, Andrea Lay Hoon Kwa, Johan K. Sandberg, Edwin Leeansyah&lt;/p&gt;

Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are abundant antimicrobial T cells in humans and recognize antigens derived from the microbial riboflavin biosynthetic pathway presented by the MHC-Ib-related protein (MR1). However, the mechanisms responsible for MAIT cell antimicrobial activity are not fully understood, and the efficacy of these mechanisms against antibiotic resistant bacteria has not been explored. Here, we show that MAIT cells mediate MR1-restricted antimicrobial activity against &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; clinical strains in a manner dependent on the activity of cytolytic proteins but independent of production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or induction of apoptosis in infected cells. The combined action of the pore-forming antimicrobial protein granulysin and the serine protease granzyme B released in response to T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated recognition of MR1-presented antigen is essential to mediate control against both cell-associated and free-living, extracellular forms of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, MAIT cell-mediated bacterial control extends to multidrug-resistant &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; primary clinical isolates additionally resistant to carbapenems, a class of last resort antibiotics. Notably, high levels of granulysin and granzyme B in the MAIT cell secretomes directly damage bacterial cells by increasing their permeability, rendering initially resistant &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; susceptible to the bactericidal activity of carbapenems. These findings define the role of cytolytic effector proteins in MAIT cell-mediated antimicrobial activity and indicate that granulysin and granzyme B synergize to restore carbapenem bactericidal activity and overcome carbapenem resistance in &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LLLbEM92uH0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: SCN3A‐related neurodevelopmental disorder: A spectrum of epilepsy and brain malformation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25809?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25809?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;SCN3A &lt;/i&gt;, encoding the voltage‐gated sodium channel subunit Nav1.3, cause severe childhood‐onset epilepsy and malformation of cortical development. Here, we define the spectrum of clinical, genetic, and neuroimaging features of &lt;i&gt;SCN3A &lt;/i&gt;‐related neurodevelopmental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients were ascertained via an international collaborative network. We compared sodium channels containing wild‐type vs. variant Nav1.3 subunits co‐expressed with β1 and β2 subunits using whole‐cell voltage clamp electrophysiological recordings in a heterologous mammalian system (HEK‐293 T cells).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 22 patients with pathogenic &lt;i&gt;SCN3A &lt;/i&gt; variants, most had treatment‐resistant epilepsy beginning in the first year of life (16/21, 76%; median onset, 2 weeks), with severe or profound developmental delay (15/20; 75%). Many, but not all (15/19; 79%), exhibited malformations of cortical development. Pathogenic variants clustered in transmembrane segments 4–6 of domains II‐IV. Most pathogenic missense variants tested (10/11; 91%) displayed gain of channel function, with increased persistent current and/or a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, and all variants associated with malformation of cortical development exhibited gain of channel function. One variant (p.Ile1468Arg) exhibited mixed effects, with gain and partial loss of function. Two variants demonstrated loss of channel function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study defines &lt;i&gt;SCN3A‐ &lt;/i&gt;related neurodevelopmental disorder along a spectrum of severity, but typically including epilepsy and severe or profound developmental delay/intellectual disability. Malformations of cortical development are a characteristic feature of this unusual channelopathy syndrome, present in over 75% of affected individuals. Gain of function at the channel level in developing neurons is likely an important mechanism of disease pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: An open access mouse brain flatmap and upgraded rat and human brain flatmaps based on current reference atlases</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;An open access mouse brain flatmap and upgraded rat and human brain flatmaps based on current reference atlases&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/be254fc2-2246-4a97-9f28-5ae2c1035804/cne24966-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illustration shows several flatmap representations of the mammalian brain, selected and modified from a collection of new and enhanced flatmap representations of the mouse, rat, and human brain. The human brain flatmap primarily details cortical regionalization. The rat and mouse brain flatmaps are based on current brain reference atlases, and they represent all depths of the divisional hierarchy of central nervous system gray matter represented therein. Also represented for rat and mouse are white matter tracts, ganglia, and nerves, and for the rat a series of flatmaps illustrating stages of brain development. The rat and mouse brain flatmaps are designed to facilitate comparative analysis between these species, and for adaptability to novel parcellation schemas and computational applications. We give examples of these uses, including a proof‐of‐concept workflow demonstrating how the flatmaps could be adapted to form the basis of a web‐based graphical data viewer and analysis platform to represent a wide variety of brain data.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we present a flatmap of the mouse central nervous system (brain) and substantially enhanced flatmaps of the rat and human brain. Also included are enhanced representations of nervous system white matter tracts, ganglia, and nerves, and an enhanced series of ten flatmaps showing different stages of rat brain development. The adult mouse and rat brain flatmaps provide layered diagrammatic representation of central nervous system divisions, according to their arrangement in corresponding reference atlases: Brain Maps 4.0 (BM4, rat) (Swanson, 2018), and the first version of the Allen Reference Atlas (mouse) (Dong, 2007). To facilitate comparative analysis, both flatmaps are scaled equally, and the divisional hierarchy of gray matter follows a topographic arrangement used in BM4. Also included with the mouse and rat brain flatmaps are cerebral cortex atlas level contours based on the reference atlases, and direct graphical and tabular comparison of regional parcellation. To encourage use of the brain flatmaps, they were designed and organized, with supporting reference tables, for ease‐of‐use and to be amenable to computational applications. We demonstrate how they can be adapted to represent novel parcellations resulting from experimental data, and we provide a proof‐of‐concept for how they could form the basis of a web‐based graphical data viewer and analysis platform. The mouse, rat, and human brain flatmap vector graphics files (Adobe Reader/Acrobat viewable and Adobe Illustrator editable) and supporting tables are provided open access; they constitute a broadly applicable neuroscience toolbox resource for researchers seeking to map and perform comparative analysis of brain data.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Peculiar protrusions along tanycyte processes face diverse neural and non‐neural cell types in the hypothalamic parenchyma</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Peculiar protrusions along tanycyte processes face diverse neural and non‐neural cell types in the hypothalamic parenchyma&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/719f468e-817c-4fb5-beec-da94d1b4490f/cne24965-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TAT‐Cre‐mediated transduction of tdTomato in tanycytes, this study morphologically describes peculiar protrusions along tanycyte processes. Combining tdTomato filling, fluorescence immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy, the authors show in 3D reconstructions the diverse tanycyte partners as well as the subcellular organelles and transporters present in tanycyte protrusions. 3 V, third ventricle; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MVB, multivesicular bodies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanycytes are highly specialized ependymal cells that line the bottom and the lateral walls of the third ventricle. In contact with the cerebrospinal fluid through their cell bodies, they send processes into the arcuate nucleus, the ventromedial nucleus and the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present work, we combined transgenic and immunohistochemical approaches to investigate the neuroanatomical associations between tanycytes and neural cells present in the hypothalamic parenchyma, in particular in the arcuate nucleus. The specific expression of tdTomato in tanycytes first allowed the observation of peculiar subcellular protrusions along tanycyte processes and at their endfeet such as spines, swelling, en passant boutons, boutons or claws. Interestingly, these protrusions contact different neural cells in the brain parenchyma including blood vessels and neurons, and in particular NPY and POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus. Using both fluorescent and electron microscopy, we finally observed that these tanycyte protrusions contain ribosomes, mitochondria, diverse vesicles, and transporters, suggesting dense tanycyte/neuron and tanycyte/blood vessel communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, our results lay the neuroanatomical basis for tanycyte/neural cell interactions, which will be useful to further understand cell‐to‐cell communications involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Inhibition of neural stem cell aging through the transient induction of reprogramming factors</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Inhibition of neural stem cell aging through the transient induction of reprogramming factors&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/901cb43f-e28f-40bb-9800-25cafc146286/cne24967-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long‐term in vitro culture of neural stem cells (NSCs) resulted in aging‐related upregulation of inflammatory‐ and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‐related genes. The induction of four reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c‐Myc) could decrease expression of the inflammatory and ER stress‐related genes during the long‐term culture.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult stem cells age during long‐term &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt; culture, and neural stem cells (NSCs), which can self‐renew and differentiate into neurons and glial cells, also display reduced differentiation potential after repeated passaging. However, the mechanistic details underlying this process remain unclear. In this study, we found that long‐term in vitro culture of NSCs resulted in aging‐related upregulation of inflammatory‐ and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‐related genes, including the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)1β and IL6, the senescence‐associated enzyme matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13), and the ER stress‐responsive transcription factor activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). However, the cyclic and transient induction of four reprogramming factors (POU domain, class 5, transcription factor 1, also known as octamer‐binding transcription factor 4; SRY [sex determining region Y]‐box 2; Kruppel‐like factor 4; and myelocytomatosis oncogene; collectively referred to as OSKM) can inhibit NSC aging, as indicated by the decreased expression of the inflammatory and ER stress‐related genes. We used ROSA‐4F NSCs, which express OSKM from only one allele, to minimize the potential for full reprogramming or tumor formation during NSC rejuvenation. We expect that this novel rejuvenation method will enhance the potential of NSCs as a clinical approach to the treatment of neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Hippocampus: Improving sensory representations using episodic memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23186?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is well known to be essential for declarative memory. However, a growing body of research suggests that MTL structures might be involved in perceptual processes as well. Our previous modeling work suggests that sensory representations in cortex influence the accuracy of episodic memory retrieved from the MTL. We adopt that model here to show that, conversely, episodic memory can also influence the quality of sensory representations. We model the effect of episodic memory as (a) repeatedly replaying episodes from memory and (b) recombining episode fragments to form novel sequences that are more informative for learning sensory representations than the original episodes. We demonstrate that the performance in visual discrimination tasks is superior when episodic memory is present and that this difference is due to episodic memory driving the learning of a more optimized sensory representation. We conclude that the MTL can, even if it has only a purely mnemonic function, influence perceptual discrimination indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Effects of social defeat stress and fluoxetine treatment on neurogenesis and behavior in mice that lack zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) and vesicular zinc</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23185?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, in part because the available treatments are inadequate and do not work for many people. The neurobiology of depression, and the mechanism of action of common antidepressant drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), is not well understood. One mechanism thought to underlie the effects of these drugs is upregulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Evidence indicates that vesicular zinc is required for modulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, at least under some circumstances. Vesicular zinc refers to zinc that is stored in the synaptic vesicles of certain neurons, including in the hippocampus, and released in response to neuronal activity. It can be eliminated from the brain by deletion of zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3), as is the case in ZnT3 knockout mice. Here, we examined the effects of repeated social defeat stress and subsequent chronic treatment with the SSRI fluoxetine on behavior and neurogenesis in ZnT3 knockout mice. We hypothesized that fluoxetine treatment would increase neurogenesis and reverse stress‐induced behavioral symptoms in wild type, but not ZnT3 knockout, mice. As anticipated, stress induced persistent depression‐like effects, including social avoidance and anxiety‐like behavior. Fluoxetine decreased social avoidance, though the effect was not specific to the stressed mice, but did not affect anxiety‐like behavior. Surprisingly, stress increased the survival of neurons born 1 day after the last episode of defeat stress. Fluoxetine treatment also increased cell survival, particularly in wild type mice, though it did not affect proliferation. Our results did not support our hypothesis that vesicular zinc is required for the behavioral benefits of fluoxetine treatment. As to whether vesicular zinc is required for the neurogenic effects of fluoxetine, our results were inconclusive, warranting further investigation into the role of vesicular zinc in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Improved identification and differentiation from epileptiform activity of human hippocampal sharp wave ripples during NREM sleep</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rodents, pyramidal cell firing patterns from waking may be replayed in nonrapid eye movement sleep (NREM) sleep during hippocampal sharp wave ripples (HC‐SWR). In humans, HC‐SWR have only been recorded with electrodes implanted to localize epileptogenicity. Here, we characterize human HC‐SWR with rigorous rejection of epileptiform activity, requiring multiple oscillations and coordinated sharp waves. We demonstrated typical SWR in those rare HC recordings which lack interictal epileptiform spikes (IIS) and with no or minimal seizure involvement. These HC‐SWR have a similar rate (~12 min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; on average, variable across NREM stages and anterior/posterior HC) and apparent intra‐HC topography (ripple maximum in putative stratum pyramidale, slow wave in radiatum) as rodents, though with lower frequency (~85 Hz compared to ~140 Hz in rodents). Similar SWR are found in HC with IIS, but no significant seizure involvement. These SWR were modulated by behavior, being largely absent (&amp;lt;2 min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) except during NREM sleep in both Stage 2 (~9 min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and Stage 3 (~15 min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), distinguishing them from IIS. This study quantifies the basic characteristics of a strictly selected sample of SWR recorded in relatively healthy human hippocampi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Double dissociation of learned approach–avoidance conflict processing and spatial pattern separation along the dorsoventral axis of the dentate gyrus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23182?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ventral portion of the rodent hippocampus (HPC; anterior in primates) has been implicated in the detection and resolution of approach–avoidance conflict, which arises when an organism encounters a stimulus that predicts both positive and negative outcomes. Previous work has found differential regulation of approach–avoidance conflict behavior by the CA3 and CA1 subfields, with inhibition of ventral CA3 increasing approach toward conflicting stimuli and inhibition of the ventral CA1 potentiating avoidance. Here, we sought to extend these findings by investigating the role of the dentate gyrus (DG), the input region of the HPC, in learned approach–avoidance conflict processing in rats. Animals were first trained to acquire three different visuotactile cue‐outcome associations in separate arms of a Y‐maze (appetitive, aversive, and neutral). Postacquisition, they were administered a “conflict test,” in which they were presented with a choice between exploring an arm in which the appetitive and aversive cues were concurrently presented (conflict stimulus), and another arm containing the neutral stimulus. GABAR‐mediated inactivation of the ventral DG, but not dorsal DG, potentiated approach behavior toward the conflict stimulus, similar to the effects of ventral CA3 inactivation. In contrast, dorsal DG, but not ventral DG, inactivation was found to impair performance on a metric spatial discrimination task, which is commonly used as a test of pattern separation. The findings of this study demonstrate a robust double dissociation between the ventral and dorsal aspects of the DG, in line with previous reports of functional differences along the longitudinal axis of the HPC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Hippocampal state transitions at the boundaries between trial epochs</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus encodes distinct contexts with unique patterns of activity. Representational shifts with changes in context, referred to as remapping, have been extensively studied. However, less is known about transitions between representations. In this study, we leverage a large dataset of neuronal recordings taken while rats performed an olfactory memory task with a predictable temporal structure involving trials and intertrial intervals (ITIs), separated by salient boundaries at the trial start and trial end. We found that trial epochs were associated with stable hippocampal representations despite moment‐to‐moment variability in stimuli and behavior. Representations of trial and ITI epochs were far more distinct than spatial factors would predict and the transitions between the two were abrupt. The boundary was associated with a large spike in multiunit activity, with many individual cells specifically active at the start or end of each trial. Both epochs and boundaries were encoded by hippocampal populations, and these representations carried information on orthogonal axes readily identified using principal component analysis. We suggest that the hippocampus orthogonalizes representations of the trial and ITI epochs and the activity spike at trial boundaries might serve to drive hippocampal activity from one stable state to the other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Inactivation of ATRX in forebrain excitatory neurons affects hippocampal synaptic plasticity</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;α‐Thalassemia X‐linked intellectual disability (ATR‐X) syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;ATRX &lt;/i&gt; gene that encodes a SNF2‐type chromatin‐remodeling protein. The ATRX protein regulates chromatin structure and gene expression in the developing mouse brain and early inactivation leads to DNA replication stress, extensive cell death, and microcephaly. However, the outcome of &lt;i&gt;Atrx &lt;/i&gt; loss of function postnatally in neurons is less well understood. We recently reported that conditional inactivation of &lt;i&gt;Atrx &lt;/i&gt; in postnatal forebrain excitatory neurons (ATRX‐cKO) causes deficits in long‐term hippocampus‐dependent spatial memory. Thus, we hypothesized that ATRX‐cKO mice will display impaired hippocampal synaptic transmission and plasticity. In the present study, evoked field potentials and current source density analysis were recorded from a multichannel electrode in male, urethane‐anesthetized mice. Three major excitatory synapses, the Schaffer collaterals to basal dendrites and proximal apical dendrites, and the temporoammonic path to distal apical dendrites on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells were assessed by their baseline synaptic transmission, including paired‐pulse facilitation (PPF) at 50‐ms interpulse interval, and by their long‐term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta‐frequency burst stimulation. Baseline single‐pulse excitatory response at each synapse did not differ between ATRX‐cKO and control mice, but baseline PPF was reduced at the CA1 basal dendritic synapse in ATRX‐cKO mice. While basal dendritic LTP of the first‐pulse excitatory response was not affected in ATRX‐cKO mice, proximal and distal apical dendritic LTP were marginally and significantly reduced, respectively. These results suggest that ATRX is required in excitatory neurons of the forebrain to achieve normal hippocampal LTP and PPF at the CA1 apical and basal dendritic synapses, respectively. Such alterations in hippocampal synaptic transmission and plasticity could explain the long‐term spatial memory deficits in ATRX‐cKO mice and provide insight into the physiological mechanisms underlying intellectual disability in ATR‐X syndrome patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Characterization of hippocampal subfields using ex vivo MRI and histology data: Lessons for in vivo segmentation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23172?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal subfield segmentation on in vivo MRI is of great interest for cognition, aging, and disease research. Extant subfield segmentation protocols have been based on neuroanatomical references, but these references often give limited information on anatomical variability. Moreover, there is generally a mismatch between the orientation of the histological sections and the often anisotropic coronal sections on in vivo MRI. To address these issues, we provide a detailed description of hippocampal anatomy using a postmortem dataset containing nine specimens of subjects with and without dementia, which underwent a 9.4 T MRI and histological processing. Postmortem MRI matched the typical orientation of in vivo images and segmentations were generated in MRI space, based on the registered annotated histological sections. We focus on the following topics: the order of appearance of subfields, the location of subfields relative to macroanatomical features, the location of subfields in the uncus and tail and the composition of the dark band, a hypointense layer visible in T2‐weighted MRI. Our main findings are that: (a) there is a consistent order of appearance of subfields in the hippocampal head, (b) the composition of subfields is not consistent in the anterior uncus, but more consistent in the posterior uncus, (c) the dark band consists only of the CA‐stratum lacunosum moleculare, not the strata moleculare of the dentate gyrus, (d) the subiculum/CA1 border is located at the middle of the width of the hippocampus in the body in coronal plane, but moves in a medial direction from anterior to posterior, and (e) the variable location and composition of subfields in the hippocampal tail can be brought back to a body‐like appearance when reslicing the MRI scan following the curvature of the tail. Our findings and this publicly available dataset will hopefully improve anatomical accuracy of future hippocampal subfield segmentation protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Ex vivo Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Serotonin Transporter Interactome: Network Impact of the SERT Ala56 Coding Variant</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00089</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Altered serotonin (5-HT) signaling is associated with multiple brain disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The presynaptic, high-affinity 5-HT transporter (SERT) tightly regulates 5-HT clearance after release from serotonergic neurons in the brain and enteric nervous systems, among other sites. Accumulating evidence suggests that SERT is dynamically regulated in distinct activity states as a result of environmental and intracellular stimuli, with regulation perturbed by disease-associated coding variants. Our lab identified a rare, hypermorphic SERT coding substitution, Gly56Ala, in subjects with ASD, finding that the Ala56 variant stabilizes a high-affinity outward-facing conformation (SERT&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;) that leads to elevated 5-HT uptake in vitro and in vivo. Hyperactive SERT Ala56 appears to preclude further activity enhancements by p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and can be normalized by pharmacological p38α MAPK inhibition, consistent with SERT Ala56 mimicking, constitutively, a high-activity conformation entered into transiently by p38α MAPK activation. We hypothesize that changes in SERT-interacting proteins (SIPs) support the shift of SERT into the SERT&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; state which may be captured by comparing the composition of SERT Ala56 protein complexes with those of wildtype (WT) SERT, defining specific interactions through comparisons of protein complexes recovered using preparations from SERT&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; (knockout; KO) mice. Using quantitative proteomic-based approaches, we identify a total of 459 SIPs, that demonstrate both SERT specificity and sensitivity to the Gly56Ala substitution, with a striking bias being a loss of SIP interactions with SERT Ala56 compared to WT SERT. Among this group are previously validated SIPs, such as flotillin-1 (FLOT1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), whose functions are believed to contribute to SERT microdomain localization and regulation. Interestingly, our studies nominate a number of novel SIPs implicated in ASD, including fragile X mental retardation 1 protein (FMR1) and SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains protein 3 (SHANK3), of potential relevance to long-standing evidence of serotonergic contributions to ASD. Further investigation of these SIPs, and the broader networks they engage, may afford a greater understanding of ASD as well as other brain and peripheral disorders associated with perturbed 5-HT signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Emergence of Mixed Mode Oscillations in Random Networks of Diverse Excitable Neurons: The Role of Neighbors and Electrical Coupling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00049</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00049</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we focus on the emergence of diverse neuronal oscillations arising in a mixed population of neurons with different excitability properties. These properties produce mixed mode oscillations (MMOs) characterized by the combination of large amplitudes and alternate subthreshold or small amplitude oscillations. Considering the biophysically plausible, Izhikevich neuron model, we demonstrate that various MMOs, including MMBOs (mixed mode bursting oscillations) and synchronized tonic spiking appear in a randomly connected network of neurons, where a fraction of them is in a quiescent (silent) state and the rest in self-oscillatory (firing) states. We show that MMOs and other patterns of neural activity depend on the number of oscillatory neighbors of quiescent nodes and on electrical coupling strengths. Our results are verified by constructing a reduced-order network model and supported by systematic bifurcation diagrams as well as for a small-world network. Our results suggest that, for weak couplings, MMOs appear due to the de-synchronization of a large number of quiescent neurons in the networks. The quiescent neurons together with the firing neurons produce high frequency oscillations and bursting activity. The overarching goal is to uncover a favorable network architecture and suitable parameter spaces where Izhikevich model neurons generate diverse responses ranging from MMOs to tonic spiking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dyslipidemic Diet Induces Mobilization of Peripheral Neutrophils and Monocytes That Exacerbate Hemorrhagic Brain Injury and Neuroinflammation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver condition characterized by a significant accumulation of lipids in the liver without excessive alcohol consumption. Accumulating evidence suggests a significantly increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in NAFLD patients. However, it remains poorly understood whether and how NAFLD affects the outcome of hemorrhagic brain injury. Here, we examined the effects of diet-induce NAFLD on ICH injury and neuroinflammation in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: NAFLD was induced in C57BL/6 mice by feeding with a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet for 4 weeks. Collagenase and autologous blood models were used to evaluate the effects of NAFLD on ICH injury and neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: MCD diet for 4 weeks induces NAFLD and hyperlipidemia in mice. Mice receiving the MCD diet have aggravated neurological deficits and brain edema after ICH. The augmentation of ICH injury was accompanied by brain infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes and increased production of pro-inflammatory factors. Before ICH, MCD diet-induced mobilization of neutrophils and monocytes in the periphery. Notably, the detrimental effects of NAFLD on ICH injury was ablated in mice receiving antibody depletion of neutrophils and monocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These results suggest that NAFLD exacerbates neuroinflammation and ICH injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A Novel Major Output Target for Pheromone-Sensitive Projection Neurons in Male Moths</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Even though insects have comparably small brains, they achieve astoundingly complex behaviors. One example is flying moths tracking minute amounts of pheromones using olfactory circuits. The tracking distance can be up to 1 km, which makes it essential that male moths respond efficiently and reliably to very few pheromone molecules. The male-specific macroglomerular complex (MGC) in the moth antennal lobe contains circuitry dedicated to pheromone processing. Output neurons from this region project along three parallel pathways, the medial, mediolateral, and lateral tracts. The MGC-neurons of the lateral tract are least described and their functional significance is mainly unknown. We used mass staining, calcium imaging, and intracellular recording/staining to characterize the morphological and physiological properties of these neurons in the noctuid moth, Helicoverpa armigera. All lateral-tract MGC neurons targeted the column, a small region within the superior intermediate neuropil. We identified this region as a unique converging site for MGC lateral-tract neurons responsive to pheromones, as well as a dense congregating site for plant odor information since a substantial number of lateral-tract neurons from ordinary glomeruli (OG) also terminates in this region. The lateral-tract MGC-neurons responded with a shorter peak latency than the well-described neurons in the medial tract. Different from the medial-tract MGC neurons encoding odor quality important for species-specific signal identification, those in the lateral tract convey a more robust and rapid signal—potentially important for fast control of hard-wired behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>SARS-CoV-2 presents an unprecedented international challenge, but it will not be the last such threat. Here, we argue that the world needs to be much better prepared to rapidly detect, define and defeat future pandemics. We propose that a Global Immunological Observatory (GIO) and associated developments in systems immunology, therapeutics and vaccine design should be at the heart of this enterprise.</description>

	<description>Lymphocyte migration is essential for the function of the adaptive immune system, and regulation of T cell entry into tissues is an effective therapy in autoimmune diseases. Little is known about the specific role of cytoskeletal effectors that mediate mechanical forces and morphological changes essential for migration in complex environments. We developed a new Formin-like-1 (FMNL1) knock-out mouse model and determined that the cytoskeletal effector FMNL1 is selectively required for effector T cell trafficking to inflamed tissues, without affecting naïve T cell entry into secondary lymphoid organs. Here, we identify a FMNL1-dependent mechanism of actin polymerization at the back of the cell that enables migration of the rigid lymphocyte nucleus through restrictive barriers. Furthermore, FMNL1-deficiency impairs the ability of self-reactive effector T cells to induce autoimmune disease. Overall, our data suggest that FMNL1 may be a potential therapeutic target to specifically modulate T cell trafficking to inflammatory sites.</description>

	<description>Diffusible small molecule microbial hormones drastically alter the expression profiles of antibiotics and other drugs in actinobacteria. For example, avenolide (a butenolide) regulates production of avermectin, derivatives of which are used in the treatment of river blindness and other parasitic diseases. Butenolides and γ-butyrolactones control production of pharmaceutically important secondary metabolites by binding to TetR family transcriptional repressors. Here, we describe a concise, 22-step synthetic strategy for the production of avenolide. We present crystal structures of the butenolide receptor AvaR1 in isolation, and in complex with avenolide, as well as AvaR1 bound to an oligonucleotide derived from its operator. Biochemical studies guided by the co-crystal structures enable identification of 90 new actinobacteria that may be regulated by butenolides, two of which are experimentally verified. These studies provide a foundation for understanding regulation of microbial secondary metabolite production, which may be exploited for the discovery and production of novel medicines.</description>

	<description>Human natural killer (NK) cells are defined as CD56+CD3−. Despite its ubiquitous expression on human NK cells the role of CD56 (NCAM) in human NK cell cytotoxic function has not been defined. In non-immune cells, NCAM can induce signaling, mediate adhesion, and promote exocytosis through interactions with focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Here we demonstrate that deletion of CD56 on the NK92 cell line leads to impaired cytotoxic function. CD56-knockout (KO) cells fail to polarize during immunological synapse (IS) formation and have severely impaired exocytosis of lytic granules. Phosphorylation of the FAK family member Pyk2 at tyrosine 402 is decreased in NK92 CD56-KO cells, demonstrating a functional link between CD56 and signaling in human NK cells. Cytotoxicity, lytic granule exocytosis, and the phosphorylation of Pyk2 are rescued by the reintroduction of CD56. These data highlight a novel functional role for CD56 in stimulating exocytosis and promoting cytotoxicity in human NK cells.</description>

	<title>eLife: Whole-organism behavioral profiling reveals a role for dopamine in state-dependent motor program coupling in C. elegans</title>

	<description>Animal behaviors are commonly organized into long-lasting states that coordinately impact the generation of diverse motor outputs such as feeding, locomotion, and grooming. However, the neural mechanisms that coordinate these diverse motor programs remain poorly understood. Here, we examine how the distinct motor programs of the nematode &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;are coupled together across behavioral states. We describe a new imaging platform that permits automated, simultaneous quantification of each of the main &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; motor programs over hours or days. Analysis of these whole-organism behavioral profiles shows that the motor programs coordinately change as animals switch behavioral states. Utilizing genetics, optogenetics, and calcium imaging, we identify a new role for dopamine in coupling locomotion and egg-laying together across states. These results provide new insights into how the diverse motor programs throughout an organism are coordinated and suggest that neuromodulators like dopamine can couple motor circuits together in a state-dependent manner.</description>

	<description>The supplementary motor area is believed to guide action by “looking ahead” in time. Russo et al. formalize this idea and predict a basic property that neural activity must have to serve that purpose. That property is present, explains diverse features of activity, and distinguishes higher- from lower-level motor areas.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Dysregulated expression of the alternatively spliced variant mRNAs of the mu opioid receptor gene, OPRM1, in the medial prefrontal cortex of male human heroin abusers and heroin self‐administering male rats</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Dysregulated expression of the alternatively spliced variant mRNAs of the mu opioid receptor gene, OPRM1, in the medial prefrontal cortex of male human heroin abusers and heroin self‐administering male rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/84b33b24-e534-4af7-ac08-25b06f2f3318/jnr24640-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulated expression of several &lt;i&gt;OPRM1 &lt;/i&gt; splice variant mRNAs in the medial prefrontal cortex of male human heroin abusers was recaptured in heroin self‐administering male rats, suggesting potential roles of the &lt;i&gt;OPRM1 &lt;/i&gt; splice variants in heroin addiction that could be mechanistically explored using the rat heroin self‐administration model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heroin, a mu agonist, acts through the mu opioid receptor. The mu opioid receptor gene, &lt;i&gt;OPRM1, &lt;/i&gt; undergoes extensive alternative splicing, creating an array of splice variants that are conserved from rodent to humans. Increasing evidence suggests that these &lt;i&gt;OPRM1 &lt;/i&gt; splice variants are pharmacologically important in mediating various actions of mu opioids, including analgesia, tolerance, physical dependence, rewarding behavior, as well as addiction. In the present study, we examine expression of the &lt;i&gt;OPRM1 &lt;/i&gt; splice variant mRNAs in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), one of the major brain regions involved in decision‐making and drug‐seeking behaviors, of male human heroin abusers and male rats that developed stable heroin‐seeking behavior using an intravenous heroin self‐administration (SA) model. The results show similar expression profiles among multiple &lt;i&gt;OPRM1 &lt;/i&gt; splice variants in both human control subjects and saline control rats, illustrating conservation of &lt;i&gt;OPRM1 &lt;/i&gt; alternative splicing from rodent to humans. Moreover, the expressions of several &lt;i&gt;OPRM1 &lt;/i&gt; splice variant mRNAs were dysregulated in the postmortem mPFCs from heroin abusers compared to the control subjects. Similar patterns were observed in the rat heroin SA model. These findings suggest potential roles of the &lt;i&gt;OPRM1 &lt;/i&gt; splice variants in heroin addiction that could be mechanistically explored using the rat heroin SA model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Zonisamide promotes survival of human‐induced pluripotent stem cell‐derived dopaminergic neurons in the striatum of female rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24668?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Zonisamide promotes survival of human‐induced pluripotent stem cell‐derived dopaminergic neurons in the striatum of female rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5e020615-b1cc-465a-943f-7d2392edb484/jnr24668-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We examined the effects of zonisamide on transplanted human dopaminergic neurons in the rat striatum and found that zonisamide facilitates the survival of dopamine neurons, an effect that may be related to an increase in the expression of SLIT‐and NTRK‐like protein 6 in rat striatum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transplantation of dopaminergic (DA) progenitors derived from pluripotent stem cells improves the behavior of Parkinson's disease model animals. However, the survival of DA progenitors is low, and the final yield of DA neurons is only approximately 0.3%–2% the number of transplanted cells. Zonisamide (ZNS) increases the number of survived DA neurons upon the transplantation of mouse‐induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell‐derived DA progenitors in the rat striatum. In this study, we induced DA progenitors from human iPS cells and transplanted them into the striatum of female rats with daily administration of ZNS. The number of survived DA neurons was evaluated 1 and 4 months after transplantation by immunohistochemistry, which revealed that the number of survived DA neurons was significantly increased with the administration of ZNS. To assess the mechanism of action of ZNS, we performed a gene expression analysis to compare the gene expression profiles in striatum treated with or without ZNS. The analysis revealed that the expression of SLIT‐and NTRK‐like protein 6 (SLITRK6) was upregulated in rat striatum treated with ZNS. In conclusion, ZNS promotes the survival of DA neurons after the transplantation of human‐iPS cell‐derived DA progenitors in the rat striatum. SLITRK6 is suggested to be involved in this supportive effect of ZNS by modulating the environment of the host brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: COVID‐19: a global threat to the nervous system</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In less than 6 months, the severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus type 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has spread worldwide infecting nearly 6 million people and killing over 350,000. Initially thought to be restricted to the respiratory system, we now understand that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) also involves multiple other organs including the central and peripheral nervous system. The number of recognized neurologic manifestations of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is rapidly accumulating. These may result from a variety of mechanisms including virus‐induced hyper‐inflammatory and hypercoagulable states, direct virus infection of the CNS, and post‐infectious immune mediated processes. Example of COVID‐19 CNS disease include encephalopathy, encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, meningitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, venous sinus thrombosis and endothelialitis. In the peripheral nervous system COVID‐19 is associated with dysfunction of smell and taste, muscle injury, the Guillain‐Barre syndrome and its variants. Due to its worldwide distribution and multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms, COVID‐19 poses a global threat to the entire nervous system. While our understanding of SARS‐CoV‐2 neuropathogenesis is still incomplete and our knowledge is evolving rapidly, we hope that this review will provide a useful framework and help neurologists in understanding the many neurologic facets of COVID‐19.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The identification of progression in multiple sclerosis is typically retrospective. Given the profound burden of progressive multiple sclerosis, and the recent development of effective treatments for these patients, there is a need to establish measures capable of identifying progressive multiple sclerosis early in the disease course. Starting from recent pathological findings, this review assesses the state‐of‐the‐art of potential measures able to predict progressive multiple sclerosis. Future promising biomarkers, that might shed light on mechanisms of progression are also discussed. Finally, expansion of the concept of progressive multiple sclerosis, by including an assessment of cognition, patient‐reported outcomes and comorbidities, is considered.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Detecting differential alternative splicing events in scRNA-seq with or without Unique Molecular Identifiers</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Hu, Kai Wang, Mingyao Li&lt;/p&gt;

The emergence of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology has made it possible to measure gene expression variations at cellular level. This breakthrough enables the investigation of a wider range of problems including analysis of splicing heterogeneity among individual cells. However, compared to bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq data are much noisier due to high technical variability and low sequencing depth. Here we propose SCATS (Single-Cell Analysis of Transcript Splicing) for differential splicing analysis in scRNA-seq, which achieves high sensitivity at low coverage by accounting for technical noise. SCATS models scRNA-seq data either with or without Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs). For non-UMI data, SCATS explicitly models technical noise by accounting for capture efficiency and amplification bias through the use of external spike-ins; for UMI data, SCATS models capture efficiency and further accounts for transcriptional burstiness. A key aspect of SCATS lies in its ability to group “exons” that originate from the same isoform(s). Grouping exons is essential in splicing analysis of scRNA-seq data as it naturally aggregates spliced reads across different exons, making it possible to detect splicing events even when sequencing depth is low. To evaluate the performance of SCATS, we analyzed both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets and compared with existing methods including Census and DEXSeq. We show that SCATS has well controlled type I error rate, and is more powerful than existing methods, especially when splicing difference is small. In contrast, Census suffers from severe type I error inflation, whereas DEXSeq is more conservative. When applied to mouse brain scRNA-seq datasets, SCATS identified more differential splicing events with subtle difference across cell types compared to Census and DEXSeq. With the increasing adoption of scRNA-seq, we believe SCATS will be well-suited for various splicing studies. The implementation of SCATS can be downloaded from https://github.com/huyustats/SCATS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4NVGgnWxTVw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Ventricular contraction is roughly proportional to the amount of calcium released from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR) during systole. While it is rather straightforward to measure calcium levels and contractibility under different physiological conditions, the complexity of calcium handling during systole and diastole has made the prediction of its release at steady state impossible. Here we approach the problem analyzing the evolution of intracellular and extracellular calcium fluxes during a single beat which is away from homeostatic balance. Using an in-silico subcellular model of rabbit ventricular myocyte, we show that the high dimensional nonlinear problem of finding the steady state can be reduced to a two-variable general equilibrium condition where pre-systolic calcium level in the cytosol and in the SR must fulfill simultaneously two different equalities. This renders calcium homeostasis as a problem that can be studied in terms of its equilibrium structure, leading to precise predictions of steady state from single-beat measurements. We show how changes in ion channels modify the general equilibrium, as shocks would do in general equilibrium macroeconomic models. This allows us to predict when an enhanced entrance of calcium in the cell reduces its contractibility and explain why SERCA gene therapy, a change in calcium handling to treat heart failure, might fail to improve contraction even when it successfully increases SERCA expression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mu2DBZQtspw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Epidemiological consequences of enduring strain-specific immunity requiring repeated episodes of infection</title>

Group A &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; (GAS) skin infections are caused by a diverse array of strain types and are highly prevalent in disadvantaged populations. The role of strain-specific immunity in preventing GAS infections is poorly understood, representing a critical knowledge gap in vaccine development. A recent GAS murine challenge study showed evidence that sterilising strain-specific and enduring immunity required two skin infections by the same GAS strain within three weeks. This mechanism of developing enduring immunity may be a significant impediment to the accumulation of immunity in populations. We used an agent-based mathematical model of GAS transmission to investigate the epidemiological consequences of enduring strain-specific immunity developing only after two infections with the same strain within a specified interval. Accounting for uncertainty when correlating murine timeframes to humans, we varied this maximum inter-infection interval from 3 to 420 weeks to assess its impact on prevalence and strain diversity, and considered additional scenarios where no maximum inter-infection interval was specified. Model outputs were compared with longitudinal GAS surveillance observations from northern Australia, a region with endemic infection. We also assessed the likely impact of a targeted strain-specific multivalent vaccine in this context. Our model produced patterns of transmission consistent with observations when the maximum inter-infection interval for developing enduring immunity was 19 weeks. Our vaccine analysis suggests that the leading multivalent GAS vaccine may have limited impact on the prevalence of GAS in populations in northern Australia if strain-specific immunity requires repeated episodes of infection. Our results suggest that observed GAS epidemiology from disease endemic settings is consistent with enduring strain-specific immunity being dependent on repeated infections with the same strain, and provide additional motivation for relevant human studies to confirm the human immune response to GAS skin infection.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/47TFyc1oQ4k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are vascular lesions predominantly developing in the central nervous system (CNS), with no effective treatments other than surgery. Loss-of-function mutation in CCM1/krev interaction trapped 1 (KRIT1), CCM2, or CCM3/programmed cell death 10 (PDCD10) causes lesions that are characterized by abnormal vascular integrity. Vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), a major regulator of endothelial cell (EC) junctional integrity is strongly disorganized in ECs lining the CCM lesions. We report here that microRNA-27a (miR-27a), a negative regulator of VE-cadherin, is elevated in ECs isolated from mouse brains developing early CCM lesions and in cultured ECs with CCM1 or CCM2 depletion. Furthermore, we show miR-27a acts downstream of kruppel-like factor (KLF)2 and KLF4, two known key transcription factors involved in CCM lesion development. Using CD5-2 (a target site blocker [TSB]) to prevent the miR-27a/VE-cadherin mRNA interaction, we present a potential therapy to increase VE-cadherin expression and thus rescue the abnormal vascular integrity. In CCM1- or CCM2-depleted ECs, CD5-2 reduces monolayer permeability, and in &lt;i&gt;Ccm1&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice, it restores dermal vessel barrier function. In a neonatal mouse model of CCM disease, CD5-2 normalizes vasculature and reduces vascular leakage in the lesions, inhibits the development of large lesions, and significantly reduces the size of established lesions in the hindbrain. Furthermore, CD5-2 limits the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lesion area. Our work has established that VE-cadherin is a potential therapeutic target for normalization of the vasculature and highlights that targeting miR-27a/VE-cadherin interaction by CD5-2 is a potential novel therapy for the devastating disease, CCM.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/a7Bn3ZKf8Nc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The brain of Cataglyphis ants: Neuronal organization and visual projections&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6eb299ca-bc57-42ac-854b-55b000b5d1f2/cne24934-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three‐dimensional reconstruction of a &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis &lt;/i&gt; brain based on immunohistochemical staining and fluorescent tracing. We provide a detailed atlas of the &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis &lt;/i&gt; brain including 33 brain neuropils and 30 fiber tracts. We further focus on the description of the major optical tracts/commissures and their projections in the central brain.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis &lt;/i&gt; ants are known for their outstanding navigational abilities. They return to their inconspicuous nest after far‐reaching foraging trips using path integration, and whenever available, learn and memorize visual features of panoramic sceneries. To achieve this, the ants combine directional visual information from celestial cues and panoramic scenes with distance information from an intrinsic odometer. The largely vision‐based navigation in &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis &lt;/i&gt; requires sophisticated neuronal networks to process the broad repertoire of visual stimuli. Although &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis &lt;/i&gt; ants have been subjected to many neuroethological studies, little is known about the general neuronal organization of their central brain and the visual pathways beyond major circuits. Here, we provide a comprehensive, three‐dimensional neuronal map of synapse‐rich neuropils in the brain of &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis nodus &lt;/i&gt; including major connecting fiber systems. In addition, we examined neuronal tracts underlying the processing of visual information in more detail. This study revealed a total of 33 brain neuropils and 30 neuronal fiber tracts including six distinct tracts between the optic lobes and the cerebrum. We also discuss the importance of comparative studies on insect brain architecture for a profound understanding of neuronal networks and their function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neoplastic or dysplastic neuronal tissue in the brain stem and cerebellum can become epileptogenic in pediatric patients. However, it is unknown whether such tissue may transform intrinsic properties of the human cerebellum, making it capable of generating epileptic population activity. We noninvasively detected epileptiform signals unaveraged in a pediatric patient with epilepsy due to a tumor in the middle cerebellar peduncle. Analysis of generators of the signals revealed that the cerebellum ipsilateral and contralateral to the tumor was the dominant interictal spike generator and could initiate ictal activity, suggesting that human cerebellum may become capable of intrinsically generating epileptic activity.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Methyltransferase 3 Mediated miRNA m6A Methylation Promotes Stress Granule Formation in the Early Stage of Acute Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00103</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00103</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The modification of methyltransferase-like (METTL) enzymes plays important roles in various cellular responses by regulating microRNA expression. However, how m6A modification is involved in stress granule (SG) formation in the early stage of acute ischemic stroke by affecting the biogenesis processing of microRNAs remains unclear. Here, we established a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model in primary cortical neurons and PC12 cells to explore the potential mechanism between m6A modification and SG formation. The in vivo results showed that the level of infarction and apoptosis increased while SG formation decreased significantly within the ischemic cortex with improved reperfusion time after 2 h of ischemia. Consistent with the in vivo data, an inverse association between the apoptosis level and SG formation was observed in PC12 cells during the reperfusion period after 6 h of OGD stimulation. Both in vivo and in vitro results showed that the expression of METTL3 protein, m6A and miR-335 was significantly decreased with the reperfusion period. Overexpression of the METTL3 and METTL3 gene-knockdown in PC12 cells were achieved via plasmid transfection and CRISPR-Cas9 technology, respectively. Overexpression or knockdown of METTL3 in oxygen-glucose deprivation of PC12 cells resulted in functional maturation of miR-335, SG formation and apoptosis levels. In addition, we found that miR-335 enhanced SG formation through degradation of the mRNA of the eukaryotic translation termination factor (Erf1). In conclusion, we found that METTL3-mediated m6A methylation increases the maturation of miR-335, which promotes SG formation and reduces the apoptosis level of injury neurons and cells, and provides a potential therapeutic strategy for AIS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Hypothermia-Induced Ubiquitination of Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 3 Protects BV2 Microglia Cells From Cytotoxicity Following Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Recovery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00100</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00100</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Hypothermia attenuates microglial activation and exerts a potential neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemic-reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this in vitro study, a model of oxygen-glucose deprivation, followed by recovery (OGD/R), was used to investigate whether hypothermia exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis properties via enhanced ubiquitination and down-regulation of voltage-dependent anion channel 3 (VDAC3) expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: BV2 microglia were cultured under OGD for 4 h following reperfusion with or without hypothermia for 2, 4, or 8 h. M1 and M2 microglia markers [inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase (Arg)1] were detected using immunofluorescence. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin (IL)-1β], and anti-inflammatory factor (IL-10) were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was assayed by JC-1 staining using a flow cytometer. Expression of caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, and VDAC3 were assessed using western blot analysis. The cellular locations and interactions of ubiquitin and VDAC3 were identified using double immunofluorescence staining and immunoprecipitation (IP) assay. Also, the level of the VDAC3 mRNA was determined using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Hypothermia inhibited the OGD/R–induced microglia activation and differentiation into the M1 type with pro-inflammatory effect, whereas it promoted differentiation to the M2 type with anti-inflammatory effect. Hypothermia attenuated OGD/R-induced loss of Δψm, as well as the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins. Compared to normothermia, hypothermia increased the level of ubiquitinated VDAC3 in the BV2 microglia at both 2 and 8 h of reperfusion. Furthermore, hypothermia did not attenuate VDAC3 mRNA expression in OGD/R-induced microglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Hypothermia treatment during reperfusion, attenuated OGD/R-induced inflammation, and apoptosis in BV2 microglia. This might be due to the promotion of VDAC3 ubiquitination, identifying VDAC3 as a new target of hypothermia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Sarcosine Suppresses Epileptogenesis in Rats With Effects on Hippocampal DNA Methylation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00097</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00097</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epileptogenesis is a common consequence of brain insults, however, the prevention or delay of the epileptogenic process remains an important unmet medical challenge. Overexpression of glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) is proposed as a pathological hallmark in the hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and we previously demonstrated in rodent epilepsy models that augmentation of glycine suppressed chronic seizures and altered acute seizure thresholds. In the present study we evaluated the effect of the GlyT1 inhibitor, sarcosine (aka N-methylglycine), on epileptogenesis and also investigated possible mechanisms. We developed a modified rapid kindling model of epileptogenesis in rats combined with seizure score monitoring to evaluate the antiepileptogenic effect of sarcosine. We used immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis for the evaluation of GlyT1 expression and epigenetic changes of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in the epileptogenic hippocampi of rats, and further evaluated expression changes in enzymes involved in the regulation of DNA methylation, ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1), DNA-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), and DNMT3a. Our results demonstrated: (i) experimental evidence that sarcosine (3 g/kg, i.p. daily) suppressed kindling epileptogenesis in rats; (ii) the sarcosine-induced antiepileptogenic effect was accompanied by a suppressed hippocampal GlyT1 expression as well as a reduction of hippocampal 5mC levels and a corresponding increase in 5hmC; and (iii) sarcosine treatment caused differential expression changes of TET1 and DNMTs. Together, these findings suggest that sarcosine has unprecedented disease-modifying properties in a kindling model of epileptogenesis in rats, which was associated with altered hippocampal DNA methylation. Thus, manipulation of the glycine system is a potential therapeutic approach to attenuate the development of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: MicroRNA-146a Is a Wide-Reaching Neuroinflammatory Regulator and Potential Treatment Target in Neurological Diseases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00090</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Progressive functional deterioration and loss of neurons underlies neurological diseases and constitutes an important cause of disability and death worldwide. The causes of various types of neurological diseases often share several critical nerve-related cellular mechanisms and pathological features, particularly the neuroinflammatory response in the nervous system. A rapidly growing body of evidence indicates that various microRNAs play pivotal roles in these processes in neurological diseases and might be viable therapeutic targets. Among these microRNAs, microRNA-146a (miR-146a) stands out due to the rapid increase in recent literature on its mechanistic involvement in neurological diseases. In this review, we summarize and highlight the critical role of miR-146a in neurological diseases. MiR-146a polymorphisms are associated with the risk of neurological disease. Alterations in miR-146a expression levels are crucial events in the pathogenesis of numerous neurological diseases that are spatially and temporally diverse. Additionally, the target genes of miR-146a are involved in the regulation of pathophysiological processes in neurological diseases, particularly the neuroinflammatory response. In summary, miR-146a mainly plays a critical role in neuroinflammation during the progression of neurological diseases and might be a prospective biomarker and therapeutic target. Understanding the mechanisms by which miR-146a affects the neuroinflammatory response in different neurological injuries, different cell types, and even different stages of certain neurological diseases will pave the way for its use as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Non-invasive Neurophysiology in Learning and Training: Mechanisms and a SWOT Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00589</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although many scholars deem non-invasive measures of neurophysiology to have promise in assessing learning, these measures are currently not widely applied, neither in educational settings nor in training. How can non-invasive neurophysiology provide insight into learning and how should research on this topic move forward to ensure valid applications? The current article addresses these questions by discussing the mechanisms underlying neurophysiological changes during learning followed by a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis of non-invasive neurophysiology in learning and training. This type of analysis can provide a structured examination of factors relevant to the current state and future of a field. The findings of the SWOT analysis indicate that the field of neurophysiology in learning and training is developing rapidly. By leveraging the opportunities of neurophysiology in learning and training (while bearing in mind weaknesses, threats, and strengths) the field can move forward in promising directions. Suggestions for opportunities for future work are provided to ensure valid and effective application of non-invasive neurophysiology in a wide range of learning and training settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Accurate MR Image Registration to Anatomical Reference Space for Diffuse Glioma</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00585</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00585</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To summarize the distribution of glioma location within a patient population, registration of individual MR images to anatomical reference space is required. In this study, we quantified the accuracy of MR image registration to anatomical reference space with linear and non-linear transformations using estimated tumor targets of glioblastoma and lower-grade glioma, and anatomical landmarks at pre- and post-operative time-points using six commonly used registration packages (FSL, SPM5, DARTEL, ANTs, Elastix, and NiftyReg). Routine clinical pre- and post-operative, post-contrast T1-weighted images of 20 patients with glioblastoma and 20 with lower-grade glioma were collected. The 2009a Montreal Neurological Institute brain template was used as anatomical reference space. Tumors were manually segmented in the patient space and corresponding healthy tissue was delineated as a target volume in the anatomical reference space. Accuracy of the tumor alignment was quantified using the Dice score and the Hausdorff distance. To measure the accuracy of general brain alignment, anatomical landmarks were placed in patient and in anatomical reference space, and the landmark distance after registration was quantified. Lower-grade gliomas were registered more accurately than glioblastoma. Registration accuracy for pre- and post-operative MR images did not differ. SPM5 and DARTEL registered tumors most accurate, and FSL least accurate. Non-linear transformations resulted in more accurate general brain alignment than linear transformations, but tumor alignment was similar between linear and non-linear transformation. We conclude that linear transformation suffices to summarize glioma locations in anatomical reference space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Features of Postnatal Hippocampal Development in a Rat Model of Sporadic Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00533</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00533</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging is the major risk factor of the most common (∼95% of cases) sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Accumulating data indicate middle age as a critical period for the relevant pathological processes, however, the question of when AD starts to develop remains open. It has been reported only recently that in the early postnatal period—when brain development is completing—preconditions for a decrease in cognitive abilities and for accelerated aging can form. Here, we hypothesized that specific features of early postnatal brain development may be considered some of the prerequisites of AD development at an advanced age. To test this hypothesis, we used OXYS rats, which are a suitable model of sporadic AD. The duration of gestation, litter size, and weight at birth were lower in OXYS rats compared to control Wistar rats. The shortened duration of gestation may result in developmental retardation. Indeed, we noted decreased locomotor activity and increased anxiety in OXYS rats already at a young age: possible signs of altered brain development. We demonstrated retardation of the peak of postnatal neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of OXYS rats. Delayed neuronal maturation led to alterations of mossy-fiber formation: a shortened suprapyramidal bundle and longer infrapyramidal bundle, less pronounced fasciculation of granule cells’ axons, and smaller size and irregular shape of nuclei in the CA3 pyramidal layer. These changes were accompanied by altered astrocytic migration. The observed features of early development may be considered some of the risk factors of the AD-like pathology that manifests itself in OXYS rats late in life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dysfunction within large-scale brain networks as the basis for movement disorders is an accepted hypothesis. The treatment options for restoring network function are limited. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation are now being studied to modify the network. Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is also a portable, cost-effective, and non-invasive way of network modulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial alternating current stimulation have been studied in Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, tremor, and ataxia. Transcranial pulsed current stimulation and transcranial random noise stimulation are not yet studied enough. The literature in the use of these techniques is intriguing, yet many unanswered questions remain. In this review, we highlight the studies using these four potential tES techniques and their electrophysiological basis and consider the therapeutic implication in the field of movement disorders. The objectives are to consolidate the current literature, demonstrate that these methods are feasible, and encourage the application of such techniques in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Protracted Morphological Changes in the Corticospinal Tract Within the Cervical Spinal Cord After Intracerebral Hemorrhage in the Right Striatum of Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Currently, there is no promising treatment that improves prognosis significantly. While a thorough investigation of the pathological process within the primary site of injury in the brain has been conducted by the research field, the focus was mainly on gray matter injury, which partly accounted for the failure of discovery of clinically efficacious treatments. It is not until recent years that white matter (WM) injury in the brain after subcortical ICH was examined. As WM tracts form networks between different regions, damage to fibers should impair brain connectivity, resulting in functional impairment. Although WM changes have been demonstrated in the brain after ICH, alterations distant from the initial injury site down in the spinal cord are unclear. This longitudinal study, for the first time, revealed prolonged morphological changes of the contralesional dorsal corticospinal tract (CST) in the spinal cord 5 weeks after experimental ICH in mice by confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, implying that the structural integrity of the CST was compromised extensively after ICH. Given the important role of CST in motor function, future translational studies targeting motor recovery should delineate the treatment effects on CST integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for the management of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, DBS is indicated as the disease progresses and motor complications derived from pharmacological therapy arise. Here, we evaluate the potential of DBS prior to levodopa (L-Dopa) in improving quality of life (QoL), challenging the state of the art for DBS therapy. We present data on clinical manifestation, decision finding during early indication to DBS, and trajectories after DBS. We further discuss current paradigms for DBS and hypothesize on possible mechanisms. Six patients, between 50 and 67 years old, presenting at least 5 years of PD symptoms, and without L-Dopa therapy initiation, received subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS implantation. In the six PD cases, indication for DBS was not driven by motor complications, as supported by current guidelines, but by relevant QoL impairment and patient’s reluctance to initiate L-Dopa treatment. All patients treated with STN-DBS prior to L-Dopa presented improvement in motor and non-motor symptoms and significant QoL improvement. All patients reduced the intake of dopamine agonists, and five are currently free from L-Dopa medication, with no reported adverse events. We introduce a multicenter observational study to investigate whether early DBS treatment may affect the natural course of PD. Early application of DBS instead of L-Dopa administration could have a pathophysiological basis and be prompted by a significant incline on QoL through disease progression; however, the clinical value of this proposed paradigm shift should be addressed in clinical trials aimed at modulating the natural course of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Bloodletting Puncture at Hand Twelve Jing-Well Points Improves Neurological Recovery by Ameliorating Acute Traumatic Brain Injury-Induced Coagulopathy in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to hypocoagulopathy associated with prolonged bleeding and hemorrhagic progression. Bloodletting puncture therapy at hand twelve Jing-well points (BL-HTWP) has been applied as a first aid measure in various emergent neurological diseases, but the detailed mechanisms of the modulation between the central nervous system and systemic circulation after acute TBI in rodents remain unclear. To investigate whether BL-HTWP stimulation modulates hypocoagulable state and exerts neuroprotective effect, experimental TBI model of mice was produced by the controlled cortical impactor (CCI), and treatment with BL-HTWP was immediately made after CCI. Then, the effects of BL-HTWP on the neurological function, cerebral perfusion state, coagulable state, and cerebrovascular histopathology post-acute TBI were determined, respectively. Results showed that BL-HTWP treatment attenuated cerebral hypoperfusion and improve neurological recovery post-acute TBI. Furthermore, BL-HTWP stimulation reversed acute TBI-induced hypocoagulable state, reduced vasogenic edema and cytotoxic edema by regulating multiple hallmarks of coagulopathy in TBI. Therefore, we conclude for the first time that hypocoagulopathic state occurs after acute experimental TBI, and the neuroprotective effect of BL-HTWP relies on, at least in part, the modulation of hypocoagulable state. BL-HTWP therapy may be a promising strategy for acute severe TBI in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Dynamics of Cognitive Control in Various Types of Incongruence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00214</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Conflict-control is a core function of cognitive control. Although numerous studies have considered cognitive control to be domain-general, the shared and distinct brain responses to different types of incongruence or conflict remain unclear. Using a hybrid flanker task, the present study explored the temporal dynamics of brain activation to three types of incongruence: flanker interference, rule-based response switch (rule-switch), and action-based response switch (response-alternation). The results showed that: (1) all three types of incongruence evoked larger N2 amplitudes than the congruent condition in the frontal region, with the N2 amplitudes and topographical distribution of the N2 effect differing between the different types of incongruence; and (2) in the P300 time window, the flanker interference condition yielded the most delayed P300 latency, whereas the rule-switch and response-alternation conditions yielded smaller P300 amplitudes with a longer interval from P300 peak to a keypress. These findings suggest that different types of incongruence are first monitored similarly by the cognitive control system and then resolved differently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Better Phonological Short-Term Memory Is Linked to Improved Cortical Memory Representations for Word Forms and Better Word Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00209</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Language learning relies on both short-term and long-term memory. Phonological short-term memory (pSTM) is thought to play an important role in the learning of novel word forms. However, language learners may differ in their ability to maintain word representations in pSTM during interfering auditory input. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate how pSTM capacity in better and poorer pSTM groups is linked to language learning and the maintenance of pseudowords in pSTM. In particular, MEG was recorded while participants maintained pseudowords in pSTM by covert speech rehearsal, and while these brain representations were probed by presenting auditory pseudowords with first or third syllables matching or mismatching the rehearsed item. A control condition included identical stimuli but no rehearsal. Differences in response strength between matching and mismatching syllables were interpreted as the phonological mapping negativity (PMN). While PMN for the first syllable was found in both groups, it was observed for the third syllable only in the group with better pSTM. This suggests that individuals with better pSTM maintained representations of trisyllabic pseudowords more accurately during interference than individuals with poorer pSTM. Importantly, the group with better pSTM learned words faster in a paired-associate word learning task, linking the PMN findings to language learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Differential Functional Connectivity in Anterior and Posterior Hippocampus Supporting the Development of Memory Formation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00204</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging evidence suggests that the development of the hippocampus, a brain structure critical for memory function, contributes to the improvements of episodic memory between middle childhood to adulthood. However, investigations on age differences in hippocampal activation and functional connectivity and their contributions to the development of memory have yielded mixed results. Given the known structural and functional heterogeneity along the long axis of the hippocampus, we investigated age differences in the activation and functional connectivity in hippocampal subregions with a cross-sectional sample of 96 participants ages 8–25 years. We found that anterior and posterior hippocampus supported memory formation, and there was overall stability in memory-related hippocampal activation with age. Without taking account of memory outcome, direct contrast between subregions showed higher functional connectivity of anterior, compared to the posterior hippocampus, with regions in the inferior frontal and lateral temporal lobes, and higher functional connectivity of posterior, compared to the anterior hippocampus, with regions in the medial and superior frontal, inferior parietal, and occipital lobes. A direct contrast between the memory-related connectivity patterns of anterior and posterior hippocampus identified a region in the medial frontal cortex, with which anterior and posterior hippocampus was differentially functionally connected. Finally, we identified age differences in memory-related differential hippocampal functional connectivity with several frontal and visual/sensory cortices, underscoring the importance of examining age differences in the patterns of hippocampal connectivity. Moreover, the specific patterns of differential anterior and posterior functional connectivity indicate an increase in the functional specialization along the long axis of the hippocampus and a dynamic shift in hippocampal connectivity patterns that supports memory development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Role of Moderating Variables on BOLD fMRI Response During Semantic Verbal Fluency and Finger Tapping in Active and Educated Healthy Seniors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00203</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Semantic verbal fluency is among the most employed tasks in cognitive aging research and substantial work is devoted to understanding the underlying mechanisms behind age-related differences at the neural and behavioral levels. The present investigation aimed to evaluate the role of moderating variables, such as age, sex, MMSE, and proxies of cognitive reserve (CR) on the hemodynamic response evoked by semantic verbal fluency in healthy young and healthy older adults. So far, no study has been conducted to this end. To elucidate the exclusive effect of the mentioned variables on brain activation during semantic fluency, finger tapping was included as a control task. Results showed that disregarding adjustments for age, older adults displayed important parietal activations during semantic fluency as well as during finger-tapping. Specifically, the anterior intra-parietal sulcus (IPS) and left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) were areas activated in both tasks in the older group. Younger adults, only displayed parietal activations related to age and sex when these demographics were employed as predictors. Concerning proxies of CR in semantic fluency, the only vocabulary was an important moderator in both age groups. Higher vocabulary scores were associated with lesser activation in occipital areas. Education did not show significant correlations with brain activity during semantic fluency in any of the groups. However, both CR proxies were significantly correlated to brain activations of older adults during finger tapping. Specifically, vocabulary was associated with frontal regions, while education correlated with parietal lobe and cingulate gyrus. Finally, the effects of MMSE were mostly observed on brain activation of older adults in both tasks. These findings demonstrate that the effects of moderating variables on shaping brain activation are intricate and not exclusive of complex verbal tasks. Thus, before adjusting for “nuisance variables,” their importance needs to be established. This is especially true for samples including older adults for whom a motor task may be a demanding operation due to normal age-related processes of dedifferentiation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Depression is the most common non-motor symptom in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) with unknown mechanisms, but the diagnostic criteria of PD with depression (PDD) are not uniform.&lt;/p&gt;Purpose&lt;p&gt;The aim of the study was to investigate interhemispheric interactions between PDD patients and patients with PD without depression (PDND).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) combined with the seed-based method was used to investigate intrinsic resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in 33 PDD patients, 60 PDND, and 47 healthy controls (HCs).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;PDD patients exhibited a decreased VMHC in the bilateral medial frontal gyrus and paracentral lobule (MFG/PCL) than did PDND patients. Parkinson’s disease with depression had a decreased VMHC in the bilateral precentral gyrus than had PDND and HC (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Parkinson’s disease with depression had a decreased homotopic RSFC from the medial frontal gyrus (MFG)/PCL to the contralateral supplementary motor area (SMA) than had PDND (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The decreased homotopic RSFC from the right MFG/PCL to the left SMA was negatively correlated with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores (p &amp;lt; 0.05), but not with illness duration, Beck’s Depression Inventory, and Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicated that the occurrence of depression in Parkinson’s disease is associated with the dysfunctional connectivity from the MFG/PCL to the contralateral SMA, which could be used as potential neuroimaging markers for the diagnosis of depression in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Association Between Experimentally Induced Stress, Performance Monitoring, and Response Inhibition: An Event-Related Potential (ERP) Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00189</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Psychological stress is increasingly associated with alterations in performance and affect. Yet, the relationship between experimentally induced psychological stress and neural indices of performance monitoring and error processing, as well as response inhibition, are unclear. Using scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs), we tested the relationship between experimental stress, using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), and the error-related negativity (ERN), error positivity (Pe), and N2 ERP components. A final sample of 71 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to go through the TSST (n = 36; 18 female) or a brief mindfulness relaxation exercise (n = 35; 16 female) immediately followed by a go/no-go task while electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected. Salivary cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure confirmed increased physiological stress in the TSST group relative to control. Reaction times, accuracy, and post-error slowing did not differ by stress group. Two-group (TSST, control) by 2-trial type (correct, incorrect for ERN/Pe; go correct, no-go correct for N2) repeated measures ANOVAs for the ERN, Pe, and N2 showed the expected main effects of trial type; neither the ERN nor the N2 ERP components showed interactions with the stress manipulation. In contrast, the Pe component showed a significant Group by Trial interaction, with reduced Pe amplitude following the stress condition relative to control. Pe amplitude did not, however, correlate with cortisol reactivity. Findings suggest a reduction in Pe amplitude following experimental stress that may be associated with reduced error awareness or attention to errors following the TSST. Given the variability in the extant literature on the relationship between experimentally induced stress and neurophysiological reflections of performance monitoring, we provide another point of data and conclude that better understanding of moderating variables is needed followed by high-powered replication studies to get at the nuance that is not yet understood in the relationship between induced stress and performance monitoring/response inhibition processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Transfer Entropy as a Measure of Brain Connectivity: A Critical Analysis With the Help of Neural Mass Models</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Assessing brain connectivity from electrophysiological signals is of great relevance in neuroscience, but results are still debated and depend crucially on how connectivity is defined and on mathematical instruments utilized. Aim of this work is to assess the capacity of bivariate Transfer Entropy (TE) to evaluate connectivity, using data generated from simple neural mass models of connected Regions of Interest (ROIs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approach: Signals simulating mean field potentials were generated assuming two, three or four ROIs, connected via excitatory or by-synaptic inhibitory links. We investigated whether the presence of a statistically significant connection can be detected and if connection strength can be quantified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main Results: Results suggest that TE can reliably estimate the strength of connectivity if neural populations work in their linear regions, and if the epoch lengths are longer than 10 s. In case of multivariate networks, some spurious connections can emerge (i.e., a statistically significant TE even in the absence of a true connection); however, quite a good correlation between TE and synaptic strength is still preserved. Moreover, TE appears more robust for distal regions (longer delays) compared with proximal regions (smaller delays): an approximate a priori knowledge on this delay can improve the procedure. Finally, non-linear phenomena affect the assessment of connectivity, since they may significantly reduce TE estimation: information transmission between two ROIs may be weak, due to non-linear phenomena, even if a strong causal connection is present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance: Changes in functional connectivity during different tasks or brain conditions, might not always reflect a true change in the connecting network, but rather a change in information transmission. A limitation of the work is the use of bivariate TE. In perspective, the use of multivariate TE can improve estimation and reduce some of the problems encountered in the present study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Spatial Updating Depends on Gravity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00020</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00020</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;As we move through an environment the positions of surrounding objects relative to our body constantly change. Maintaining orientation requires spatial updating, the continuous monitoring of self-motion cues to update external locations. This ability critically depends on the integration of visual, proprioceptive, kinesthetic, and vestibular information. During weightlessness gravity no longer acts as an essential reference, creating a discrepancy between vestibular, visual and sensorimotor signals. Here, we explore the effects of repeated bouts of microgravity and hypergravity on spatial updating performance during parabolic flight. Ten healthy participants (four women, six men) took part in a parabolic flight campaign that comprised a total of 31 parabolas. Each parabola created about 20–25 s of 0 g, preceded and followed by about 20 s of hypergravity (1.8 g). Participants performed a visual-spatial updating task in seated position during 15 parabolas. The task included two updating conditions simulating virtual forward movements of different lengths (short and long), and a static condition with no movement that served as a control condition. Two trials were performed during each phase of the parabola, i.e., at 1 g before the start of the parabola, at 1.8 g during the acceleration phase of the parabola, and during 0 g. Our data demonstrate that 0 g and 1.8 g impaired pointing performance for long updating trials as indicated by increased variability of pointing errors compared to 1 g. In contrast, we found no support for any changes for short updating and static conditions, suggesting that a certain degree of task complexity is required to affect pointing errors. These findings are important for operational requirements during spaceflight because spatial updating is pivotal for navigation when vision is poor or unreliable and objects go out of sight, for example during extravehicular activities in space or the exploration of unfamiliar environments. Future studies should compare the effects on spatial updating during seated and free-floating conditions, and determine at which g-threshold decrements in spatial updating performance emerge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Targeting Microglial Population Dynamics in Alzheimer’s Disease: Are We Ready for a Potential Impact on Immune Function?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting two-thirds of people with dementia in the world. To date, no disease-modifying treatments are available to stop or delay the progression of AD. This chronic neurodegenerative disease is dominated by a strong innate immune response, whereby microglia plays a central role as the main resident macrophage of the brain. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in microglial genes and associated with a delayed onset of AD, highlighting the important role of these cells on the onset and/or progression of the disease. These findings have increased the interest in targeting microglia-associated neuroinflammation as a potentially disease-modifying therapeutic approach for AD. In this review we provide an overview on the contribution of microglia to the pathophysiology of AD, focusing on the main regulatory pathways controlling microglial population dynamics during the neuroinflammatory response, such as the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), its ligands (the colony-stimulating factor 1 and interleukin 34) and the transcription factor PU.1. We also discuss the current therapeutic strategies targeting proliferation to modulate microglia-associated neuroinflammation and their potential impact on peripheral immune cell populations in the short and long-term. Understanding the effects of immunomodulatory approaches on microglia and other immune cell types might be critical for developing specific, effective, and safe therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A Whole-Brain Cell-Type-Specific Sparse Neuron Labeling Method and Its Application in a Shank3 Autistic Mouse Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Single neurons, as the basic unit of the brain, consist of a cell body and processes, including dendrites and axons. Even neurons of the same type show various subtle process characteristics to fit into the diverse neural circuits. Different cell types of neurons form complicated circuits in the brain. Therefore, detailed neuronal morphology is required to understand normal neuronal function and pathological mechanisms, such as those that occur in autism. Here, we developed a strategy to sparsely label the same type of neurons throughout the whole brain and tested its application in an autistic animal model—Shank3 knockout (KO) mice. To achieve this, we designed an adeno-associated virus (AAV) that expresses Cre recombinase-dependent regular and membrane-targeted enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under a human synapsin 1 promoter and verified it in several Cre transgenic mice. We could sparsely label the projection neurons in multiple brain areas by retro-ocular injection of the virus into CaMKIIα-Cre mice. Then, we analyzed the morphology of the projection neurons in Shank3 KO mice with this method. We found differential dendritic complexity and dendritic spine changes in projection neurons in Shank3 KO mice crossed with CaMKIIα-Cre mice compared with littermate control mice in the striatum, cortex, and hippocampus. By combining this method with various Cre mouse lines crossed with mouse models of disease, we can screen the morphological traits of distinct types of neurons throughout the whole brain that will help us to understand the exact role of the specific cell types of neurons not only in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) mouse models but also in other psychiatric disorder mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Basal Forebrain Modulates Neuronal Response in an Active Olfactory Discrimination Task</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Successful completion of sensory decision-making requires focusing on relevant stimuli, adequate signal/noise ratio for stimulus discrimination, and stimulus valence evaluation. Different brain regions are postulated to play a role in these computations; however, evidence suggests that sensory and decision-making circuits are required to interact through a common neuronal pathway to elicit a context-adequate behavioral response. Recently, the basal forebrain (BF) region has emerged as a good candidate, since its heterogeneous projecting neurons innervate most of the cortical mantle and sensory processing circuits modulating different aspects of the sensory decision-making process. Moreover, evidence indicates that the BF plays an important role in attention and in fast modulation of neuronal activity that enhance visual and olfactory sensory perception. Here, we study in awake mice the involvement of BF in initiation and completion of trials in a reward-driven olfactory detection task. Using tetrode recordings, we find that BF neurons (including cholinergics) are recruited during sensory discrimination, reward, and interestingly slightly before trial initiation in successful discrimination trials. The precue neuronal activity was correlated with animal performance, indicating that this circuit could play an important role in adaptive context-dependent behavioral responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Gestational Exposure to Sodium Valproate Disrupts Fasciculation of the Mesotelencephalic Dopaminergic Tract, With a Selective Reduction of Dopaminergic Output From the Ventral Tegmental Area</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gestational exposure to valproic acid (VPA) is known to cause behavioral deficits of sociability, matching similar alterations in human autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Available data are scarce on the neuromorphological changes in VPA-exposed animals. Here, we focused on alterations of the dopaminergic system, which is implicated in motivation and reward, with relevance to social cohesion. Whole brains from 7-day-old mice born to mothers given a single injection of VPA (400 mg/kg b.wt.) on E13.5 were immunostained against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). They were scanned using the iDISCO method with a laser light-sheet microscope, and the reconstructed images were analyzed in 3D for quantitative morphometry. A marked reduction of mesotelencephalic (MT) axonal fascicles together with a widening of the MT tract were observed in VPA treated mice, while other major brain tracts appeared anatomically intact. We also found a reduction in the abundance of dopaminergic ventral tegmental (VTA) neurons, accompanied by diminished tissue level of DA in ventrobasal telencephalic regions (including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), olfactory tubercle, BST, substantia innominata). Such a reduction of DA was not observed in the non-limbic caudate-putamen. Conversely, the abundance of TH+ cells in the substantia nigra (SN) was increased, presumably due to a compensatory mechanism or to an altered distribution of TH+ neurons occupying the SN and the VTA. The findings suggest that defasciculation of the MT tract and neuronal loss in VTA, followed by diminished dopaminergic input to the ventrobasal telencephalon at a critical time point of embryonic development (E13-E14) may hinder the patterning of certain brain centers underlying decision making and sociability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Dilated Perivascular Space in the Midbrain May Reflect Dopamine Neuronal Degeneration in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The imbalance between the production and clearance of alpha-synuclein and its consequent accumulation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The diminished clearance of alpha-synuclein may be partly attributable to impaired interstitial fluid, which can be reflected by the extent of dilated perivascular space (dPVS). We studied the association between dPVS and dopamine neuronal degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: We screened 71 healthy controls (HCs) and 88 patients from the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. The dPVS was evaluated in different brain regions on axial T2-weighted images, and dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging data was used to elucidate the extent of dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Patients with PD were further divided into two groups (SN + PD and SN − PD groups) according to whether dPVS was observed in the substantia nigra (SN). DAT uptake values and clinical scales were compared between the patients with PD and HCs and against dPVS scores. We also investigated the correlation between baseline dPVS scores and longitudinal DAT changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Relative to the HCs, patients with PD had more dPVS in the SN and basal ganglia (BG). PD patients with dPVS in the SN region exhibited greater expression of tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid (P = 0.038) and a trend towards decreased DAT binding (P = 0.086) relative to those without SN dPVS. No correlations were found between dPVS scores and DAT uptake values or between dPVS scores and longitudinal DAT changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The dPVS in the SN of patients with PD may reflect the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Despite known associations of lower serum uric acid (UA) with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia or AD-related cognitive impairment, little is known regarding the underlying patho-mechanisms. We aimed to examine the relationships of serum UA with in vivo AD pathologies including cerebral beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau deposition, AD-signature region cerebral glucose metabolism (AD-CM), and white matter hyperintensities (WMH). We also investigated the association between serum UA and cognitive performance, and then assessed whether such an association is mediated by the brain pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 430 non-demented older adults underwent comprehensive clinical assessments, measurement of serum UA level, and multimodal brain imaging, including Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography (PET), AV-1451 PET, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, and magnetic resonance imaging scans. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and word list recall (WLR) test scores were used to measure cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Serum UA level was significantly associated with AD-CM, but not with Aβ deposition, tau deposition, or WMH volume. Serum UA levels also had significant association with WLR and marginal association with MMSE; such associations disappeared when AD-CM was controlled as a covariate, indicating that AD-CM has a mediating effect.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The findings of the present study indicate that there is an association of low serum UA with AD-related cerebral hypometabolism, and whether this represents a causal relationship remains to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Translation Imaging in Parkinson’s Disease: Focus on Neuroinflammation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the appearance of α-synuclein insoluble aggregates known as Lewy bodies. Neurodegeneration is accompanied by neuroinflammation mediated by cytokines and chemokines produced by the activated microglia. Several studies demonstrated that such an inflammatory process is an early event, and contributes to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions. α-synuclein fibrillization and aggregation activate microglia and contribute to disease onset and progression. Mutations in different genes exacerbate the inflammatory phenotype in the monogenic compared to sporadic forms of PD. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) with selected radiopharmaceuticals allow in vivo imaging of molecular modifications in the brain of living subjects. Several publications showed a reduction of dopaminergic terminals and dopamine (DA) content in the basal ganglia, starting from the early stages of the disease. Moreover, non-dopaminergic neuronal pathways are also affected, as shown by in vivo studies with serotonergic and glutamatergic radiotracers. The role played by the immune system during illness progression could be investigated with PET ligands that target the microglia/macrophage Translocator protein (TSPO) receptor. These agents have been used in PD patients and rodent models, although often without attempting correlations with other molecular or functional parameters. For example, neurodegeneration and brain plasticity can be monitored using the metabolic marker 2-Deoxy-2-[&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fluoroglucose ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-FDG), while oxidative stress can be probed using the copper-labeled diacetyl-bis(N-methyl-thiosemicarbazone) ([Cu]-ATSM) radioligand, whose striatal-specific binding ratio in PD patients seems to correlate with a disease rating scale and motor scores. Also, structural and functional modifications during disease progression may be evaluated by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), using different parameters as iron content or cerebral volume. In this review article, we propose an overview of in vivo clinical and non-clinical imaging research on neuroinflammation as an emerging marker of early PD. We also discuss how multimodal-imaging approaches could provide more insights into the role of the inflammatory process and related events in PD development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mild Cognitive Impairment Staging Yields Genetic Susceptibility, Biomarker, and Neuroimaging Differences</title>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;While Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is divided into severity stages, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains a solitary construct despite clinical and prognostic heterogeneity. This study aimed to characterize differences in genetic, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), neuroimaging, and neuropsychological markers across clinician-derived MCI stages.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Vanderbilt Memory &amp;amp; Aging Project participants with MCI were categorized into 3 severity subtypes at screening based on neuropsychological assessment, functional assessment, and Clinical Dementia Rating interview, including mild (n = 18, 75 ± 8 years), moderate (n = 89 72 ± 7 years), and severe subtypes (n = 18, 78 ± 8 years). At enrollment, participants underwent neuropsychological testing, 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and optional fasting lumbar puncture to obtain CSF. Neuropsychological testing and MRI were repeated at 18-months, 3-years, and 5-years with a mean follow-up time of 3.3 years. Ordinary least square regressions examined cross-sectional associations between MCI severity and apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 status, CSF biomarkers of amyloid beta (Aβ), phosphorylated tau, total tau, and synaptic dysfunction (neurogranin), baseline neuroimaging biomarkers, and baseline neuropsychological performance. Longitudinal associations between baseline MCI severity and neuroimaging and neuropsychological trajectory were assessed using linear mixed effects models with random intercepts and slopes and a follow-up time interaction. Analyses adjusted for baseline age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and intracranial volume for MRI models.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Stages differed at baseline on APOE-ε4 status (early &amp;lt; middle = late; p-values &amp;lt; 0.03) and CSF Aβ (early &amp;gt; middle = late), phosphorylated and total tau (early = middle &amp;lt; late; p-values &amp;lt; 0.05), and neurogranin concentrations (early = middle &amp;lt; late; p-values &amp;lt; 0.05). MCI stage related to greater longitudinal cognitive decline, hippocampal atrophy, and inferior lateral ventricle dilation (early &amp;lt; late; p-values &amp;lt; 0.03).&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;Clinician staging of MCI severity yielded longitudinal cognitive trajectory and structural neuroimaging differences in regions susceptible to AD neuropathology and neurodegeneration. As expected, participants with more severe MCI symptoms at study entry had greater cognitive decline and gray matter atrophy over time. Differences are likely attributable to baseline differences in amyloidosis, tau, and synaptic dysfunction. MCI staging may provide insight into underlying pathology, prognosis, and therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Comparative Efficacy of Multiple Interventions for Mild Cognitive Impairment in Alzheimer's Disease: A Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00121</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00121</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the early phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of early intervention for MCI is to decrease the rate of conversion from MCI to AD. However, the efficacy of multiple interventions in MCI, and the optimal methods of delivery, remain controversial. We aimed to compare and rank the treatment methods for MCI in AD, in order to find an optimal intervention for MCI and a way to prevent or delay the occurrence of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Pair-wise and network meta-analysis were conducted to integrate the treatment effectiveness through direct and indirect evidence. Four English databases and three Chinese databases were searched for international registers of eligible published, single or double blind, randomized controlled trials up to September 31st 2019. We included nine comparative interventions: pharmacological therapies which incorporated cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI), ginkgo, nimodipine, and Chinese medicine; non-pharmacological therapies comprising of acupuncture, music therapy, exercise therapy, and nutrition therapy; and a placebo group. The primary outcome was the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. The secondary outcome was the AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Twenty-eight trials were eligible, including 6,863 participants. In the direct meta-analysis, as for the Mini-Mental State Examination scale, the ChEIs (MD: −0.38; 95% CI: −0.74, −0.01), Chinese medicine (MD: −0.31; 95% CI: −0.75, 0.13), exercise therapy (MD: −0.50; 95% CI: −0.65, −0.35), music therapy (MD: −1.71; 95% CI: −4.49, 1.07), were statistically more efficient than placebo. For AD Assessment Scalecognitive subscale outcome, ChEIs (MD: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.68), Acupuncture (MD: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.28, 1.44), Chinese medicine (MD: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.73) and exercise (MD: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.73) were better than placebo. In the network meta-analysis, the MMSE outcome ranked music therapy (59%) as the best and Acupuncture (26%) as second. Nutrition and Ginkgo treatment had the lowest rank among all interventions. For ADAS-cog outcome, acupuncture (52) ranked the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Among the nine treatments studied, music therapy appears to be the best treatment for MCI, followed by acupuncture. Our study provides new insights into potential clinical treatments for MCI due to AD, and may aid the development of guidelines for MCI in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Targeted sequencing of genomic regions is a cost- and time-efficient approach for screening patient cohorts. We present a fast and efficient workflow to analyze highly imbalanced, targeted next-generation sequencing data generated using molecular inversion probe (MIP) capture. Our Snakemake pipeline performs sample demultiplexing, overlap paired-end merging, alignment, MIP-arm trimming, variant calling, coverage analysis and report generation. Further, we support the analysis of probes specifically designed to capture certain structural variants and can assign sex using Y-chromosome-unique probes. In a user-friendly HTML report, we summarize all these results including covered, incomplete or missing regions, called variants and their predicted effects. We developed and tested our pipeline using the hemophilia A &amp;amp; B MIP design from the “My Life, Our Future” initiative. HemoMIPs is available as an open-source tool on GitHub at: https://github.com/kircherlab/hemoMIPs&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hAGb_mEQjv8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Discriminating between negative cooperativity and ligand binding to independent sites using pre-equilibrium properties of binding curves</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Federico Sevlever, Juan Pablo Di Bella, Alejandra C. Ventura&lt;/p&gt;

Negative cooperativity is a phenomenon in which the binding of a first ligand or substrate molecule decreases the rate of subsequent binding. This definition is not exclusive to ligand-receptor binding, it holds whenever two or more molecules undergo two successive binding events. Negative cooperativity turns the binding curve more graded and cannot be distinguished from two independent and different binding events based on equilibrium measurements only. The need of kinetic data for this purpose was already reported. Here, we study the binding response as a function of the amount of ligand, at different times, from very early times since ligand is added and until equilibrium is reached. Over those binding curves measured at different times, we compute the dynamic range: the fold change required in input to elicit a change from 10 to 90% of maximum output, finding that it evolves in time differently and controlled by different parameters in the two situations that are identical in equilibrium. Deciphering which is the microscopic model that leads to a given binding curve adds understanding on the molecular mechanisms at play, and thus, is a valuable tool. The methods developed in this article were tested both with simulated and experimental data, showing to be robust to noise and experimental constraints.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oqA0bKDI_Zg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Transmembrane helix association is a fundamental step in the folding of helical membrane proteins. The prototypical example of this association is formation of the glycophorin dimer. While its structure and stability have been well-characterized experimentally, the detailed assembly mechanism is harder to obtain. Here, we use all-atom simulations within phospholipid membrane to study glycophorin association. We find that initial association results in the formation of a non-native intermediate, separated by a significant free energy barrier from the dimer with a native binding interface. We have used transition-path sampling to determine the association mechanism. We find that the mechanism of the initial bimolecular association to form the intermediate state can be mediated by many possible contacts, but seems to be particularly favoured by formation of non-native contacts between the C-termini of the two helices. On the other hand, the contacts which are key to determining progression from the intermediate to the native state are those which define the native binding interface, reminiscent of the role played by native contacts in determining folding of globular proteins. As a check on the simulations, we have computed association and dissociation rates from the transition-path sampling. We obtain results in reasonable accord with available experimental data, after correcting for differences in native state stability. Our results yield an atomistic description of the mechanism for a simple prototype of helical membrane protein folding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1Sn_ospOBpI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Abolfazl Ramezanpour, Alireza Mashaghi&lt;/p&gt;

We study the time evolution of symptoms (signs) with some defects in the dynamics of a reaction network as a (microscopic) model for the progress of disease phenotypes. To this end, we take a large population of reaction networks and follow the stochastic dynamics of the system to see how the development of defects affects the macroscopic states of the signs probability distribution. We start from some plausible definitions for the healthy and disease states along with a dynamical model for the emergence of diseases by a reverse simulated annealing algorithm. The healthy state is defined as a state of maximum objective function, which here is the sum of mutual information between a subset of signal variables and the subset of assigned response variables. A disease phenotype is defined with two parameters controlling the rate of mutations in reactions and the rate of accepting mutations that reduce the objective function. The model can provide the time dependence of the sign probabilities given a disease phenotype. This allows us to obtain the accuracy of diagnosis as a function of time by using a probabilistic model of signs and diseases. The trade-off between the diagnosis accuracy (increasing in time) and the objective function (decreasing in time) can be used to suggest an optimal time for medical intervention. Our model would be useful in particular for a dynamical (history-based) diagnostic problem, to estimate the likelihood of a disease hypothesis given the temporal evolution of the signs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XR2oyGCJvwU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Most sensory systems are remarkable in their temporal precision, reflected in such phrases as “a flash of light” or “a twig snap”. Yet taste is complicated by the transport processes of stimuli through the papilla matrix to reach taste receptors, processes that are poorly understood. We computationally modeled the surface of the human tongue as a microfiber porous medium and found that time-concentration profiles within the papilla zone rise with significant delay that well match experimental ratings of perceived taste intensity to a range of sweet and salty stimuli for both rapid pulses and longer sip-and-hold exposures. Diffusivity of these taste stimuli, determined mostly by molecular size, correlates greatly with time and slope to reach peak intensity: smaller molecular size may lead to quicker taste perception. Our study demonstrates the novelty of modeling the human tongue as a porous material to drastically simplify computational approaches and that peripheral transport processes may significantly affect the temporal profile of taste perception, at least to sweet and salty compounds.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KX7gG3hdNbw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: G-OnRamp: Generating genome browsers to facilitate undergraduate-driven collaborative genome annotation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007863</guid>

Scientists are sequencing new genomes at an increasing rate with the goal of associating genome contents with phenotypic traits. After a new genome is sequenced and assembled, structural gene annotation is often the first step in analysis. Despite advances in computational gene prediction algorithms, most eukaryotic genomes still benefit from manual gene annotation. This requires access to good genome browsers to enable annotators to visualize and evaluate multiple lines of evidence (e.g., sequence similarity, RNA sequencing [RNA-Seq] results, gene predictions, repeats) and necessitates many volunteers to participate in the work. To address the technical barriers to creating genome browsers, the Genomics Education Partnership (GEP; https://gep.wustl.edu/) has partnered with the Galaxy Project (https://galaxyproject.org) to develop G-OnRamp (http://g-onramp.org), a web-based platform for creating UCSC Genome Browser Assembly Hubs and JBrowse genome browsers. G-OnRamp also converts a JBrowse instance into an Apollo instance for collaborative genome annotations in research and educational settings. The genome browsers produced can be transferred to the CyVerse Data Store for long-term access. G-OnRamp enables researchers to easily visualize their experimental results, educators to create Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) centered on genome annotation, and students to participate in genomics research. In the process, students learn about genes/genomes and about how to utilize large datasets. Development of G-OnRamp was guided by extensive user feedback. Sixty-five researchers/educators from &amp;gt;40 institutions participated through in-person workshops, which produced &amp;gt;20 genome browsers now available for research and education. Genome browsers generated for four parasitoid wasp species have been used in a CURE engaging students at 15 colleges and universities. Our assessment results in the classroom demonstrate that the genome browsers produced by G-OnRamp are effective tools for engaging undergraduates in research and in enabling their contributions to the scientific literature in genomics. Expansion of such genomics research/education partnerships will be beneficial to researchers, faculty, and students alike.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZONxdZNiNI0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Apoptotic cell death can be initiated through the extrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways. While cell cycle progression promotes the responsiveness to intrinsic apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress or spindle poisons, this has not yet been studied conclusively for extrinsic apoptosis. Here, we combined fluorescence-based time-lapse monitoring of cell cycle progression and cell death execution by long-term time-lapse microscopy with sampling-based mathematical modeling to study cell cycle dependency of TRAIL-induced extrinsic apoptosis in NCI-H460/geminin cells. In particular, we investigated the interaction of cell death timing and progression of cell cycle states. We not only found that TRAIL prolongs cycle progression, but in reverse also that cell cycle progression affects the kinetics of TRAIL-induced apoptosis: Cells exposed to TRAIL in G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; died significantly faster than cells stimulated in S/G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/M. The connection between cell cycle state and apoptosis progression was captured by developing a mathematical model, for which parameter estimation revealed that apoptosis progression decelerates in the second half of the cell cycle. Similar results were also obtained when studying HCT-116 cells. Our results therefore reject the null hypothesis of independence between cell cycle progression and extrinsic apoptosis and, supported by simulations and experiments of synchronized cell populations, suggest that unwanted escape from TRAIL-induced apoptosis can be reduced by enriching the fraction of cells in G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phase. Besides novel insight into the interrelation of cell cycle progression and extrinsic apoptosis signaling kinetics, our findings are therefore also relevant for optimizing future TRAIL-based treatment strategies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LkmNTZ3OmGA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Why does poor-quality sleep lead to atherosclerosis? In a diverse sample of over 1,600 individuals, we describe a pathway wherein sleep fragmentation raises inflammatory-related white blood cell counts (neutrophils and monocytes), thereby increasing atherosclerosis severity, even when other common risk factors have been accounted for. Improving sleep quality may thus represent one preventive strategy for lowering inflammatory status and thus atherosclerosis risk, reinforcing public health policies focused on sleep health.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Jgmps9lVGhE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Longitudinal development of hippocampal subregions from early‐ to mid‐childhood</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23218?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early childhood is characterized by vast changes in behaviors supported by the hippocampus and an increased susceptibility of the hippocampus to environmental influences. Thus, it is an important time to investigate the development of the hippocampus. Existing research suggests subregions of the hippocampus (i.e., head, body, tail) have dissociable functions and that the relations between subregions and cognitive abilities vary across development. However, longitudinal research examining age‐related changes in subregions in humans, particularly during early childhood (i.e., 4–6 years), is limited. Using a large sample of 184 healthy 4‐ to 8‐year‐old children, the present study is the first to characterize developmental changes in hippocampal subregion volume from early‐ to mid‐childhood. Results reveal differential developmental trajectories in hippocampal head, body, and tail during this period. Specifically, head volume showed a quadratic pattern of change, and both body and tail showed linear increases, resulting in a pattern of cubic change for total hippocampal volume. Further, main effects of sex on hippocampal volume (males &amp;gt; females) and hemispheric differences in developmental trajectories were observed. These findings provide an improved understanding of the development of the hippocampus and have important implications for research investigating a range of cognitive abilities and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Radiologically Isolated Syndrome: 10‐Year Risk Estimate of a Clinical Event</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25799?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25799?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have previously identified male sex, younger age, and the presence of spinal cord lesions as independent factors that increase the 5‐year risk for evolution from radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) to multiple sclerosis. We investigate here risk factors for the development of a clinical event using a 10‐year, multi‐national, retrospectively‐identified RIS dataset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIS subjects were identified according to 2009 RIS criteria and longitudinally followed as part of a worldwide cohort study. We analyzed data from 21 individual databases from 5 different countries. Associations between clinical and MRI characteristics, and the risk of developing a first clinical event were determined using multivariate Cox regression models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional follow‐up data was available in 277/451 RIS subjects (86% female). Mean age at RIS diagnosis was 37.2 y (range:11–74 y) with a median clinical follow‐up of 6.7 years. The cumulative probability of a first clinical event at 10 years was 51.2%. Age, positive CSF, infratentorial lesions on MRI, and spinal cord lesions, were baseline independent predictors associated with a subsequent clinical event. The presence of gadolinium enhancing lesions during follow‐up was also associated with the risk of a seminal event. Reason for MRI and gadolinium enhancing lesions at baseline did not influence the risk of a subsequent clinical event.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately half of individuals with RIS experience a first clinical event within 10 years of the index MRI. The identification of independent predictors of risk for symptom onset may guide education and clinical management of individuals with RIS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: MRI IN NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASES: AN EMERGING DIAGNOSTIC TOOL AND BIOMARKER FOR PROGNOSIS AND EFFICACY</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25804?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25804?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is an unmet need to identify biomarkers sensitive to change in rare, slowly progressive neuromuscular diseases. Quantitative MRI of muscle may offer this opportunity, is non‐invasive and can be carried out almost independent of patient‐cooperation and disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle fat content correlates with muscle function in neuromuscular diseases, and changes in fat content precede changes in function, which suggests that muscle MRI is a strong biomarker candidate to predict prognosis and treatment efficacy. In this paper, we review the evidence suggesting that muscle MRI may be an important biomarker for diagnosis and to monitor change in disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions are associated with sporadic essential tremor: Variable disease expressivity on long‐term follow‐up</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25803?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25803?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We screened 662 subjects comprising 462 essential tremor, ET (285 sporadic, 125 with family history and 52 probands from well‐characterized ET pedigrees and 200 controls and identified pathogenic &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC &lt;/i&gt; GGC repeat expansions in four sporadic ET patients. Two patients were followed up for over a decade: one with 90 repeats remained an ET phenotype that did not evolve after forty years, while another patient with 107 repeats developed motor symptoms and cognitive impairment after 8 to 10舁years. Neuroimaging in this patient revealed severe leukoencephalopathy; diffusion‐weighted imaging hyperintensity in the corticomedullary junction and skin biopsy revealed intranuclear inclusions suggestive of intranuclear inclusion body disease (NIID). No GGC repeats above 60舁units were detected in familial ET cases and controls, though four ET patients carried 47–53 “intermediate” repeats. &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC &lt;/i&gt; GGC repeat expansions can be associated with sporadic ET. Carriers presenting with a pure ET phenotype may or may not convert to NIID up to four decades after initial tremor onset.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Brain Metabolite Changes After Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>

	<description>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Previous research has provided evidence that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can reduce severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, the exact mechanism of this effect is still unknown. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has demonstrated low levels of brain metabolites in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), amygdala, and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in individuals with ASD. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of anodal tDCS on social functioning of individuals with ASD, as measured by the social subscale of the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), through correlations between pretreatment and posttreatment concentrations of brain metabolites in the areas of interest (DLPFC, ACC, amygdala, and locus coeruleus) and scores on the ATEC social subscale.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Ten participants with ASD were administered 1 mA anodal tDCS to the left DLPFC for 20 min over five consecutive days. Measures of the ATEC social subscale and the concentrations of brain metabolites were performed before and immediately after the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The results showed a significant decrease between pretreatment and immediately posttreatment in the ATEC social subscale scores, significant increases in N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) and myoinositol (mI)/Cr concentrations, and a decrease in choline (Cho)/Cr concentrations in the left DLPFC and locus coeruleus after tDCS treatment. Significant associations between decreased ATEC social subscale scores and changed concentrations in NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, and mI/Cr in the locus coeruleus were positive.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest that beneficial effects of tDCS in ASD may be due to changes in neuronal and glia cell activity and synaptogenesis in the brain network of individuals with ASD. Further studies with larger sample sizes and control groups are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: LRRK2-Related Parkinson’s Disease Due to Altered Endolysosomal Biology With Variable Lewy Body Pathology: A Hypothesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00556</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in the gene encoding for leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are associated with both familial and sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD). LRRK2 encodes a large protein comprised of a GTPase and a kinase domain. All pathogenic variants converge on enhancing LRRK2 kinase substrate phosphorylation, and distinct LRRK2 kinase inhibitors are currently in various stages of clinical trials. Although the precise pathophysiological functions of LRRK2 remain largely unknown, PD-associated mutants have been shown to alter various intracellular vesicular trafficking pathways, especially those related to endolysosomal protein degradation events. In addition, biochemical studies have identified a subset of Rab proteins, small GTPases required for all vesicular trafficking steps, as substrate proteins for the LRRK2 kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the impact of such phosphorylation on neurodegenerative mechanisms underlying LRRK2-related PD, especially with respect to deregulated Rab-mediated endolysosomal membrane trafficking and protein degradation events. Surprisingly, a significant proportion of PD patients due to LRRK2 mutations display neuronal cell loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta in the absence of any apparent α-synuclein-containing Lewy body neuropathology. These findings suggest that endolysosomal alterations mediated by pathogenic LRRK2 per se are not sufficient to cause α-synuclein aggregation. Here, we will review current knowledge about the link between pathogenic LRRK2, Rab protein phosphorylation and endolysosomal trafficking alterations, and we will propose a testable working model whereby LRRK2-related PD may present with variable LB pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;During presurgical evaluation for focal epilepsy patients, the evidence supporting the use of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) for delineating the epileptogenic zone (EZ) increased over the past decade. This study aims to develop and validate an integrated automatic detection, classification and imaging pipeline of HFOs with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) to narrow the gap between HFOs quantitative analysis and clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The proposed pipeline includes stages of channel inclusion, candidate HFOs detection and automatic labeling with four trained convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers and HFOs sorting based on occurrence rate and imaging. We first evaluated the initial detector using an open simulated dataset. After that, we validated our full algorithm in a 20-patient cohort against three assumptions based on previous studies. Classified HFOs results were compared with seizure onset zone (SOZ) channels for their concordance. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) were calculated representing the prediction ability of the labeled HFOs outputs for SOZ.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The initial detector demonstrated satisfactory performance on the simulated dataset. The four CNN classifiers converged quickly during training, and the accuracies on the validation dataset were above 95%. The localization value of HFOs was significantly improved by HFOs classification. The AUC values of the 20 testing patients increased after HFO classification, indicating a satisfactory prediction value of the proposed algorithm for EZ identification.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our detector can provide robust HFOs analysis results revealing EZ at the individual level, which may ultimately push forward the transitioning of HFOs analysis into a meaningful part of the presurgical evaluation and surgical planning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The fruit fly compound eye is a premier experimental system for modeling human neurodegenerative diseases. The disruption of the retinal geometry has been historically assessed using time-consuming and poorly reliable techniques such as histology or pseudopupil manual counting. Recent semiautomated quantification approaches rely either on manual region-of-interest delimitation or engineered features to estimate the extent of degeneration. This work presents a fully automated classification pipeline of bright-field images based on orientated gradient descriptors and machine learning techniques. An initial region-of-interest extraction is performed, applying morphological kernels and Euclidean distance-to-centroid thresholding. Image classification algorithms are trained on these regions (support vector machine, decision trees, random forest, and convolutional neural network), and their performance is evaluated on independent, unseen datasets. The combinations of oriented gradient + gaussian kernel Support Vector Machine [0.97 accuracy and 0.98 area under the curve (AUC)] and fine-tuned pre-trained convolutional neural network (0.98 accuracy and 0.99 AUC) yielded the best results overall. The proposed method provides a robust quantification framework that can be generalized to address the loss of regularity in biological patterns similar to the Drosophila eye surface and speeds up the processing of large sample batches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00491</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;We aimed to construct and validate a nomogram model based on the combination of radiomic features and satellite sign number for predicting intracerebral hematoma expansion.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 129 patients from two institutions were enrolled in this study. The preprocessed initial CT images were used for radiomic feature extraction. The ANOVA-Kruskal–Wallis test and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were applied to identify candidate radiomic features and construct the Radscore. A nomogram model was developed by integrating the Radscore with a satellite sign number. The discrimination performance of the proposed model was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the predictive accuracy was assessed via a calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival analysis were performed to evaluate the clinical value of the model.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Four optimal features were ultimately selected and contributed to the Radscore construction. A positive correlation was observed between the satellite sign number and Radscore (Pearson’s r: 0.451). The nomogram model showed the best performance with high area under the curves in both training cohort (0.881, sensitivity: 0.973; specificity: 0.787) and external validation cohort (0.857, sensitivity: 0.950; specificity: 0.766). The calibration curve, DCA, and KM analysis indicated the high accuracy and clinical usefulness of the nomogram model for hematoma expansion prediction.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;A nomogram model of integrated radiomic signature and satellite sign number based on noncontrast CT images could serve as a reliable and convenient measurement of hematoma expansion prediction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: The Mechanisms of Nuclear Proteotoxicity in Polyglutamine Spinocerebellar Ataxias</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Polyglutamine (polyQ) spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are the most prevalent subset of SCAs and share the aberrant expansion of Q-encoding CAG repeats within the coding sequences of disease-responsible genes as their common genetic cause. These polyQ SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17) are inherited neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the progressive atrophy of the cerebellum and connected regions of the nervous system, which leads to loss of fine muscle movement coordination. Upon the expansion of polyQ repeats, the mutated proteins typically accumulate disproportionately in the neuronal nucleus, where they sequester various target molecules, including transcription factors and other nuclear proteins. However, it is not yet clearly understood how CAG repeat expansion takes place or how expanded polyQ proteins accumulate in the nucleus. In this article, we review the current knowledge on the molecular and cellular bases of nuclear proteotoxicity of polyQ proteins in SCAs and present our perspectives on the remaining issues surrounding these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Multimodal MRI Longitudinal Assessment of White and Gray Matter in Different SPG Types of Hereditary Spastic Paraparesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00325</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00325</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are a group of genetically and clinically heterogeneous neurologic disorders. Hereby we describe a relatively large group of patients (pts) affected by HSP studied at baseline (31 pts) and at follow-up (mean period 28.9 ± 8.4 months; 23 pts) with multimodal advanced MRI: high-resolution T1 images for voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). An age-matched healthy control (HC) group underwent the same neuroimaging protocol in a time schedule matched with the HSP patients. At baseline, VBM showed gray matter (GM) reduction in HSP in the right pre-frontal cortex and bilaterally in the thalami. MRS at baseline depicted in HSP patients compared to the HC group reduction of NAA/Cr ratio in the right pre-frontal region, increase of Cho/Cr ratio in the right pre-central regions, and increase of mI/Cr ratio on the left pre-central area. At cross-sectional follow-up analysis and longitudinal evaluation, no VBM and MRS statistically significant results were obtained. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis showed widespread DTI brain white matter (WM) alterations in patients compared to HC at baseline, which are characterized by reduction of fractional anisotropy (FA) and increase of mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity, as confirmed on cross-analysis of the follow-up dataset. A longitudinal analysis with TBSS in HSP patients did not show significant variations, while upon applying region-based analysis we found increased FA and decreased MD and AD in specific brain WM fiber complex during follow-up. The changes were not correlated with the clinical presentation (pure vs complicated HSP), motor function, and motility indexes or history of specific treatments (botulinum toxin). In conclusion, the cross-sectional analysis of the multiparametric MRI data in our HSP patients confirmed the non-prominent involvement of the cortex in the primary motor regions but rather of other more associative areas. On the contrary, DTI demonstrated a widespread involvement of the brain WM, including the primary motor regions, which was confirmed at follow-up. The longitudinal analysis revealed an apparent inversion of tendency when considering the expected evolution of a neurodegenerative process: we detected an increase of FA and a decrease of MD and AD. These time-related modifications may suggest a repair attempt by the residual central WM fibers, which requires confirmation with a larger group of patients and with a longer time interval.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00289</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00289</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;MVPA-Light is a MATLAB toolbox for multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). It provides native implementations of a range of classifiers and regression models, using modern optimization algorithms. High-level functions allow for the multivariate analysis of multi-dimensional data, including generalization (e.g., time x time) and searchlight analysis. The toolbox performs cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and nested preprocessing. It computes various classification and regression metrics and establishes their statistical significance, is modular and easily extendable. Furthermore, it offers interfaces for LIBSVM and LIBLINEAR as well as an integration into the FieldTrip neuroimaging toolbox. After introducing MVPA-Light, example analyses of MEG and fMRI datasets, and benchmarking results on the classifiers and regression models are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neurophysiological Correlates of Gait in the Human Basal Ganglia and the PPN Region in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00194</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00194</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to characterize the neurophysiological correlates of gait in the human pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) region and the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) cohort. Though much is known about the PPN region through animal studies, there are limited physiological recordings from ambulatory humans. The PPN has recently garnered interest as a potential deep brain stimulation (DBS) target for improving gait and freezing of gait (FoG) in PD. We used bidirectional neurostimulators to record from the human PPN region and GPi in a small cohort of severely affected PD subjects with FoG despite optimized dopaminergic medications. Five subjects, with confirmed on-dopaminergic medication FoG, were implanted with bilateral GPi and bilateral PPN region DBS electrodes. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained during various gait tasks for 5 months postoperatively in both the off- and on-medication conditions (obtained during the no stimulation condition). The results revealed suppression of low beta power in the GPi and a 1–8 Hz modulation in the PPN region which correlated with human gait. The PPN feature correlated with walking speed. GPi beta desynchronization and PPN low-frequency synchronization were observed as subjects progressed from rest to ambulatory tasks. Our findings add to our understanding of the neurophysiology underpinning gait and will likely contribute to the development of novel therapies for abnormal gait in PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:Clinicaltrials.gov identifier; NCT02318927.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Methylene Blue Prevents Retinal Damage Caused by Perinatal Asphyxia in the Rat</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00157</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00157</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Perinatal asphyxia (PA) is responsible for a large proportion of neonatal deaths and numerous neurological sequelae, including visual dysfunction and blindness. In PA, the retina is exposed to ischemia/reoxygenation, which results in nitric oxide (NO) overproduction and neurotoxicity. We hypothesized that methylene blue (MB), a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, and free-radical scavenger currently used in the clinic, may block this pathway and prevent PA-induced retinal degeneration. Male rat pups were subjected to an experimental model of PA. Four groups were studied: normally delivered (CTL), normally delivered treated with 2 mg Kg-1 MB (MB), exposed to PA for 20 min at 37°C (PA), and exposed to PA and, then, treated with MB (PA-MB). Scotopic electroretinography performed 45 days after birth showed that PA animals had significant defects in the a- and b-waves and oscillatory potentials (OP). The same animals presented a significant increase in the thickness of the inner retina and a large number of TUNEL-positive cells. All these physiological and morphological parameters were significantly prevented by the treatment with MB. Gene expression analysis demonstrated significant increases in iNOS, MMP9, and VEGF in the eyes of PA animals, which were prevented by MB treatment. In conclusion, MB regulates key players of inflammation, matrix remodeling, gliosis, and angiogenesis in the eye and could be used as a treatment to prevent the deleterious visual consequences of PA. Given its safety profile and low cost, MB may be used clinically in places where alternative treatments may be unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Huntingtin-Associated Protein 1 in Mouse Hypothalamus Stabilizes Glucocorticoid Receptor in Stress Response</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00125</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00125</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (Hap1) was initially identified as a brain-enriched protein that binds to the Huntington’s disease protein, huntingtin. Unlike huntingtin that is ubiquitously expressed in the brain, Hap1 is enriched in the brain with the highest expression level in the hypothalamus. The selective enrichment of Hap1 in the hypothalamus suggests that Hap1 may play a specific role in hypothalamic function that can regulate metabolism and stress response. Here we report that Hap1 is colocalized and interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in mouse hypothalamic neurons. Genetic depletion of Hap1 reduced the expression level of GR in the hypothalamus. Dexamethasone, a GR agonist, treatment or fasting of mice induced stress, resulting in increased expression of Hap1 in the hypothalamus. However, when Hap1 was absent, these treatments promoted GR reduction in the hypothalamus. In cultured cells, loss of Hap1 shortened the half-life of GR. These findings suggest that Hap1 stabilizes GR in the cytoplasm and that Hap1 dysfunction or deficiency may alter animal’s stress response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Location of the Cell Adhesion Molecule “Coxsackievirus and Adenovirus Receptor” in the Adult Mouse Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00028</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00028</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a single-pass transmembrane cell adhesion molecule (CAM). CAR is expressed in numerous mammalian tissues including the brain, heart, lung, and testes. In epithelial cells, CAR functions are typical of the quintessential roles of numerous CAMs. However, in the brain the multiple roles of CAR are poorly understood. To better understand the physiological role of CAR in the adult brain, characterizing its location is a primordial step to advance our knowledge of its functions. In addition, CAR is responsible for the attachment, internalization, and retrograde transport of canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vectors, which have found a niche in the mapping of neuronal circuits and gene transfer to treat and model neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence to document the global location of CAR in the healthy, young adult mouse brain. Globally, we found that CAR is expressed by maturing and mature neurons in the brain parenchyma and located on the soma and on projections. While CAR occasionally colocalizes with glial fibrillary acidic protein, this overlap was restricted to areas that are associated with adult neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Interactions Between the Serotonergic and Other Neurotransmitter Systems in the Basal Ganglia: Role in Parkinson’s Disease and Adverse Effects of L-DOPA</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00026</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. However, other non-dopaminergic neuronal systems such as the serotonergic system are also involved. Serotonergic dysfunction is associated with non-motor symptoms and complications, including anxiety, depression, dementia, and sleep disturbances. This pathology reduces patient quality of life. Interaction between the serotonergic and other neurotransmitters systems such as dopamine, noradrenaline, glutamate, and GABA controls the activity of striatal neurons and are particularly interesting for understanding the pathophysiology of PD. Moreover, serotonergic dysfunction also causes motor symptoms. Interestingly, serotonergic neurons play an important role in the effects of L-DOPA in advanced PD stages. Serotonergic terminals can convert L-DOPA to dopamine, which mediates dopamine release as a “false” transmitter. The lack of any autoregulatory feedback control in serotonergic neurons to regulate L-DOPA-derived dopamine release contributes to the appearance of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). This mechanism may also be involved in the development of graft-induced dyskinesias (GID), possibly due to the inclusion of serotonin neurons in the grafted tissue. Consistent with this, the administration of serotonergic agonists suppressed LID. In this review article, we summarize the interactions between the serotonergic and other systems. We also discuss the role of the serotonergic system in LID and if therapeutic approaches specifically targeting this system may constitute an effective strategy in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: TDP-43 Is Elevated in Plasma Neuronal-Derived Exosomes of Patients With Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Recently, TDP-43 has been recognized as a common proteinopathy in the “oldest old” and a neuropathological comorbidity in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, since it has a low concentration in cerebrospinal fluid, the presence of TDP-43 in AD is rarely investigated in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four patients with amyloid PET confirmed AD and 15 healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. TDP-43 level in plasma neuronal-derived exosomes (NDEs) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;TDP-43 level was elevated in patients with AD compared with HCs (median 1.08 ng/ml, IQR 0.72–1.37 ng/ml vs. median 0.66 ng/ml, IQR 0.48–0.76 ng/ml, P = 0.002). There was no correlation between TDP-43 level and cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms or APOE genotype in patients with AD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrated increased TDP-43 accumulation in AD patients by examining plasma NDEs, which may provide a window into the effects of TDP-43 on AD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Enriched Environment Decreases Cognitive Impairment in Elderly Rats With Prenatal Mobile Phone Exposure</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mobile phone use has rapidly increased worldwide, and pregnant women are passively or actively exposed to the associated electromagnetic radiation. Maternal cell phone exposure is related to behavioral difficulties in young offspring. However, whether prenatal mobile phone exposure can predispose the elderly offspring to cognitive impairment is unclear. The enriched environment (EE) has shown positive effects on cognition in an immature brain, but its impact on aging offspring after prenatal cell phone exposure is unknown. This study aimed to investigate whether prenatal exposure to mobile phone exerts long-term effects on cognition in elderly rat offspring and whether EE during adulthood can rescue cognitive impairment by altering the synaptic plasticity. Pregnant rats were subjected to prenatal short-term or long-term cell phone exposure and offspring rats were randomly assigned to standard or EE. Spatial learning and memory were investigated using Morris water maze (MWM) in elderly rat offspring. Hippocampal cellular morphology was assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and synaptic ultrastructure was evaluated with transmission electron microscopy. Expression of synaptophysin (SYN), postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were detected by western blot. The results demonstrated that prenatal long-term but not short-term exposure to mobile phone lead to cognitive impairment, morphological changes in the hippocampal cells, reduced synaptic number, decreased SYN, PSD-95, and BDNF expression in elderly offspring, which were alleviated by postnatal EE housing. These findings suggest that prenatal long-term mobile phone exposure may pose life-long adverse effects on elderly offspring and impair cognition by disrupting the synaptic plasticity, which may be reversed by postnatal EE housing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are a class of disorders affecting brain development and function and are characterized by wide genetic and clinical variability. In this review, we discuss the multiple factors that influence the clinical presentation of NDDs, with particular attention to gene vulnerability, mutational load, and the two-hit model. Despite the complex architecture of mutational events associated with NDDs, the various proteins involved appear to converge on common pathways, such as synaptic plasticity/function, chromatin remodelers and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.</description>

Molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses are increasingly popular to explore the genetic architecture of complex traits, but existing studies do not leverage shared regulatory patterns and suffer from a large multiplicity burden, which hampers the detection of weak signals such as &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; associations. Here, we present a fully multivariate proteomic QTL (pQTL) analysis performed with our recently proposed Bayesian method LOCUS on data from two clinical cohorts, with plasma protein levels quantified by mass-spectrometry and aptamer-based assays. Our two-stage study identifies 136 pQTL associations in the first cohort, of which &amp;gt;80% replicate in the second independent cohort and have significant enrichment with functional genomic elements and disease risk loci. Moreover, 78% of the pQTLs whose protein abundance was quantified by both proteomic techniques are confirmed across assays. Our thorough comparisons with standard univariate QTL mapping on (1) these data and (2) synthetic data emulating the real data show how LOCUS borrows strength across correlated protein levels and markers on a genome-wide scale to effectively increase statistical power. Notably, 15% of the pQTLs uncovered by LOCUS would be missed by the univariate approach, including several &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; and pleiotropic hits with successful independent validation. Finally, the analysis of extensive clinical data from the two cohorts indicates that the genetically-driven proteins identified by LOCUS are enriched in associations with low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia and might therefore act as endophenotypes for metabolic diseases. While considerations on the clinical role of the pQTLs are beyond the scope of our work, these findings generate useful hypotheses to be explored in future research; all results are accessible online from our searchable database. Thanks to its efficient variational Bayes implementation, LOCUS can analyse jointly thousands of traits and millions of markers. Its applicability goes beyond pQTL studies, opening new perspectives for large-scale genome-wide association and QTL analyses.

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The connectome of the Caenorhabditis elegans pharynx&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/02b63ab7-546a-43ef-a869-e3e05a9d771b/cne24932-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reconstructed the &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans &lt;/i&gt; adult hermaphrodite pharyngeal nervous system from serial section electron micrographs to generate a weighted pharyngeal connectome. We subjected the pharyngeal wiring diagram to a set of visual, graph theoretic, statistical, and fluorescent‐reporter analyses, revealing a shallow neural structure. Together, our study shows that most pharyngeal neurons exhibit sensory‐motor characteristics, similar to primitive nervous systems comprised of “ur‐neurons.”

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed anatomical maps of individual organs and entire animals have served as invaluable entry points for ensuing dissection of their evolution, development, and function. The pharynx of the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans &lt;/i&gt; is a simple neuromuscular organ with a self‐contained, autonomously acting nervous system, composed of 20 neurons that fall into 14 anatomically distinct types. Using serial electron micrograph (EM) reconstruction, we re‐evaluate here the connectome of the pharyngeal nervous system, providing a novel and more detailed view of its structure and predicted function. Contrasting the previous classification of pharyngeal neurons into distinct inter‐ and motor neuron classes, we provide evidence that most pharyngeal neurons are also likely sensory neurons and most, if not all, pharyngeal neurons also classify as motor neurons. Together with the extensive cross‐connectivity among pharyngeal neurons, which is more widespread than previously realized, the sensory‐motor characteristics of most neurons define a shallow network architecture of the pharyngeal connectome. Network analysis reveals that the patterns of neuronal connections are organized into putative computational modules that reflect the known functional domains of the pharynx. Compared with the somatic nervous system, pharyngeal neurons both physically associate with a larger fraction of their neighbors and create synapses with a greater proportion of their neighbors. We speculate that the overall architecture of the pharyngeal nervous system may be reminiscent of the architecture of ancestral, primitive nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Subthalamic Nucleus Stimulation Modulates Motor Epileptic Activity in Humans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25776?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25776?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmaco‐refractory focal motor epileptic seizures pose a significant challenge. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a recently recognized therapeutic option for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. To identify the specific target for focal motor seizures, we evaluate the modulatory effects of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation because of the critical role of STN in cortico‐subcortical motor processing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven patients with epilepsy with refractory seizures who underwent chronic stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) monitoring were studied in presurgical evaluation. Seizure onset zone was hypothesized to be partially involved in the motor areas in 6 patients. For each patient, one electrode was temporally implanted into the STN that was ipsilateral to the seizure onset zone. The cortical–subcortical seizure propagation was systemically evaluated. The simultaneously electrophysiological responses over distributed cortical areas to STN stimulation at varied frequencies were quantitatively assessed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed the consistent downstream propagation of seizures from the motor cortex toward the ipsilateral STN and remarkable cortical responses on motor cortex to single‐pulse STN stimulation. Furthermore, we showed frequency‐dependent upstream modulatory effect of STN stimulation on motor cortex specifically. In contrast to the enhanced effects of low frequency stimulation, high‐frequency stimulation of the STN can significantly reduce interictal spikes, high‐frequency oscillations over motor cortex disclosing effective connections to the STN.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result showed that the STN is not only engaged in as a propagation network of focal motor seizures but STN stimulation can profoundly modulate the epileptic activity of motor cortex in humans, suggesting a mechanism‐based alternative for patients suffering from refractory focal motor seizures.

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Transient sublethal hypoxia in neonatal rats causes reduced dendritic spines, aberrant synaptic plasticity, and impairments in memory&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/89074f0c-34f5-4918-bfd2-7d7ab804507f/jnr24652-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When neonatal rats were exposed to transient sublethal hypoxia, the hippocampal neurons developed shorter and thinner dendrites, with decreased dendritic spine density, and reduced strength in excitatory synaptic transmission. The rats also showed impaired cognitive performance in spatial learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxic/ischemic insult, a leading cause of functional brain defects, has been extensively studied in both clinical and experimental animal research, including its etiology, neuropathogenesis, and pharmacological interventions. Transient sublethal hypoxia (TSH) is a common clinical occurrence in the perinatal period. However, its effect on early developing brains remains poorly understood. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of TSH on the dendrite and dendritic spine formation, neuronal and synaptic activity, and cognitive behavior of early postnatal Day 1 rat pups. While TSH showed no obvious effect on gross brain morphology, neuron cell density, or glial activation in the hippocampus, we found transient hypoxia did cause significant changes in neuronal structure and function. In brains exposed to TSH, hippocampal neurons developed shorter and thinner dendrites, with decreased dendritic spine density, and reduced strength in excitatory synaptic transmission. Moreover, TSH‐treated rats showed impaired cognitive performance in spatial learning and memory. Our findings demonstrate that TSH in newborn rats can cause significant impairments in synaptic formation and function, and long‐lasting brain functional deficits. Therefore, this study provides a useful animal model for the study of TSH on early developing brains and to explore potential pharmaceutical interventions for patients subjected to TSH insult.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A New Glycogen Storage Disease Caused by a Dominant PYGM Mutation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25771?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25771?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) are severe human disorders resulting from abnormal glucose metabolism, and all previously described GSDs segregate as autosomal recessive or X‐linked traits. In this study, we aimed to molecularly characterize the first family with a dominant GSD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe a dominant GSD family with 13 affected members presenting with adult‐onset muscle weakness, and we provide clinical, metabolic, histological, and ultrastructural data. We performed exome sequencing to uncover the causative gene, and functional experiments in the cell model and on recombinant proteins to investigate the pathogenic effect of the identified mutation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a heterozygous missense mutation in &lt;i&gt;PYGM &lt;/i&gt; segregating with the disease in the family. &lt;i&gt;PYGM &lt;/i&gt; codes for myophosphorylase, the enzyme catalyzing the initial step of glycogen breakdown. Enzymatic tests revealed that the &lt;i&gt;PYGM &lt;/i&gt; mutation impairs the AMP‐independent myophosphorylase activity, whereas the AMP‐dependent activity was preserved. Further functional investigations demonstrated an altered conformation and aggregation of mutant myophosphorylase, and the concurrent accumulation of the intermediate filament desmin in the myofibers of the patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this study describes the first example of a dominant glycogen storage disease in humans, and elucidates the underlying pathomechanisms by deciphering the sequence of events from the PYGM mutation to the accumulation of glycogen in the muscle fibers.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Long-Term Neuroanatomical Consequences of Childhood Maltreatment: Reduced Amygdala Inhibition by Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00028</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Similar to patients with Major depressive disorder (MDD), healthy subjects at risk for depression show hyperactivation of the amygdala as a response to negative emotional expressions. The medial prefrontal cortex is responsible for amygdala control. Analyzing a large cohort of healthy subjects, we aimed to delineate malfunction in amygdala regulation by the medial prefrontal cortex in subjects at increased risk for depression, i.e., with a family history of affective disorders or a personal history of childhood maltreatment. We included a total of 342 healthy subjects from the FOR2107 cohort (www.for2107.de). An emotional face-matching task was used to identify the medial prefrontal cortex and right amygdala. Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) was conducted and neural coupling parameters were obtained for healthy controls with and without particular risk factors for depression. We assigned a genetic risk if subjects had a first-degree relative with an affective disorder and an environmental risk if subjects experienced childhood maltreatment. We then compared amygdala inhibition during emotion processing between groups. Amygdala inhibition by the medial prefrontal cortex was present in subjects without those two risk factors, as indicated by negative model parameter estimates. Having a genetic risk (i.e., a family history) did not result in changes in amygdala inhibition compared to no risk subjects. In contrast, childhood maltreatment as environmental risk has led to a significant reduction of amygdala inhibition by the medial prefrontal cortex. We propose a mechanistic explanation for the amygdala hyperactivity in subjects with particular risk for depression, in particular childhood maltreatment, caused by a malfunctioned amygdala downregulation via the medial prefrontal cortex. As childhood maltreatment is a major environmentalrisk factor for depression, we emphasize the importance of this potential early biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive cognitive decline associated with global brain damage. Initially, intracellular paired helical filaments composed by hyperphosphorylated tau and extracellular deposits of amyloid-β (Aβ) were postulated as the causing factors of the synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal death, detected in AD patients. Therefore, the vast majority of clinical trials were focused on targeting Aβ and tau directly, but no effective treatment has been reported so far. Consequently, only palliative treatments are currently available for AD patients. Over recent years, several studies have suggested the involvement of the purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R), a plasma membrane ionotropic ATP-gated receptor, in the AD brain pathology. In this line, altered expression levels and function of P2X7R were found both in AD patients and AD mouse models. Consequently, genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of P2X7R ameliorated the hallmarks and symptoms of different AD mouse models. In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge about the role of the P2X7R in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: GSK-3β Contributes to Parkinsonian Dopaminergic Neuron Death: Evidence From Conditional Knockout Mice and Tideglusib</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00081</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00081</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) dysregulation has been implicated in nigral dopaminergic neurodegeneration, one of the main pathological features of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The two isoforms, GSK-3α and GSK-3β, have both been suggested to play a detrimental role in neuronal death. To date, several studies have focused on the role of GSK-3β on PD pathogenesis, while the role of GSK-3α has been largely overlooked. Here, we report in situ observations that both GSK-3α and GSK-3β are dephosphorylated at a negatively acting regulatory serine, indicating kinase activation, selectively in nigral dopaminergic neurons following exposure of mice to 1-methyl-4-pheny-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). To identify whether GSK-3α and GSK-3β display functional redundancy in regulating parkinsonian dopaminergic cell death, we analysed dopaminergic neuron-specific Gsk3a null (Gsk3a&lt;sup&gt;ΔDat&lt;/sup&gt;) and Gsk3b null (Gsk3b&lt;sup&gt;ΔDat&lt;/sup&gt;) mice, respectively. We found that Gsk3b&lt;sup&gt;ΔDat&lt;/sup&gt;, but not Gsk3a&lt;sup&gt;ΔDat&lt;/sup&gt;, showed significant resistance to MPTP insult, revealing non-redundancy of GSK-3α and GSK-3β in PD pathogenesis. In addition, we tested the neuroprotective effect of tideglusib, the most clinically advanced inhibitor of GSK-3, in the MPTP model of PD. Administration of higher doses (200 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg) of tideglusib exhibited significant neuroprotection, whereas 50 mg/kg tideglusib failed to prevent dopaminergic neurodegeneration from MPTP toxicity. Administration of 200 mg/kg tideglusib improved motor symptoms of MPTP-treated mice. Together, these data demonstrate GSK-3β and not GSK-3α is critical for parkinsonian neurodegeneration. Our data support the view that GSK-3β acts as a potential therapeutic target in PD and tideglusib would be a candidate drug for PD neuroprotective therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: MRI Features in a Rat Model of H-ABC Tubulinopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00555</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00555</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tubulinopathies are a group of recently described diseases characterized by mutations in the tubulin genes. Mutations in TUBB4A produce diseases such as dystonia type 4 (DYT4) and hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC), which are clinically diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We propose the taiep rat as the first animal model for tubulinopathies. The spontaneous mutant suffers from a syndrome related to a central leukodystrophy and characterized by tremor, ataxia, immobility, epilepsy, and paralysis. The pathological signs presented by these rats and the morphological changes we found by our longitudinal MRI study are similar to those of patients with mutations in TUBB4A. The diffuse atrophy we found in brain, cerebellum and spinal cord is related to the changes detectable in many human tubulinopathies and in particular in H-ABC patients, where myelin degeneration at the level of putamen and cerebellum is a clinical trademark of the disease. We performed Tubb4a exon analysis to corroborate the genetic defect and formulated hypotheses about the effect of amino acid 302 change on protein physiology. Optical microscopy of taiep rat cerebella and spinal cord confirmed the optical density loss in white matter associated with myelin loss, despite the persistence of neural fibers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Object-Based Analyses in FIJI/ImageJ to Measure Local RNA Translation Sites in Neurites in Response to Aβ1-42 Oligomers</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Subcellular protein delivery is especially important in signal transduction and cell behavior, and is typically achieved by localization signals within the protein. However, protein delivery can also rely on localization of mRNAs that are translated at target sites. Although once considered heretical, RNA localization has proven to be highly conserved in eukaryotes. RNA localization and localized translation are especially relevant in polarized cells like neurons where neurites extend dozens to hundreds of centimeters away from the soma. Local translation confers dendrites and axons the capacity to respond to their environment in an acute manner without fully relying on somatic signals. The relevance of local protein synthesis in neuron development, maintenance and disease has not been fully acknowledged until recent years, partly due to the limited amount of locally produced proteins. For instance, in hippocampal neurons levels of newly synthesized somatic proteins can be more than 20–30 times greater than translation levels of neuritic proteins. Thus local translation events can be easily overlooked under the microscope. Here we describe an object-based analysis used to visualize and quantify local RNA translation sites in neurites. Newly synthesized proteins are tagged with puromycin and endogenous RNAs labeled with SYTO. After imaging, signals corresponding to neuritic RNAs and proteins are filtered with a Laplacian operator to enhance the edges. Resulting pixels are converted into objects and selected by automatic masking followed by signal smoothing. Objects corresponding to RNA or protein and colocalized objects (RNA and protein) are quantified along individual neurites. Colocalization between RNA and protein in neurites correspond to newly synthesized proteins arising from localized RNAs and represent localized translation sites. To test the validity of our analyses we have compared control neurons to Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;-treated neurons. Aβ is involved in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease and was previously reported to induce local translation in axons and dendrites which in turn contributes to the disease. We have observed that Aβ increases the synthesis of neuritic proteins as well as the fraction of translating RNAs in distal sites of the neurite, suggesting an induction of local protein synthesis. Our results thus confirm previous reports and validate our quantification method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Histological Correlates of Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Microscopy in a Mouse Model of Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00543</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common type of focal epilepsy. It is frequently associated with abnormal MRI findings, which are caused by underlying cellular, structural, and chemical changes at the micro-scale. In the current study, it is investigated to which extent these alterations correspond to imaging features detected by high resolution magnetic resonance imaging in the intrahippocampal kainate mouse model of MTLE. Fixed hippocampal and whole-brain sections of mouse brain tissue from nine animals under physiological and chronically epileptic conditions were examined using structural and diffusion-weighted MRI. Microstructural details were investigated based on a direct comparison with immunohistochemical analyses of the same specimen. Within the hippocampal formation, diffusion streamlines could be visualized corresponding to dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells and granule cells, as well as mossy fibers and Schaffer collaterals. Statistically significant changes in diffusivities, fractional anisotropy, and diffusion orientations could be detected in tissue samples from chronically epileptic animals compared to healthy controls, corresponding to microstructural alterations (degeneration of pyramidal cells, dispersion of the granule cell layer, and sprouting of mossy fibers). The diffusion parameters were significantly correlated with histologically determined cell densities. These findings demonstrate that high-resolution diffusion-weighted MRI can resolve subtle microstructural changes in epileptic hippocampal tissue corresponding to histopathological features in MTLE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Monitoring of Stimulus Evoked Murine Somatosensory Cortex Hemodynamic Activity With Volumetric Multi-Spectral Optoacoustic Tomography</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory stimulation is an attractive paradigm for studying brain activity using various optical-, ultrasound- and MRI-based functional neuroimaging methods. Optoacoustics has been recently suggested as a powerful new tool for scalable mapping of multiple hemodynamic parameters with rich contrast and previously unachievable spatio-temporal resolution. Yet, its utility for studying the processing of peripheral inputs at the whole brain level has so far not been quantified. We employed volumetric multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (vMSOT) to non-invasively monitor the HbO, HbR, and HbT dynamics across the mouse somatosensory cortex evoked by electrical paw stimuli. We show that elevated contralateral activation is preserved in the HbO map (invisible to MRI) under isoflurane anesthesia. Brain activation is shown to be predominantly confined to the somatosensory cortex, with strongest activation in the hindpaw region of the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Furthermore, vMSOT detected the presence of an initial dip in the contralateral hindpaw region in the delta HbO channel. Sensorimotor cortical activity was identified over all other regions in HbT and HbO but not in HbR. Pearson’s correlation mapping enabled localizing the response to the sensorimotor cortex further highlighting the ability of vMSOT to bridge over imaging performance deficiencies of other functional neuroimaging modalities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Applications of Resting-State fNIRS in the Developing Brain: A Review From the Connectome Perspective</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00476</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Early brain development from infancy through childhood is closely related to the development of cognition and behavior in later life. Human brain connectome is a novel framework for describing topological organization of the developing brain. Resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), with a natural scanning environment, low cost, and high portability, is considered as an emerging imaging technique and has shown valuable potential in exploring brain network architecture and its changes during the development. Here, we review the recent advances involving typical and atypical development of the brain connectome from neonates to children using resting-state fNIRS imaging. This review highlights that the combination of brain connectome and resting-state fNIRS imaging offers a promising framework for understanding human brain development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Stress-Induced Microstructural Alterations Correlate With the Cognitive Performance of Rats: A Longitudinal in vivo Diffusion Tensor Imaging Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00474</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00474</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Stress-induced cellular changes in limbic brain structures contribute to the development of various psychopathologies. In vivo detection of these microstructural changes may help us to develop objective biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an advanced neuroimaging technique that enables the non-invasive examination of white matter integrity and provides insights into the microstructure of pathways connecting brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Our aim was to examine the temporal dynamics of stress-induced structural changes with repeated in vivo DTI scans and correlate them with behavioral alterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Out of 32 young adult male rats, 16 were exposed to daily immobilization stress for 3 weeks. Four DTI measurements were done: one before the stress exposure (baseline), two scans during the stress (acute and chronic phases), and a last one 2 weeks after the end of the stress protocol (recovery). We used a 4.7T small-animal MRI system and examined 18 gray and white matter structures calculating the following parameters: fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). T2-weighted images were used for volumetry. Cognitive performance and anxiety levels of the animals were assessed in the Morris water maze, novel object recognition, open field, and elevated plus maze tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Reduced FA and increased MD and RD values were found in the corpus callosum and external capsule of stressed rats. Stress increased RD in the anterior commissure and reduced MD and RD in the amygdala. We observed time-dependent changes in several DTI parameters as the rats matured, but we found no evidence of stress-induced volumetric alterations in the brains. Stressed rats displayed cognitive impairments and we found numerous correlations between the cognitive performance of the animals and between various DTI metrics of the inferior colliculus, corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our data provide further support to the translational value of DTI studies and suggest that chronic stress exposure results in similar white matter microstructural alterations that have been documented in stress-related psychiatric disorders. These DTI findings imply microstructural abnormalities in the brain, which may underlie the cognitive deficits that are often present in stress-related mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Nexus Model of Restricted Interests in Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00212</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00212</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Restricted interests (RIs) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are clinically impairing interests of unusual focus or intensity. They are a subtype of restricted and repetitive behaviors which are one of two diagnostic criteria for the disorder. Despite the near ubiquity of RIs in ASD, the neural basis for their development is not well understood. However, recent cognitive neuroscience findings from nonclinical samples and from individuals with ASD shed light on neural mechanisms that may explain the emergence of RIs. We propose the nexus model of RIs in ASD, a novel conceptualization of this symptom domain that suggests that RIs may reflect a co-opting of brain systems that typically serve to integrate complex attention, memory, semantic, and social communication functions during development. The nexus model of RIs hypothesizes that when social communicative development is compromised, brain functions typically located within the lateral surface of cortex may expand into social processing brain systems and alter cortical representations of various cognitive functions during development. These changes, in turn, promote the development of RIs as an alternative process mediated by these brain networks. The nexus model of RIs makes testable predictions about reciprocal relations between the impaired development of social communication and the emergence of RIs in ASD and suggests novel avenues for treatment development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; edition (WAIS-III) is widely used to evaluate the intelligence quotient (IQ). We aimed to investigate the correlation between the WAIS-III metrics and whole-brain structures using magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The participants were 266 healthy, right-handed individuals (age: 45.6 ± 12.9 years, 98 males and 168 females). IQs were evaluated using the WAIS-III and Japanese Adult Reading Test (JART). Voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging were performed to analyze the correlation of the WAIS-III metrics and JART score with the gray matter volume and white matter integrity, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The verbal IQ significantly and positively correlated with the left gyrus rectus and anterior cingulate gyrus, left posterior insula and planum polare, and left superior and middle frontal gyri volumes (p &amp;lt; 0.05, corrected). The verbal comprehension group index significantly and positively correlated with the left superior and middle frontal gyri, left gyrus rectus and anterior cingulate gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus volumes, while the processing speed group index significantly and positively correlated with the bilateral various regional white matter fractional anisotropy values (p &amp;lt; 0.05, corrected). In contrast, the JART score showed no correlation with any brain structure.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These results suggested the neurostructural bases of the WAIS-III IQs and group indices in the brain of healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Spatial Perspective-Taking in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders: The Predictive Role of Visuospatial and Motor Abilities</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00208</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00208</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite its impact on everyday functioning, spatial perspective-taking has rarely been investigated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and previous findings are surprisingly sparse and inconsistent. In the present study, we aimed to investigate spatial perspective-taking abilities in children and adolescents with ASD without intellectual disabilities, comparing them with a group of typically developing (TD) peers. Our objectives were: (i) to test similarities and differences between these groups in a spatial perspective-taking task; and (ii) to see whether similar or different underlying processes (i.e., fine and gross motor skills, and visuospatial abilities) might account for the groups’ performance in the spatial perspective-taking task. A group of children with ASD (N = 36) was compared with a TD group (N = 39), aged from 8 to 16 years. Participants were administered tasks assessing spatial perspective-taking, fine and gross motor skills, visuo-constructive abilities, visuospatial working memory, visual imagery, and mental rotation. Our results revealed that the ASD group had more difficulty with the spatial perspective-taking task than the TD group. The two groups also had some shared and some different processes that predicted their perspective-taking performance: a significant predictive effect of fine motor skills and visuospatial working memory emerged for both groups, while gross motor skills (i.e., walking heel-to-toe) and visuospatial imagery only revealed a role in the TD group. These findings suggest that different abilities might account for the two groups’ performance in the spatial perspective-taking task. Gross motor skills and complex visuospatial abilities seem to be more important in sustaining spatial perspective-taking ability in typical development than in the event of ASD. Some of the clinical and educational implications of these findings are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Hemispheric Differences in Functional Interactions Between the Dorsal Lateral Prefrontal Cortex and Ipsilateral Motor Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00202</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00202</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in both hemispheres have a central integrative function for motor control and behavior. Understanding the hemispheric difference between DLPFC and ipsilateral motor cortex connection in the resting-state will provide fundamental knowledge to explain the different roles DLPFC plays in motor behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purpose: The current study tested the interactions between the ipsilateral DLPFC and the primary motor cortex (M1) in each hemisphere at rest. We hypothesized that left DLPFC has a greater inhibitory effect on the ipsilateral M1 compared to the right DLPFC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Fourteen right-handed subjects were tested in a dual-coil paired-pulse paradigm using transcranial magnetic stimulation. The conditioning stimulus (CS) was applied to the DLPFC and the test stimulus (TS) was applied to M1. Interstimulus intervals (ISIs) between CS and TS were 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 ms. The result was expressed as a percentage of the mean peak-to-peak amplitude of the unconditioned test pulse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: There was stronger inhibitory effect for the left compared to the right hemisphere at ISIs of 2 (p = 0.045), 10 (p = 0.006), 15 (p = 0.029) and 20 (p = 0.024) ms. There was no significant inhibition or facilitation at any ISI in the right hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The two hemispheres have distinct DLPFC and M1 cortico-cortical connectivity at rest. Left hemisphere DLPFC is dominant in inhibiting ipsilateral M1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Joint Attention During Live Person-to-Person Contact Activates rTPJ, Including a Sub-Component Associated With Spontaneous Eye-to-Eye Contact</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00201</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00201</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Eye-to-eye contact is a spontaneous behavior between interacting partners that occurs naturally during social interactions. However, individuals differ with respect to eye gaze behaviors such as frequency of eye-to-eye contacts, and these variations may reflect underlying differences in social behavior in the population. While the use of eye signaling to indicate a shared object of attention in joint attention tasks has been well-studied, the effects of the natural variation in establishing eye contact during joint attention have not been isolated. Here, we investigate this question using a novel two-person joint attention task. Participants were not instructed regarding the use of eye contacts; thus all mutual eye contact events between interacting partners that occurred during the joint attention task were spontaneous and varied with respect to frequency. We predicted that joint attention systems would be modulated by differences in the social behavior across participant pairs, which could be measured by the frequency of eye contact behavior. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning and eye-tracking to measure the neural signals associated with joint attention in interacting dyads and to record the number of eye contact events between them. Participants engaged in a social joint attention task in which real partners used eye gaze to direct each other’s attention to specific targets. Findings were compared to a non-social joint attention task in which an LED cue directed both partners’ attention to the same target. The social joint attention condition showed greater activity in right temporoparietal junction than the non-social condition, replicating prior joint attention results. Eye-contact frequency modulated the joint attention activity, revealing bilateral activity in social and high level visual areas associated with partners who made more eye contact. Additionally, when the number of mutual eye contact events was used to classify each pair as either “high eye contact” or “low eye contact” dyads, cross-brain coherence analysis revealed greater coherence between high eye contact dyads than low eye contact dyads in these same areas. Together, findings suggest that variation in social behavior as measured by eye contact modulates activity in a subunit of the network associated with joint attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Optogenetic Manipulation of Postsynaptic cAMP Using a Novel Transgenic Mouse Line Enables Synaptic Plasticity and Enhances Depolarization Following Tetanic Stimulation in the Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;cAMP is a positive regulator tightly involved in certain types of synaptic plasticity and related memory functions. However, its spatiotemporal roles at the synaptic and neural circuit levels remain elusive. Using a combination of a cAMP optogenetics approach and voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging with electrophysiological recording, we define a novel capacity of postsynaptic cAMP in enabling dentate gyrus long-term potentiation (LTP) and depolarization in acutely prepared murine hippocampal slices. To manipulate cAMP levels at medial perforant path to granule neuron (MPP-DG) synapses by light, we generated transgenic (Tg) mice expressing photoactivatable adenylyl cyclase (PAC) in DG granule neurons. Using these Tg(CMV-Camk2a-RFP/bPAC)3Koka mice, we recorded field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) from MPP-DG synapses and found that photoactivation of PAC during tetanic stimulation enabled synaptic potentiation that persisted for at least 30 min. This form of LTP was induced without the need for GABA receptor blockade that is typically required for inducing DG plasticity. The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) remained unchanged, indicating the cAMP-dependent LTP was likely postsynaptic. By employing fast fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye (VSD: di-4-ANEPPS) and fluorescence imaging, we found that photoactivation of the PAC actuator enhanced the intensity and extent of dentate gyrus depolarization triggered following tetanic stimulation. These results demonstrate that the elevation of cAMP in granule neurons is capable of rapidly enhancing synaptic strength and neuronal depolarization. The powerful actions of cAMP are consistent with this second messenger having a critical role in the regulation of synaptic function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Inhibition of NLRP3 Inflammasome: A Prospective Target for the Treatment of Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00155</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00155</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is one of the major devastating diseases with no effective medical therapeutics. Because of the high rate of disability and mortality among stroke patients, new treatments are urgently required to decrease brain damage following a stroke. In recent years, the inflammasome is a novel breakthrough point that plays an important role in the stroke, and the inhibition of inflammasome may be an effective method for stroke treatment. Briefly, inflammasome is a multi-protein complex that causes activation of caspase-1 and subsequent production of pro-inflammatory factors including interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1β. Among them, the NLRP3 inflammasome is the most typical inflammasome, which can detect cell damage and mediate inflammatory response to tissue damage in ischemic stroke. The NLRP3 inflammasome has become a key mediator of post-ischemic inflammation, leading to a cascade of inflammatory reactions and cell death eventually. Thus, NLRP3 inflammasome is an ideal therapeutic target due to its important role in the inflammatory response after ischemic stroke. In this mini review article, we will summarize the structure, assembly, and regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome, the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in ischemic stroke, and several treatments targeting NLRP3 inflammasome in ischemic stroke. The further understanding of the mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome in patients with ischemic stroke will provide novel targets for the treatment of cerebral ischemic stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Systemic Inflammation in the Neonatal Period Increases Microglial Density and Oxidative Stress in the Cerebellum of Adult Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory processes occurring in the perinatal period may affect different brain regions, resulting in neurologic sequelae. Injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at different neurodevelopmental stages produces long-term consequences in several brain structures, but there is scarce evidence regarding alterations in the cerebellum. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term consequences on the cerebellum of a systemic inflammatory process induced by neonatal LPS injection. For this, neonatal rats were randomly assigned to three different groups: naïve, sham, and LPS. Saline (sham group) or LPS solution (1 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected on alternate postnatal days (PN) PN1, PN3, PN5, and PN7. Spontaneous activity was evaluated with the open field test in adulthood. The cerebellum was evaluated for different parameters: microglial and Purkinje cell densities, oxidative stress levels, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) mRNA expression. Our results show that administration of LPS did not result in altered spontaneous activity in adult animals. Our data also indicate increased oxidative stress in the cerebellum, as evidenced by an increase in superoxide fluorescence by dihydroethidium (DHE) indicator. Stereological analyses indicated increased microglial density in the cerebellum that was not accompanied by Purkinje cell loss or altered TNF-α expression in adult animals. Interestingly, Purkinje cells ectopically positioned in the granular and molecular layers of the cerebellum were observed in animals of the LPS group. Our data suggest that neonatal LPS exposure causes persistent cellular and molecular changes to the cerebellum, indicating the susceptibility of this region to systemic inflammatory insults in infancy. Further investigation of the consequences of these changes and the development of strategies to avoid those should be subject of future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mammalian neurovascular unit (NVU) is comprised of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. The NVU is the nexus between the cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS). The central component of the NVU is the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which consists of a monolayer of tightly connected endothelial cells covered by pericytes and further surrounded by astrocytic endfeet. In addition to preventing the diffusion of toxic species into the CNS, the BBB endothelium serves as a dynamic regulatory system facilitating the transport of molecules from the bloodstream to the brain and vis versa. The structural integrity and transport functions of the BBB are maintained, in part, by an orchestra of membrane receptors and transporters including members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here, we provide an overview of GPCRs known to regulate mammalian BBB structure and function and discuss how dysregulation of these pathways plays a role in various neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cellular and Molecular Targets of Waterbuck Repellent Blend Odors in Antennae of Glossina fuscipes fuscipes Newstead, 1910</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Insects that transmit many of the world’s deadliest animal diseases, for instance trypanosomosis, find their suitable hosts and avoid non-preferred hosts mostly through olfactory cues. The waterbuck repellent blend (WRB) comprising geranylacetone, guaiacol, pentanoic acid, and δ-octalactone derived from waterbuck skin odor is a repellent to some savannah-adapted tsetse flies and reduces trap catches of riverine species. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with detection and coding of the repellent odors remain to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that WRB inhibited blood feeding in both Glossina pallidipes Austen, 1903 and Glossina fuscipes fuscipes Newstead, 1910. Using the DREAM (Deorphanization of Receptors based on Expression Alterations in odorant receptor mRNA levels) technique, combined with ortholog comparison and molecular docking, we predicted the putative odorant receptors (ORs) for the WRB in G. f. fuscipes, a non-model insect. We show that exposure of G. f. fuscipes in vivo to WRB odorant resulted in up- and downregulation of mRNA transcript of several ORs. The WRB component with strong feeding inhibition altered mRNA transcript differently as compared to an attractant odor, showing these two odors of opposing valence already segregate at the cellular and molecular levels. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the predicted ligand–OR binding pockets consisted mostly of hydrophobic residues with a few hydrogen bonds but a stable interaction. Finally, our electrophysiological response showed the olfactory sensory neurons of G. f. fuscipes tuned to the tsetse repellent components in different sensitivity and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Multiparity – grand multiparity (i.e., five or more childbirths) in particular – has been reported to have an association with increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia or related cognitive decline in women. However, the pathological links underlying this relationship are still unknown. This study was conducted to examine the relationships of multiparity with cerebral amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, brain atrophy, and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In this study, total of 237 older women with 148 cognitively normal and 89 mild cognitive impairment from the Korean Brain Aging Study for Early Diagnosis and Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease (KBASE) were included. Participants underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessments in addition to &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The associations of parity with Aβ deposition, hippocampal volume, cortical volume, WMH volume and mini-mental status examination (MMSE) score were examined.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Participants with grand multiparity showed significantly reduced adjusted hippocampal volume, spatial pattern of atrophy for recognition of AD volume and spatial pattern of atrophy for recognition of brain aging volume even after controlling for potential confounders. Furthermore, MMSE score was also significantly lower in this group. In contrast, grand multiparity did not show any association with global Aβ retention, Aβ positivity rate, or WMH volume, regardless of covariates.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that grand multiparity contributes to cognitive decline or increased dementia risk in older women by aggravating amyloid-independent hippocampal or cortical atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Enriching Hippocampal Memory Function in Older Adults Through Real-World Exploration</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Age-related structural and functional changes in the hippocampus can have a severe impact on hippocampal-dependent memory performance. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a real-world spatial exploration and learning intervention would improve hippocampal-dependent memory performance in healthy older adults. We developed a scavenger hunt task that participants performed over the course of a 4-week behavioral intervention period. Following this intervention, participants’ lure discrimination index (LDI) on the Mnemonic Similarity Task was significantly higher than it was at baseline and greater than that of a No-Contact Control Group, while traditional recognition scores remained relatively unchanged. These results point to the viability of a spatial exploration intervention for improving hippocampal-dependent memory in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;To investigate the efficacy and safety of three H. erinaceus mycelia (EAHE) capsules (350 mg/capsule; containing 5 mg/g erinacine A active ingredient) per day for the treatment of patients with mild Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This study comprised a 3-week no-drug screening period, followed by a 49-week double-blind treatment period with 2-parallel groups in which eligible patients were randomized to either three 5 mg/g EAHE mycelia capsules per day or identical appearing placebo capsules. Cognitive assessments, ophthalmic examinations, biomarker collection, and neuroimaging were followed throughout the study period.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;After 49 weeks of EAHE intervention, a significant decrease in Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument score was noted in the placebo group, a significant improvement in Mini-Mental State Examination score was observed in the EAHE group and a significant Instrumental Activities of Daily Living score difference were found between the two groups. In addition, EAHE group achieved a significantly better contrast sensitivity when compared to the placebo group. Moreover, only the placebo group observed significantly lowered biomarkers such as calcium, albumin, apolipoprotein E4, hemoglobin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor and significantly elevated alpha1-antichymotrypsin and amyloid-beta peptide 1–40 over the study period. Using diffusion tensor imaging, the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values from the arcuate fasciculus region in the dominant hemisphere significantly increased in the placebo group while no significant difference was found in the EAHE group in comparison to their baselines. Moreover, ADC values from the parahippocampal cingulum region in the dominant hemisphere significantly decreased in the EAHE group whereas no significant difference was found in the placebo group when compared to their baselines. Lastly, except for four subjects who dropped out of the study due to abdominal discomfort, nausea, and skin rash, no other adverse events were reported.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Three 350 mg/g EAHE capsules intervention for 49 weeks demonstrated higher CASI, MMSE, and IADL scores and achieved a better contrast sensitivity in patients with mild AD when compared to the placebo group, suggesting that EAHE is safe, well-tolerated, and may be important in achieving neurocognitive benefits.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT04065061.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Excessive Production of Transforming Growth Factor β1 Causes Mural Cell Depletion From Cerebral Small Vessels</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00151</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is increasingly becoming apparent that cerebrovascular dysfunction contributes to the pathogenic processes involved in vascular dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders. Under these pathologic conditions, the degeneration of cerebral blood vessels is frequently accompanied by a loss of mural cells from the vascular walls. Vascular mural cells play pivotal roles in cerebrovascular functions, such as regulation of cerebral blood flow and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, cerebrovascular mural cell impairment is involved in the pathophysiology of vascular-related encephalopathies, and protecting these cells is essential for maintaining brain health. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying mural cell abnormalities is incomplete. Several reports have indicated that dysregulated transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling is involved in the development of cerebral arteriopathies. These studies have specifically suggested the involvement of TGFβ overproduction. Although cerebrovascular toxicity via vascular fibrosis by extracellular matrix accumulation or amyloid deposition is known to occur with enhanced TGFβ production, whether increased TGFβ results in the degeneration of vascular mural cells in vivo remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that chronic TGFβ1 overproduction causes a dropout of mural cells and reduces their coverage on cerebral vessels in both smooth muscle cells and pericytes. Mural cell degeneration was also accompanied by vascular luminal dilation. TGFβ1 overproduction in astrocytes significantly increased TGFβ1 content in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and increased TGFβ signaling-regulated gene expression in both pial arteries and brain capillaries. These results indicate that TGFβ is an important effector that mediates mural cell abnormalities under pathological conditions related to cerebral arteriopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Ketamine exerts rapid antidepressant action in depressed and treatment-resistant depressed patients within hours. At the same time, ketamine elicits a unique form of functional synaptic plasticity that shares several attributes and molecular mechanisms with well-characterized forms of homeostatic synaptic scaling. Lithium is a widely used mood stabilizer also proposed to act via synaptic scaling for its antimanic effects. Several studies to date have identified specific forms of homeostatic synaptic plasticity that are elicited by these drugs used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders. In the last two decades, extensive work on homeostatic synaptic plasticity mechanisms have shown that they diverge from classical synaptic plasticity mechanisms that process and store information and thus present a novel avenue for synaptic regulation with limited direct interference with cognitive processes. In this review, we discuss the intersection of the findings from neuropsychiatric treatments and homeostatic plasticity studies to highlight a potentially wider paradigm for treatment advance.</description>

Learning in a changing, uncertain environment is a difficult problem. A popular solution is to predict future observations and then use surprising outcomes to update those predictions. However, humans also have a sense of confidence that characterizes the precision of their predictions. Bayesian models use a confidence-weighting principle to regulate learning: for a given surprise, the update is smaller when the confidence about the prediction was higher. Prior behavioral evidence indicates that human learning adheres to this confidence-weighting principle. Here, we explored the human brain dynamics sub-tending the confidence-weighting of learning using magneto-encephalography (MEG). During our volatile probability learning task, subjects’ confidence reports conformed with Bayesian inference. MEG revealed several stimulus-evoked brain responses whose amplitude reflected surprise, and some of them were further shaped by confidence: surprise amplified the stimulus-evoked response whereas confidence dampened it. Confidence about predictions also modulated several aspects of the brain state: pupil-linked arousal and beta-range (15–30 Hz) oscillations. The brain state in turn modulated specific stimulus-evoked surprise responses following the confidence-weighting principle. Our results thus indicate that there exist, in the human brain, signals reflecting surprise that are dampened by confidence in a way that is appropriate for learning according to Bayesian inference. They also suggest a mechanism for confidence-weighted learning: confidence about predictions would modulate intrinsic properties of the brain state to amplify or dampen surprise responses evoked by discrepant observations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cCqNonMiEZE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Interpretations of elevated blood levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for drug-induced liver injury often assume that the biomarker is released passively from dying cells. However, the mechanisms driving that release have not been explored experimentally. The usefulness of ALT and related biomarkers will improve by developing mechanism-based explanations of elevated levels that can be expanded and elaborated incrementally. We provide the means to challenge the ability of closely related model mechanisms to generate patterns of simulated hepatic injury and ALT release that scale (or not) to be quantitatively similar to the wet-lab validation targets, which are elevated plasma ALT values following acetaminophen (APAP) exposure in mice. We build on a published model mechanism that helps explain the generation of characteristic spatiotemporal features of APAP hepatotoxicity within hepatic lobules. Discrete event and agent-oriented software methods are most prominent. We instantiate and leverage a small constellation of concrete model mechanisms. Their details during execution help bring into focus ways in which particular sources of uncertainty become entangled with cause-effect details within and across several levels. We scale ALT amounts in virtual mice directly to target plasma ALT values in individual mice. A virtual experiment comprises a set of Monte Carlo simulations. We challenge the sufficiency of four potentially explanatory theories for ALT release. The first of the tested model theories failed to achieve the initial validation target, but each of the three others succeeded. Results for one of the three model mechanisms matched all target ALT values quantitatively. It explains how ALT externalization is the combined consequence of lobular-location-dependent drug-induced cellular damage and hepatocyte death. Falsification of one (or more) of the model mechanisms provides new knowledge and incrementally shrinks the constellation of model mechanisms. The modularity and biomimicry of our explanatory models enable seamless transition from mice to humans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GPPLZ3c2lbU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Amygdala and ventral tegmental area differentially interact with hippocampus and cortical medial temporal lobe during rest in humans</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulatory regions that detect salience, such as amygdala and ventral tegmental area (VTA), have distinct effects on memory. Yet, questions remain about how these modulatory regions target subregions across the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortex. Here, we sought to characterize how VTA and amygdala subregions (i.e., basolateral amygdala and central‐medial amygdala) interact with hippocampus head, body, and tail, as well as cortical MTL areas of perirhinal cortex and parahippocampal cortex in a task‐free state. To quantify these interactions, we used high‐resolution resting state fMRI and characterized pair‐wise, partial correlations across regions‐of‐interest. We found that basolateral amygdala showed greater functional coupling with hippocampus head, hippocampus tail, and perirhinal cortex when compared to either VTA or central‐medial amygdala. Furthermore, the VTA showed greater functional coupling with hippocampus tail when compared to central‐medial amygdala. There were no significant differences in functional coupling with hippocampus body and parahippocampal cortex. These results support a framework by which neuromodulatory regions do not indiscriminately influence all MTL subregions equally, but rather bias information processing to discrete MTL targets. These findings provide a more specified model of the intrinsic properties of systems underlying MTL neuromodulation. This emphasizes the need to consider heterogeneity both across and within neuromodulatory systems to better understand affective memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Altered hippocampal centrality and dynamic anatomical covariance of intracortical microstructure in first episode psychosis</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal circuitry has been posited to be fundamental to positive symptoms in psychosis, but its contributions to other factors important for outcome remains unclear. We hypothesized that longitudinal changes in the hippocampal circuit and concomitant changes of intracortical microstructure are altered in first episode psychosis (FEP) patients and that such changes are associated with negative symptoms and verbal memory. Longitudinal brain scans (2–4 visits over 3–15 months) were acquired for 27 FEP and 29 age‐ and sex‐matched healthy controls. Quantitative T1 maps, sensitive to myelin content, were used to sample the microstructure of the hippocampal subfields and output circuitry (fimbria, alveus, fornix, mammillary bodies), and intracortical regions. Dynamic anatomical covariance in pair‐wise regional trajectories were assessed for each subject, and graph theory was used to calculate a participation coefficient metric that quantifies the similarity/divergence between hippocampal and intracortical microstructure. The mean participation coefficient of the hippocampus was significantly reduced in FEP patients compared with controls, reflecting differences in output hippocampal regions. Importantly, lower participation coefficient of the hippocampal circuit was associated with worse negative symptoms, a relationship that was mediated by changes in verbal memory. This study provides evidence for reduced hippocampal centrality in FEP and concomitant changes in intracortical anatomy.

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;A crabs’ high‐order brain center resolved as a mushroom body‐like structure&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e1409178-400b-4784-9934-4945989f50d7/cne24960-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we show that the hemiellipsoid body of the true crab &lt;i&gt;Neohelice granulata &lt;/i&gt; shares many of the insect mushroom body characters. In this brain center, which has previously been shown to reflect context‐dependent memory, we identified the presence of microglomeruli‐like complexes, input and output regions, aminergic innervation, adult neurogenesis, and elevated expression of proteins necessary for memory processes. &lt;i&gt;In vivo &lt;/i&gt; calcium imaging suggests that, as in insect mushroom bodies, stimuli of different nature can trigger divergent neuronal activity patterns in the output region. The study provides a series of data that is parsimonious with a shared organization of memory centers across crustaceans and insects.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis of a common origin for high‐order memory centers in bilateral animals presents the question of how different brain structures, such as the vertebrate hippocampus and the arthropod mushroom bodies, are both structurally and functionally comparable. Obtaining evidence to support the hypothesis that crustaceans possess structures equivalent to the mushroom bodies that play a role in associative memories has proved challenging. Structural evidence supports that the hemiellipsoid bodies of hermit crabs, crayfish and lobsters, spiny lobsters, and shrimps are homologous to insect mushroom bodies. Although a preliminary description and functional evidence supporting such homology in true crabs (Brachyura) has recently been shown, other authors consider the identification of a possible mushroom body homologue in Brachyura as problematic. Here we present morphological and immunohistochemical data in &lt;i&gt;Neohelice granulata &lt;/i&gt; supporting that crabs possess well‐developed hemiellipsoid bodies that are resolved as mushroom bodies‐like structures. &lt;i&gt;Neohelice &lt;/i&gt; exhibits a peduncle‐like tract, from which processes project into proximal and distal domains with different neuronal specializations. The proximal domains exhibit spines and &lt;i&gt;en passant &lt;/i&gt;‐like processes and are proposed here as regions mainly receiving inputs. The distal domains exhibit a “trauben”‐like compartmentalized structure with bulky terminal specializations and are proposed here as output regions. In addition, we found microglomeruli‐like complexes, adult neurogenesis, aminergic innervation, and elevated expression of proteins necessary for memory processes. Finally, &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; calcium imaging suggests that, as in insect mushroom bodies, the output regions exhibit stimulus‐specific activity. Our results support the shared organization of memory centers across crustaceans and insects.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The zebrafish visual system transmits dimming information via multiple segregated pathways&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5e53b317-4f6f-4fe4-8ed1-eabe96776e76/cne24964-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We examined the visual response properties of genetically targeted neurons in retina, optic tectum, and torus longitudinalis of larval zebrafish. Functional characterization of dimming responsive neurons within these visual areas revealed responses with varied photosensitivity profiles, including: 1) low sensitivity neurons that selectively respond to large light decrements, 2) high sensitivity neurons that selectively encode small decrements, and 3) broad sensitivity neurons that respond to a wide range of light decrements. Our data support a model in which parallel OFF channels generated in the retina remain segregated across three stages of visual processing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vertebrate retinas contain circuits specialized to encode light level decrements. This information is transmitted to the brain by dimming‐sensitive OFF retinal ganglion cells (OFF‐RGCs) that respond to light decrements with increased firing. It is known that OFF‐RGCs with distinct photosensitivity profiles form parallel visual channels to the vertebrate brain, yet how these channels are processed by first‐ and higher‐order brain areas has not been well characterized in any species. To address this question in the larval zebrafish visual system we examined the visual response properties of a genetically identified population of tectal neurons with a defined axonal projection to a second order visual area: &lt;i&gt;id2b:gal4‐ &lt;/i&gt;positive torus longitudinalis projection neurons (TLPNs). TLPNs responded consistently to whole‐field dimming stimuli and exhibited the strongest responses when dimming was preceded by low light levels. Functional characterization of OFF‐RGC terminals in tectum revealed responses that varied in their photosensitivities: 1) low sensitivity OFF‐RGCs that selectively respond to large light decrements, 2) high sensitivity OFF‐RGCs that selectively encode small decrements, and 3) broad sensitivity OFF‐RGCs that respond to a wide range of light decrements. Diverse photosensitivity profiles were also observed using pan‐neuronal calcium imaging to identify dimming‐responsive neurons in both tectum and torus longitudinalis. Together these data support a model in which parallel OFF channels generated in the retina remain segregated across three stages of visual processing. Segregated OFF channels with different sensitivities may allow specific aspects of dimming‐evoked behaviors to be modulated by ambient light levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myopia is induced when a growing eye wears a diffuser that deprives it of detailed spatial vision (form deprivation, FD). In chickens with optic nerve section (ONS), FD myopia still occurs, suggesting that the signals underlying myopia reside within the eye. As avian eyes differ from mammals, we asked whether local mechanisms also underlie FD myopia in a mammalian model. Young guinea pigs underwent either sham surgery followed by FD (SHAM+FD, n=7); or ONS followed by FD (ONS+FD, n=7); or ONS without FD (ONS, n=9). FD was initiated 3 days after surgery with a diffuser that was worn on the surgically treated eye for 14 days. Animals with ONS+FD developed ‐8.9 D of relative myopia and elongated by 135 μm more than in their untreated eyes after 2 weeks of FD. These changes were significantly greater than those in SHAM+FD animals (‐5.5 D and 40 μm of elongation after 14 days of FD), and reflected exaggerated elongation of the posterior chamber. The myopia reversed when FD was discontinued, despite ONS, but eyes did not recover back to normal (30 days after surgery, ONS+FD eyes still retained ‐3 D of relative myopia when SHAM+FD animals had returned to normal). No long‐term residual myopia was present after ONS alone, ruling out a surgical artefact. Although the gross mechanism signaling myopic ocular growth and its recovery in the young mammalian eye does not require an intact optic nerve, its fine‐tuning is disrupted by ONS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Pigment epithelium‐derived factor (PEDF) and PEDF‐receptor in the adult mouse brain: Differential spatial/temporal localization pattern&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/86a59f32-38eb-4618-a54c-b57659a83556/cne24940-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A schematic drawing is depicted indicating of the detection of PEDF and PEDFR proteins in the mouse brain. Representative brain coronal sections to show the principal regions where PEDF (red dots on the left brain scheme) and PEDFR (blue dots on the right brain scheme) are detected by immunohistochemical study. An equal codistribution is observed for both proteins in the Cerebellum, Hippocampus and periventricular zone. CTX‐Layer VI, Layer VI of cerebral cortex; CTX‐Layer IV–V, Layer IV and V of cerebral cortex; CTX‐Layer I‐III: Layer I, II, and III of Cerebral Cortex; Layer CA1 HYP: layer CA1 of Hippocampus; Layer CA2‐3 HIP: Layer Ca2 and CA3 of hippocampus; SM, medial septum; DBN, Banda diagonal nuclei, and CEREB‐Purk, Purkinje layer of cerebellum.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pigment epithelium‐derived factor (PEDF) is a multifunctional protein which was initially described in the retina, although it is also present in other tissues. It functions as an antioxidant agent promoting neuronal survival. Recently, a PEDF receptor has shown an elevated binding affinity for PEDF. There are no relevant data regarding the distribution of both proteins in the brain, therefore the main goal of this work was to investigate the spatiotemporal presence of PEDF and PEDFR in the adult mouse brain, and to determine the PEDF blood level in mouse and human. The localization of both proteins was analyzed by different experimental methods such as immunohistochemistry, western‐blotting, and also by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. Differential expression was found in some telencephalic structures and positive signals for both proteins were detected in the cerebellum. The magnitude of the PEDFR labeling pattern was higher than PEDF and included some cortical and subventricular areas. Age‐dependent changes in intensity of both protein immunoreactions were found in the cortical and hippocampal areas with greater reactivity between 4 and 8 months of age, whilst others, like the subventricular zones, these differences were more evident for PEDFR. Although ubiquitous presence was not found in the brain for these two proteins, their relevant functions must not be underestimated. It has been described that PEDF plays an important role in neuroprotection and data provided in the present work represents the first extensive study to understand the relevance of these two proteins in specific brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Characterization of a cell bridge variant connecting the nodose and superior cervical ganglia in the mouse: Prevalence, anatomical features, and practical implications&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9d1282b0-842d-4082-a964-c4feabea2c8f/cne24936-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study describes the anatomy of a cell bridge (CB) variant consisting of the fusion of the mouse nodose ganglion (NG) and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). This anastomosis was tubular shaped and significantly more prevalent in the ganglionic masses from males (38%) than females (21%). It contained a mixed of vagal afferents (blue, tyrosine hydroxylase [TH] positive, Hand2 negative, and isolectin B4 negative; purple, TH negative, Hand2 negative, and isolectin B4 positive; gray, TH negative, Hand2 negative, and isolectin B4 negative) and postganglionic sympathetic neurons (green, TH positive and Hand2 positive). The two populations of neurons abruptly replaced each other in the middle of the cell bridge. The practical implications of our observations are discussed with respect to studies of the mouse vagal afferents, an area of research of increasing popularity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While autonomic ganglia have been extensively studied in rats instead of mice, there is renewed interest in the anatomy of the mouse autonomic nervous system. This study examined the prevalence and anatomical features of a cell bridge linking two autonomic ganglia of the neck, namely, the nodose ganglion (NG) and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) in a cohort of C57BL/6J mice. We identified a cell bridge between the NG and the cranial pole of the SCG. This cell bridge was tubular shaped with an average length and width of 700 and 240 μm, respectively. The cell bridge was frequently unilateral and significantly more prevalent in the ganglionic masses from males (38%) than females (21%). On each of its extremities, it contained a mixed of vagal afferents and postganglionic sympathetic neurons. The two populations of neurons abruptly replaced each other in the middle of the cell bridge. We examined the mRNA expression for selected autonomic markers in samples of the NG with or without cell bridge. Our results indicated that the cell bridge was enriched in both markers of postganglionic sympathetic and vagal afferents neurons. Lastly, using FluoroGold microinjection into the NG, we found that the existence of a cell bridge may occasionally lead to the inadvertent contamination of the SCG. In summary, this study describes the anatomy of a cell bridge variant consisting of the fusion of the mouse NG and SCG. The practical implications of our observations are discussed with respect to studies of the mouse vagal afferents, an area of research of increasing popularity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Several decades of research suggest that weak electric fields may influence neural processing, including those induced by neuronal activity and proposed as a substrate for a potential new cellular communication system, i.e., ephaptic transmission. Here we aim to model mesoscopic ephaptic activity in the human brain and explore its trajectory during aging by characterizing the electric field generated by cortical dipoles using realistic finite element modeling. Extrapolating from electrophysiological measurements, we first observe that modeled endogenous field magnitudes are comparable to those in measurements of weak but functionally relevant self-generated fields and to those produced by noninvasive transcranial brain stimulation, and therefore possibly able to modulate neuronal activity. Then, to evaluate the role of these fields in the human cortex in large MRI databases, we adapt an interaction approximation that considers the relative orientation of neuron and field to estimate the membrane potential perturbation in pyramidal cells. We use this approximation to define a simplified metric (EMOD1) that weights dipole coupling as a function of distance and relative orientation between emitter and receiver and evaluate it in a sample of 401 realistic human brain models from healthy subjects aged 16–83. Results reveal that ephaptic coupling, in the simplified mesoscopic modeling approach used here, significantly decreases with age, with higher involvement of sensorimotor regions and medial brain structures. This study suggests that by providing the means for fast and direct interaction between neurons, ephaptic modulation may contribute to the complexity of human function for cognition and behavior, and its modification across the lifespan and in response to pathology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qqipGVcY2wg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

J-domain proteins (JDPs), obligatory Hsp70 cochaperones, play critical roles in protein homeostasis. They promote key allosteric transitions that stabilize Hsp70 interaction with substrate polypeptides upon hydrolysis of its bound ATP. Although a recent crystal structure revealed the physical mode of interaction between a J-domain and an Hsp70, the structural and dynamic consequences of J-domain action once bound and how Hsp70s discriminate among its multiple JDP partners remain enigmatic. We combined free energy simulations, biochemical assays and evolutionary analyses to address these issues. Our results indicate that the invariant aspartate of the J-domain perturbs a conserved intramolecular Hsp70 network of contacts that crosses domains. This perturbation leads to destabilization of the domain-domain interface—thereby promoting the allosteric transition that triggers ATP hydrolysis. While this mechanistic step is driven by conserved residues, evolutionarily variable residues are key to initial JDP/Hsp70 recognition—via electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged surfaces. We speculate that these variable residues allow an Hsp70 to discriminate amongst JDP partners, as many of them have coevolved. Together, our data points to a two-step mode of J-domain action, a recognition stage followed by a mechanistic stage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QKhvBg2Ay6I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Artificial electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves for sensory feedback restoration can greatly benefit from computational models for simulation-based neural implant design in order to reduce the trial-and-error approach usually taken, thus potentially significantly reducing research and development costs and time. To this end, we built a computational model of a peripheral nerve trunk in which the interstitial space between the fibers and the tissues was modelled using a resistor network, thus enabling distance-dependent ephaptic coupling between myelinated axons and between fascicles as well. We used the model to simulate a) the stimulation of a nerve trunk model with a cuff electrode, and b) the propagation of action potentials along the axons. Results were used to investigate the effect of ephaptic interactions on recruitment and selectivity stemming from artificial (i.e., neural implant) stimulation and on the relative timing between action potentials during propagation. Ephaptic coupling was found to increase the number of fibers that are activated by artificial stimulation, thus reducing the artificial currents required for axonal recruitment, and it was found to reduce and shift the range of optimal stimulation amplitudes for maximum inter-fascicular selectivity. During propagation, while fibers of similar diameters tended to lock their action potentials and reduce their conduction velocities, as expected from previous knowledge on bundles of identical axons, the presence of many other fibers of different diameters was found to make their interactions weaker and unstable.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9LYYJGiFpOs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We study the pathogenesis of &lt;i&gt;Francisella tularensis&lt;/i&gt; infection with an experimental mouse model, agent-based computation and mathematical analysis. Following inhalational exposure to &lt;i&gt;Francisella tularensis&lt;/i&gt; SCHU S4, a small initial number of bacteria enter lung host cells and proliferate inside them, eventually destroying the host cell and releasing numerous copies that infect other cells. Our analysis of disease progression is based on a stochastic model of a population of infectious agents inside one host cell, extending the birth-and-death process by the occurrence of catastrophes: cell rupture events that affect all bacteria in a cell simultaneously. Closed expressions are obtained for the survival function of an infected cell, the number of bacteria released as a function of time after infection, and the total bacterial load. We compare our mathematical analysis with the results of agent-based computation and, making use of approximate Bayesian statistical inference, with experimental measurements carried out after murine aerosol infection with the virulent SCHU S4 strain of the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Francisella tularensis&lt;/i&gt;, that infects alveolar macrophages. The posterior distribution of the rate of replication of intracellular bacteria is consistent with the estimate that the time between rounds of bacterial division is less than 6 hours &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4LaLP1GtotU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Linking skeletal muscle aging with osteoporosis by lamin A/C deficiency</title>

The nuclear lamina protein lamin A/C is a key component of the nuclear envelope. Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (&lt;i&gt;LMNA&lt;/i&gt;) are identified in patients with various types of laminopathy-containing diseases, which have features of accelerated aging and osteoporosis. However, the underlying mechanisms for laminopathy-associated osteoporosis remain largely unclear. Here, we provide evidence that loss of lamin A/C in skeletal muscles, but not osteoblast (OB)-lineage cells, results in not only muscle aging–like deficit but also trabecular bone loss, a feature of osteoporosis. The latter is due in large part to elevated bone resorption. Further cellular studies show an increase of osteoclast (OC) differentiation in cocultures of bone marrow macrophages/monocytes (BMMs) and OBs after treatment with the conditioned medium (CM) from lamin A/C–deficient muscle cells. Antibody array screening analysis of the CM proteins identifies interleukin (IL)-6, whose expression is markedly increased in lamin A/C–deficient muscles. Inhibition of IL-6 by its blocking antibody in BMM-OB cocultures diminishes the increase of osteoclastogenesis. Knockout (KO) of IL-6 in muscle lamin A/C–KO mice diminishes the deficits in trabecular bone mass but not muscle. Further mechanistic studies reveal an elevation of cellular senescence marked by senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), p16&lt;sup&gt;Ink4a&lt;/sup&gt;, and p53 in lamin A/C–deficient muscles and C2C12 muscle cells, and the p16&lt;sup&gt;Ink4a&lt;/sup&gt; may induce senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and IL-6 expression. Taken together, these results suggest a critical role for skeletal muscle lamin A/C to prevent cellular senescence, IL-6 expression, hyperosteoclastogenesis, and trabecular bone loss, uncovering a pathological mechanism underlying the link between muscle aging/senescence and osteoporosis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/orKeAPv1UCs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Data-driven research in biomedical science requires structured, computable data. Increasingly, these data are created with support from automated text mining. Text-mining tools have rapidly matured: although not perfect, they now frequently provide outstanding results. We describe 10 straightforward writing tips—and a web tool, PubReCheck—guiding authors to help address the most common cases that remain difficult for text-mining tools. We anticipate these guides will help authors’ work be found more readily and used more widely, ultimately increasing the impact of their work and the overall benefit to both authors and readers. PubReCheck is available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubrecheck.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jph2sfXU3Xo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Chemogenetic manipulation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis counteracts social behavioral deficits induced by early life stress in C57BL/6J mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/de99b864-e943-4f83-9916-ec6620172c3d/jnr24644-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early life stress (ELS) induces long‐lasting social behavior deficits. We used chemogenetics to manipulate activity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), which undergoes maturation during the early postnatal period. Altering BNST activity in adulthood produced divergent effects on social behavior that were dependent upon history of ELS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trauma during critical periods of development can induce long‐lasting adverse effects. To study neural aberrations resulting from early life stress (ELS), many studies utilize rodent maternal separation, whereby pups are intermittently deprived of maternal care necessary for proper development. This can produce adulthood behavioral deficits related to anxiety, reward, and social behavior. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) encodes aspects of anxiety‐like and social behaviors, and also undergoes developmental maturation during the early postnatal period, rendering it vulnerable to effects of ELS. Mice underwent maternal separation (separation 4 hr/day during postnatal day (PD)2–5 and 8 hr/day on PD6‐16) with early weaning on PD17, which induced behavioral deficits in adulthood performance on two‐part social interaction task designed to test social motivation (choice between a same‐sex novel conspecific or an empty cup) and social novelty preference (choice between the original‐novel conspecific vs. a new‐novel conspecific). We used chemogenetics to non‐selectively silence or activate neurons in the BNST to examine its role in social motivation and social novelty preference, in mice with or without the history of ELS. Manipulation of BNST produced differing social behavior effects in non‐stressed versus ELS mice; social motivation was decreased in non‐stressed mice following BNST activation, but unchanged following BNST silencing, while ELS mice showed no change in social behavior after BNST activation, but exhibited enhancement of social motivation—for which they were deficient prior—following BNST silencing. Findings emphasize the BNST as a potential therapeutic target for social anxiety disorders instigated by childhood trauma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Multimodal cross‐registration and quantification of metric distortions in marmoset whole brain histology using diffeomorphic mappings&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/604a4546-b56b-404e-86d8-f626e5f25626/cne24946-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Graphical Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we present methods for guided volume reconstruction of serial section animal brain histology with an evaluation of registration accuracy. Using methods derived from diffeomorphometry, we quantify the 3D distortion caused by two steps in the histology tissue processing pipeline: (a) reassembly of tape‐transfer assisted histology sections and (b) tissue perfusion and fixation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole brain neuroanatomy using tera‐voxel light‐microscopic data sets is of much current interest. A fundamental problem in this field is the mapping of individual brain data sets to a reference space. Previous work has not rigorously quantified in‐vivo to ex‐vivo distortions in brain geometry from tissue processing. Further, existing approaches focus on registering unimodal volumetric data; however, given the increasing interest in the marmoset model for neuroscience research and the importance of addressing individual brain architecture variations, new algorithms are necessary to cross‐register multimodal data sets including MRIs and multiple histological series. Here we present a computational approach for same‐subject multimodal MRI‐guided reconstruction of a series of consecutive histological sections, jointly with diffeomorphic mapping to a reference atlas. We quantify the scale change during different stages of brain histological processing using the Jacobian determinant of the diffeomorphic transformations involved. By mapping the final image stacks to the ex‐vivo post‐fixation MRI, we show that (a) tape‐transfer assisted histological sections can be reassembled accurately into 3D volumes with a local scale change of 2.0 ± 0.4% per axis dimension; in contrast, (b) tissue perfusion/fixation as assessed by mapping the in‐vivo MRIs to the ex‐vivo post fixation MRIs shows a larger median absolute scale change of 6.9 ± 2.1% per axis dimension. This is the first systematic quantification of local metric distortions associated with whole‐brain histological processing, and we expect that the results will generalize to other species. These local scale changes will be important for computing local properties to create reference brain maps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This review in memoriam of Jack Pettigrew provides an overview of research into the phenomenon of perceptual rivalry, across a wide variety of species including insects, fish, reptiles, and primates. Perceptual rivalry is characterized by spontaneous alternations in perceptual state in response to ambiguous or conflicting sensory input. We highlight several interesting commonalities across species and use a comparative approach to better understand how the brain suppresses opposing sensory signals and generates alternations in perceptual dominance.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review in memoriam of Jack Pettigrew provides an overview of past and current research into the phenomenon of multistable perception across multiple animal species. Multistable perception is characterized by two or more perceptual interpretations spontaneously alternating, or rivaling, when animals are exposed to stimuli with inherent sensory ambiguity. There is a wide array of ambiguous stimuli across sensory modalities, ranging from the configural changes observed in simple line drawings, such as the famous Necker cube, to the alternating perception of entire visual scenes that can be instigated by interocular conflict. The latter phenomenon, called binocular rivalry, in particular caught the attention of the late Jack Pettigrew, who combined his interest in the neuronal basis of perception with a unique comparative biological approach that considered ambiguous sensation as a fundamental problem of sensory systems that has shaped the brain throughout evolution. Here, we examine the research findings on visual perceptual alternation and suppression in a wide variety of species including insects, fish, reptiles, and primates. We highlight several interesting commonalities across species and behavioral indicators of perceptual alternation. In addition, we show how the comparative approach provides new avenues for understanding how the brain suppresses opposing sensory signals and generates alternations in perceptual dominance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Projections between visual cortex and pulvinar in the rat</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Projections between visual cortex and pulvinar in the rat&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1146e75b-d617-4185-885d-67e738b4f8d0/cne24937-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Graphical Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the geniculocortical pathway which interconnects only between the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex (V1), the pulvinar has long been known to interconnect with most if not all of visual cortex. Here we show that pulvinar interconnectivity is actually more dominant with higher visual cortex (V2) than with V1. Thus, the pulvinocortical pathway does not likely play as big a role in directly modulating V1 activity as previously thought.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extrageniculate visual pathway, which carries visual information from the retina through the superficial layers of the superior colliculus and the pulvinar, is poorly understood. The pulvinar is thought to modulate information flow between cortical areas, and has been implicated in cognitive tasks like directing visually guided actions. In order to better understand the underlying circuitry, we performed retrograde injections of modified rabies virus in the visual cortex and pulvinar of the Long‐Evans rat. We found a relatively small population of cells projecting to primary visual cortex (V1), compared to a much larger population projecting to higher visual cortex. Reciprocal corticothalamic projections showed a similar result, implying that pulvinar does not play as big a role in directly modulating rodent V1 activity as previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In the resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we used a Granger causality analysis (GCA) to identify direction of information flow and whether the impact of that flow was excitatory or inhibitory of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in patients with obsessive‐compulsive disorder (OCD). Results showed decreased amplitude of low‐frequency fluctuation in left pregenual ACC (pACC) in patients than controls. There was significantly decreased excitatory output from the left pACC to both right dorsal superior frontal gyrus (dSFG) and left precuneus in patients compared with controls. Patients also had decreased inhibitory input to left pACC from left ventral SFG and left thalamus and caudate relative to controls. In patients, path coefficients of GCA from left pACC to right dSFG showed significant negative correlations with obsession and anxiety ratings. Decreased spontaneous neural activity and altered effective connectivity of pACC with widely distributed cortical circuitry, and associations with clinical ratings highlight the importance of pACC functional alteration in OCD.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling neuropsychiatric disorder whose neurobiological basis remains unclear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have reported functional and structural alterations of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in OCD. In this study, we explored the functional activity of subregions of the ACC and effective connectivity (EC) between ACC subregions and the whole brain in OCD. We used a Granger causality analysis (GCA) to identify the direction of information flow and whether the impact of that flow was excitatory or inhibitory. We performed resting‐state functional MRI in 31 patients with OCD and 36 healthy controls and analyzed the amplitude of low‐frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and coefficient‐based GCA. The left pregenual ACC (pACC) in patients with OCD showed decreased ALFF relative to controls. There was significantly decreased excitatory output from the left pACC to both right dorsal superior frontal gyrus (dSFG) and left precuneus in patients compared with controls. Patients also had decreased inhibitory input to left pACC from left ventral SFG and left thalamus and caudate relative to controls. Results were similar in drug‐naive patients and those with prior but not current psychopharmacological treatment. In patients, path coefficients of GCA from left pACC to right dSFG showed significant negative correlations with obsession and anxiety ratings. Decreased spontaneous neural activity and altered EC of pACC with widely distributed cortical circuitry, and associations with clinical ratings highlight the importance of pACC functional alteration in OCD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Interactions with PDZ proteins diversify voltage‐gated calcium channel signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24650?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voltage‐gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) channels are crucial for neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission upon depolarization. Their properties &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; are modulated by their interaction with a variety of scaffolding proteins. Such interactions can influence the function and localization of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels, as well as their coupling to intracellular second messengers and regulatory pathways, thus amplifying their signaling potential. Among these scaffolding proteins, a subset of PDZ (postsynaptic density‐95, Drosophila discs‐large, and zona occludens)‐domain containing proteins play diverse roles in modulating Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channel properties. At the presynaptic terminal, PDZ proteins enrich Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels in the active zone, enabling neurotransmitter release by maintaining a tight and vital link between channels and vesicles. In the postsynaptic density, these interactions are essential in regulating dendritic spine morphology and postsynaptic signaling cascades. In this review, we highlight the studies that demonstrate dynamic regulations of neuronal Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels by PDZ proteins. We discuss the role of PDZ proteins in controlling channel activity, regulating channel cell surface density, and influencing channel‐mediated downstream signaling events. We highlight the importance of PDZ protein regulations of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels and evaluate the link between this regulatory effect and human disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Localizing the seizure onset zone by comparing patient postictal hypoperfusion to healthy controls&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/98ceea7d-9406-438a-9530-325bb5e5fcea/jnr24646-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We compared post‐ictal hypoperfusion ASL MRI data in epilepsy patients to healthy controls to determine the location of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). This comparison identified the clinically suspected SOZ in 59% of patients. These findings matched our previous subtraction ASL MRI study (Gaxiola‐Valdez et al., 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI can provide seizure onset zone (SOZ) localizing information in up to 80% of patients. Clinical implementation of this technique is limited by the need to obtain two scans per patient: a postictal scan that is subtracted from an interictal scan. We aimed to determine whether it is possible to limit the number of ASL scans to one per patient by comparing patient postictal ASL scans to baseline scans of 100 healthy controls. Eighteen patients aged 20–55 years underwent ASL MRI &amp;lt;90 min after a seizure and during the interictal period. Each postictal cerebral blood flow (CBF) map was statistically compared to average baseline CBF maps from 100 healthy controls (pvcASL; patient postictal CBF vs. control baseline CBF). The pvcASL maps were compared to subtraction ASL maps (sASL; patient baseline CBF minus patient postictal CBF). Postictal CBF reductions from pvcASL and sASL maps were seen in 17 of 18 (94.4%) and 14 of 18 (77.8%) patients, respectively. Maximal postictal hypoperfusion seen in pvcASL and sASL maps was concordant with the SOZ in 10 of 17 (59%) and 12 of 14 (86%) patients, respectively. In seven patients, both pvcASL and sASL maps showed similar results. In two patients, sASL showed no significant hypoperfusion, while pvcASL showed significant hypoperfusion concordant with the SOZ. We conclude that pvcASL is clinically useful and although it may have a lower overall concordance rate than sASL, pvcASL does provide localizing or lateralizing information for specific cases that would be otherwise missed through sASL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
