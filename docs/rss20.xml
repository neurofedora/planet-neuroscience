The combination of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) with Electroencephalography (EEG) exposes the brain’s global response to localized and abrupt stimulations. However, large electric artifacts are induced in the EEG by the TMS, obscuring crucial stages of the brain’s response. Artifact removal is commonly performed by data processing techniques. However, an experimentally verified physical model for the origin and structure of the TMS-induced discharge artifacts, by which these methods can be justified or evaluated, is still lacking. We re-examine the known contribution of the skin in creating the artifacts, and outline a detailed model for the relaxation of the charge accumulated at the electrode-gel-skin interface due to the TMS pulse. We then experimentally validate implications set forth by the model. We find that the artifacts decay like a power law in time rather than the commonly assumed exponential. In fact, the skin creates a power-law decay of order 1 at each electrode, which is turned into a power law of order 2 by the reference electrode. We suggest an artifact removal method based on the model which can be applied from times after the pulse as short as 2 milliseconds onwards to expose the full EEG from the brain. The method can separate the capacitive discharge artifacts from those resulting from cranial muscle activation, demonstrating that the capacitive effect dominates at short times. Overall, our insight into the physical process allows us to accurately access TMS-evoked EEG responses that directly follow the TMS pulse, possibly opening new opportunities in TMS-EEG research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EXQCGpRf8hI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Two Sides of the Same Coin: Distinct Sub-Bands in the Alpha Rhythm Reflect Facilitation and Suppression Mechanisms during Auditory Anticipatory Attention</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Anticipatory attention results in enhanced response to task-relevant stimulus, and reduced processing of unattended input, suggesting the deployment of distinct facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms. Alpha oscillations are a suitable candidate for supporting these mechanisms. We aimed to examine the role of alpha oscillations, with a special focus on peak frequencies, in facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms during auditory anticipation, within the auditory and visual regions. MEG data were collected from fourteen healthy young human adults (8 female) performing an auditory task in which spatial attention to sounds was manipulated by visual cues, either informative or not of the target side. By incorporating uninformative cues, we could delineate facilitating and suppressive mechanisms. During anticipation of a visually-cued auditory target, we observed a decrease in alpha power around 9Hz in the auditory cortices; and an increase around 13 Hz in the visual regions. Only this power increase in high alpha significantly correlated with behavior. Importantly, within the right auditory cortex, we showed a larger increase in high alpha power when attending an ipsilateral sound; and a stronger decrease in low alpha power when attending a contralateral sound. In summary, we found facilitatory and suppressive attentional mechanisms with distinct timing in task-relevant and task-irrelevant brain areas, differentially correlated to behavior and supported by distinct alpha sub-bands. We provide new insight into the role of the alpha peak-frequency by showing that anticipatory attention is supported by distinct facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms, mediated in different low and high sub-bands of the alpha rhythm, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We investigated the role of alpha oscillations, with a special focus on peak frequencies, in facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms during anticipation, using MEG data collected during an auditory spatial attention task. We show, during anticipation of a visually-cued auditory target, a decrease in alpha power around 9Hz in the auditory cortices, simultaneous to an increase around 13 Hz in in the visual regions, the latter significantly correlated with behavioral performances. Within the right auditory cortex, we show a larger increase in high alpha when attending an ipsilateral sound; and a stronger decrease in low alpha when attending a contralateral sound. Therefore, anticipatory attention would be supported by distinct facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms, mediated in different low and high alpha sub-bands, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Estradiol Drives the Anorexigenic Activity of Proopiomelanocortin Neurons in Female Mice</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Energy balance is regulated by anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. POMC neurons make extensive projections and are thought to release both amino acid and peptide neurotransmitters. However, whether they communicate directly with NPY/AgRP neurons is debated. Initially, using single cell RT-PCR, we determined that mouse POMC&lt;sup&gt;eGFP&lt;/sup&gt; neurons express &lt;i&gt;Slc17a6&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Slc18a2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vmat2&lt;/i&gt;), but not &lt;i&gt;Slc31a1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vgat&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA, suggesting glutamate and non-canonical GABA release. Quantitative RT-PCR of POMC&lt;sup&gt;eGFP&lt;/sup&gt; cells revealed that &lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Vmat2&lt;/i&gt; expression was significantly increased in E2- vs. oil-treated, ovariectomized (OVX) female mice. Since 17β-estradiol (E2) is anorexigenic, we hypothesized that an underlying mechanism was enhancement of POMC signaling. Therefore, we optogenetically stimulated POMC neurons in hypothalamic slices to examine evoked release of neurotransmitters onto NPY/AgRP neurons. Using brief light pulses we primarily observed glutamatergic currents and, based on the paired pulse ratio, determined that release probability was higher in E2- vs oil-treated, OVX female, congruent with increased &lt;i&gt;Vlgut2&lt;/i&gt; expression. Moreover, bath perfusion of the Gq-coupled membrane estrogen receptor agonist STX recapitulated the effects of E2 treatment. In addition, high frequency (20 Hz) stimulation generated a slow outward current that reversed near E&lt;sub&gt;k+&lt;/sub&gt; and was antagonized by naloxone, indicative of β-endorphin release. Furthermore, individual NPY/AgRP neurons were found to express &lt;i&gt;Oprm1,&lt;/i&gt; the transcript for μ-opioid receptor, and DAMGO, a selective agonist, elicited an outward current. Therefore, POMC excitability and neurotransmission are enhanced by E2, which would facilitate decreased food consumption through marked inhibition of NPY/AgRP neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus sense the energy state of an animal and regulate satiety to maintain homeostasis. Neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons also participate in energy balance, but instead drive hunger. Disruptions in this circuit can promote the development of obesity, which frequently occurs during menopause due to the loss of estrogens. The primary female sex hormone, 17β-estradiol (E2) exerts an anorexigenic effect, decreasing food intake and increasing activity. These behavioral changes are mediated, in part, through inhibition of NPY/AgRP and potentiation of POMC signaling. For the first time we report that POMC neurons provide direct input to NPY/AgRP neurons primarily through glutamate and β-endorphin release. Furthermore, E2 enhances POMC neurotransmission to inhibit NPY/AgRP neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Functional Connectivity of Chronic Cocaine Use Reveals Progressive Neuroadaptations in Neocortical, Striatal and Limbic Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0081-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging studies indicate that chronic cocaine users display altered functional connectivity between prefrontal cortical, thalamic, striatal, and limbic regions; however, the use of cross-sectional designs in these studies precludes measuring baseline brain activity prior to cocaine use. Animal studies can circumvent this limitation by comparing functional connectivity between baseline and various time points after chronic cocaine use. In the present study, adult male Long-Evans rats were trained to self-administer cocaine intravenously for 6-hour daily sessions over 14 consecutive days. Two additional groups serving as controls underwent sucrose self-administration or exposure to the test chambers alone. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted before self-administration and after 1 and 14 days of abstinence (1d and 14d Abs). At 1d Abs from cocaine, there was increased clustering coefficient in brain areas involved in reward seeking, learning, memory, and autonomic and affective processing, including amygdala, hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus and thalamus. Similar changes in clustering coefficient after 1d Abs from sucrose were evident in predominantly thalamic brain regions. Notably, there were no changes in strength of functional connectivity at 1d or 14d after either cocaine or sucrose self-administration. The results suggest that cocaine and sucrose can change the arrangement of functional connectivity of brain regions involved in cognition and emotion, but that these changes dissipate across the early stages of abstinence. The study also emphasizes the importance of including baseline measures in longitudinal functional neuroimaging designs seeking to assess functional connectivity in the context of substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Although human neuroimaging studies have been invaluable in understanding the relationship between cocaine use and brain functional connectivity, they inherently lack pre-drug baseline information important to establish how cocaine use alters regional interactions. Coupling neuroimaging with rodent models of cocaine self-administration circumvents this issue by controlling variables that can confound human studies and providing pre-drug baseline information. Using such an approach, this study reveals that after cocaine use, functional connectivity patterns change as a function of abstinence duration and that these changes are observed in networks supporting reward and emotion-related cognition and behavior. These findings highlight the importance of using multiple timepoints in preclinical models of substance use to assess effects on functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Estradiol Increases Glutamate and GABA Neurotransmission into GnRH Neurons via Retrograde NO-Signaling in Proestrous Mice during the Positive Estradiol Feedback Period</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Surge release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) is essential in the activation of pituitary gonadal unit at proestrus afternoon preceded by the rise of serum 17β-estradiol level during positive feedback period. Here we describe a mechanism of positive estradiol feedback regulation acting directly on GnRH-GFP neurons of mice. Whole cell clamp and loose patch recordings revealed that a high physiological dose of estradiol (200 pM), significantly increased firing rate at proestrus afternoon. The mPSC frequency at proestrus afternoon also increased, whereas decreased it at metestrus afternoon, and had no effect at proestrus morning. Inhibition of the estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), intracellular blockade of the Src kinase and PI3K and scavenge of nitric oxide inside GnRH neurons prevented the facilitatory estradiol effect indicating involvement of the ERβ/Src/PI3K/Akt/nNOS pathway in this fast, direct stimulatory effect. Immunohistochemistry localized soluble guanylate cyclase, the main nitric oxide receptor, in both glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals innervating GnRH neurons. Accordingly, estradiol facilitated neurotransmissions to GnRH neurons via both GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-R and glutamate/AMPA/kainate-R. These results indicate that estradiol acts directly on GnRH neurons via the ERβ/Akt/nNOS pathway at proestrus afternoon generating nitric oxide that retrogradely accelerates GABA and glutamate release from the presynaptic terminals contacting GnRH neurons. The newly explored mechanism might contribute to the regulation of the GnRH surge, a fundamental prerequisite of the ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; One of the major reasons of infertility is the failure in ovulation. Therefore, understanding of the neuronal processes resulting in proper ovulation is indispensable. Although hypothalamic GnRH neurons are regarded the master-neurons orchestrating reproduction, most of the relevant papers have suggested so far, that the estradiol positive feedback (indispensable for ovulation) acts in these neurons mostly indirectly, via hypothalamic nuclei free of GnRH neurons. Now we have presented strong evidence that estradiol exerts fast direct stimulatory action in GnRH neurons during the positive feedback, by activating retrograde nitric-oxide signaling to accelerate excitatory synaptic inputs to GnRH neurons. In addition, we suggest a putative mechanism, whereby indirect and direct actions of estradiol can work in concert regulating GnRH neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Characterization of Tissue Plasminogen Activator Expression and Trafficking in the Adult Murine Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0119-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is an immediate-early gene important for regulating physiological processes like synaptic plasticity and neurovascular coupling. It has also been implicated in several pathological processes including blood-brain barrier permeability, seizure progression, and stroke. These varied reports suggest that tPA is a pleiotropic mediator whose actions are highly compartmentalized in space and time. The specific localization of tPA, therefore, can provide useful information about its function. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to provide a detailed characterization of tPA’s regional, cellular, and subcellular localization in the brain. To achieve this, two new transgenic mouse lines were utilized: (1) a PlatβGAL reporter mouse, which houses the β-galactosidase gene in the tPA locus and (2) a tPA&lt;sup&gt;BAC&lt;/sup&gt;-Cerulean mouse, which has a cerulean-fluorescent protein fused in-frame to the tPA C-terminus. Using these two transgenic reporters, we show that while tPA is expressed throughout most regions of the adult murine brain, it appears to be preferentially targeted to fiber tracts in the limbic system. In the hippocampus, confocal microscopy revealed tPA-Cerulean (tPA-Cer) puncta localized to giant mossy fiber boutons and astrocytes in stratum lucidum. With amplification of the tPA-Cer signal, somatically localized tPA was also observed in the stratum oriens/alveus layer of both CA1 and CA3 subfields. Co-immunostaining of tPA-Cer and interneuronal markers indicates that these tPA-positive cell bodies belong to a subclass of somatostatin/oriens-lacunosum moleculare interneurons. Together, these data imply that tPA’s localization is differentially regulated, suggesting that its neuromodulatory effects may be compartmentalized and specialized to cell-type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The serine protease tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been shown to modulate numerous neurologic processes including synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration. Many of the functional conclusions drawn about tPA activity, however, have not been affirmed by high-resolution, imaging analysis of tPA localization. To address these shortcomings, we used two new transgenic reporter mice to provide a detailed characterization of tPA expression in the adult murine brain. A comparison of these reporter mice demonstrates a differential expression pattern between the sites of tPA synthesis and its targeted localization in the hippocampus, amygdala, and basal ganglia. Moreover, colocalization and co-expression analysis reveals that tPA is primarily trafficked to pre-synaptic structures and that it’s predominant somatic and/or axonal localization is cell-type specific.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Exosomes, abundant in blood, deliver various molecules to recipient cells. Endothelial cells are directly exposed to circulating substances. However, how endothelial cells respond to serum exosomes (SExos) and the implications in diabetes-associated vasculopathy have never been explored. In the present study, we showed that SExos from diabetic db/db mice (db/db...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/4mTKGQEjA6s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Neurons of the medullary reticular nucleus gigantocellularis (NGC) and their targets have recently been a focus of research on mechanisms supporting generalized CNS arousal (GA) required for proper cognitive functions. Using the retro-TRAP method, we characterized transcripts enriched in NGC neurons which have projections to the thalamus.

	<description>Recent experimental studies suggest that, in cortical microcircuits of the mammalian brain, the majority of neuron-to-neuron connections are realized by multiple synapses. However, it is not known whether such redundant synaptic connections provide any functional benefit.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal and glial cells release diverse proteoglycans and glycoproteins,
which aggregate in the extracellular space and form the extracellular matrix
(ECM) that may in turn regulate major cellular functions. Brain cells also
release extracellular proteases that may degrade the ECM, and both synthesis
and degradation of ECM are activity-dependent. In this study we introduce a
mathematical model describing population dynamics of neurons interacting with
ECM molecules over extended timescales. It is demonstrated that depending on
the prevalent biophysical mechanism of ECM-neuronal interactions, different
dynamical regimes of ECM activity can be observed, including bistable states
with stable stationary levels of ECM molecule concentration, spontaneous ECM
oscillations, and coexistence of ECM oscillations and a stationary state,
allowing dynamical switches between activity regimes.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: True Contextuality Beats Direct Influences in Human Decision Making. (arXiv:1807.05684v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05684</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05684</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In quantum physics there are well-known situations when measurements of the
same property in different contexts (under different conditions) have the same
probability distribution, but cannot be represented by one and the same random
variable. Such systems of random variables are called contextual. More
generally, true contextuality is observed when different contexts force
measurements of the same property (in psychology, responses to the same
question) to be more dissimilar random variables than warranted by the
difference of their distributions. The difference in distributions is itself a
form of context-dependence, but of another nature: it is attributable to direct
causal influences exerted by contexts upon the random variables. We present a
series of crowdsourcing experiments that reveal true contextuality in human
decision making. Their analysis is based on the Contextuality-by-Default (CbD)
theory, one that allows one to separate true contextuality from direct
influences in the overall context-dependence. The design of our experiments is
an elaboration of one introduced in the &quot;Snow Queen&quot; experiment (Decision 5,
193-204, 2018), where contextuality was for the first time demonstrated
unequivocally. The CbD analysis of many previous attempts to demonstrate
contextuality in human judgments shows that they were unsuccessful because
direct influences in them were all one needed to account for
context-dependence.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human-machine interactions are being increasingly explored to create
alternative ways of communication and to improve our daily life. Based on a
classification of the user's intention from the user's underlying neural
activity, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct interactions with the
external environment while bypassing the traditional effector of the
musculoskeletal system. Despite the enormous potential of BCIs, there are still
a number of challenges that limit their societal impact, ranging from the
correct decoding of a human's thoughts, to the application of effective
learning strategies. Despite several important engineering advances, the basic
neuroscience behind these challenges remains poorly explored. Indeed, BCIs
involve complex dynamic changes related to neural plasticity at a diverse range
of spatiotemporal scales. One promising antidote to this complexity lies in
network science, which provides a natural language in which to model the
organizational principles of brain architecture and function as manifest in its
interconnectivity. Here, we briefly review the main limitations currently
affecting BCIs, and we offer our perspective on how they can be addressed by
means of network theoretic approaches. We posit that the emerging field of
network neuroscience will prove to be an effective tool to unlock human-machine
interactions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Towards Modeling the Interaction of Spatial-Associative Neural Network Representations for Multisensory Perception. (arXiv:1807.05222v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05222</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05222</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our daily perceptual experience is driven by different neural mechanisms that
yield multisensory interaction as the interplay between exogenous stimuli and
endogenous expectations. While the interaction of multisensory cues according
to their spatiotemporal properties and the formation of multisensory
feature-based representations have been widely studied, the interaction of
spatial-associative neural representations has received considerably less
attention. In this paper, we propose a neural network architecture that models
the interaction of spatial-associative representations to perform causal
inference of audiovisual stimuli. We investigate the spatial alignment of
exogenous audiovisual stimuli modulated by associative congruence. In the
spatial layer, topographically arranged networks account for the interaction of
audiovisual input in terms of population codes. In the associative layer,
congruent audiovisual representations are obtained via the experience-driven
development of feature-based associations. Levels of congruency are obtained as
a by-product of the neurodynamics of self-organizing networks, where the amount
of neural activation triggered by the input can be expressed via a nonlinear
distance function. Our novel proposal is that activity-driven levels of
congruency can be used as top-down modulatory projections to spatially
distributed representations of sensory input, e.g. semantically related
audiovisual pairs will yield a higher level of integration than unrelated
pairs. Furthermore, levels of neural response in unimodal layers may be seen as
sensory reliability for the dynamic weighting of crossmodal cues. We describe a
series of planned experiments to validate our model in the tasks of
multisensory interaction on the basis of semantic congruence and unimodal cue
reliability.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Parsimonious Dynamical Model for Structural Learning in the Human Brain. (arXiv:1807.05214v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05214</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is capable of diverse feats of intelligence. A particularly
salient example is the ability to deduce structure from time-varying auditory
and visual stimuli, enabling humans to master the rules of language and to
build rich expectations of their physical environment. The broad relevance of
this ability for human cognition motivates the need for a first-principles
model explicating putative mechanisms. Here we propose a general framework for
structural learning in the brain, composed of an evolving, high-dimensional
dynamical system driven by external stimuli or internal processes. We
operationalize the scenario in which humans learn the rules that generate a
sequence of stimuli, rather than the exemplar stimuli themselves. We model
external stimuli as seemingly disordered chaotic time series generated by
complex dynamical systems; the underlying structure being deduced is then that
of the corresponding chaotic attractor. This approach allows us to demonstrate
and theoretically explain the emergence of five distinct phenomena reminiscent
of cognitive functions: (i) learning the structure of a chaotic system purely
from time series, (ii) generating new streams of stimuli from a chaotic system,
(iii) switching stream generation among multiple learned chaotic systems,
either spontaneously or in response to external perturbations, (iv) inferring
missing data from sparse observations of the chaotic system, and (v)
deciphering superimposed input from different chaotic systems. Numerically, we
show that these phenomena emerge naturally from a recurrent neural network of
Erdos-Renyi topology in which the synaptic strengths adapt in a Hebbian-like
manner. Broadly, our work blends chaotic theory and artificial neural networks
to answer the long standing question of how neural systems can learn the
structure underlying temporal sequences of stimuli.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Adaptation to constant light requires Fic-mediated AMPylation of BiP to protect against reversible photoreceptor degeneration</title>

	<description>In response to environmental, developmental, and pathological stressors, cells engage homeostatic pathways to maintain their function. Among these pathways, the Unfolded Protein Response protects cells from the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Depending on ER stress levels, the ER-resident Fic protein catalyzes AMPylation or de-AMPylation of BiP, the major ER chaperone and regulator of the Unfolded Protein Response. This work elucidates the importance of the reversible AMPylation of BiP in maintaining the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;visual system in response to stress. After 72 hours of constant light, photoreceptors of &lt;i&gt;fic&lt;/i&gt;-null and AMPylation-resistant &lt;i&gt;BiP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;T366A&lt;/sup&gt; mutants, but not wild-type flies, display loss of synaptic function, disintegration of rhabdomeres, and excessive activation of ER stress reporters. Strikingly, this phenotype is reversible: photoreceptors regain their structure and function within 72 hours once returned to a standard light:dark cycle. These findings show that Fic-mediated AMPylation of BiP is required for neurons to adapt to transient stress demands.</description>

	<description>The voltage-gated potassium channel K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;7.1 and the auxiliary subunit KCNE1 together form the cardiac I&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt; channel, which is a proposed target for future anti-arrhythmic drugs. We previously showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) activate K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;7.1 via an electrostatic mechanism. The activating effect was abolished when K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;7.1 was co-expressed with KCNE1, as KCNE1 renders PUFAs ineffective by promoting PUFA protonation. PUFA protonation reduces the potential of PUFAs as anti-arrhythmic compounds. It is unknown how KCNE1 promotes PUFA protonation. Here, we found that neutralization of negatively charged residues in the S5-P-helix loop of K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;7.1 restored PUFA effects on K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;7.1 co-expressed with KCNE1 in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes. We propose that KCNE1 moves the S5-P-helix loop of K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;7.1 towards the PUFA binding site, which indirectly causes PUFA protonation, thereby reducing the effect of PUFAs on K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;7.1. This mechanistic understanding of how KCNE1 alters K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;7.1 pharmacology is essential for development of drugs targeting the I&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt; channel.</description>

	<description>The human gut microbiota impacts host metabolism and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of obesity and metabolic syndromes. However, defining the roles of specific microbial activities and metabolites on host phenotypes has proven challenging due to the complexity of the microbiome-host ecosystem. Here, we identify strains from the abundant gut bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes that display selective bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Using isogenic strains of wild-type and BSH-deleted &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron&lt;/i&gt;, we selectively modulated the levels of the bile acid tauro-b-muricholic acid in monocolonized gnotobiotic mice. &lt;i&gt;B. thetaiotaomicron&lt;/i&gt; BSH mutant-colonized mice displayed altered metabolism, including reduced weight gain and respiratory exchange ratios, as well as transcriptional changes in metabolic, circadian rhythm, and immune pathways in the gut and liver. Our results demonstrate that metabolites generated by a single microbial gene and enzymatic activity can profoundly alter host metabolism and gene expression at local and organism-level scales.</description>

	<description>Understanding how patterning influences cell behaviors to generate three dimensional morphologies is a central goal of developmental biology. Additionally, comparing these regulatory mechanisms among morphologically diverse tissues allows for rigorous testing of evolutionary hypotheses. Zebrafish skin is endowed with a coat of precisely patterned bony scales. We use &lt;i&gt;in-toto &lt;/i&gt;live imaging during scale development and manipulations of cell signaling activity to elucidate core features of scale patterning and morphogenesis. These analyses show that scale development requires the concerted activity of Wnt/β-catenin, Ectodysplasin (Eda) and Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling. This regulatory module coordinates Hedgehog (HH) dependent collective cell migration during epidermal invagination, a cell behavior not previously implicated in skin appendage morphogenesis. Our analyses demonstrate the utility of zebrafish scale development as a tractable system in which to elucidate mechanisms of developmental patterning and morphogenesis, and suggest a single, ancient origin of skin appendage patterning mechanisms in vertebrates.</description>

	<description>Nitric oxide (NO) is released into the air by NO-producing organisms; however, it is unclear if animals utilize NO as a sensory cue. We show that &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;avoids &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa &lt;/i&gt;(PA14) in part by detecting PA14-produced NO. PA14 mutants deficient for NO production fail to elicit avoidance and NO donors repel worms. PA14 and NO avoidance are mediated by a chemosensory neuron (ASJ) and these responses require receptor guanylate cyclases and cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels. ASJ exhibits calcium increases at both the onset and removal of NO. These NO-evoked ON and OFF calcium transients are affected by a redox sensing protein, TRX-1/thioredoxin. TRX-1's trans-nitrosylation activity inhibits the ON transient whereas TRX-1's de-nitrosylation activity promotes the OFF transient. Thus, &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;exploits bacterially produced NO as a cue to mediate avoidance and TRX-1 endows ASJ with a bi-phasic response to NO exposure.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Cytokinin transfer by a free-living mirid to Nicotiana attenuata recapitulates a strategy of endophytic insects</title>

	<description>Endophytic insects provide the textbook examples of herbivores that manipulate their host plant's physiology, putatively altering source/sink relationships by transferring cytokinins (CK) to create 'green islands' that increase the nutritional value of infested tissues. However, unambiguous demonstrations of CK transfer are lacking. Here we show that feeding by the free-living herbivore &lt;i&gt;Tupiocoris notatus &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana attenuata&lt;/i&gt; is characterized by stable nutrient levels, increased CK levels and alterations in CK-related transcript levels in attacked leaves, in striking similarity to endophytic insects. Using &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-isotope labeling, we demonstrate that the CK &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-isopentenyladenine (IP) is transferred from insects to plants via their oral secretions. In the field, &lt;i&gt;T. notatus&lt;/i&gt; preferentially attacks leaves with transgenically increased CK levels; plants with abrogated CK-perception are less tolerant of &lt;i&gt;T. notatus&lt;/i&gt; feeding damage. We infer that this free-living insect uses CKs to manipulate source/sink relationships to increase food quality and minimize the fitness consequences of its feeding.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Insights into the ubiquitin transfer cascade catalyzed by the Legionella effector SidC</title>

	<description>The causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, &lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/i&gt;, delivers more than 330 virulent effectors to its host to establish an intracellular membrane-bound organelle called the &lt;i&gt;Legionella&lt;/i&gt; containing vacuole. Among the army of &lt;i&gt;Legionella&lt;/i&gt; effectors, SidC and its paralog SdcA have been identified as novel bacterial ubiquitin (Ub) E3 ligases. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of SidC/SdcA as Ub ligases, we determined the crystal structures of a binary complex of the N-terminal catalytic SNL domain of SdcA with its cognate E2 UbcH5C and a ternary complex consisting of the SNL domain of SidC with the Ub-linked E2 UbcH7. These two structures reveal the molecular determinants governing the Ub transfer cascade catalyzed by SidC. Together, our data support a common mechanism in the Ub transfer cascade in which the donor Ub is immobilized with its C-terminal tail locked in an extended conformation, priming the donor Ub for catalysis.</description>

	<description>Abnormalities in nucleic acid processing are associated with the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations in &lt;i&gt;Matrin 3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;MATR3&lt;/i&gt;), a poorly understood DNA- and RNA-binding protein, cause familial ALS/FTD, and MATR3 pathology is a feature of sporadic disease, suggesting that MATR3 dysfunction is integrally linked to ALS pathogenesis. Using a rat primary neuron model to assess MATR3-mediated toxicity, we noted that neurons were bidirectionally vulnerable to MATR3 levels, with pathogenic MATR3 mutants displaying enhanced toxicity. MATR3’s zinc finger domains partially modulated toxicity, but elimination of its RNA recognition motifs had no effect on survival, instead facilitating its self-assembly into liquid-like droplets. In contrast to other RNA-binding proteins associated with ALS, cytoplasmic MATR3 redistribution mitigated neurodegeneration, suggesting that nuclear MATR3 mediates toxicity. Our findings offer a foundation for understanding MATR3-related neurodegeneration and how nucleic acid binding functions, localization, and pathogenic mutations drive sporadic and familial disease.</description>

	<description>Type III protein secretion systems (T3SS) are encoded by several pathogenic or symbiotic bacteria. The central component of this nanomachine is the needle complex. Here we show in a &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; Typhimurium T3SS that assembly of the needle filament of this structure requires OrgC, a protein encoded within the T3SS gene cluster. Absence of OrgC results in significantly reduced number of needle substructures but does not affect needle length. We show that OrgC is secreted by the T3SS and that exogenous addition of OrgC can complement a &lt;i&gt;∆orgC&lt;/i&gt; mutation. We also show that OrgC interacts with the needle filament subunit PrgI and accelerates its polymerization into filaments &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. The structure of OrgC shows a novel fold with a shared topology with a domain from flagellar capping proteins. These findings identify a novel component of T3SS and provide new insight into the assembly of the type III secretion machine.</description>

	<description>The budding of tubular organs from flat epithelial sheets is a vital morphogenetic process. Cell behaviours that drive such processes are only starting to be unraveled. Using live-imaging and novel morphometric methods we show that in addition to apical constriction, radially-oriented directional intercalation of cells plays a major contribution to early stages of invagination of the salivary gland tube in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryo. Extending analyses in 3D, we find that near the pit of invagination, isotropic apical constriction leads to strong cell-wedging. Further from the pit cells interleave circumferentially, suggesting apically-driven behaviours. Supporting this, junctional myosin is enriched in, and neighbour exchanges are biased towards the circumferential orientation. In a mutant failing pit specification, neither are biased due to an inactive pit. Thus, tube budding involves radially-patterned pools of apical myosin, medial as well as junctional, and radially-patterned 3D-cell behaviours, with a close mechanical interplay between invagination and intercalation.</description>

	<description>Heritable variation in gene expression forms a crucial bridge between genomic variation and the biology of many traits. However, most expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) remain unidentified. We mapped eQTLs by transcriptome sequencing in 1,012 yeast segregants. The resulting eQTLs accounted for over 70% of the heritability of mRNA levels, allowing comprehensive dissection of regulatory variation. Most genes had multiple eQTLs. Most expression variation arose from &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-acting eQTLs distant from their target genes. Nearly all &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-eQTLs clustered at 102 hotspot locations, some of which influenced the expression of thousands of genes. Fine-mapped hotspot regions were enriched for transcription factor genes. While most genes had a local eQTL, most of these had no detectable effects on the expression of other genes in &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;. Hundreds of non-additive genetic interactions accounted for small fractions of expression variation. These results reveal the complexity of genetic influences on transcriptome variation in unprecedented depth and detail.</description>

	<description>For many proteins, aggregation is one part of a structural equilibrium that can occur. Balancing productive aggregation versus pathogenic aggregation that leads to toxicity is critical and known to involve adenosine triphosphate (ATP) dependent action of chaperones and disaggregases. Recently a second activity of ATP was identified, that of a hydrotrope which, independent of hydrolysis, was sufficient to solubilize aggregated proteins in vitro. This novel function of ATP was postulated to help regulate proteostasis in vivo. We tested this hypothesis on aggregates found in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocyte nucleoli. Our results indicate that ATP has dual roles in the maintenance of protein solubility. We provide evidence of endogenous hydrotropic action of ATP but show that hydrotropic solubilization of nucleolar aggregates is preceded by a destabilizing event. Destabilization is accomplished through an energy dependent process, reliant upon ATP and one or more soluble nuclear factors, or by disruption of a co-aggregate like RNA.</description>

	<description>Mutations in members of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling family are common events in cancer, but the mechanisms whereby disruption of SWI/SNF components alters tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. To model the effect of loss of function mutations in the SWI/SNF subunit Arid1a in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) initiation, we directed shRNA triggered, inducible and reversible suppression of Arid1a to the mouse pancreas in the setting of oncogenic Kras&lt;sup&gt;G12D&lt;/sup&gt;. Arid1a cooperates with Kras in the adult pancreas as postnatal silencing of Arid1a following sustained Kras&lt;sup&gt;G12D&lt;/sup&gt; expression induces rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous PDAC precursor lesions. In contrast, Arid1a silencing during embryogenesis, concurrent with Kras&lt;sup&gt;G12D&lt;/sup&gt; activation, leads to retention of acinar cell fate. Together, our results demonstrate Arid1a as a critical modulator of Kras-dependent changes in acinar cell identity, and underscore an unanticipated influence of timing and genetic context on the effects of SWI/SNF complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis.</description>

	<description>Birds and other vertebrates display stunning variation in pigmentation patterning, yet the genes controlling this diversity remain largely unknown. Rock pigeons (&lt;i&gt;Columba livia&lt;/i&gt;) are fundamentally one of four color pattern phenotypes, in decreasing order of melanism: T-check, checker, bar (ancestral), or barless. Using whole-genome scans, we identified &lt;i&gt;NDP&lt;/i&gt; as a candidate gene for this variation. Allele-specific expression differences in &lt;i&gt;NDP&lt;/i&gt; indicate &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-regulatory divergence between ancestral and melanistic alleles. Sequence comparisons suggest that derived alleles originated in the speckled pigeon (&lt;i&gt;Columba guinea&lt;/i&gt;), providing a striking example of introgression. In contrast, barless rock pigeons have an increased incidence of vision defects and, like human families with hereditary blindness, carry start-codon mutations in &lt;i&gt;NDP&lt;/i&gt;. In summary, we find that both coding and regulatory variation in the same gene drives wing pattern diversity, and post-domestication introgression supplied potentially advantageous melanistic alleles to feral populations of this ubiquitous urban bird.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Using GPUs to accelerate computational diffusion MRI: From microstructure estimation to tractography and connectomes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/371278v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The great potential of computational diffusion MRI (dMRI) relies on indirect inference of tissue microstructure and brain connections, since modelling and tractography frameworks map diffusion measurements to neuroanatomical features. This mapping however can be computationally highly expensive, particularly given the trend of increasing dataset sizes and the complexity in biophysical modelling. Limitations on computing resources can restrict data exploration and methodology development. A step forward is to take advantage of the computational power offered by recent parallel computing architectures, especially Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). GPUs are massive parallel processors that offer trillions of floating point operations per second, and have made possible the solution of computationally-intensive scientific problems that were intractable before. However, they are not inherently suited for all problems. Here, we present two different frameworks for accelerating dMRI computations using GPUs that cover the most typical dMRI applications: a framework for performing biophysical modelling and microstructure estimation, and a second framework for performing tractography and long-range connectivity estimation. The former provides a front-end and automatically generates a GPU executable file from a user-specified biophysical model, allowing accelerated non-linear model fitting in both deterministic and stochastic ways (Bayesian inference). The latter performs probabilistic tractography, it can generate whole-brain connectomes and supports new functionality for imposing anatomical constraints, such as inherent consideration of surface meshes (GIFTI files) along with volumetric images. We validate the frameworks against well established CPU-based implementations and we show that despite the very different challenges for parallelising these problems, GPU-based designs can offer accelerations of more than two orders of magnitude in both cases.</description>

	<description>Sleep and emotion are both powerful modulators of the long-term stability of episodic memories, but precisely how these factors interact remains unresolved. We assessed changes in item recognition, contextual memory, and affective tone for negative and neutral memories across a 12 h interval containing sleep or wakefulness in 71 human volunteers. Our data indicate a sleep-dependent stabilization of negative contextual memories, in a way not seen for neutral memories, item recognition, or across wakefulness. Furthermore, retention of contextual memories was positively associated with time spent in non-rapid eye movement sleep. Finally, our results offer partial support for the hypothesis that sleep attenuates emotional responses to previously memorized material.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neuronal overexpression of DYRK1A/minibrain alters motor decline, neurodegeneration and synaptic plasticity in Drosophila</title>

	<description>Down syndrome (DS) is characterised by abnormal cognitive and motor development, and later in life by progressive Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like dementia, neuropathology, declining motor function and shorter life expectancy. It is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (Hsa21), but how individual Hsa21 genes contribute to various aspects of the disorder is incompletely understood. Previous work has demonstrated a role for triplication of the Hsa21 gene DYRK1A in cognitive and motor deficits, as well as in altered neurogenesis and neurofibrillary degeneration in the DS brain, but its contribution to other DS phenotypes is unclear. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of minibrain (mnb), the Drosophila ortholog of DYRK1A, in the Drosophila nervous system accelerated age-dependent decline in motor performance and shortened lifespan. Overexpression of mnb in the eye was neurotoxic and overexpression in ellipsoid body neurons in the brain caused age-dependent neurodegeneration. At the larval neuromuscular junction, an established model for mammalian central glutamatergic synapses, neuronal mnb overexpression enhanced spontaneous vesicular transmitter release. It also slowed recovery from short-term depression of evoked transmitter release induced by high-frequency nerve stimulation and increased the number of boutons in one of the two glutamatergic motor neurons innervating the muscle. These results provide further insight into the roles of DYRK1A triplication in abnormal aging and synaptic dysfunction in DS.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Primacy coding facilitates effective odor discrimination when receptor sensitivities are tuned</title>

	<description>The olfactory system faces the difficult task of identifying an enormous variety of odors independent of their intensity. Primacy coding, where the odor identity is encoded by the receptor types that respond earliest, is one possible representation that can facilitate this task. So far, it is unclear whether primacy coding facilitates typical olfactory tasks and what constraints it implies for the olfactory system. In this paper, we develop a simple model of primacy coding, which we simulate numerically and analyze using a statistical description. We show that the encoded information depends strongly on the number of receptor types included in the primacy representation, but only weakly on the size of the receptor repertoire. The representation is independent of the odor intensity and the transmitted information is useful to perform typical olfactory tasks, like detecting a target odor or discriminating similar mixtures, with close to experimentally measured performance. Interestingly, we find situations in which a smaller receptor repertoire is advantageous for identifying a target odor. The model also suggests that overly sensitive receptor types could dominate the entire response and make the whole array useless, which allows us to predict how receptor arrays need to adapt to stay useful during environmental changes. By quantifying the information transmitted using primacy coding, we can thus connect microscopic characteristics of the olfactory system to its overall performance.</description>

	<description>Short-term depression is classically viewed as a low pass filter of synaptic information that reduces and flattens synaptic information transfer at high presynaptic firing frequencies. This view questions the relevance of spontaneous high firing rates in some networks. In the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia, neurons in the globus pallidus (GP), which are spontaneously active and fire over a wide frequency range, form depressing inhibitory synapses in the basal ganglia output nuclei. Here we investigated the contribution of the different firing rates of GP neurons to information transmission in the indirect pathway. We used numerical modeling and whole-cell recordings from single entopeduncular nucleus (EP) neurons in rat brain slices. Whole-cell recordings showed significant variability in steady-state depression which decreased as stimulation frequency increased. Modeling predicted that this variability would translate into different postsynaptic noise levels during constitutive presynaptic activity. Our simulations further predicted that brief changes in presynaptic activity would generate postsynaptic deflections of the membrane potential that are weakly dependent on baseline presynaptic firing rate. Our model predicted that due to short-term depression and slow kinetics of GP-EP synapses, the large range of GP firing rates would enable different modes of information transmission in which the magnitude and temporal features of postsynaptic modulation would change as a function of present and past firing rates of GP neurons. We confirmed these predictions using whole-cell recordings. Our results thus demonstrate how short-term synaptic depression shapes information transmission in the basal ganglia in particular and via GABAergic synapses in general.</description>

	<description>Purpose: To link the clinically defined retinal and perceptual deficits in glaucoma by quantifying optic nerve structural integrity in the human visual system. Methods: We characterized optic nerve (ON) neuropathy in patients with unilateral glaucoma (n = 6) using probabilistic diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) tractography. Results: Glaucoma was associated with reduced structural integrity of the optic nerves. Specifically, we found reduced fractional anisotropy in the ONs of eyes with advanced, as compared to mild, stages of disease (F(1,10) = 55.474, p &amp;lt; 0.00001). Furthermore, by comparing the ratios of ON fractional anisotropies in glaucoma subjects to those of healthy controls (n = 6) we determined that this difference was beyond that expected from normal anatomical variation (F(1,9) = 20.276, p &amp;lt; 0. 005). Finally, we linked neural integrity to clinical assessments. Retinal measures (vertical cup-to-disc ratio) predicted optic nerve neural integrity (ON FA) (F(1,10) = 11.061, p &amp;lt; 0.01), and neural integrity in turn predicted perceptual performance (visual field index (VFI)) (F(1,10) = 15.308, p &amp;lt; 0.005). Conclusion: We provide methods to detect glaucoma-related structural changes in the optic nerves and establish that the retinal, neural, and perceptual measures of glaucoma are well-correlated. Translational Relevance: We demonstrate the potential of diffusion MRI as a clinical tool in human glaucoma. Early detection is critical given the degenerative nature of the disease, and the availability of additional diagnostic tools such as dMRI may significantly improve treatment outcome.</description>

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) inhibit expression of target genes by binding to their RNA transcripts. It has been recently shown that RNA transcripts targeted by the same miRNA could “compete” for the miRNA molecules and thereby indirectly regulate each other. Experimental evidence has suggested that the aberration of such miRNA-mediated interaction between RNAs—called competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interaction—can play important roles in tumorigenesis. Given the difficulty of deciphering context-specific miRNA binding, and the existence of various gene regulatory factors such as DNA methylation and copy number alteration, inferring context-specific ceRNA interactions accurately is a computationally challenging task. Here we propose a computational method called Cancerin to identify cancer-associated ceRNA interactions. Cancerin incorporates DNA methylation, copy number alteration, gene and miRNA expression datasets to construct cancer-specific ceRNA networks. We applied Cancerin to three cancer datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Our results indicated that ceRNAs were enriched with cancer-related genes, and ceRNA modules in the inferred ceRNA networks were involved in cancer-associated biological processes. Using LINCS-L1000 shRNA-mediated gene knockdown experiment in breast cancer cell line to assess accuracy, Cancerin was able to predict expression outcome of ceRNA genes with high accuracy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/blL43-YkQ6E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The Band 3 (AE1, SLC4A1) membrane protein is found in red blood cells and in kidney where it functions as an electro-neutral chloride/bicarbonate exchanger. In this study, we have used molecular dynamics simulations to provide the first realistic model of the dimeric membrane domain of human Band 3 in an asymmetric lipid bilayer containing a full complement of phospholipids, including phosphatidylinositol 4,5–bisphosphate (PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and cholesterol, and its partner membrane protein Glycophorin A (GPA). The simulations show that the annular layer in the inner leaflet surrounding Band 3 was enriched in phosphatidylserine and PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. Cholesterol was also enriched around Band 3 but also at the dimer interface. The interaction of these lipids with specific sites on Band 3 may play a role in the folding and function of this anion transport membrane protein. GPA associates with Band 3 to form the Wright (Wr) blood group antigen, an interaction that involves an ionic bond between Glu658 in Band 3 and Arg61 in GPA. We were able to recreate this complex by performing simulations to allow the dimeric transmembrane portion of GPA to interact with Band 3 in a model membrane. Large-scale simulations showed that the GPA dimer can bridge Band 3 dimers resulting in the dynamic formation of long strands of alternating Band 3 and GPA dimers.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Kfh8ScEBncs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias is known to be associated with tissue heterogeneities including fibrosis. However, the impact of microscopic structural heterogeneities on conduction in excitable tissues remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how acellular microheterogeneities affect macroscopic conduction under conditions of normal and reduced excitability by utilizing a novel platform of paired &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; studies to examine the mechanisms of conduction. Regular patterns of nonconductive micro-obstacles were created in confluent monolayers of the previously described engineered-excitable Ex293 cell line. Increasing the relative ratio of obstacle size to intra-obstacle strand width resulted in significant conduction slowing up to 23.6% and a significant increase in wavefront curvature anisotropy, a measure of spatial variation in wavefront shape. Changes in bulk electrical conductivity and in path tortuosity were insufficient to explain these observed macroscopic changes. Rather, microscale behaviors including local conduction slowing due to microscale branching, and conduction acceleration due to wavefront merging were shown to contribute to macroscopic phenomena. Conditions of reduced excitability led to further conduction slowing and a reversal of wavefront curvature anisotropy due to spatially non-uniform effects on microscopic slowing and acceleration. This unique experimental and computation platform provided critical mechanistic insights in the impact of microscopic heterogeneities on macroscopic conduction, pertinent to settings of fibrotic heart disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-2oVZ0teIoQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Quantification of Total and Mutant Huntingtin Protein Levels in Biospecimens Using a Novel alphaLISA Assay</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The neurodegenerative Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) amplification in the huntingtin protein (HTT). Currently there is no effective therapy available for HD; however, several efforts are directed to develop and optimize HTT lowering methods to improve HD phenotypes. To validate these approaches, there is an immediate need for reliable, sensitive and easily accessible methods to quantify HTT expression. Using the AlphaLISA platform we developed two novel sensitive and robust assays for quantification of HTT in biological samples using commercially available antibodies. The first, a polyQ independent assay, measures the total pool of HTT; whilst the second, a polyQ dependent assay, preferentially detects the mutant form of HTT. Using purified HTT protein standards and brain homogenates from an HD mouse model, we determine a lower limit of quantification of 1 and 3 pM and optimal reproducibility with CV values lower than 7% for intra- and 20% for inter-assay. In addition, we used the assays to quantify HTT in neural stem cells generated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in human brain tissue lysates. Finally, we could detect changes in HTT levels in a mouse model where mutant HTT was conditionally deleted in neural tissue, verifying the potential to monitor the outcome of HTT lowering strategies. This analytical platform is ideal for high-throughput screens and thus has an added value for the HD community as a tool to optimize novel therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating HTT protein levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The HTT lowering approaches are widely investigated as possible therapies for HD. to support these strategies, there is a high need for reproducible and sensitive assays able to quantify HTT protein. In this study we describe two robust and sensitive assays based on the AlphaLISA platform, which are able to measure either the pool of wild-type and mutant HTT, polyQ independent assay, or preferentially mutant HTT, polyQ dependent assay, in biological samples. These assays constitute a very valuable tool for HD research as they apply readily accessible antibodies and have a simple implementation. Furthermore, the HTT AlphaLISA assays are suitable for use in high throughput studies and potentially could be multiplexed to monitor simultaneously different forms of HTT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Individual Differences in Motor Noise and Adaptation Rate Are Optimally Related</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0170-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Individual variations in motor adaptation rate were recently shown to correlate with movement variability or &quot;motor noise&quot; in a forcefield adaptation task. However, this finding could not be replicated in a meta-analysis of adaptation experiments. Possibly, this inconsistency stems from noise being composed of distinct components which relate to adaptation rate in different ways. Indeed, previous modeling and electrophysiological studies have suggested that motor noise can be factored into planning noise, originating from the brain, and execution noise, stemming from the periphery. Were the motor system optimally tuned to these noise sources, planning noise would correlate positively with adaptation rate and execution noise would correlate negatively with adaptation rate, a phenomenon familiar in Kalman filters. To test this prediction, we performed a visuomotor adaptation experiment in 69 subjects. Using a novel Bayesian fitting procedure, we succeeded in applying the well-established state-space model of adaptation to individual data. We found that adaptation rate correlates positively with planning noise (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;  =  0.44; 95%HDI=[0.27 0.59]) and negatively with execution noise (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = -0.39; 95%HDI=[-0.50 -0.30]). In addition, the steady-state Kalman gain calculated from planning and execution noise correlated positively with adaptation rate (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.54; 95%HDI = [0.38 0.66]). These results suggest that motor adaptation is tuned to approximate optimal learning, consistent with the &quot;optimal control&quot; framework that has been used to explain motor control. Since motor adaptation is thought to be a largely cerebellar process, the results further suggest the sensitivity of the cerebellum to both planning noise and execution noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Our study shows that the adaptation rate is optimally tuned to planning noise and execution noise across individuals. This suggests that motor adaptation is tuned to approximate optimal learning, consistent with &quot;optimal control&quot; approaches to understanding the motor system. In addition, our results imply sensitivity of the cerebellum to both planning noise and execution noise, an idea not previously considered. Finally, our Bayesian statistical approach represents a powerful, novel method for fitting the well-established state-space models that could have an influence on the methodology of the field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Heterogeneous inputs to central pattern generators can shape insect gaits. (arXiv:1807.05142v1 [math.DS])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05142</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05142</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In our previous work, we studied an interconnected bursting neuron model for
insect locomotion, and its corresponding phase oscillator model, which at high
speed can generate stable tripod gaits with three legs off the ground
simultaneously in swing, and at low speed can generate stable tetrapod gaits
with two legs off the ground simultaneously in swing. However, at low speed
several other stable locomotion patterns, that are not typically observed as
insect gaits, may coexist. In the present paper, by adding heterogeneous
external input to each oscillator, we modify the bursting neuron model so that
its corresponding phase oscillator model produces only one stable gait at each
speed, specifically: a unique stable tetrapod gait at low speed, a unique
stable tripod gait at high speed, and a unique branch of stable transition
gaits connecting them. This suggests that control signals originating in the
brain and central nervous system can modify gait patterns.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Local learning rules to attenuate forgetting in neural networks. (arXiv:1807.05097v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hebbian synaptic plasticity inevitably leads to interference and forgetting
when different, overlapping memory patterns are sequentially stored in the same
network. Recent work on artificial neural networks shows that an
information-geometric approach can be used to protect important weights to slow
down forgetting. This strategy however is biologically implausible as it
requires knowledge of the history of previously learned patterns. In this work,
we show that a purely local weight consolidation mechanism, based on estimating
energy landscape curvatures from locally available statistics, prevents pattern
interference. Exploring a local calculation of energy curvature in the
sparse-coding limit, we demonstrate that curvature-aware learning rules reduce
forgetting in the Hopfield network. We further show that this method connects
information-geometric global learning rules based on the Fisher information to
local spike-dependent rules accessible to biological neural networks. We
conjecture that, if combined with other learning procedures, it could provide a
building-block for content-aware learning strategies that use only quantities
computable in biological neural networks to attenuate pattern interference and
catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, this work clarifies how global
information-geometric structure in a learning problem can be exposed in local
model statistics, building a deeper theoretical connection between the
statistics of single units in a network, and the global structure of the
collective learning space.

	<description>Anhydrobiotes are rare microbes, plants and animals that tolerate severe water loss. Understanding the molecular basis for their desiccation tolerance may provide novel insights into stress biology and critical tools for engineering drought-tolerant crops. Using the anhydrobiote, budding yeast, we show that trehalose and Hsp12, a small intrinsically disordered protein (sIDP) of the hydrophilin family, synergize to mitigate completely the inviability caused by the lethal stresses of desiccation. We show that these two molecules help to stabilize the activity and prevent aggregation of model proteins both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt; in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We also identify a novel &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt;role for Hsp12 as a membrane remodeler, a protective feature not shared by another yeast hydrophilin, suggesting that sIDPs have distinct biological functions.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38017</link>
	<description>α-Xenorhabdolysins (Xax) are α-pore-forming toxins (α-PFT) that form 1-1.3 MDa large pore complexes to perforate the host cell membrane. PFTs are used by a variety of bacterial pathogens to attack host cells. Due to the lack of structural information, the molecular mechanism of action of Xax toxins is poorly understood. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the XaxAB pore complex from &lt;i&gt;Xenorhabdus nematophila&lt;/i&gt; and the crystal structures of the soluble monomers of XaxA and XaxB. The structures reveal that XaxA and XaxB are built similarly and appear as heterodimers in the 12-15 subunits containing pore, classifying XaxAB as bi-component α-PFT. Major conformational changes in XaxB, including the swinging out of an amphipathic helix are responsible for membrane insertion. XaxA acts as an activator and stabilizer for XaxB that forms the actual transmembrane pore. Based on our results, we propose a novel structural model for the mechanism of Xax intoxication.</description>

	<description>The HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) transcription factor is the master regulator of the metazoan response to chronic hypoxia. In addition to promoting adaptations to low oxygen, HIF drives cytoprotective mechanisms in response to stresses and modulates neural circuit function. How most HIF targets act in the control of the diverse aspects of HIF-regulated biology remains unknown. We discovered that a HIF target, the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;gene &lt;i&gt;cyp-36A1&lt;/i&gt;, is required for numerous HIF-dependent processes, including modulation of gene expression, stress resistance, and behavior. &lt;i&gt;cyp-36A1&lt;/i&gt; encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme that we show controls expression of more than a third of HIF-induced genes. CYP-36A1 acts cell non-autonomously by regulating the activity of the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-46, suggesting that CYP-36A1 functions as a biosynthetic enzyme for a hormone ligand of this receptor. We propose that regulation of HIF effectors through activation of cytochrome P450 enzyme/nuclear receptor signaling pathways could similarly occur in humans.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Distinct Cortical-Thalamic-Striatal Circuits Through the Parafascicular Nucleus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/370734v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/370734v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The thalamic parafascicular nucleus (PF), an excitatory input to the basal ganglia, is targeted with deep-brain-stimulation to alleviate a range of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, PF lesions disrupt the execution of correct motor actions in uncertain environments. Nevertheless, the circuitry of the PF and its contribution to action selection are poorly understood. We find that, in mice, PF forms the densest subcortical projection to the striatum. This projection arises from transcriptionally- and physiologically-distinct classes of PF neurons that are also reciprocally connected with functionally-distinct cortical regions, differentially innervate striatum neurons, and are not synaptically connected in PF. Thus, mouse PF contains heterogeneous neurons that are organized into parallel and independent associative, limbic, and motor circuits. Furthermore, these subcircuits share motifs of cortical-PF-cortical and cortical-PF-striatum organization that allow each PF subregion, via its precise connectivity with cortex, to coordinate diverse inputs to striatum.</description>

	<description>Dopamine modulation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediates diverse effects on neuronal physiology and function, but the expression of dopamine receptors at sub-populations of pyramidal neurons and interneurons remains unresolved. Here, we examine D1 receptor expression and modulation at specific cell types and layers in the mouse prelimbic PFC. We first show that D1 receptors are enriched in pyramidal neurons in both layers 5 and 6, and that these cells project intra-telencephalically, rather than to sub-cortical structures. We then find that D1 receptors are also present in interneurons, and enriched in VIP+ interneurons that co-expresses calretinin, but absent from PV+ and SOM+ interneurons. Finally, we determine that D1 receptors strongly and selectively enhance action potential firing in only a subset of these cortico-cortical neurons and VIP+ interneurons. Our findings define several novel sub-populations of D1+ neurons, highlighting how modulation via D1 receptors can influence both excitatory and disinhibitory micro-circuits in the PFC.</description>

	<description>A musician's nervous system is thought to specialize to their mode of music production. For instance, the pianist's control of hands and arms develops to facilitate greater dexterity at the keyboard, while the cellist develops control to play notes using both the fret board and/or bow. Our previous work, employing an anomalous musical event (AME) detection task, identified neural and behavioral correlates that differentiated between a specific class of musicians, cellists, and those without professional musical training and expertise. Here we investigate a fine-grain differentiation between musicians having different modes of musical production, specifically in terms of how these differences are manifested in the neural correlates identified in the AME task. We show, using electroencephalography (EEG), that both event related potentials (ERPs) and single-trial analysis of the EEG can grade musical expertise by mode of sound production. Important is that these fine-grained EEG correlates are observable absent any motor response or active music production by the individuals. We find evidence that these grades of expertise are mediated by different sensory-motor interactions emblematic of the sound production mode. More broadly, our results show that neural markers can both define types of musical expertise and decompose their source components when behavioral differences are either minute or indistinguishable.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Illuminating spatial A-to-I RNA editing signatures within the Drosophila brain</title>

	<description>Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, catalyzed by ADAR enzymes, is a ubiquitous mechanism that generates transcriptomic diversity. This process is particularly important for proper neuronal function; however, little is known about how RNA editing is dynamically regulated between the many functionally distinct neuronal populations of the brain. In this resource paper, we present a spatial RNA editing map in the Drosophila brain and show that different neuronal populations possess distinct RNA editing signatures. After purifying and sequencing RNA from genetically marked neuronal nuclei, we identified a large number of novel editing sites and compared editing levels in hundreds of transcripts across nine functionally different neuronal populations. We found distinct editing repertoires for each population, including novel sites in repeat regions of the transcriptome and differential editing in highly conserved and likely functional regions of transcripts that encode essential neuronal genes. These changes are site-specific and not driven by changes in Adar expression, suggesting a complex, targeted regulation of editing levels in key transcripts. This fine-tuning of the transcriptome between different neurons by RNA editing may account for functional differences between distinct populations in the brain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Effect of temporal and spatial asymmetries to the neuromuscular control of the lower limbs during stationary cycling</title>

	<description>Motor adaptations are a useful tool in the study of the neurophysiology and motor control of the lower limbs. However, motor adaptation paradigms for the lower limbs are typically based on locomotion tasks, where the necessity of maintaining a stable gait pattern is the main driver of adaptations and could possibly mask other underlying processes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether small temporal or spatial asymmetries can trigger motor adaptations during stationary cycling tasks where stability is not directly compromised. Therefore 14 healthy individuals participated in two experiments: in one the angle between the crank arms of the pedals was altered by 10 degrees to induce a temporal asymmetry; in the other the length of one pedal was shortened by 2.4 cm to induce a spatial asymmetry. We recorded the acceleration of the crank arms during the exercises and the EMGs of 16 muscles. The analysis of the accelerometer data was used to investigate the presence and extent of motor adaptations. Muscle synergies analysis was used to quantify changes in neuromuscular control. We found that motor adaptations are present in response to temporal asymmetries. This adaptation was obtained, at the neuromuscular level, mostly by rotating two synergies on the perturbed side. Spatial asymmetries, on the other hand, appear to trigger a feedback-driven response that does not present an aftereffect and is not consistent with a motor adaptation. All the changes in neuromuscular control were well explained by changes in recruitment of a fixed set of muscle synergies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The integration of visual and target signals in V4 and IT during visual object search</title>

	<description>Many everyday tasks require us to flexibly map incoming sensory information onto behavioral responses based on context. One example is the act of searching for a specific object, which requires our brain to compare the items in view with a remembered representation of a sought target to determine whether a target match is present. During object search, this comparison is thought to be implemented, in part, via the combination of top-down modulations reflecting target identity with feed-forward visual representations. However, it remains unclear whether these top-down signals are integrated at a single locus within the ventral visual pathway (e.g. V4) or at multiple stages (e.g. both V4 and inferotemporal cortex, IT). To investigate, we compared neural responses in V4 and IT recorded as rhesus monkeys performed a task that required them to identify when a target object appeared across variation in position, size and background context. We found non-visual, task-specific signals in both V4 and IT. To evaluate the plausibility that V4 was the only locus for the integration of top-down signals, we evaluated a number of feed-forward accounts of processing from V4 to IT, including a model in which IT preferentially sampled from the best V4 units, as well as a model that allowed for nonlinear IT computation. IT task-specific modulation could not be accounted for by any of these feed-forward descriptions, suggesting that during object search, top-down signals are integrated directly within IT itself.</description>

	<description>Inter-subject correlation (ISC) based analysis is a conceptually simple approach to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired under naturalistic stimuli such as a movie. We describe and validate the statistical approaches for comparing ISCs between two groups of subjects implemented in the ISC toolbox, which is an open source software package for ISC-based analysis of fMRI data. The approaches are based on permutation tests. We validated the approaches using five different data sets from the ICBM functional reference battery tasks. In these experiments, we created two matched groups of subjects and assumed that no group difference exists. Based on the experiments, we recommend the usage of subject-wise permutations, instead of element-wise permutations following Chen et al. (2016). However, we observed that the null-distributions should be voxel-specific and not based on pooling all voxels across the brain as is typical in fMRI. This was the case even if studentized permutation tests were used. Additionally, we experimented with an fMRI dataset acquired using a dance movie stimulus for comparison of the group of adult males in autism spectrum to the matched control group. The experiment confirmed the differences between voxel-based permutation tests and global model based permutation tests.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Seeing versus Knowing: The Temporal Dynamics of Real and Implied Colour Processing in the Human Brain</title>

	<description>Colour is a defining feature of many objects, playing a crucial role in our ability to rapidly recognise things in the world around us and make categorical distinctions. For example, colour is a vital cue when distinguishing lemons from limes or blackberries from raspberries. That means our representation of many objects includes key colour-related information. The question addressed here is whether the neural representation activated by knowing that something is red is the same as that activated when we actually see something red, particularly in regard to timing. We addressed this question using neural timeseries (magnetoencephalography, MEG) data to contrast real colour perception and implied object colour activation. We applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to focus, in particular, on the temporal dynamics of these processes. Male and female human participants (N=18) viewed isoluminant red and green shapes and grey-scale, luminance-matched pictures of fruits and vegetables that are red (e.g., tomato) or green (e.g., kiwifruit) in nature. We show that the brain activation pattern evoked by real colour perception is similar to implied colour activation, but that this pattern is instantiated at a later time. Similarly, participants were faster at categorising the colour of an abstract shape than they were at categorising the typical colour of grey-scale objects. Together, these results demonstrate that a common colour representation can be triggered by activating object representations from memory and perceiving colours. We show here that the key difference between these processes lies in the time it takes to access the common colour representation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Endogenous controllability of closed-loop brain-machine interfaces for pain.</title>

	<description>The ultimate aim of closed-loop brain-machine systems for pain is to directly titrate the ongoing level of an intervention to pain-related neural activity. However pain is highly susceptible to endogenous modulation, raising the possibility that active or passive changes in neural activity provoked by the operation of the system could enhance or interfere with the signals upon which it is based. We studied healthy subjects receiving intermittent pain stimuli in a real-time fMRI-based closed-loop feedback-stimulation task. We showed that multi-voxel pattern decoding of pain intensity could be used to train a control algorithm to learn to deliver less painful stimuli (adaptive decoded neurofeedback). However, the system engaged two types of endogenous processes in the brain. First, despite the inherent incentive for subjects to enhance the neural decodability of pain, decodability was either reduced or unchanged in classic pain-processing regions, including insula, dorsolateral prefrontal, and somatosensory cortices. However, increased decodability was observed in a putative pain modulatory region - the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC). Second, we found that pain perception itself was modulated by an endogenous computational uncertainty signal engaged as subjects learned the success rate of the system in reducing pain - an effect that also correlated with pgACC responses. The results illustrate how regionally and computationally specific co-adaptive brain-machine learning influences the efficacy of closed-loop systems for pain, and shows that pgACC acts as a key hub in the endogenous controllability of pain.</description>

	<description>GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus provide for local and long-distance coordination of functionally connected areas. Vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP+) interneurons occupy a distinct niche in the circuitry as many of them specialize in innervating GABAergic cells and providing network disinhibition. In the CA1 hippocampus, VIP+ interneuron-selective cells target local interneurons. Here, we discovered a novel type of VIP+ neuron whose axon innervates CA1 and also projects to the subiculum (VIP-LRPs). VIP-LRPs showed specific molecular properties and targeted interneurons within the CA1 area but both interneurons and pyramidal cells within subiculum. They were interconnected through gap junctions but demonstrated sparse spike coupling in vitro. In awake mice, VIP-LRPs decreased their activity during theta-run epochs and were active during quiet wakefulness but not coupled to sharp-wave ripples. Together, this study provides new evidence of VIP interneuron molecular diversity and functional specialization in controlling cell ensembles along hippocampo-subicular axis.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The role of the gustatory cortex in incidental experience-evoked enhancement of later taste learning</title>

	<description>The strength of learned associations between pairs of stimuli is affected by multiple factors, the most extensively studied of which is prior experience with the stimuli themselves. In contrast, little data is available regarding how experience with incidental stimuli (independent of any conditioning situation) impacts later learning. This lack of research is striking given the importance of incidental experience to survival. We have recently begun to fill this void using conditioned taste aversion (CTA), wherein an animal learns to avoid a taste that has been associated with malaise. We previously demonstrated that incidental exposure to salty and sour tastes (taste pre-exposure, TPE) enhances aversions learned later to sucrose. Here, we investigate the neurobiology underlying this phenomenon. First, we use immediate early gene (cFos) expression to identify gustatory cortex (GC) as a site at which TPE specifically increases the neural activation caused by taste-malaise pairing (i.e., TPE did not change cFos induced by either stimulus in isolation). Next, we use site-specific infection with the optical silencer Archaerhodopsin-T to show that GC inactivation during TPE inhibits the expected enhancements of both learning and CTA related cFos expression, a full day later. Thus, we conclude that GC is almost certainly a vital part of the circuit that integrates incidental experience into later associative learning.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Double Dissociation of Nicotinic alpha-7 and alpha-4/beta-2 Sub-receptor Agonists for Enhancing Learning and Attentional Filtering of Distraction</title>

	<description>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) modulate attention, memory, and higher executive functioning, but it has remained unclear whether nAChR sub-receptors tap into different neural mechanisms of these functions. We therefore set out to contrast the contributions of selective alpha-7 nAChR and alpha-4/beta-2 nAChR agonists in mediating value learning and attentional filtering of distractors in the nonhuman primate. We found that the alpha-7 nAChR agonist PHA- 543613 selectively enhanced the learning speed of feature values but did not modulate how salient distracting information was filtered from ongoing choice processes. In contrast, the selective alpha-4/beta-2 nAChR agonist ABT-089 did not affect learning speed but reduced distractibility. This double dissociation was dose-dependent and evident in the absence of systematic changes in overall performance, reward intake, motivation to perform the task, perseveration tendencies, or reaction times. These results suggest nicotinic sub-receptor-specific mechanisms consistent with (1) alpha-4/beta-2 nAChR specific amplification of cholinergic transients in prefrontal cortex linked to enhanced cue detection in light of interferences, and (2) alpha-7 nAChR specific activation prolonging cholinergic transients, which could facilitate subjects to follow-through with newly established attentional strategies when outcome contingencies change. These insights will be critical for developing function-specific drugs alleviating attention and learning deficits in neuro-psychiatric diseases.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Asymmetric effective connectivity between primate anterior cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortex revealed by electrical microstimulation.</title>

	<description>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) of the non-human primate show neural firing correlations and synchronize at theta and beta frequencies during the monitoring and shifting of attention. These functional interactions might be based on synaptic connectivity that is equally efficacious in both directions, but it might be that there are systematic asymmetries in connectivity consistent with reports of more effective inhibition within the ACC than lPFC, or with a preponderance of ACC projections synapsing onto inhibitory neurons in the lPFC. Here, we tested effective ACC-lPFC connectivity in awake monkeys and report systematic asymmetries in the temporal patterning and latencies of effective connectivity as measured using electrical microstimulation. We found that ACC stimulation triggered evoked fields (EFPs) were more likely to be multiphasic in the lPFC than in the reverse direction, with a large proportion of connections showing 2-4 inflection points resembling resonance in the 20-30 Hz beta frequency range. Stimulation of ACC [-&amp;gt;] lPFC resulted, on average, in shorter-latency EFPs than lPFC [-&amp;gt;] ACC. Overall, latencies and connectivity strength varied more than two-fold depending on the precise anterior-to-posterior location of the connections. These findings reveal systematic asymmetries in effective connectivity between ACC and lPFC in the awake non-human primate and document the spatial and temporal patchiness of effective synaptic connections. We speculate that measuring effective connectivity profiles will be essential for understanding how local synaptic efficacy and synaptic connectivity translates into functional neuronal interactions to support adaptive behaviors.</description>

	<description>Altered protein post-translational modifications such as glycosylation have become a target of investigation in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Disrupted glycosylation associated processes including atypical sphingolipid metabolism, reduced polysialylation of cell adhesion molecules, abnormal proteoglycan expression, and irregular glycan synthesis and branching have also been reported in this disorder. These pathways are regulated by the expression of glycosidases and glycosyltransferases, classes of enzymes which comprise approximately 2% of the genome. Many glycosylation enzymes can participate in multiple glycosylation pathways and dysregulation of enzyme expression could represent a common mechanism leading to a variety of glycan processing deficits in schizophrenia. In matched pairs of elderly schizophrenia and comparison subject (N = 12 pairs) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, we measured mRNA levels of 84 key glycosylation enzymes by qPCR array. We found dysregulated transcript expression of 36 glycosylation enzymes from 12 functional categories. All of the abnormally expressed enzymes demonstrated increased transcript expression in schizophrenia, and many altered enzymes are known to modify substrates that have been previously implicated in the pathophysiology this illness. These findings suggest that abnormal glycosylation enzyme expression in schizophrenia may contribute to dysregulation of multiple glycosylation pathways, and disruptions of these central cell signaling processes may underlie a variety of deficits in schizophrenia.</description>

We first discuss the experimental approaches to study activity-dependent plasticity of adult human synapses, and then highlight rules and mechanisms of Hebbian spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) found in these synapses. Finally, we conclude with thoughts on how these synaptic principles can underlie human learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Albert Pla, Xiangfu Zhong, Simon Rayner&lt;/p&gt;

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to partially complementary regions within the 3’UTR of their target genes. Computational methods play an important role in target prediction and assume that the miRNA “seed region” (nt 2 to 8) is required for functional targeting, but typically only identify ∼80% of known bindings. Recent studies have highlighted a role for the entire miRNA, suggesting that a more flexible methodology is needed. We present a novel approach for miRNA target prediction based on Deep Learning (DL) which, rather than incorporating any knowledge (such as seed regions), investigates the entire miRNA and 3’TR mRNA nucleotides to learn a uninhibited set of feature descriptors related to the targeting process. We collected more than 150,000 experimentally validated homo sapiens miRNA:gene targets and cross referenced them with different CLIP-Seq, CLASH and iPAR-CLIP datasets to obtain ∼20,000 validated miRNA:gene exact target sites. Using this data, we implemented and trained a deep neural network—composed of autoencoders and a feed-forward network—able to automatically learn features describing miRNA-mRNA interactions and assess functionality. Predictions were then refined using information such as site location or site accessibility energy. In a comparison using independent datasets, our DL approach consistently outperformed existing prediction methods, recognizing the seed region as a common feature in the targeting process, but also identifying the role of pairings outside this region. Thermodynamic analysis also suggests that site accessibility plays a role in targeting but that it cannot be used as a sole indicator for functionality.

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Selecting the most advantageous actions in a changing environment is a central feature of adaptive behavior. The midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons along with the major targets of their projections, including dopaminoceptive neurons in the frontal cortex and basal ganglia, play a key role in this process. Here, we investigate the consequences of a selective genetic disruption of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGluR5) receptors in the DA system on adaptive choice behavior, in mice. We tested the effects of the mutation on performance in the probabilistic reinforcement learning and probability discounting tasks. In case of the probabilistic choice, both the loss of NMDA receptors in dopaminergic neurons or loss mGluR5 receptors in D1 receptor-expressing dopaminoceptive neurons reduced the probability of selecting the more rewarded alternative and lowered the likelihood of returning to the previously rewarded alternative (win-stay). When observed behavior was fitted to reinforcement learning models, we found that these two mutations were associated with reduced effect of expected outcome on choice, i.e. more random choices. None of the mutations affected probability discounting, which indicates that all animals had normal ability to assess probability. However, in both behavioral tasks animals with targeted loss of NMDA receptors in dopaminergic neurons or mGluR5 receptors in D1 neurons were significantly slower to perform choices. In conclusion, these results show that glutamate receptor-dependent signaling in the DA system is essential for the speed and accuracy of choices, but at the same time probably not critical for correct estimation of probable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We investigated the role of glutamate signaling in the brain’s reward system in adaptive decision-making. We used genetically modified mice with disruption of glutamate signaling, that was caused by deletion of glutamate receptors in dopamine-producing and dopamine-sensitive neurons. When mutant mice were offered a choice between two alternatives with varying chances of being rewarded, the mutations decreased the probability of selecting the more often rewarded alternative, and the likelihood of repeating previously rewarded choice. Moreover, mutant animals were much slower in performing choices. Our results show that when glutamate signaling in the reward system is disrupted, it causes an impairment in decision-making, by increasing randomness and reducing the speed of decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Conflicted between Goal-Directed and Habitual Control - an fMRI Investigation</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;&quot;Slips of action&quot; occur in everyday life when we momentarily lose sight of a goal (for example when in a rush or distracted). Associative models propose that these habitual responses can be activated via a direct stimulus-response mechanism, regardless of the current hedonic value of the outcome. The slips-of-action task (SOAT) has been extensively used in both healthy and pathological populations to measure habit tendencies – the likelihood of making erroneous responses for devalued outcomes. Inspection of behavioral performance does not reveal, however, whether the impairments were due to impaired goal-directed control or aberrantly strong habit formation. In the current study we used functional MRI while human participants performed both the instrumental training and SOAT test phases, to elucidate the relative contributions of these mechanisms to performance on the SOAT. On trials in which conflict arises between competing goal-directed and habitual responses we observed increased activation across areas including the anterior cingulate cortex, paracingulate gyrus, lateral OFC, insula and inferior frontal gyrus. Responding for devalued outcomes was related to increased activation in the premotor cortex and cerebellum – implicating these regions in habitual responding. Increased activation in the caudate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontal pole during training was associated with better performance during the test phase, indicative of goal-directed action control. These results endorse interpretation of the SOAT in terms of competing goal-directed and habitual mechanisms and highlight that cognitive control processes present an additional bottleneck for successful performance on this task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Imagine that you step in the car intending to drive to your new office but distracted, end up driving the route to your old office instead. We are all familiar with the feeling that results from inadvertently carrying out a previously valid behavior, even if we no longer desire the consequence. In the current study we examined how the brain reacts to cues that signal a previously rewarded response whose outcome value has now changed. We were also able to identify the brain regions that were activated when participants made an erroneous (habitual) response under time-pressure. These results give us a richer sense of how the brain acts to control behavior when goal-directed processes are otherwise engaged.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Predicting Task and Subject Differences with Functional Connectivity and BOLD Variability. (arXiv:1807.04745v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04745</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04745</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found that functional connectivity (FC) can accurately
predict the identity of a subject performing a task and the type of task being
performed. We replicate these results using a large dataset collected at the
OSU Center for Cognitive and Behavioral Brain Imaging. We also introduce a
novel perspective on task and subject identity prediction: BOLD Variability
(BV). Conceptually, BV is a region-specific measure based on the variance
within each brain region. BV is simple to compute, interpret, and visualize. We
show that both FC and BV are predictive of task and subject, even across
scanning sessions separated by multiple years. Subject differences rather than
task differences account for the majority of changes in BV and FC. Similar to
results in FC, we show that BV is reduced during cognitive tasks relative to
rest.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental understanding of the network architecture of the brain is
necessary for the further development of theories explicating circuit function.
Perhaps as a derivative of its initial application to abstract informational
systems, network science provides many methods and summary statistics that
address the network's topological characteristics with little or no thought to
its physical instantiation. Recent progress has capitalized on quantitative
tools from network science to parsimoniously describe and predict neural
activity and connectivity across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Yet, for
embedded systems, physical laws can directly constrain processes of network
growth, development, and function, and an appreciation of those physical laws
is therefore critical to an understanding of the system. Recent evidence
demonstrates that the constraints imposed by the physical shape of the brain,
and by the mechanical forces at play in its development, have marked effects on
the observed network topology and function. Here, we review the rules imposed
by space on the development of neural networks and show that these rules give
rise to a specific set of complex topologies. We present evidence that these
fundamental wiring rules affect the repertoire of neural dynamics that can
emerge from the system, and thereby inform our understanding of network
dysfunction in disease. We also discuss several computational tools,
mathematical models, and algorithms that have proven useful in delineating the
effects of spatial embedding on a given networked system and are important
considerations for addressing future problems in network neuroscience. Finally,
we outline several open questions regarding the network architectures that
support circuit function, the answers to which will require a thorough and
honest appraisal of the role of physical space in brain network anatomy and
physiology.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Elements of Consciousness and Cognition. Biology, Mathematic, Physics and Panpsychism: an Information Topology Perspective. (arXiv:1807.04520v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This review presents recent and older results on elementary quantitative and
qualitative aspects of consciousness and cognition and tackles the question
&quot;What is consciousness?&quot; conjointly from biological, neuroscience-cognitive,
physical and mathematical points of view. It proposes to unify various results
and theories by means of information topology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chapter presents the postulates and results on elementary
perception at various organizational scales of the nervous system and proposes
the hypothesis of an electrodynamic intrinsic nature of consciousness which is
sustained by an analogical code. It underlines the diversity of the learning
mechanisms that sustain the dynamics of perception and consciousness, including
adaptive and homeostatic processes on multiple scales.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second chapter investigates the logical aspects of cognition and
consciousness and proposes an axiomatization based on measure and probability
theory. Topos and constructive logic are presented as providing an intrinsic
probabilistic logic, with the long-term aim of avoiding the paradoxical
decomposition induced by the Axiom of Choice. We sketch an elementary procedure
allowing an expression of the information of a mathematical formula a la Godel.
We then present the formalism of information topology and propose that it
provides a preliminary basis for synthesizing the main models of cognition and
consciousness within a formal Gestalt theory. Information topology establishes
a characterization of information theory functions, allowing for a precise
expression of information structures and patterns. It provides a quantification
of the structure of statistical interactions and their expression in terms of
statistical physics and machine learning. Notably, those topological methods
allow conciliation of some of the main theories of consciousness.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Analyzing P300 Distractors for Target Reconstruction. (arXiv:1807.04334v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04334</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;P300-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are often trained per-user and
per-application space. Training such models requires ground truth knowledge of
target and non-target stimulus categories during model training, which imparts
bias into the model. Additionally, not all non-targets are created equal; some
may contain visual features that resemble targets or may otherwise be visually
salient. Current research has indicated that non-target distractors may elicit
attenuated P300 responses based on the perceptual similarity of these
distractors to the target category. To minimize this bias, and enable a more
nuanced analysis, we use a generalized BCI approach that is fit to neither user
nor task. We do not seek to improve the overall accuracy of the BCI with our
generalized approach; we instead demonstrate the utility of our approach for
identifying target-related image features. When combined with other intelligent
agents, such as computer vision systems, the performance of the generalized
model equals that of the user-specific models, without any user specific data.

	<description>The severity of intestinal disease associated with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is variable in the patient population and this variability is partially conferred by the influence of modifier genes. Genome-wide association studies have identified &lt;i&gt;SLC6A14&lt;/i&gt;, an electrogenic amino acid transporter, as a genetic modifier of CF-associated meconium ileus. The purpose of the current work was to determine the biological role of &lt;i&gt;Slc6a14&lt;/i&gt;, by disrupting its expression in CF mice bearing the major mutation, F508del. We found that disruption of &lt;i&gt;Slc6a14&lt;/i&gt; worsened the intestinal fluid secretion defect characteristic of these mice. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies of mouse intestinal organoids revealed that exacerbation of the primary defect was associated with reduced arginine uptake across the apical membrane, with aberrant nitric oxide and cyclic GMP mediated regulation of the major CF-causing mutant protein. Together, these studies highlight the role of this apical transporter in modifying cellular nitric oxide levels, residual function of the major CF mutant and potentially, its promise as a therapeutic target.</description>

	<description>Sequential sampling models have provided a dominant theoretical framework guiding computational and neurophysiological investigations of perceptual decision-making. While these models share the basic principle that decisions are formed by accumulating sensory evidence to a bound, they come in many forms that can make similar predictions of choice behaviour despite invoking fundamentally different mechanisms. The identification of neural signals that reflect some of the core computations underpinning decision formation offers new avenues for empirically testing and refining key model assumptions.</description>

	<description>The central nervous system is not a static, hard-wired organ. Examples of neuroplasticity, whether at the level of the synapse, the cell, or within and between circuits, can be found during development, throughout the progression of disease, or after injury. One essential component of the molecular, anatomical, and functional changes associated with neuroplasticity is the spinal interneuron (SpIN). Here, we draw on recent multidisciplinary studies to identify and interrogate subsets of SpINs and their roles in locomotor and respiratory circuits.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modelling how responsiveness to interferon improves interferon-free treatment of hepatitis C virus infection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006335</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/-YZvCWuoO10/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Vishnu Venugopal, Pranesh Padmanabhan, Rubesh Raja, Narendra M. Dixit&lt;/p&gt;

Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for hepatitis C treatment tend to fare better in individuals who are also likely to respond well to interferon-alpha (IFN), a surprising correlation given that DAAs target specific viral proteins whereas IFN triggers a generic antiviral immune response. Here, we posit a causal relationship between IFN-responsiveness and DAA treatment outcome. IFN-responsiveness restricts viral replication, which would prevent the growth of viral variants resistant to DAAs and improve treatment outcome. To test this hypothesis, we developed a multiscale mathematical model integrating IFN-responsiveness at the cellular level, viral kinetics and evolution leading to drug resistance at the individual level, and treatment outcome at the population level. Model predictions quantitatively captured data from over 50 clinical trials demonstrating poorer response to DAAs in previous non-responders to IFN than treatment-naïve individuals, presenting strong evidence supporting the hypothesis. Model predictions additionally described several unexplained clinical observations, viz., the percentages of infected individuals who 1) spontaneously clear HCV, 2) get chronically infected but respond to IFN-based therapy, and 3) fail IFN-based therapy but respond to DAA-based therapy, resulting in a comprehensive understanding of HCV infection and treatment. An implication of the causal relationship is that failure of DAA-based treatments may be averted by adding IFN, a strategy of potential use in settings with limited access to DAAs. A second, wider implication is that individuals with greater IFN-responsiveness would require shorter DAA-based treatment durations, presenting a basis and a promising population for response-guided therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-YZvCWuoO10&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Many animals depend on descending information from the brain for the initiation and proper execution of locomotion. Interestingly, after injury and the loss of such inputs, locomotor function can sometimes be regained without the regrowth of central connections. In the medicinal leech, &lt;i&gt;Hirudo verbana&lt;/i&gt;, we have shown that crawling reemerges after removal of descending inputs. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying this return of locomotion by asking if central pattern generators (CPGs) in crawl-recovered leeches are sufficient to produce crawl-specific intersegmental coordination. From recovered animals, we treated isolated chains of ganglia with dopamine to activate the crawl CPGs (one crawl CPG per ganglion) and observed fictive crawl-like bursting in the dorsal-longitudinal-excitor motoneuron (DE-3), an established crawl-monitor neuron. However, these preparations did not exhibit crawl-specific coordination across the CPGs. Although the crawl CPGs always generated bidirectional activation of adjacent CPGs, we never observed crawl-appropriate intersegmental phase delays. Because central circuits alone were unable to organize crawl-specific coordination, we tested the coordinating role of the peripheral nervous system. In transected leeches normally destined for recovery, we removed afferent information to the anterior-most (lead) ganglion located below the nerve-cord transection site. In these dually treated animals, overt crawling was greatly delayed or prevented. After filling the peripheral nerves with Neurobiotin tracer distal to the nerve-root lesion, we found a perfect correlation between regrowth of peripheral neuronal fibers and crawl recovery. Our study establishes that during recovery after injury, crawl-specific intersegmental coordination switches to a new dependence on afferent information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of learning and behavior relies on the use of invasive techniques, which necessitate the use of animal models. However, when different species learn the same task, to what degree are they actually producing the same behavior and engaging homologous neural circuitry? This question has received virtually no recent attention, even as the most powerful new methodologies for measuring and perturbing the nervous system have become increasingly dependent on the use of murine species. Here, we test humans, rats, monkeys, and an evolutionarily intermediate species, tree shrews, on a three alternative, forced choice, visual contrast discrimination task. As anticipated, learning rate, peak performance, and transfer across contrasts was lower in the rat compared to the other species. More interestingly, rats exhibited two major behavioral peculiarities: while monkeys and tree shrews based their choices largely on visual information, rats tended to base their choices on past reward history. Furthermore, as the task became more difficult, rats largely disengaged from the visual stimulus, reverting to innate spatial predispositions in order to collect rewards near chance probability. Our findings highlight the limitation of muridae as models for translational research, at least in the area of visually based decision making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Genetic Control of Myelin Plasticity after Chronic Psychosocial Stress</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders often manifest in genetically susceptible individuals after psychosocial stress, but the mechanisms underlying these gene-environment interactions are largely unknown. We used the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model to study resilience and susceptibility to chronic psychosocial stress. We identified a strong genetic background effect in CSDS-induced social avoidance (SA) using four inbred mouse strains: 69% of C57BL/6NCrl (B6), 23% of BALB/cAnNCrl, 19% of 129S2/SvPasCrl, and 5% of DBA/2NCrl (D2) mice were stress resilient. Furthermore, different inbred mouse strains responded differently to stress, suggesting they use distinct coping strategies. To identify biological pathways affected by CSDS, we used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of three brain regions of two strains, B6 and D2: medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), ventral hippocampus (vHPC), and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). We discovered overrepresentation of oligodendrocyte (OLG)-related genes in the differentially expressed gene population. Because OLGs myelinate axons, we measured myelin thickness and found significant region and strain-specific differences. For example, in resilient D2 mice, mPFC axons had thinner myelin than controls, whereas susceptible B6 mice had thinner myelin than controls in the vHPC. Neither myelin-related gene expression in several other regions nor corpus callosum thickness differed between stressed and control animals. Our unbiased gene expression experiment suggests that myelin plasticity is a substantial response to chronic psychosocial stress, varies across brain regions, and is genetically controlled. Identification of genetic regulators of the myelin response will provide mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of stress-related diseases, such as anxiety disorders, a critical step in developing targeted therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Synaptic Mechanisms for Bandwidth Tuning in Awake Mouse Primary Auditory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy165</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy165/5052731?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Spatial size tuning in the visual cortex has been considered as an important neuronal functional property for sensory perception. However, an analogous mechanism in the auditory system has remained controversial. In the present study, cell-attached recordings in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake mice revealed that excitatory neurons can be categorized into three types according to their bandwidth tuning profiles in response to band-passed noise (BPN) stimuli: nonmonotonic (NM), flat, and monotonic, with the latter two considered as non-tuned for bandwidth. The prevalence of bandwidth-tuned (i.e., NM) neurons increases significantly from layer 4 to layer 2/3. With sequential cell-attached and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from the same neurons, we found that the bandwidth preference of excitatory neurons is largely determined by the excitatory synaptic input they receive, and that the bandwidth selectivity is further enhanced by flatly tuned inhibition observed in all cells. The latter can be attributed at least partially to the flat tuning of parvalbumin inhibitory neurons. The tuning of auditory cortical neurons for bandwidth of BPN may contribute to the processing of complex sounds.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Heritability of Regional Brain Volumes in Large-Scale Neuroimaging and Genetic Studies</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain genetics is an active research area. The degree to which genetic variants impact variations in brain structure and function remains largely unknown. We examined the heritability of regional brain volumes (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; ~ 100) captured by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in UK Biobank (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 9000). We found that regional brain volumes are highly heritable in this study population and common genetic variants can explain up to 80% of their variabilities (median heritability 34.8%). We observed omnigenic impact across the genome and examined the enrichment of SNPs in active chromatin regions. Principal components derived from regional volume data are also highly heritable, but the amount of variance in brain volume explained by the component did not seem to be related to its heritability. Heritability estimates vary substantially across large-scale functional networks, exhibit a symmetric pattern across left and right hemispheres, and are consistent in females and males (correlation = 0.638). We repeated the main analysis in Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 1100), Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 600), and Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 500) datasets, which demonstrated that more stable estimates can be obtained from the UK Biobank.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Interactions with the environment happen within one’s peripersonal space (PPS)—the space surrounding the body. Studies in monkeys and humans have highlighted a multisensory distributed cortical network representing the PPS. However, knowledge about the temporal dynamics of PPS processing around the trunk is lacking. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in humans while administering tactile stimulation (T), approaching auditory stimuli (A), and the 2 combined (AT). To map PPS, tactile stimulation was delivered when the sound was far, intermediate, or close to the body. The 19% of the electrodes showed AT multisensory integration. Among those, 30% showed a PPS effect, a modulation of the response as a function of the distance between the sound and body. AT multisensory integration and PPS effects had similar spatiotemporal characteristics, with an early response (~50 ms) in the insular cortex, and later responses (~200 ms) in precentral and postcentral gyri. Superior temporal cortex showed a different response pattern with AT multisensory integration at ~100 ms without a PPS effect. These results, represent the first iEEG delineation of PPS processing in humans and show that PPS and multisensory integration happen at similar neural sites and time periods, suggesting that PPS representation is based on a spatial modulation of multisensory integration.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Anterior Thalamic Excitation and Feedforward Inhibition of Presubicular Neurons Projecting to Medial Entorhinal Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The presubiculum contains head direction cells that are crucial for spatial orientation. Here, we examined the connectivity and strengths of thalamic inputs to presubicular layer 3 neurons projecting to the medial entorhinal cortex in the mouse. We recorded pairs of projection neurons and interneurons while optogenetically stimulating afferent fibers from the anterior thalamic nuclei. Thalamic input differentially affects presubicular neurons: layer 3 pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing interneurons are directly and monosynaptically activated, with depressing dynamics, whereas somatostatin-expressing interneurons are indirectly excited, during repetitive anterior thalamic nuclei activity. This arrangement ensures that the thalamic excitation of layer 3 cells is often followed by disynaptic inhibition. Feedforward inhibition is largely mediated by parvalbumin interneurons, which have a high probability of connection to presubicular pyramidal cells, and it may enforce temporally precise head direction tuning during head turns. Our data point to the potential contribution of presubicular microcircuits for fine-tuning thalamic head direction signals transmitted to medial entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How microcircuits participate in shaping neural inputs is crucial to understanding information processing in the brain. Here, we show how the presubiculum may process thalamic head directional information before transmitting it to the medial entorhinal cortex. Synaptic inputs from the anterior thalamic nuclei excite layer 3 pyramidal cells and parvalbumin interneurons, which mediate disynaptic feedforward inhibition. Somatostatin interneurons are excited indirectly. Presubicular circuits may switch between two regimens depending on the angular velocity of head movements. During immobility, somatostatin-pyramidal cell interactions could support maintained head directional firing with attractor-like dynamics. During rapid head turns, in contrast, parvalbumin-mediated feedforward inhibition may act to tune the head direction signal transmitted to medial entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Network Controllability in the Inferior Frontal Gyrus Relates to Controlled Language Variability and Susceptibility to TMS</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In language production, humans are confronted with considerable word selection demands. Often, we must select a word from among similar, acceptable, and competing alternative words to construct a sentence that conveys an intended meaning. In recent years, the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) has been identified as being critical to this ability. Despite a recent emphasis on network approaches to understanding language, how the LIFG interacts with the brain's complex networks to facilitate controlled language performance remains unknown. Here, we take a novel approach to understanding word selection as a network control process in the brain. Using an anatomical brain network derived from high-resolution diffusion spectrum imaging, we computed network controllability underlying the site of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the LIFG between administrations of language tasks that vary in response (cognitive control) demands: open-response tasks (word generation) versus closed response tasks (number naming). We found that a statistic that quantifies the LIFG's theoretically predicted control of communication across modules in the human connectome explains TMS-induced changes in open-response language task performance only. Moreover, we found that a statistic that quantifies the LIFG's theoretically predicted control of difficult-to-reach states explains vulnerability to TMS in the closed-ended (but not open-ended) response task. These findings establish a link among network controllability, cognitive function, and TMS effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work illustrates that network control statistics applied to anatomical connectivity data demonstrate relationships with cognitive variability during controlled language tasks and TMS effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: {alpha}2{delta}-1 Is Essential for Sympathetic Output and NMDA Receptor Activity Potentiated by Angiotensin II in the Hypothalamus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Both the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system are critically involved in hypertension development. Although angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulates hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) neurons to increase sympathetic vasomotor tone, the molecular mechanism mediating this action remains unclear. The glutamate NMDAR in the PVN controls sympathetic outflow in hypertension. In this study, we determined the interaction between α2-1 (encoded by &lt;i&gt;Cacna2d1&lt;/i&gt;), commonly known as a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel subunit, and NMDARs in the hypothalamus and its role in Ang II-induced synaptic NMDAR activity in PVN presympathetic neurons. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that α2-1 interacted with the NMDAR in the hypothalamus of male rats and humans (both sexes). Ang II increased the prevalence of synaptic α2-1–NMDAR complexes in the hypothalamus. Also, Ang II increased presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity via AT1 receptors, and such effects were abolished either by treatment with pregabalin, an inhibitory α2-1 ligand, or by interrupting the α2-1–NMDAR interaction with an α2-1 C terminus-interfering peptide. In &lt;i&gt;Cacna2d1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice (both sexes), Ang II failed to affect the presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity of PVN neurons. In addition, the α2-1 C terminus-interfering peptide blocked the sympathoexcitatory response to microinjection of Ang II into the PVN. Our findings indicate that Ang II augments sympathetic vasomotor tone and excitatory glutamatergic input to PVN presympathetic neurons by stimulating α2-1-bound NMDARs at synapses. This information extends our understanding of the molecular basis for the interaction between the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems and suggests new strategies for treating neurogenic hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although both the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system are closely involved in hypertension development, the molecular mechanisms mediating this involvement remain unclear. We showed that α2-1, previously known as a calcium channel subunit, interacts with NMDARs in the hypothalamus of rodents and humans. Angiotensin II (Ang II) increases the synaptic expression level of α2-1–NMDAR complexes. Furthermore, inhibiting α2-1, interrupting the α2-1–NMDAR interaction, or deleting α2-1 abolishes the potentiating effects of Ang II on presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity in the hypothalamus. In addition, the sympathoexcitatory response to Ang II depends on α2-1-bound NMDARs. Thus, α2-1–NMDAR complexes in the hypothalamus serve as an important molecular substrate for the interaction between the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system. This evidence suggests that α2-1 may be a useful target for the treatment neurogenic hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Causal Evidence for Mnemonic Metacognition in Human Precuneus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6379?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6379?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Metacognition is the capacity to introspectively monitor and control one's own cognitive processes. Previous anatomical and functional neuroimaging findings implicated the important role of the precuneus in metacognition processing, especially during mnemonic tasks. However, the issue of whether this medial parietal cortex is a domain-specific region that supports mnemonic metacognition remains controversial. Here, we focally disrupted this parietal area with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in healthy human participants of both sexes, seeking to ascertain its functional necessity for metacognition in memory versus perceptual decisions. Perturbing precuneal activity selectively impaired metacognitive efficiency of temporal-order memory judgment, but not perceptual discrimination. Moreover, the correlation in individuals' metacognitive efficiency between domains disappeared when the precuneus was perturbed. Together, these findings provide evidence reinforcing the notion that the precuneal region plays an important role in mediating metacognition of episodic memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Theories on the neural basis of metacognition have thus far been largely centered on the role of the prefrontal cortex. Here we refined the theoretical framework through characterizing a unique precuneal involvement in mnemonic metacognition with a noninvasive but inferentially powerful method: transcranial magnetic stimulation. By quantifying metacognitive efficiency across two distinct domains (memory vs perception) that are matched for stimulus characteristics, we reveal an instrumental role of the precuneus in mnemonic metacognition. This causal evidence corroborates ample clinical reports that parietal lobe lesions often produce inaccurate self-reports of confidence in memory recollection and establish the precuneus as a nexus for the introspective ability to evaluate the success of memory judgment in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Monoamines Inhibit GABAergic Neurons in Ventrolateral Preoptic Area That Make Direct Synaptic Connections to Hypothalamic Arousal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6366?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The hypothalamus plays an important role in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness states. While the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) plays a critical role in the initiation and maintenance of sleep, the lateral posterior part of the hypothalamus contains neuronal populations implicated in maintenance of arousal, including orexin-producing neurons (orexin neurons) in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN). During a search for neurons that make direct synaptic contact with histidine decarboxylase-positive (HDC+), histaminergic neurons (HDC neurons) in the TMN and orexin neurons in the LHA of male mice, we found that these arousal-related neurons are heavily innervated by GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area including the VLPO. We further characterized GABAergic neurons electrophysiologically in the VLPO (GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO&lt;/sup&gt; neurons) that make direct synaptic contact with these hypothalamic arousal-related neurons. These neurons (GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO-&amp;gt;HDC&lt;/sup&gt; or GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO-&amp;gt;orexin&lt;/sup&gt; neurons) were both potently inhibited by noradrenaline and serotonin, showing typical electrophysiological characteristics of sleep-promoting neurons in the VLPO. This work provides direct evidence of monosynaptic connectivity between GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and hypothalamic arousal neurons and identifies the effects of monoamines on these neuronal pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Rabies-virus-mediated tracing of input neurons of two hypothalamic arousal-related neuron populations, histaminergic and orexinergic neurons, showed that they receive similar distributions of input neurons in a variety of brain areas, with rich innervation by GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area, including the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), a region known to play an important role in the initiation and maintenance of sleep. Electrophysiological experiments found that GABAergic neurons in the VLPO (GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO&lt;/sup&gt; neurons) that make direct input to orexin or histaminergic neurons are potently inhibited by noradrenaline and serotonin, suggesting that these monoamines disinhibit histamine and orexin neurons. This work demonstrated functional and structural interactions between GABA&lt;sup&gt;VLPO&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and hypothalamic arousal-related neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Comparison of Decision-Related Signals in Sensory and Motor Preparatory Responses of Neurons in Area LIP</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6350?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the lateral intraparietal (LIP) area of Macaques exhibit both sensory and oculomotor preparatory responses. During perceptual decision making, the preparatory responses have been shown to track the state of the evolving evidence leading to the decision. The sensory responses are known to reflect categorical properties of visual stimuli, but it is not known whether these responses also track evolving evidence. We recorded neural responses from lateral intraparietal area of 2 female rhesus monkeys during a direction discrimination task. We compared sensory and oculomotor-preparatory responses in the same neurons when either the discriminandum (random dot motion) or an eye movement choice-target was in the neuron's response field. The neural responses in both configurations reflected the strength and direction of motion and were correlated with the animal's choice, albeit more prominently when the choice-target was in the response field. However, the variance and autocorrelation pattern of only the motor preparatory responses reflected the process of evidence accumulation. Simulations suggest that the task related activity of sensory responses could be inherited through lateral interactions with neurons that are carrying evidence accumulation signals in their motor-preparatory responses. The results are consistent with the proposal that evolving decision processes are supported by persistent neural activity in the service of actions or intentions, as opposed to high-order representations of stimulus properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Perceptual decision making is the process of choosing an appropriate motor action based on perceived sensory information. Association areas of the cortex play an important role in this sensory-motor transformation. The neurons in these areas show both sensory- and motor-related activity. We show here that, in the macaque parietal association area LIP, signatures of the process of evidence accumulation that underlies the decisions are predominantly reflected in the motor-related activity. This finding supports the proposal that perceptual decision making is implemented in the brain as a process of choosing between available motor actions rather than as a process of representing the properties of the sensory stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Brain Circuits Mediating Opposing Effects on Emotion and Pain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The amygdala is important for processing emotion, including negative emotion such as anxiety and depression induced by chronic pain. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in recent years on amygdala regulation of both negative (fear) and positive (reward) behavioral responses, our current understanding is still limited regarding how the amygdala processes and integrates these negative and positive emotion responses within the amygdala circuits. In this study with optogenetic stimulation of specific brain circuits, we investigated how amygdala circuits regulate negative and positive emotion behaviors, using pain as an emotional assay in male rats. We report here that activation of the excitatory pathway from the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) that relays peripheral pain signals to the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) is sufficient to cause behaviors of negative emotion including anxiety, depression, and aversion in normal rats. In strong contrast, activation of the excitatory pathway from basolateral amygdala (BLA) that conveys processed corticolimbic signals to CeA dramatically opposes these behaviors of negative emotion, reducing anxiety and depression, and induces behavior of reward. Surprisingly, activating the PBN–CeA pathway to simulate pain signals does not change pain sensitivity itself, but activating the BLA–CeA pathway inhibits basal and sensitized pain. These findings demonstrate that the pain signal conveyed through the PBN–CeA pathway is sufficient to drive negative emotion and that the corticolimbic signal via the BLA–CeA pathway counteracts the negative emotion, suggesting a top-down brain mechanism for cognitive control of negative emotion under stressful environmental conditions such as pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It remains unclear how the amygdala circuits integrate both negative and positive emotional responses and the brain circuits that link peripheral pain to negative emotion are largely unknown. Using optogenetic stimulation, this study shows that the excitatory projection from the parabrachial nucleus to the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) is sufficient to drive behaviors of negative emotion including anxiety, depression, and aversion in rats. Conversely, activation of the excitatory projection from basolateral amygdala to CeA counteracts each of these behaviors of negative emotion. Thus, this study identifies a brain pathway that mediates pain-driven negative emotion and a brain pathway that counteracts these emotion behaviors in a top-down mechanism for brain control of negative emotion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hand Motor Recovery Following Extensive Frontoparietal Cortical Injury Is Accompanied by Upregulated Corticoreticular Projections in Monkey</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6323?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6323?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We tested the hypothesis that arm/hand motor recovery after injury of the lateral sensorimotor cortex is associated with upregulation of the corticoreticular projection (CRP) from the supplementary motor cortex (M2) to the gigantocellular reticular nucleus of the medulla (Gi). Three groups of rhesus monkeys of both genders were studied: five controls, four cases with lesions of the arm/hand area of the primary motor cortex (M1) and the lateral premotor cortex (LPMC; F2 lesion group), and five cases with lesions of the arm/hand area of M1, LPMC, S1, and anterior parietal cortex (F2P2 lesion group). CRP strength was assessed using high-resolution anterograde tracers injected into the arm/hand area of M2 and stereology to estimate of the number of synaptic boutons in the Gi. M2 projected bilaterally to the Gi, primarily targeting the medial Gi subsector and, to a lesser extent, lateral, dorsal, and ventral subsectors. Total CRP bouton numbers were similar in controls and F2 lesion cases but F2P2 lesion cases had twice as many boutons as the other two groups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0002). Recovery of reaching and fine hand/digit function was strongly correlated with estimated numbers of CRP boutons in the F2P2 lesion cases. Because we previously showed that F2P2 lesion cases experience decreased strength of the M2 corticospinal projection (CSP), whereas F2 lesion monkeys experienced increased strength of the M2 CSP, these results suggest one mechanism underlying arm/hand motor recovery after F2P2 injury is upregulation of the M2 CRP. This M2-CRP response may influence an important reticulospinal tract contribution to upper-limb motor recovery following frontoparietal injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We previously showed that after brain injury affecting the lateral motor cortex controlling arm/hand motor function, recovery is variable and closely associated with increased strength of corticospinal projection (CSP) from an uninjured medial cortical motor area. Hand motor recovery also varies after brain injury affecting the lateral sensorimotor cortex, but medial motor cortex CSP strength decreases and cannot account for recovery. Here we observed that motor recovery following sensorimotor cortex injury is closely associated with increased strength of the descending projection from an uninjured medial cortical motor area to a brainstem reticular nucleus involved in control of arm/hand function, suggesting an enhanced corticoreticular projection may compensate for injury to the sensorimotor cortex to enable recovery of arm/hand motor function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dominant Neuropeptide Cotransmission in Kisspeptin-GABA Regulation of GnRH Neuron Firing Driving Ovulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6310?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6310?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A population of kisspeptin-GABA coexpressing neurons located in the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) is believed to activate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons to generate the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge triggering ovulation. Selective optogenetic activation of RP3V kisspeptin (RP3V&lt;sup&gt;KISS&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons in female mice for &amp;gt;30 s and ≥10 Hz in either a continuous or bursting mode was found to reliably generate a delayed and long-lasting activation of GnRH neuron firing in brain slices. Optogenetic activation of RP3V&lt;sup&gt;KISS&lt;/sup&gt; neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; at 10 Hz generated substantial increments in LH secretion of similar amplitude to the endogenous LH surge. Studies using GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonists and optogenetic activation of RP3V GABA (RP3V&lt;sup&gt;GABA&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; revealed that low-frequency (2 Hz) stimulation generated immediate and transient GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated increases in GnRH neuron firing, whereas higher frequencies (10 Hz) recruited the long-lasting activation observed following RP3V&lt;sup&gt;KISS&lt;/sup&gt; neuron stimulation. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, 2 Hz activation of RP3V&lt;sup&gt;GABA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons did not alter LH secretion, whereas 10 Hz stimulation evoked a sustained large increase in LH identical to RP3V&lt;sup&gt;KISS&lt;/sup&gt; neuron activation. Optogenetic activation of RP3V&lt;sup&gt;KISS&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in which kisspeptin had been deleted did not alter LH secretion. These studies demonstrate the presence of parallel transmission streams from RP3V neurons to GnRH neurons that are frequency dependent and temporally distinct. This comprises a rapid and transient GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated activation and a slower onset kisspeptin-mediated stimulation of long duration. At the time of the LH surge, GABA release appears to be functionally redundant with the neuropeptide kisspeptin being the dominant cotransmitter influencing GnRH neuron output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Miscommunication between the brain and ovaries is thought to represent a major cause of infertility in humans. Studies in rodents suggest that a population of neurons located in the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) are critical for activating the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons that trigger ovulation. The present study provides evidence that an RP3V neuron population coexpressing kisspeptin and GABA provides a functionally important excitatory input to GnRH neurons at the time of ovulation. This neural input releases GABA and/or kisspeptin in the classical frequency dependent and temporally distinct nature of amino acid-neuropeptide cotransmission. Unusually, however, the neuropeptide stream is found to be functionally dominant in activating GnRH neurons at the time of ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Single-Trial Phase Entrainment of Theta Oscillations in Sensory Regions Predicts Human Associative Memory Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6299?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6299?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Episodic memories are rich in sensory information and often contain integrated information from different sensory modalities. For instance, we can store memories of a recent concert with visual and auditory impressions being integrated in one episode. Theta oscillations have recently been implicated in playing a causal role synchronizing and effectively binding the different modalities together in memory. However, an open question is whether momentary fluctuations in theta synchronization predict the likelihood of associative memory formation for multisensory events. To address this question we entrained the visual and auditory cortex at theta frequency (4 Hz) and in a synchronous or asynchronous manner by modulating the luminance and volume of movies and sounds at 4 Hz, with a phase offset at 0° or 180°. EEG activity from human subjects (both sexes) was recorded while they memorized the association between a movie and a sound. Associative memory performance was significantly enhanced in the 0° compared with the 180° condition. Source-level analysis demonstrated that the physical stimuli effectively entrained their respective cortical areas with a corresponding phase offset. The findings suggested a successful replication of a previous study (Clouter et al., 2017). Importantly, the strength of entrainment during encoding correlated with the efficacy of associative memory such that small phase differences between visual and auditory cortex predicted a high likelihood of correct retrieval in a later recall test. These findings suggest that theta oscillations serve a specific function in the episodic memory system: binding the contents of different modalities into coherent memory episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How multisensory experiences are bound to form a coherent episodic memory representation is one of the fundamental questions in human episodic memory research. Evidence from animal literature suggests that the relative timing between an input and theta oscillations in the hippocampus is crucial for memory formation. We precisely controlled the timing between visual and auditory stimuli and the neural oscillations at 4 Hz using a multisensory entrainment paradigm. Human associative memory formation depends on coincident timing between sensory streams processed by the corresponding brain regions. We provide evidence for a significant role of relative timing of neural theta activity in human episodic memory on a single-trial level, which reveals a crucial mechanism underlying human episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuron activity accompanies synapse formation and maintenance, but how early circuit activity contributes to behavior development is not well understood. Here, we use the &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; egg-laying motor circuit as a model to understand how coordinated cell and circuit activity develops and drives a robust two-state behavior in adults. Using calcium imaging in behaving animals, we find the serotonergic hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs) and vulval muscles show rhythmic calcium transients in L4 larvae before eggs are produced. HSN activity in L4 is tonic and lacks the alternating burst-firing/quiescent pattern seen in egg-laying adults. Vulval muscle activity in L4 is initially uncoordinated but becomes synchronous as the anterior and posterior muscle arms meet at HSN synaptic release sites. However, coordinated muscle activity does not require presynaptic HSN input. Using reversible silencing experiments, we show that neuronal and vulval muscle activity in L4 is not required for the onset of adult behavior. Instead, the accumulation of eggs in the adult uterus renders the muscles sensitive to HSN input. Sterilization or acute electrical silencing of the vulval muscles inhibits presynaptic HSN activity and reversal of muscle silencing triggers a homeostatic increase in HSN activity and egg release that maintains ~12–15 eggs in the uterus. Feedback of egg accumulation depends upon the vulval muscle postsynaptic terminus, suggesting that a retrograde signal sustains HSN synaptic activity and egg release. Our results show that egg-laying behavior in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; is driven by a homeostat that scales serotonin motor neuron activity in response to postsynaptic muscle feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The functional importance of early, spontaneous neuron activity in synapse and circuit development is not well understood. Here, we show in the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; that the serotonergic hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs) and postsynaptic vulval muscles show activity during circuit development, well before the onset of adult behavior. Surprisingly, early activity is not required for circuit development or the onset of adult behavior and the circuit remains unable to drive egg laying until fertilized embryos are deposited into the uterus. Egg accumulation potentiates vulval muscle excitability, but ultimately acts to promote burst firing in the presynaptic HSNs which results in egg laying. Our results suggest that mechanosensory feedback acts at three distinct steps to initiate, sustain, and terminate &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; egg-laying circuit activity and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reorganization of Destabilized Nodes of Ranvier in {beta}IV Spectrin Mutants Uncovers Critical Timelines for Nodal Restoration and Prevention of Motor Paresis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6267?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Disorganization of nodes of Ranvier is associated with motor and sensory dysfunctions. Mechanisms that allow nodal recovery during pathological processes remain poorly understood. A highly enriched nodal cytoskeletal protein βIV spectrin anchors and stabilizes the nodal complex to actin cytoskeleton. Loss of murine βIV spectrin allows the initial nodal organization, but causes gradual nodal destabilization. Mutations in human βIV spectrin cause auditory neuropathy and impairment in motor coordination. Similar phenotypes are caused by nodal disruption due to demyelination. Here we report on the precise timelines of nodal disorganization and reorganization by following disassembly and reassembly of key nodal proteins in βIV spectrin mice of both sexes before and after βIV spectrin re-expression at specifically chosen developmental time points. We show that the timeline of nodal restoration has different outcomes in the PNS and CNS with respect to nodal reassembly and functional restoration. In the PNS, restoration of nodes occurs within 1 month regardless of the time of βIV spectrin re-expression. In contrast, the CNS nodal reorganization and functional restoration occurs within a critical time window; after that, nodal reorganization diminishes, leading to less efficient motor recovery. We demonstrate that timely restoration of nodes can improve both the functional properties and the ultrastructure of myelinated fibers affected by long-term nodal disorganization. Our studies, which indicate a critical timeline for nodal restoration together with overall motor performance and prolonged life span, further support the idea that nodal restoration is more beneficial if initiated before any axonal damage, which is critically relevant to demyelinating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Nodes of Ranvier are integral to efficient and rapid signal transmission along myelinated fibers. Various demyelinating disorders are characterized by destabilization of the nodal molecular complex, accompanied by severe reduction in nerve conduction and the onset of motor and sensory dysfunctions. This study is the first to report &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; reassembly of destabilized nodes with sequential improvement in overall motor performance. Our study reveals that nodal restoration is achievable before any axonal damage, and that long-term nodal destabilization causes irreversible axonal structural changes that prevent functional restoration. Our studies provide significant insights into timely restoration of nodal domains as a potential therapeutic approach in treatment of demyelinating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: NOS3 Inhibition Confers Post-Ischemic Protection to Young and Aging White Matter Integrity by Conserving Mitochondrial Dynamics and Miro-2 Levels</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/28/6247?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;White matter (WM) damage following a stroke underlies a majority of the neurological disability that is subsequently observed. Although ischemic injury mechanisms are age-dependent, conserving axonal mitochondria provides consistent post-ischemic protection to young and aging WM. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activation is a major cause of oxidative and mitochondrial injury in gray matter during ischemia; therefore, we used a pure WM tract, isolated male mouse optic nerve, to investigate whether NOS inhibition provides post-ischemic functional recovery by preserving mitochondria. We show that pan-NOS inhibition applied before oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) promotes functional recovery of young and aging axons and preserves WM cellular architecture. This protection correlates with reduced nitric oxide (NO) generation, restored glutathione production, preserved axonal mitochondria and oligodendrocytes, and preserved ATP levels. Pan-NOS inhibition provided post-ischemic protection to only young axons, whereas selective inhibition of NOS3 conferred post-ischemic protection to both young and aging axons. Concurrently, genetic deletion of NOS3 conferred long-lasting protection to young axons against ischemia. OGD upregulated NOS3 levels in astrocytes, and we show for the first time that inhibition of NOS3 generation in glial cells prevents axonal mitochondrial fission and restores mitochondrial motility to confer protection to axons by preserving Miro-2 levels. Interestingly, NOS1 inhibition exerted post-ischemic protection selectively to aging axons, which feature age-dependent mechanisms of oxidative injury in WM. Our study provides the first evidence that inhibition of glial NOS activity confers long-lasting benefits to WM function and structure and suggests caution in defining the role of NO in cerebral ischemia at vascular and cellular levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; White matter (WM) injury during stroke is manifested as the subsequent neurological disability in surviving patients. Aging primarily impacts CNS WM and mechanisms of ischemic WM injury change with age. Nitric oxide is involved in various mitochondrial functions and we propose that inhibition of glia-specific nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms promotes axon function recovery by preserving mitochondrial structure, function, integrity, and motility. Using electrophysiology and three-dimensional electron microscopy, we show that NOS3 inhibition provides a common target to improve young and aging axon function, whereas NOS1 inhibition selectively protects aging axons when applied after injury. This study provides the first evidence that inhibition of glial cell NOS activity confers long-lasting benefits to WM structure and function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Computer modelling of connectivity change suggests epileptogenesis mechanisms in idiopathic generalised epilepsy. (arXiv:1807.03696v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03696</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03696</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) typically have normal
conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hence diagnosis based on MRI is
challenging. Anatomical abnormalities underlying brain dysfunctions in IGE are
unclear and their relation to the pathomechanisms of epileptogenesis is poorly
understood. In this study, we applied connectometry, an advanced quantitative
neuroimaging technique for investigating localised changes in white-matter
tissues in vivo. Analysing white matter structures of 32 subjects we
incorporated our in vivo findings in a computational model of seizure dynamics
to suggest a plausible mechanism of epileptogenesis. Patients with IGE have
significant bilateral alterations in major white-matter fascicles. In cingulum,
fornix, and superior longitudinal fasciculus, tract integrity is compromised,
whereas in specific parts of tracts between thalamus and the precentral gyrus,
tract integrity is enhanced in patients. Incorporating these alterations in a
classification framework, we found that patients and controls are linearly
separable with 81.3% accuracy and 83.3% sensitivity. The computational model,
informed with the findings on the tract abnormalities, specifically highlighted
the importance of enhanced cortico-reticular connections along with impaired
cortico-cortical connections in inducing pathological seizure-like dynamics. We
emphasise taking directionality of brain connectivity into consideration
towards understanding the pathological mechanisms; this is possible by
combining neuroimaging and computational modelling. Our imaging evidence of
structural alterations in IGEs may be applied as non-invasive diagnostic
biomarker. We suggest that impaired connectivity from cortical regions to the
thalamic reticular nucleus offers a therapeutic target for selectively
modifying the brain circuit to reverse the mechanisms leading to
epileptogenesis.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Information-theoretic analysis of realistic odor plumes: What cues are useful for determining location?</title>

Many species rely on olfaction to navigate towards food sources or mates. Olfactory navigation is a challenging task since odor environments are typically turbulent. While time-averaged odor concentration varies smoothly with the distance to the source, instaneous concentrations are intermittent and obtaining stable averages takes longer than the typical intervals between animals’ navigation decisions. How to effectively sample from the odor distribution to determine sampling location is the focus on this article. To investigate which sampling strategies are most informative about the location of an odor source, we recorded three naturalistic stimuli with planar lased-induced fluorescence and used an information-theoretic approach to quantify the information that different sampling strategies provide about sampling location. Specifically, we compared multiple sampling strategies based on a fixed number of coding bits for encoding the olfactory stimulus. When the coding bits were all allocated to representing odor concentration at a single sensor, information rapidly saturated. Using the same number of coding bits in two sensors provides more information, as does coding multiple samples at different times. When accumulating multiple samples at a fixed location, the temporal sequence does not yield a large amount of information and can be averaged with minimal loss. Furthermore, we show that histogram-equalization is not the most efficient way to use coding bits when using the olfactory sample to determine location.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zIMMO9rrGJQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Phase-lags in large scale brain synchronization: Methodological considerations and in-silico analysis</title>

Architecture of phase relationships among neural oscillations is central for their functional significance but has remained theoretically poorly understood. We use phenomenological model of delay-coupled oscillators with increasing degree of topological complexity to identify underlying principles by which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain governs the phase lags between oscillatory activity at distant regions. Phase relations and their regions of stability are derived and numerically confirmed for two oscillators and for networks with randomly distributed or clustered bimodal delays, as a first approximation for the brain structural connectivity. Besides in-phase, clustered delays can induce anti-phase synchronization for certain frequencies, while the sign of the lags is determined by the natural frequencies and by the inhomogeneous network interactions. For in-phase synchronization faster oscillators always phase lead, while stronger connected nodes lag behind the weaker during frequency depression, which consistently arises for in-silico results. If nodes are in anti-phase regime, then a distance &lt;i&gt;π&lt;/i&gt; is added to the in-phase trends. The statistics of the phases is calculated from the phase locking values (PLV), as in many empirical studies, and we scrutinize the method’s impact. The choice of surrogates do not affects the mean of the observed phase lags, but higher significance levels that are generated by some surrogates, cause decreased variance and might fail to detect the generally weaker coherence of the interhemispheric links. These links are also affected by the non-stationary and intermittent synchronization, which causes multimodal phase lags that can be misleading if averaged. Taken together, the results describe quantitatively the impact of the spatio-temporal connectivity of the brain to the synchronization patterns between brain regions, and to uncover mechanisms through which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain renders phases to be distributed around 0 and &lt;i&gt;π&lt;/i&gt;.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Examining the Reversibility of Long-Term Behavioral Disruptions in Progeny of Maternal SSRI Exposure</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Serotonergic dysregulation is implicated in numerous psychiatric disorders. Serotonin plays widespread trophic roles during neurodevelopment; thus perturbations to this system during development may increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Epidemiological studies have examined association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment during pregnancy and increased autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring. It is unclear from these studies whether ASD susceptibility is purely related to maternal psychiatric diagnosis, or if treatment poses additional risk. We sought to determine whether maternal SSRI treatment alone or in combination with genetically vulnerable background was sufficient to induce offspring behavior disruptions relevant to ASD. We exposed C57BL/6J or &lt;i&gt;Celf6&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mouse dams to fluoxetine (FLX) during different periods of gestation and lactation and characterized offspring on tasks assessing social communicative interaction and repetitive behavior patterns including sensory sensitivities. We demonstrate robust reductions in pup ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and alterations in social hierarchy behaviors, as well as perseverative behaviors and tactile hypersensitivity. &lt;i&gt;Celf6&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice demonstrate social communicative deficits and perseverative behaviors, without further interaction with FLX. FLX re-exposure in adulthood ameliorates the tactile hypersensitivity yet exacerbates the dominance phenotype. This suggests acute deficiencies in serotonin levels likely underlie the abnormal responses to sensory stimuli, while the social alterations are instead due to altered development of social circuits. These findings indicate maternal FLX treatment, independent of maternal stress, can induce behavioral disruptions in mammalian offspring, thus contributing to our understanding of the developmental role of the serotonin system and the possible risks to offspring of SSRI treatment during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A quantum uncertainty entails entangled linguistic sequences. (arXiv:1807.03174v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synchronization of finite spike sequences is the way two brain regions
compare their content and extract the most suitable sequence. This is the core
of the linguistic comparison between a word and a previous one retrieved by
memory. Classifying the information content of neural spike trains, an
uncertainty relation emerges between the bit size of a word and its duration.
This uncertainty affects the task of synchronizing spike trains of different
duration representing different words, entailing the occurrence of entangled
sequences, so that word comparison amounts to a measurement based quantum
computation. Entanglement explains the inverse Bayes inference that connects
different words in a linguistic search. The behaviour here discussed provides
an explanation for other reported evidences of quantum effects in human
cognitive processes lacking a plausible framework, since either no assignment
of an appropriate quantum constant had been associated, or speculating on
microscopic processes dependent on Planck's constant resulted in unrealistic
de-coherence times.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fiber photometry permits monitoring fluorescent indicators of neural activity
in behaving animals. Optical fibers are typically used to excite and collect
fluorescence from genetically-encoded calcium indicators expressed by a subset
of neurons in a circuit of interest. However, a quantitative understanding of
the brain volumes from which signal is collected and how this depends on the
properties of the optical fibers are lacking. Here we analytically model and
experimentally measure the light emission and collection fields for optical
fibers in solution and scattering tissue, providing a comprehensive
characterization of fibers commonly employed for fiber photometry. Since
photometry signals depend on both excitation and collection efficiency, a
combined confocal/2-photon microscope was developed to evaluate these
parameters independently. We find that the 80% of the effective signal arises
from a 10^5-10^6 um3 volume extending ~200 um from the fiber face, and thus
permitting a spatial interpretation of measurements made with fiber photometry.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The permutation test is known as the exact test procedure in statistics.
However, often it is not exact in practice and only an approximate method since
only a small fraction of every possible permutation is generated. Even for a
small sample size, it often requires to generate tens of thousands
permutations, which can be a serious computational bottleneck. In this paper,
we propose a novel combinatorial inference procedure that enumerates all
possible permutations combinatorially without any resampling. The proposed
method is validated against the standard permutation test in simulation studies
with the ground truth. The method is further applied in twin DTI study in
determining the genetic contribution of the minimum spanning tree of the
structural brain connectivity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: An ALE meta-analytic comparison of verbal working memory tasks. (arXiv:1807.02755v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02755</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02755</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The n-back and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) are
commonly used verbal working memory tasks that have partially overlapping uses
in clinical and experimental psychology. We performed three activation
likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses, comparing two load levels of the
n-back task (2-back, 3-back) to the PASAT and to each-other. These analyses
aimed to determine the involvement of cognitive and emotional brain regions for
these tasks. Results: We observed higher overall likelihood of activation the
frontal eye fields in the 3-back. The PASAT exhibited higher overall activation
in the bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMA), left supramarginal gyrus, and
left superior parietal lobule. Furthermore, the 3-back exhibited higher
activation in the right SMA, and anterior mid-cingulate cortex versus the
2-back, and the PASAT exhibited higher activation in a cluster near the right
premotor area versus the 2-back. A laterality effect was observed in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the PASAT (left) and 3-back(right).
These data suggest greater activation of regions traditionally associated with
the phonological loop during the PASAT, compared to the 2- and 3-back tasks.
Furthermore, individual ALE analyses suggest involvement of emotional
processing and salience network regions (insula, cingulate) in addition to the
well-established verbal working memory regions (Broca's region, bilateral SMA,
premotor, posterior parietal cortices) in all 3 tasks. Conclusions: Here we
identify regions activated by the PASAT, which has not been meta-analytically
reviewed prior to this study. Using ALE meta-analysis, we have also identified
meaningful differences in activation associated with specific cognitive and
emotional aspects of verbal working memory during these tasks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A convex code is a binary code generated by the pattern of intersections of a
collection of open convex sets in some Euclidean space. Convex codes are
relevant to neuroscience as they arise from the activity of neurons that have
convex receptive fields. In this paper, we use algebraic methods to determine
if a code is convex. Specifically, we use the neural ideal of a code, which is
a generalization of the Stanley-Reisner ideal. Using the neural ideal together
with its standard generating set, the canonical form, we provide algebraic
signatures of certain families of codes that are non-convex. We connect these
signatures to the precise conditions on the arrangement of sets that prevent
the codes from being convex. Finally, we also provide algebraic signatures for
some families of codes that are convex, including the class of
intersection-complete codes. These results allow us to detect convexity and
non-convexity in a variety of situations, and point to some interesting open
questions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Gradient Hyperalignment for multi-subject fMRI data alignment. (arXiv:1807.02612v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-subject fMRI data analysis is an interesting and challenging problem in
human brain decoding studies. The inherent anatomical and functional
variability across subjects make it necessary to do both anatomical and
functional alignment before classification analysis. Besides, when it comes to
big data, time complexity becomes a problem that cannot be ignored. This paper
proposes Gradient Hyperalignment (Gradient-HA) as a gradient-based functional
alignment method that is suitable for multi-subject fMRI datasets with large
amounts of samples and voxels. The advantage of Gradient-HA is that it can
solve independence and high dimension problems by using Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) and Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA). Validation using
multi-classification tasks on big data demonstrates that Gradient-HA method has
less time complexity and better or comparable performance compared with other
state-of-the-art functional alignment methods.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A gradient flow formulation for the stochastic Amari neural field model. (arXiv:1807.02575v1 [math.AP])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We study stochastic Amari-type neural field equations, which are mean-field
models for neural activity in the cortex. We prove that under certain
assumptions on the coupling kernel, the neural field model can be viewed as a
gradient flow in a nonlocal Hilbert space. This makes all gradient-flow methods
available for the analysis, which could previously not be used, as it was not
known, whether a rigorous gradient flow formulation exists. We show that the
equation is well-posed in the nonlocal Hilbert space in the sense that
solutions starting in this space also remain in it for all times and space-time
regularity results hold for the case of spatially correlated noise. Uniqueness
of invariant measures and ergodic properties for the associated Feller
semigroups are also discussed.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Neural-Astrocytic Network Architecture: Astrocytic calcium waves modulate synchronous neuronal activity. (arXiv:1807.02514v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02514</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02514</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the role of astrocytes in brain computation is a nascent
challenge, promising immense rewards, in terms of new neurobiological knowledge
that can be translated into artificial intelligence. In our ongoing effort to
identify principles endow-ing the astrocyte with unique functions in brain
computation, and translate them into neural-astrocytic networks (NANs), we
propose a biophysically realistic model of an astrocyte that preserves the
experimentally observed spatial allocation of its distinct subcellular
compartments. We show how our model may encode, and modu-late, the extent of
synchronous neural activity via calcium waves that propagate intracellularly
across the astrocytic compartments. This relationship between neural activity
and astrocytic calcium waves has long been speculated but it is still lacking a
mechanistic explanation. Our model suggests an astrocytic &quot;calcium cascade&quot;
mechanism for neuronal synchronization, which may empower NANs by imposing
periodic neural modulation known to reduce coding errors. By expanding our
notions of information processing in astrocytes, our work aims to solidify a
computational role for non-neuronal cells and incorporate them into artificial
networks.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: NMDA Receptor-Mediated Motor Cortex Plasticity After 20 Hz Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation</title>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy160/5051079?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been shown to modulate neural oscillations and excitability levels in the primary motor cortex (M1). These effects can last for more than an hour and an involvement of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;-methyl-&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) mediated synaptic plasticity has been suggested. However, to date the cortical mechanisms underlying tACS after-effects have not been explored. Here, we applied 20 Hz beta tACS to M1 while participants received either the NMDAR antagonist dextromethorphan or a placebo and the effects on cortical beta oscillations and excitability were explored. When a placebo medication was administered, beta tACS was found to increase cortical excitability and beta oscillations for at least 60 min, whereas when dextromethorphan was administered, these effects were completely abolished. These results provide the first direct evidence that tACS can induce NMDAR-mediated plasticity in the motor cortex, which contributes to our understanding of tACS-induced influences on human motor cortex physiology.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Microglia: An Intrinsic Component of the Proliferative Zones in the Fetal Rhesus Monkey (Macaca mulatta) Cerebral Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Microglial cells are increasingly recognized as modulators of brain development. We previously showed that microglia colonize the cortical proliferative zones in the prenatal brain and regulate the number of precursor cells through phagocytosis. To better define cellular interactions between microglia and proliferative cells, we performed lentiviral vector-mediated intraventricular gene transfer to induce enhanced green fluorescent protein expression in fetal cerebrocortical cells. Tissues were collected and counterstained with cell-specific markers to label microglial cells and identify other cortical cell types. We found that microglial cells intimately interact with the radial glial scaffold and make extensive contacts with neural precursor cells throughout the proliferative zones, particularly in the rhesus monkey fetus when compared to rodents. We also identify a subtype of microglia, which we term ‘periventricular microglia’, that interact closely with mitotic precursor cells in the ventricular zone. Our data suggest that microglia are structural modulators that facilitate remodeling of the proliferative zones as precursor cells migrate away from the ventricle and may facilitate the delamination of precursor cells. Taken together, these results indicate that microglial cells are an integral component of cortical proliferative zones and contribute to the interactive milieu in which cortical precursor cells function.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Differential roles of sleep spindles and sleep slow oscillations in memory consolidation</title>

Sleep plays an important role in the consolidation of recent memories. However, the cellular and synaptic mechanisms of consolidation during sleep remain poorly understood. In this study, using a realistic computational model of the thalamocortical network, we tested the role of Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep in memory consolidation. We found that sleep spindles (the hallmark of N2 stage sleep) and slow oscillations (the hallmark of N3 stage sleep) both promote replay of the spike sequences learned in the awake state and replay was localized around the trained network locations. Memory performance improved after a period of NREM sleep but not after the same time period in awake. When multiple memories were trained, the local nature of the spike sequence replay during spindles allowed replay of the distinct memory traces independently, while slow oscillations promoted competition that could prevent replay of the weak memories in a presence of the stronger memory traces. This could lead to extinction of the weak memories unless when sleep spindles (N2 sleep) preceded slow oscillations (N3 sleep), as observed during the natural sleep cycle. Our study presents a mechanistic explanation for the role of sleep rhythms in memory consolidation and proposes a testable hypothesis how the natural structure of sleep stages provides an optimal environment to consolidate memories.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jzS-ldh1Muw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Intracellular polarization, where a cell specifies a spatial axis by segregation of specific factors, is a fundamental biological process. In the early embryo of the nematode worm &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)&lt;/i&gt;, polarization is often accompanied by deformations of the cortex, a highly contractile structure consisting of actin filaments cross-linked by the motor protein myosin (actomyosin). It has been suggested that the eggshell surrounding the early embryo plays a role in polarization although its function is not understood. Here we develop a mathematical model which couples a reaction-diffusion model of actomyosin dynamics with a phase field model of the cell cortex to implicitly track cell shape changes in the early &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryo. We investigate the potential rigidity effect of the geometric constraint imposed by the presence and size of the eggshell on polarization dynamics. Our model suggests that the geometric constraint of the eggshell is essential for proper polarization and the size of the eggshell also affects the dynamics of polarization. Therefore, we conclude that geometric constraint on a cell might affect the dynamics of a biochemical processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S0GKlDO6sm0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Neurons process and convey information by transforming barrages of synaptic inputs into spiking activity. Synaptic inhibition typically suppresses the output firing activity of a neuron, and is commonly classified as having a &lt;i&gt;subtractive&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;divisive&lt;/i&gt; effect on a neuron’s output firing activity. Subtractive inhibition can narrow the range of inputs that evoke spiking activity by eliminating responses to non-preferred inputs. Divisive inhibition is a form of gain control: it modifies firing rates while preserving the range of inputs that evoke firing activity. Since these two “modes” of inhibition have distinct impacts on neural coding, it is important to understand the biophysical mechanisms that distinguish these response profiles. In this study, we use simulations and mathematical analysis of a neuron model to find the specific conditions (parameter sets) for which inhibitory inputs have subtractive or divisive effects. Significantly, we identify a novel role for the A-type Potassium current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;). In our model, this fast-activating, slowly-inactivating outward current acts as a switch between subtractive and divisive inhibition. In particular, if &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is strong (large maximal conductance) and fast (activates on a time-scale similar to spike initiation), then inhibition has a subtractive effect on neural firing. In contrast, if &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is weak or insufficiently fast-activating, then inhibition has a divisive effect on neural firing. We explain these findings using dynamical systems methods (plane analysis and fast-slow dissection) to define how a spike threshold condition depends on synaptic inputs and &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Our findings suggest that neurons can “self-regulate” the gain control effects of inhibition via combinations of synaptic plasticity and/or modulation of the conductance and kinetics of A-type Potassium channels. This novel role for &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; would add flexibility to neurons and networks, and may relate to recent observations of divisive inhibitory effects on neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FDIMHtgjtOc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of learning and behavior relies on the use of invasive techniques, which necessitate the use of animal models. However when different species learn the same task, to what degree are they actually producing the same behavior and engaging homologous neural circuitry? This question has received virtually no recent attention, even as the most powerful new methodologies for measuring and perturbing the nervous system have become increasingly dependent on the use of murine species. Here we test Humans, Rats, Monkeys, and an evolutionarily intermediate species, Tree Shrews, on a three alternative, forced choice, visual contrast discrimination task. As anticipated, learning rate, peak performance and transfer across contrasts was lower in the rat compared to the other species. More interestingly, Rats exhibited two major behavioral peculiarities: While Monkeys and Tree Shrews based their choices largely on visual information, Rats tended to base their choices on past reward history. Furthermore, as the task became more difficult, Rats largely disengaged from the visual stimulus, reverting to innate spatial predispositions in order to collect rewards near chance probability. Our findings highlight the limitation of muridae as models for translational research, at least in the area of visually based decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Research into the biology of cognition and behavior increasingly relies on studies performed in murine species (mice and rats). This is due to the explosion of powerful new, murine specific, genetic tools allowing for unprecedented control in imaging and manipulation of neural circuit elements. Lacking, are concomitant comparative behavioral studies necessary toward translating these exciting results to other species, particularly humans. We show here that, unlike primates, muridae incorporate species-specific predispositions and bias into their behavioral strategy toward the solution of a simple visual task, and are therefore engaging specific circuits not used by primates during task performance. This contradicts the long held idea that learning abolishes species-specific predispositions, and highlights the importance of comparative behavioral studies in translational neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Age-dependent Pavlovian biases influence motor decision-making</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiuli Chen, Robb B. Rutledge, Harriet R. Brown, Raymond J. Dolan, Sven Bestmann, Joseph M. Galea&lt;/p&gt;

Motor decision-making is an essential component of everyday life which requires weighing potential rewards and punishments against the probability of successfully executing an action. To achieve this, humans rely on two key mechanisms; a flexible, instrumental, value-dependent process and a hardwired, Pavlovian, value-independent process. In economic decision-making, age-related decline in risk taking is explained by reduced Pavlovian biases that promote action toward reward. Although healthy ageing has also been associated with decreased risk-taking in motor decision-making, it is currently unknown whether this is a result of changes in Pavlovian biases, instrumental processes or a combination of both. Using a newly established approach-avoidance computational model together with a novel app-based motor decision-making task, we measured sensitivity to reward and punishment when participants (n = 26,532) made a ‘go/no-go’ motor gamble based on their perceived ability to execute a complex action. We show that motor decision-making can be better explained by a model with both instrumental and Pavlovian parameters, and reveal age-related changes across punishment- and reward-based instrumental and Pavlovian processes. However, the most striking effect of ageing was a decrease in Pavlovian attraction towards rewards, which was associated with a reduction in optimality of choice behaviour. In a subset of participants who also played an independent economic decision-making task (n = 17,220), we found similar decision-making tendencies for motor and economic domains across a majority of age groups. Pavlovian biases, therefore, play an important role in not only explaining motor decision-making behaviour but also the changes which occur through normal ageing. This provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms which shape motor decision-making across the lifespan.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7I9gI6jfrH8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Temporally ordered multi-neuron patterns likely encode information in the brain. We introduce an unsupervised method, SPOTDisClust (Spike Pattern Optimal Transport Dissimilarity Clustering), for their detection from high-dimensional neural ensembles. SPOTDisClust measures similarity between two ensemble spike patterns by determining the minimum transport cost of transforming their corresponding normalized cross-correlation matrices into each other (SPOTDis). Then, it performs density-based clustering based on the resulting inter-pattern dissimilarity matrix. SPOTDisClust does not require binning and can detect complex patterns (beyond sequential activation) even when high levels of out-of-pattern “noise” spiking are present. Our method handles efficiently the additional information from increasingly large neuronal ensembles and can detect a number of patterns that far exceeds the number of recorded neurons. In an application to neural ensemble data from macaque monkey V1 cortex, SPOTDisClust can identify different moving stimulus directions on the sole basis of temporal spiking patterns.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ve-KmnATpsw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In experimental assays of angiogenesis in three-dimensional fibrin matrices, a temporary scaffold formed during wound healing, the type and composition of fibrin impacts the level of sprouting. More sprouts form on high molecular weight (HMW) than on low molecular weight (LMW) fibrin. It is unclear what mechanisms regulate the number and the positions of the vascular-like structures in cell cultures. To address this question, we propose a mechanistic simulation model of endothelial cell migration and fibrin proteolysis by the plasmin system. The model is a hybrid, cell-based and continuum, computational model based on the cellular Potts model and sets of partial-differential equations. Based on the model results, we propose that a positive feedback mechanism between uPAR, plasmin and transforming growth factor &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1 (TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1) selects cells in the monolayer for matrix invasion. Invading cells releases TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1 from the extracellular matrix through plasmin-mediated fibrin degradation. The activated TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1 further stimulates fibrin degradation and keeps proteolysis active as the sprout invades the fibrin matrix. The binding capacity for TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1 of LMW is reduced relative to that of HMW. This leads to reduced activation of proteolysis and, consequently, reduced cell ingrowth in LMW fibrin compared to HMW fibrin. Thus our model predicts that endothelial cells in LMW fibrin matrices compared to HMW matrices show reduced sprouting due to a lower bio-availability of TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dJeJLhtrNNo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Subgraphs of functional brain networks identify dynamical constraints of cognitive control</title>

Brain anatomy and physiology support the human ability to navigate a complex space of perceptions and actions. To maneuver across an ever-changing landscape of mental states, the brain invokes cognitive control—a set of dynamic processes that engage and disengage different groups of brain regions to modulate attention, switch between tasks, and inhibit prepotent responses. Current theory posits that correlated and anticorrelated brain activity may signify cooperative and competitive interactions between brain areas that subserve adaptive behavior. In this study, we use a quantitative approach to identify distinct topological motifs of functional interactions and examine how their expression relates to cognitive control processes and behavior. In particular, we acquire fMRI BOLD signal in twenty-eight healthy subjects as they perform two cognitive control tasks—a Stroop interference task and a local-global perception switching task using Navon figures—each with low and high cognitive control demand conditions. Based on these data, we construct dynamic functional brain networks and use a parts-based, network decomposition technique called non-negative matrix factorization to identify putative cognitive control subgraphs whose temporal expression captures distributed network structures involved in different phases of cooperative and competitive control processes. Our results demonstrate that temporal expression of the subgraphs fluctuate alongside changes in cognitive demand and are associated with individual differences in task performance. These findings offer insight into how coordinated changes in the cooperative and competitive roles of cognitive systems map trajectories between cognitively demanding brain states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XzG9sFK-qtk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Excitable neuronal assemblies with adaptation as a building block of brain circuits for velocity-controlled signal propagation</title>

The time scale of neuronal network dynamics is determined by synaptic interactions and neuronal signal integration, both of which occur on the time scale of milliseconds. Yet many behaviors like the generation of movements or vocalizations of sounds occur on the much slower time scale of seconds. Here we ask the question of how neuronal networks of the brain can support reliable behavior on this time scale. We argue that excitable neuronal assemblies with spike-frequency adaptation may serve as building blocks that can flexibly adjust the speed of execution of neural circuit function. We show in simulations that a chain of neuronal assemblies can propagate signals reliably, similar to the well-known synfire chain, but with the crucial difference that the propagation speed is slower and tunable to the behaviorally relevant range. Moreover we study a grid of excitable neuronal assemblies as a simplified model of the somatosensory barrel cortex of the mouse and demonstrate that various patterns of experimentally observed spatial activity propagation can be explained.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7s2Bl1Mmz-s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Organization of Neural Population Code in Mouse Visual System</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mammalian visual system consists of several anatomically distinct areas, layers, and cell types. To understand the role of these subpopulations in visual information processing, we analyzed neural signals recorded from excitatory neurons from various anatomical and functional structures. For each of 186 mice, one of six genetically tagged cell-types and one of six visual areas were targeted while the mouse was passively viewing various visual stimuli. We trained linear classifiers to decode one of six visual stimulus categories with distinct spatiotemporal structures from the population neural activity. We found that neurons in both the primary visual cortex and secondary visual areas show varying degrees of stimulus-specific decodability, and neurons in superficial layers tend to be more informative about the stimulus categories. Additional decoding analyses of directional motion were consistent with these findings. We observed synergy in the population code of direction in several visual areas suggesting area-specific organization of information representation across neurons. These differences in decoding capacities shed light on the specialized organization of neural information processing across anatomically distinct subpopulations, and further establish the mouse as a model for understanding visual perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This analysis is one of the first of the Allen Brain Observatory’s visual cortex dataset. The mouse has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to primates and carnivorous species as a model for studying visual perception. Mice offer the benefit of large-scale, high-throughput experiments and sophisticated genetic tools useful to investigating highly specific components of visual perception. Preliminary work in identifying the functional organization of mouse extrastriate areas has focused on single neurons and lacks analysis at the population level. Our population decoding analysis contributes novel evidence about the role of many distinct areas and layers of the mouse visual cortex in visual information processing to further establish the mouse as a viable model for future visual system research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Bidirectional Control of Risk-Seeking Behavior by the Basolateral Amygdala</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Decision-making under risk entails the possibility of simultaneously receiving positive (reward) and negative (punishment) stimuli. To learn in this context, one must integrate conflicting information related to the magnitude of reward and the probability of punishment. Long-term inactivation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) disrupts this process and increases risky behavior. In a recent study published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, Orisini et al., (2017) showed that briefly inhibiting the basolateral amygdala (BLA) may result in increased or decreased risk-taking behavior, depending on the phase of the decision process in which BLA activity is disrupted. Here we discuss the results and propose future experiments that could improve our understanding of how the BLA contributes to adaptive learning under risk and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Targeting the Mouse Ventral Hippocampus in the Intrahippocampal Kainic Acid Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Here we describe a novel mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) that moves the site of kainate injection from the rodent dorsal hippocampus (corresponding to the human posterior hippocampus) to the ventral hippocampus (corresponding to the human anterior hippocampus). We compare the phenotypes of this new model – with respect to seizures, cognitive impairment, affective deficits, and histopathology – to the standard dorsal intrahippocampal kainate model. Our results demonstrate that histopathological measures of granule cell dispersion and mossy fiber sprouting maximize near the site of kainate injection. Somewhat surprisingly, both the dorsal and ventral models exhibit similar spatial memory impairments in addition to similar electrographic and behavioral seizure burdens. In contrast, we find a more pronounced affective (anhedonic) phenotype specifically in the ventral model. These results demonstrate that the ventral intrahippocampal kainic acid model recapitulates critical pathologies of the dorsal model while providing a means to further study affective phenotypes such as depression in TLE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by spontaneous recurring seizures. TLE additionally features cognitive and affective comorbidities that impair quality of life. Animal models studying TLE are critical to advance our understanding of the disorder. A current popular model targets the dorsal hippocampus with a focal injection of kainic acid to induce epilepsy. Evidence suggest targeting the ventral hippocampus may produce a model of TLE with distinct benefits. We present data demonstrating that targeting the mouse ventral hippocampus with kainic acid creates a TLE model with similar seizure and cognitive phenotypes to the standard dorsal model but with additional, pronounced affective features, including anhedonia. These results describe a new tool for epilepsy researchers to better study comorbidities of TLE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: G9a/GLP Complex Acts as a Bidirectional Switch to Regulate Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor-Dependent Plasticity in Hippocampal CA1 Pyramidal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy161</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy161/5049853?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) is conventionally considered to be solely dependent on local protein synthesis. Given the impact of epigenetics on memory, the intriguing question is whether epigenetic regulation influences mGluR-LTD as well. G9a/GLP histone lysine methyltransferase complex is crucial for brain development and goal-directed learning as well as for drug-addiction. In this study, we analyzed whether the epigenetic regulation by G9a/GLP complex affects mGluR-LTD in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons of 5–7 weeks old male Wistar rats. In hippocampal slices with intact CA1 dendritic regions, inhibition of G9a/GLP activity abolished mGluR-LTD. The inhibition of this complex upregulated the expression of plasticity proteins like PKMζ, which mediated the prevention of mGluR-LTD expression by regulating the NSF-GluA2-mediated trafficking of AMPA receptors towards the postsynaptic site. G9a/GLP inhibition during the induction of mGluR-LTD also downregulated the protein levels of phosphorylated-GluA2 and Arc. Interestingly, G9a/GLP inhibition could not impede the mGluR-LTD when the cell-body was severed. Our study highlights the role of G9a/GLP complex in intact neuronal network as a bidirectional switch; when turned on, it facilitates the expression of mGluR-LTD, and when turned off, it promotes the expression of long-term potentiation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cortical Neuron Migration and Dendrite Morphology are Regulated by Carboxypeptidase E</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy155</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy155/5049851?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Higher brain function relies on proper development of the cerebral cortex, including correct positioning of neurons and dendrite morphology. Disruptions in these processes may result in various neurocognitive disorders. Mutations in the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CPE&lt;/span&gt; gene, which encodes carboxypeptidase E (CPE), have been linked to depression and intellectual disability. However, it remains unclear whether CPE is involved in early brain development and in turn contributes to the pathophysiology of neurocognitive disorders. Here, we investigate the effects of CPE knockdown on early brain development and explore the functional significance of the interaction between CPE and its binding partner p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt;. We demonstrate that CPE is required for cortical neuron migration and dendrite arborization. Furthermore, we show that expression of CPE-C10 redistributes p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt; from the centrosome and that disruption of CPE interaction with p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt; leads to abnormal neuronal migration and dendrite morphology, suggesting that a complex between CPE and p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt; is necessary for proper neurodevelopment.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sparse Labeling and Neural Tracing in Brain Circuits by STARS Strategy: Revealing Morphological Development of Type II Spiral Ganglion Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Elucidating axonal and dendritic projection patterns of individual neurons is a key for understanding the cytoarchitecture of neural circuits in the brain. This requires genetic approaches to achieve Golgi-like sparse labeling of desired types of neurons. Here, we explored a novel strategy of stochastic gene activation with regulated sparseness (STARS), in which the stochastic choice between 2 competing Cre-&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;lox&lt;/span&gt; recombination events is controlled by varying the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;lox&lt;/span&gt; efficiency and cassette length. In a created STARS transgenic mouse crossed with various Cre driver lines, sparse neuronal labeling with a relatively uniform level of sparseness was achieved across different brain regions and cell types in both central and peripheral nervous systems. Tracing of individual type II peripheral auditory fibers revealed for the first time that they undergo experience-dependent developmental refinement, which is impaired by attenuating external sound input. Our results suggest that STARS strategy can be applied for circuit mapping and sparse gene manipulation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;When we speak, we get correlated sensory feedback from speech sounds and from the muscles and soft tissues of the vocal tract. Here we dissociate the contributions of auditory and somatosensory feedback to identify brain networks that underlie the somatic contribution to speech motor learning. The technique uses a robotic device that selectively alters somatosensory inputs in combination with resting-state fMRI scans that reveal learning-related changes in functional connectivity. A partial correlation analysis is used to identify connectivity changes that are not explained by the time course of activity in any other learning-related areas. This analysis revealed changes related to behavioral improvements in movement and separately, to changes in auditory perception: Speech motor adaptation itself was associated with connectivity changes that were primarily in non-motor areas of brain, specifically, to a strengthening of connectivity between auditory and somatosensory cortex and between presupplementary motor area and the inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, connectively changes associated with alterations to auditory perception were restricted to speech motor areas, specifically, primary motor cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. Overall, our findings show that during adaptation, somatosensory inputs result in a broad range of changes in connectivity in areas associated with speech motor control and learning.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neuronal Mechanisms Recording the Stream of Consciousness–A Reappraisal of Wilder Penfield’s (1891–1976) Concept of Experiential Phenomena Elicited by Electrical Stimulation of the Human Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Research on memory has been a major focus in the neurosciences over the past decades. An important advance was achieved by Wilder Penfield at the Montreal Neurological Institute, who reported from the 1930s to the 1950s about experiential phenomena induced by electrical brain stimulation in humans, implying neuronal causation of memory. Since then, neuroscientists have addressed the topic of memory from a range of subdisciplines; however, these reports by Penfield and his group as well as those on patient H. M. by Brenda Milner at the same institution continue to be referenced as groundbreaking. Further experimental work by Nobel laureates Eric Kandel and John O’Keefe, as well as by Edvard and May-Britt Moser related Penfield’s patient documentation to experiential phenomena. However, our reassessment of Penfield’s original patient documentation questions the stance that he had uncovered the “storehouse of memories.” Human memory must be regarded more as context sensitive and as representative of an active reconstructive process, than as a simple recording of events. Hence, strategies aiming at naturalizing all phenomena of mind (including memory) to cellular and molecular mechanisms cannot convincingly refer to Penfield’s electrophysiological studies alone as evidence that memories are solely caused by neuronal firing patterns.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Paxillin phosphorylation at serine 273 and its effects on Rac, Rho and adhesion dynamics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Kaixi Tang, Colton G. Boudreau, Claire M. Brown, Anmar Khadra&lt;/p&gt;

Focal adhesions are protein complexes that anchor cells to the extracellular matrix. During migration, the growth and disassembly of these structures are spatiotemporally regulated, with new adhesions forming at the leading edge of the cell and mature adhesions disassembling at the rear. Signalling proteins and structural cytoskeletal components tightly regulate adhesion dynamics. Paxillin, an adaptor protein within adhesions, is one of these proteins. Its phosphorylation at serine 273 (S273) is crucial for maintaining fast adhesion assembly and disassembly. Paxillin is known to bind to a GIT1-βPIX-PAK1 complex, which increases the local activation of the small GTPase Rac. To understand quantitatively the behaviour of this system and how it relates to adhesion assembly/disassembly, we developed a mathematical model describing the dynamics of the small GTPases Rac and Rho as determined by paxillin S273 phosphorylation. Our model revealed that the system possesses bistability, where switching between uninduced (active Rho) and induced (active Rac) states can occur through a change in rate of paxillin phosphorylation or PAK1 activation. The bistable switch is characterized by the presence of memory, minimal change in the levels of active Rac and Rho within the induced and uninduced states, respectively, and the limited regime of monostability associated with the uninduced state. These results were validated experimentally by showing the presence of bimodality in adhesion assembly and disassembly rates, and demonstrating that Rac activity increases after treating Chinese Hamster Ovary cells with okadaic acid (a paxillin phosphatase inhibitor), followed by a modest recovery after 20 min washout. Spatial gradients of phosphorylated paxillin in a reaction-diffusion model gave rise to distinct regions of Rac and Rho activities, resembling polarization of a cell into front and rear. Perturbing several parameters of the model also revealed important insights into how signalling components upstream and downstream of paxillin phosphorylation affect dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4Bo3nqD1NCA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression (ME-models) explicitly compute the optimal proteome composition of a growing cell. ME-models expand upon the well-established genome-scale models of metabolism (M-models), and they enable a new fundamental understanding of cellular growth. ME-models have increased predictive capabilities and accuracy due to their inclusion of the biosynthetic costs for the machinery of life, but they come with a significant increase in model size and complexity. This challenge results in models which are both difficult to compute and challenging to understand conceptually. As a result, ME-models exist for only two organisms (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Thermotoga maritima&lt;/i&gt;) and are still used by relatively few researchers. To address these challenges, we have developed a new software framework called COBRAme for building and simulating ME-models. It is coded in Python and built on COBRApy, a popular platform for using M-models. COBRAme streamlines computation and analysis of ME-models. It provides tools to simplify constructing and editing ME-models to enable ME-model reconstructions for new organisms. We used COBRAme to reconstruct a condensed &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; ME-model called &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;JL1678b-ME. This reformulated model gives functionally identical solutions to previous &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; ME-models while using 1/6 the number of free variables and solving in less than 10 minutes, a marked improvement over the 6 hour solve time of previous ME-model formulations. Errors in previous ME-models were also corrected leading to 52 additional genes that must be expressed in &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;JL1678b-ME to grow aerobically in glucose minimal &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; media. This manuscript outlines the architecture of COBRAme and demonstrates how ME-models can be created, modified, and shared most efficiently using the new software framework.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cjOqyaA5KvQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Perceiving an external stimulus depends not only on the physical features of the stimulus, but also fundamentally on the current state of neuronal excitability, indexed by the power of ongoing alpha-band and beta-band oscillations (8–30 Hz). Recent studies suggest that heightened excitability does not improve perceptual precision, but biases observers to report the presence of a stimulus regardless of its physical presence. It is unknown whether this bias is due to changes in observers’ subjective perceptual experience (perceptual bias) or their perception-independent decision-making strategy (decision bias). We tested these alternative interpretations in an EEG experiment in which male and female human participants performed two-interval forced choice (2IFC) detection and discrimination. According to signal detection theory, perceptual bias only affects 2IFC detection, but not discrimination, while interval decision bias should be task independent. We found that correct detection was more likely when excitability before the stimulus-present interval exceeded that before the stimulus-absent interval (i.e., 8–17 Hz power was weaker before the stimulus-present interval), consistent with an effect of excitability on perceptual bias. By contrast, discrimination accuracy was unaffected by excitability fluctuations between intervals, ruling out an effect on interval decision bias. We conclude that the current state of neuronal excitability biases the perceptual experience itself, rather than the decision process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Loss of Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity in a KCl-Induced Model of Episodic Headache Enhances CNS Drug Delivery</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (CSD) in the CNS is suggested as a common mechanism contributing to headache. Despite strong evidence for CNS involvement in headache disorders, drug development for headache disorders remains focused on peripheral targets. Difficulty in delivering drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may partially account for this disparity. It is known, however, that BBB permeability is increased during several CNS pathologies. In this study, we investigated BBB changes in response to KCl-induced CSD events and subsequent allodynia in rats. Cortical KCl injection in awake, freely moving rats produced facial allodynia with peak intensity between 1.5 and 3 hours and CSD induction within 0.5 to 2 hours post-injection. Brain perfusion of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-sucrose as a marker of BBB paracellular permeability revealed increased leak in the cortex, but not brainstem, beginning 0.5 hours post-KCl injection and resolving within 6 hours; no changes in tight junction (TJ) proteins occludin or claudin-5 expression were observed. Acute pre-treatment with topiramate to inhibit CSD did not prevent the increased BBB paracellular permeability. CNS delivery of the abortive anti-migraine agent sumatriptan was increased in the cortex 1.5 hours post-KCl injection. Surprisingly, sumatriptan uptake was also increased in the brainstem following CSD induction, suggesting regulation of active transport mechanisms at the BBB. Together these results demonstrate the ability of CSD events to produce transient, time-dependent changes in BBB permeability when allodynia is present and to mediate access of clinically relevant therapeutics (i.e., sumatriptan) to the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The need to overcome the BBB is one of the major hurdles in designing CNS active drugs. CNS mechanisms have been shown to play a vital role in primary and secondary headache disorders. In this study we show that BBB permeability is transiently increased in a rat model of CSD induced episodic headache. We also observed a significant increase in sumatriptan uptake into the brain. Clinically, sumatriptan has been shown to be most efficacious when given close to the onset of headache pain, corresponding to times where we observed increased CNS uptake in our rat model. These data suggest that altered BBB permeability occurs during CSD and may be taken advantage of during therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Congenital hydrocephalus (CH) is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, affecting 1 in 1,000 live births and representing up to 3% of all pediatric hospital charges. Using data from the largest CH exome sequencing study to date, Furey et al. identify four genes (TRIM71, SMARCC1, PTCH1, and SHH) not previously implicated in CH. Remarkably, all four genes regulate ventricular zone neural stem cell fate and, together, explain ∼10% of CH cases. These findings implicate impaired neurogenesis in pathogenesis of a significant number of CH patients, with potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic ramifications.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Oscillatory Encoding of Visual Stimulus Familiarity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6223?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6223?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Familiarity of the environment changes the way we perceive and encode incoming information. However, the neural substrates underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. Here we describe a new form of experience-dependent low-frequency oscillations in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake adult male mice. The oscillations emerged in visually evoked potentials and single-unit activity following repeated visual stimulation. The oscillations were sensitive to the spatial frequency content of a visual stimulus and required the mAChRs for their induction and expression. Finally, ongoing visually evoked  (4–8 Hz) oscillations boost the visually evoked potential amplitude of incoming visual stimuli if the stimuli are presented at the high excitability phase of the oscillations. Our results demonstrate that an oscillatory code can be used to encode familiarity and serves as a gate for oncoming sensory inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Previous experience can influence the processing of incoming sensory information by the brain and alter perception. However, the mechanistic understanding of how this process takes place is lacking. We have discovered that persistent low-frequency oscillations in the primary visual cortex encode information about familiarity and the spatial frequency of the stimulus. These familiarity evoked oscillations influence neuronal responses to the oncoming stimuli in a way that depends on the oscillation phase. Our work demonstrates a new mechanism of visual stimulus feature detection and learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Alcohol Consumption during Adolescence in a Mouse Model of Binge Drinking Alters the Intrinsic Excitability and Function of the Prefrontal Cortex through a Reduction in the Hyperpolarization-Activated Cation Current</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6207?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6207?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Periodic episodes of excessive alcohol consumption (&quot;binge drinking&quot;) occur frequently among adolescents, and early binge drinking is associated with an increased risk of alcohol use disorders later in life. The PFC undergoes significant development during adolescence and hence may be especially susceptible to the effects of binge drinking. In humans and in animal models, adolescent alcohol exposure is known to alter PFC neuronal activity and produce deficits in PFC-dependent behaviors, such as decision making, response inhibition, and working memory. Using a voluntary intermittent access to alcohol (IA EtOH) procedure in male mice, we demonstrate that binge-level alcohol consumption during adolescence leads to altered drinking patterns and working memory deficits in young adulthood, two outcomes that suggest medial PFC dysfunction. We recorded from pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the prelimbic subregion of the medial PFC in slices obtained from mice that had IA EtOH and found that they display altered excitability, including a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and reductions in the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) and in intrinsic persistent activity (a mode of neuronal firing that is dependent on I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;). Many of these effects on intrinsic excitability were sustained following abstinence and observed in mice that showed working memory deficits. In addition, we found that resting membrane potential and the I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent voltage &quot;sag&quot; in prelimbic PFC PNs are developmentally regulated during adolescence, suggesting that adolescent alcohol exposure may compromise PFC function by arresting the normal developmental trajectory of PN intrinsic excitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Binge alcohol drinking during adolescence has negative consequences for the function of the developing PFC. Using a mouse model of voluntary binge drinking during adolescence, we found that this behavior leads to working memory deficits and altered drinking behavior in adulthood. In addition, we found that adolescent drinking is associated with specific changes to the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons in the PFC, reducing the ability of these neurons to generate intrinsic persistent activity, a phenomenon thought to be important for working memory. These findings may help explain why human adolescent binge drinkers show performance deficits on tasks mediated by the PFC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Classification of Neurons in the Primate Reticular Formation and Changes after Recovery from Pyramidal Tract Lesion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6190?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/27/6190?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The reticular formation is important in primate motor control, both in health and during recovery after brain damage. Little is known about the different neurons present in the reticular nuclei. Here we recorded extracellular spikes from the reticular formation in five healthy female awake behaving monkeys (193 cells), and in two female monkeys 1 year after recovery from a unilateral pyramidal tract lesion (125 cells). Analysis of spike shape and four measures derived from the interspike interval distribution identified four clusters of neurons in control animals. Cluster 1 cells had a slow firing rate. Cluster 2 cells had narrow spikes and irregular firing, which often included high-frequency bursts. Cluster 3 cells were highly rhythmic and fast firing. Cluster 4 cells showed negative spikes. A separate population of 42 cells was antidromically identified as reticulospinal neurons in five anesthetized female monkeys. The distribution of spike width in these cells closely overlaid the distribution for cluster 2, leading us tentatively to suggest that cluster 2 included neurons with reticulospinal projections. In animals after corticospinal lesion, cells could be identified in all four clusters. The firing rate of cells in clusters 1 and 2 was increased in lesioned animals relative to control animals (by 52% and 60%, respectively); cells in cluster 2 were also more regular and more bursting in the lesioned animals. We suggest that changes in both membrane properties and local circuits within the reticular formation occur following lesioning, potentially increasing reticulospinal output to help compensate for lost corticospinal descending drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work is the first to subclassify neurons in the reticular formation, providing insights into the local circuitry of this important but little understood structure. The approach developed can be applied to any extracellular recording from this region, allowing future studies to place their data within our current framework of four neural types. Changes in reticular neurons may be important to subserve functional recovery after damage in human patients, such as after stroke or spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Post-Turing tissue pattern formation: Advent of mechanochemistry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006259</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Felix Brinkmann, Moritz Mercker, Thomas Richter, Anna Marciniak-Czochra&lt;/p&gt;

Chemical and mechanical pattern formation is fundamental during embryogenesis and tissue development. Yet, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are still elusive in many cases. Most current theories assume that tissue development is driven by chemical processes: either as a sequence of chemical patterns each depending on the previous one, or by patterns spontaneously arising from specific chemical interactions (such as “Turing-patterns”). Within both theories, mechanical patterns are usually regarded as passive by-products of chemical pre-patters. However, several experiments question these theories, and an increasing number of studies shows that tissue mechanics can actively influence chemical patterns during development. In this study, we thus focus on the interplay between chemical and mechanical processes during tissue development. On one hand, based on recent experimental data, we develop new mechanochemical simulation models of evolving tissues, in which the full 3D representation of the tissue appears to be critical for obtaining a realistic mechanochemical behaviour. The presented modelling approach is flexible and numerically studied using state of the art finite element methods. Thus, it may serve as a basis to combine simulations with new experimental methods in tissue development. On the other hand, we apply the developed approach and demonstrate that even simple interactions between tissue mechanics and chemistry spontaneously lead to robust and complex mechanochemical patterns. Especially, we demonstrate that the main contradictions arising in the framework of purely chemical theories are naturally and automatically resolved using the mechanochemical patterning theory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TU2UMRsefhw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>A key component of current theories of brain structure and function is the layer-specific origin of structural connections of the cerebral cortex. This fundamental connectional feature pertains to different mammalian cortices, and recent neuroimaging advancements have started to pave the way for its function-based mapping in humans. Here, we propose a framework that systematically explains the characteristic layer-specific origin of structural connections and its graded variation across the cortical sheet and across mammalian species.</description>

	<description>How can blood rapidly and precisely reach active neurons at a given time and location has remained enigmatic for a long time. A 2003 paper by Zonta et al. suggested key roles for astrocytes in the signaling between neurons and blood vessels. While a consensus on the specific intermediary roles of astrocytes in this process is still evolving, research in the past 15 years has led to a deeper and more refined understanding of the neuro-glio-vascular unit.</description>

	<description>In 1983 Libet et al. demonstrated that brain activity associated with a voluntary act precedes conscious experience of the intention to act by several hundred milliseconds. The implication that it is the brain, rather than ‘free will’, that initiates voluntary acts has been discussed ever since by philosophers and lawyers, as well as by scientists. We show here how Libet’s original study gave rise to an entire research field of experimental investigations of volition.</description>

	<description>The past decade has yielded substantial evidence that the gut microbiome modulates brain function, including for instance behaviors relevant to anxiety and depression, pointing to a need to identify the biological pathways involved. In 2013 Clarke and colleagues reported that the early-life microbiome regulates the hippocampal serotonergic system in a sex-dependent manner, findings that opened up numerous lines of inquiry on the effects of the microbiome on neurodevelopment and behavior.</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;By using AT8-immunocytochemistry that visualizes hyperphosphorylated tau protein, we examined neurofibrillary changes related to sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 40 individuals at neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stages I–IV. We report the presence of abnormal tau changes within solitary pyramidal neurons in layers III and V of the neocortex. These pyramidal cells showed pathology in different cell compartments (dendritic, somatic, axonal) that appeared to occur sequentially: Tau pathology was seen in distal segments of the basal dendrites, then in proximal dendrites, the soma, and, finally, in the axon of affected neurons. These findings are remarkable in that they point to the existence of neurofibrillary changes in regions routinely associated with later NFT stages. In addition, they lend support to the idea that it may be the axons of cortico-cortical top-down neurons in neocortical fields involved in AD that carry and spread abnormal tau seeds in a focused manner (transsynaptically) into the distal dendritic segments of nerve cells following directly in the neuronal chain, thereby sustaining further tau-seeded templating.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Parvalbumin Interneurons Shape Neuronal Vulnerability in Blunt TBI</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Excessive excitation has been hypothesized to subsume a significant part of the acute damage occurring after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, reduced neuronal excitability, loss of neuronal firing, and a disturbed excitation/inhibition balance have been detected. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are major regulators of perisomatic inhibition, principal neurons firing, and overall cortical excitability. However, their role in acute TBI pathogenic cascades is unclear. We exploited the chemogenetic Pharmacologically Selective Activation Module and Pharmacologically Selective Effector Module control of PV-Cre&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and the Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD) control of principal neurons in a blunt model of TBI to explore the role of inhibition in shaping neuronal vulnerability to TBI. We demonstrated that inactivation of PV interneurons at the instance or soon after trauma enhances survival of principal neurons and reduces gliosis at 7 dpi whereas, activation of PV interneurons decreased neuronal survival. The protective effect of PV inactivation was suppressed by expressing the nuclear calcium buffer PV-nuclear localisation sequence in principal neurons, implying an activity-dependent neuroprotective signal. In fact, protective effects were obtained by increasing the excitability of principal neurons directly using DREADDs. Thus, we show that sustaining neuronal excitation in the early phases of TBI may reduce neuronal vulnerability by increasing activity-dependent survival, while excess activation of perisomatic inhibition is detrimental to neuronal integrity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: An Autonomic Network: Synchrony Between Slow Rhythms of Pulse and Brain Resting State Is Associated with Personality and Emotions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy144</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The sympathetic system’s role in modulating vasculature and its influence on emotions and personality led us to test the hypothesis that interactions between brain resting-state networks (RSNs) and pulse amplitude (indexing sympathetic activity) would be associated with emotions and personality. In 203 participants, we characterized RSN spatiotemporal characteristics, and phase–amplitude associations of RSN fluctuations with pulse and respiratory recordings. We found that RSNs are spatially reproducible within participants and were temporally associated with low frequencies (LFs &amp;lt; 0.1 Hz) in physiological signals. LF fluctuations in pulse amplitude were not related to cardiac electrical activity and preceded LF fluctuations in RSNs, while LF respiratory amplitude fluctuations followed LF fluctuations in RSNs. LF phase dispersion (PD) (lack of synchrony) between RSNs and pulse (PD&lt;sub&gt;pulse&lt;/sub&gt;) (not respiratory) correlated with the common variability in measures of personality and emotions, with more synchrony being associated with more positive temperamental characteristics. Voxel-level PD&lt;sub&gt;pulse&lt;/sub&gt; mapping revealed an “autonomic brain network,” including sensory cortices and dorsal attention stream, with significant interactions with peripheral signals. Here, we uncover associations between pulse signal amplitude (presumably of sympathetic origin) and brain resting state, suggesting that interactions between central and autonomic nervous systems are important for characterizing personality and emotions.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>A reductively mechanistic approach to neuroscience suggests that low-level physical laws determine our actions and that mental states are epiphenomena. In this scheme there seems to be little room for free will or genuine agency. I argue here that physical indeterminacy provides room for the information entailed in patterns of neuronal firing – the mental content of beliefs, goals, and intentions – to have real causal power in decision-making.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dorsal tegmental dopamine neurons gate associative learning of fear&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dorsal tegmental dopamine neurons gate associative learning of fear, Published online: 27 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0174-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0174-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Unpredicted aversive experiences activate DA neurons in dorsal tegmentum; these neurons are important for fear learning. This prediction-error circuit module linking amygdala and dorsal tegmentum enables a solution to an associative learning problem.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/CA4XBO9Ov1I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The authors show an enrichment of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications of these mRNA at the synapse and link m6A recognition by molecular readers to synaptic function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/XHcUlsOYCDc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>
