	<description>Publication date: February 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Zilong   Qiu&lt;br /&gt;  MECP2 is a critical gene for neural development, mutations or duplication of which led to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: February 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Aaron   Katzman, Cristina M   Alberini&lt;br /&gt; The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for memory formation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Clinical and animal model studies have shown that changes in PFC excitation and inhibition are important for cognitive functions as well as related disorders. Here, we discuss recent findings revealing the roles of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) and NLGN2 in the PFC in memory formation and modulation of memory strength. We propose that shifts in NLGN1 and NLGN2 expression in specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations in response to experience regulate the dynamic processes of memory consolidation and strengthening. Because excitatory/inhibitory imbalances accompany neuropsychiatric disorders in which strength and flexibility of representations play important roles, understanding these mechanisms may suggest novel therapies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber&lt;br /&gt; Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The morphological and molecular heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes and their progenitors point to functions beyond establishing saltatory nerve conduction. Here, we review the diversity in the oligodendroglial lineage as well as the classical and new functions identified for oligodendrocytes and their progenitors. Because oligodendroglia remain highly responsive to environmental changes, they likely contribute to various neurological and psychiatric diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Recent work suggests that they play a key role in regulating brain energy supply by increasing blood flow to regions where neurons are active, and setting the baseline level of blood flow. Controversy persists over whether lactate derived from astrocyte glycolysis is used to power oxidative phosphorylation in neurons, but astrocytes sustain neuronal ATP production by recycling neurotransmitter glutamate that would otherwise need to be resynthesised from glucose, and by providing a short-term energy store in the form of glycogen that can be mobilised when neurons are active. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

To achieve these precise shapes, glia and neurons exhibit coordinated morphological changes on the time scale of minutes and on size scales ranging from nanometers to hundreds of microns. Here, we review recent studies that reveal the highly dynamic, localized morphological changes of mammalian neuron–glia contacts. We then explore the power of Drosophila and C. elegans models to study coordinated changes at defined neuron–glia contacts, highlighting the use of innovative genetic and imaging tools to uncover the molecular mechanisms responsible for coordinated morphogenesis of neurons and glia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Derived from the yolk sac during development, microglia self-renew, self-regulate their numbers during homeostatic conditions, and show a robust proliferative capacity even in adulthood. Together with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), microglia coordinate the regeneration of CNS myelin around axons, termed remyelination. Gene expression analyses and experimental modelling have identified pro-remyelination roles for microglia/MDM in clearance of myelin debris, secretion of growth factors, and remodelling of the extracellular matrix. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms controlling these regenerative functions will reveal novel therapeutic strategies to enhance remyelination, by harnessing the beneficial effects of the innate immune response to injury. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Understanding the mechanisms underlying neuronal structural changes is central to our knowledge of how the nervous system is shaped for complex behaviors and how it further adapts to developmental and environmental demands. Caenorhabditis elegans provides a powerful model for examining developmental processes and for discovering mechanisms controlling neural plasticity.

We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: FNS: an event-driven spiking neural network framework for efficient simulations of large-scale brain models. (arXiv:1801.00864v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Limitations in processing capabilities and memory of today's computers make
spiking neuron-based (human) whole-brain simulations inevitably characterized
by a compromise between bio-plausibility and computational cost. It translates
into brain models composed of a reduced number of neurons and a simplified
neuron's mathematical model. Taking advantage of the sparse character of
brain-like computation, eventdriven technique allows us to carry out efficient
simulation of large-scale Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). The recent Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire with Latency (LIFL) spiking neuron model is event-driven
compatible and exhibits some realistic neuronal features, opening new horizons
in whole-brain modelling. In this paper we present FNS, a LIFL-based exact
event-driven spiking neural network framework implemented in Java and oriented
to wholebrain simulations. FNS combines spiking/synaptic whole-brain modelling
with the event-driven approach, allowing us to define heterogeneous modules and
multi-scale connectivity with delayed connections and plastic synapses,
providing fast simulations at the same time. A novel parallelization strategy
is also implemented in order to further speed up simulations. This paper
presents mathematical models, software implementation and simulation routines
on which FNS is based. Finally, a reduced brain network model (1400 neurons and
45000 synapses) is synthesized on the basis of real brain structural data, and
the resulting model activity is compared with associated brain functional
(source-space MEG) data. The conducted test shows a good matching between the
activity of model and that of the emulated subject, in outstanding simulation
times (about 20s for simulating 4s of activity with a normal PC). Dedicated
sections of stimuli editing and output synthesis allow the neuroscientist to
introduce and extract brain-like signals, respectively...

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Coordinated Plasticity of Synapses and Astrocytes Underlies Practice-Driven Functional Vicariation in Peri-Infarct Motor Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motor rehabilitative training after stroke can improve motor function and promote topographical reorganization of remaining motor cortical movement representations, but this reorganization follows behavioral improvements. A more detailed understanding of the neural bases of rehabilitation efficacy is needed to inform therapeutic efforts to improve it. Using a rat model of upper extremity impairments after ischemic stroke, we examined effects of motor rehabilitative training at the ultrastructural level in peri-infarct motor cortex. Extensive training in a skilled reaching task promoted improved performance and recovery of more normal movements. This was linked with greater axodendritic synapse density and ultrastructural characteristics of enhanced synaptic efficacy that were coordinated with changes in perisynaptic astrocytic processes in the border region between head and forelimb areas of peri-infarct motor cortex. Disrupting synapses and motor maps by infusions of anisomycin (ANI) into anatomically reorganized motor, but not posterior parietal, cortex eliminated behavioral gains from rehabilitative training. In contrast, ANI infusion in the equivalent cortical region of intact animals had no effect on reaching skills. These results suggest that rehabilitative training efficacy for improving manual skills is mediated by synaptic plasticity in a region of motor cortex that, before lesions, is not essential for manual skills, but becomes so as a result of the training. These findings support that experience-driven synaptic structural reorganization underlies functional vicariation in residual motor cortex after motor cortical infarcts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability. Motor rehabilitation, the main treatment for physical disability, is of variable efficacy. A better understanding of neural mechanisms underlying effective motor rehabilitation would inform strategies for improving it. Here, we reveal synaptic underpinnings of effective motor rehabilitation. Rehabilitative training improved manual skill in the paretic forelimb and induced the formation of special synapse subtypes in coordination with structural changes in astrocytes, a glial cell that influences neural communication. These changes were found in a region that is nonessential for manual skill in intact animals, but came to mediate this skill due to training after stroke. Therefore, motor rehabilitation efficacy depends on synaptic changes that enable remaining brain regions to assume new functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Locus Coeruleus Ablation Exacerbates Cognitive Deficits, Neuropathology, and Lethality in P301S Tau Transgenic Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/74?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brainstem locus coeruleus (LC) supplies norepinephrine to the forebrain and degenerates in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Loss of LC neurons is correlated with increased severity of other AD hallmarks, including β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques, tau neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive deficits, suggesting that it contributes to the disease progression. Lesions of the LC in amyloid-based transgenic mouse models of AD exacerbate Aβ pathology, neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits, but it is unknown how the loss of LC neurons affects tau-mediated pathology or behavioral abnormalities. Here we investigate the impact of LC degeneration in a mouse model of tauopathy by lesioning the LC of male and female P301S tau transgenic mice with the neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)&lt;i&gt;-N-&lt;/i&gt;ethyl-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) starting at 2 months of age. By 6 months, deficits in hippocampal-dependent spatial (Morris water maze) and associative (contextual fear conditioning) memory were observed in lesioned P301S mice while performance remained intact in all other genotype and treatment groups, indicating that tau and LC degeneration act synergistically to impair cognition. By 10 months, the hippocampal neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration typically observed in unlesioned P301S mice were exacerbated by DSP-4, and mortality was also accelerated. These DSP-4-induced changes were accompanied by only a mild aggravation of tau pathology, suggesting that increased tau burden cannot fully account for the effects of LC degeneration. Combined, these experiments demonstrate that loss of LC noradrenergic neurons exacerbates multiple phenotypes caused by pathogenic tau, and provides complementary data to highlight the dual role LC degeneration has on both tau and Aβ pathologies in AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Elucidating the mechanisms underlying AD is crucial to developing effective diagnostics and therapeutics. The degeneration of the LC and loss of noradrenergic transmission have been recognized as ubiquitous events in AD pathology, and previous studies demonstrated that LC lesions exacerbate pathology and cognitive deficits in amyloid-based mouse models. Here, we reveal a complementary role of LC degeneration on tau-mediated aspects of the disease by using selective lesions of the LC and the noradrenergic system to demonstrate an exacerbation of cognitive deficits, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy. Our data support an integral role for the LC in modulating the severity of both canonical AD-associated pathologies, as well as the detrimental consequences of LC degeneration during disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Are Cocaine-Seeking &quot;Habits&quot; Necessary for the Development of Addiction-Like Behavior in Rats?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/60?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/60?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Drug self-administration models of addiction typically require animals to make the same response (e.g., a lever-press or nose-poke) over and over to procure and take drugs. By their design, such procedures often produce behavior controlled by stimulus–response (S-R) habits. This has supported the notion of addiction as a &quot;drug habit,&quot; and has led to considerable advances in our understanding of the neurobiological basis of such behavior. However, to procure such drugs as cocaine, addicts often require considerable ingenuity and flexibility in seeking behavior, which, by definition, precludes the development of habits. To better model drug-seeking behavior in addicts, we first developed a novel cocaine self-administration procedure [puzzle self-administration procedure (PSAP)] that required rats to solve a new puzzle every day to gain access to cocaine, which they then self-administered on an intermittent access (IntA) schedule. Such daily problem-solving precluded the development of S-R seeking habits. We then asked whether prolonged PSAP/IntA experience would nevertheless produce &quot;symptoms of addiction.&quot; It did, including escalation of intake, sensitized motivation for drug, continued drug use in the face of adverse consequences, and very robust cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking, especially in a subset of &quot;addiction-prone&quot; rats. Furthermore, drug-seeking behavior continued to require dopamine neurotransmission in the core of the nucleus accumbens (but not the dorsolateral striatum). We conclude that the development of S-R seeking habits is not necessary for the development of cocaine addiction-like behavior in rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Substance-use disorders are often characterized as &quot;habitual&quot; behaviors aimed at obtaining and administering drugs. Although the actions involved in consuming drugs may involve a rigid repertoire of habitual behaviors, evidence suggests that addicts must be very creative and flexible when trying to procure drugs, and thus drug seeking cannot be governed by habit alone. We modeled flexible drug-seeking behavior in rats by requiring animals to solve daily puzzles to gain access to cocaine. We find that habitual drug-seeking isn't necessary for the development of addiction-like behavior, and that our procedure doesn't result in transfer of dopaminergic control from the ventral to dorsal striatum. This approach may prove useful in studying changes in neuropsychological function that promote the transition to addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Opposite Effects of Basolateral Amygdala Inactivation on Context-Induced Relapse to Cocaine Seeking after Extinction versus Punishment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/51?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/51?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Studies using the renewal procedure showed that basolateral amygdala (BLA) inactivation inhibits context-induced relapse to cocaine-seeking after extinction. Here, we determined whether BLA inactivation would also inhibit context-induced relapse after drug-reinforced responding is suppressed by punishment, an animal model of human relapse after self-imposed abstinence due to adverse consequences of drug use. We also determined the effect of central amygdala (CeA) inactivation on context-induced relapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We trained rats to self-administer cocaine for 12 d (6 h/d) in Context A and then exposed them to either extinction or punishment training for 8 d in Context B. During punishment, 50% of cocaine-reinforced lever-presses produced an aversive footshock of increasing intensity (0.1–0.5 or 0.7 mA). We then tested the rats for relapse to cocaine seeking in the absence of cocaine or shock in Contexts A and B after BLA or CeA injections of vehicle or GABA agonists (muscimol-baclofen). We then retrained the rats for cocaine self-administration in Context A, repunished or re-extinguished lever pressing in Context B, and retested for relapse after BLA or CeA inactivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BLA or CeA inactivation &lt;i&gt;decreased&lt;/i&gt; context-induced relapse in Context A after extinction in Context B. BLA, but not CeA, inactivation &lt;i&gt;increased&lt;/i&gt; context-induced relapse in Context A after punishment in Context B. BLA or CeA inactivation provoked relapse in Context B after punishment but not extinction. Results demonstrate that amygdala's role in relapse depends on the method used to achieve abstinence and highlights the importance of studying relapse under abstinence conditions that more closely mimic the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Relapse to drug use during abstinence is often provoked by re-exposure to the drug self-administration environment or context. Studies using the established extinction-reinstatement rodent model of drug relapse have shown that inactivation of the basolateral amygdala inhibits context-induced drug relapse after extinction of the drug-reinforced responding. Here, we determined whether basolateral amygdala inactivation would also inhibit relapse after drug-reinforced responding is suppressed by punishment, a model of human relapse after self-imposed abstinence. Unexpectedly, we found that basolateral amygdala inactivation had opposite effects on relapse provoked by re-exposure to the drug self-administration environment after extinction versus punishment. Our results demonstrate that depending on the historical conditions that lead to abstinence, amygdala activity can either promote or inhibit relapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Circular RNA DLGAP4 Ameliorates Ischemic Stroke Outcomes by Targeting miR-143 to Regulate Endothelial-Mesenchymal Transition Associated with Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/32?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly expressed in the CNS and regulate physiological and pathophysiological processes. However, the potential role of circRNAs in stroke remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the circRNA DLGAP4 (circDLGAP4) functions as an endogenous microRNA-143 (miR-143) sponge to inhibit miR-143 activity, resulting in the inhibition of homologous to the E6-AP C-terminal domain E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 expression. circDLGAP4 levels were significantly decreased in the plasma of acute ischemic stroke patients (13 females and 13 males) and in a mouse stroke model. Upregulation of circDLGAP4 expression significantly attenuated neurological deficits and decreased infarct areas and blood–brain barrier damage in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse stroke model. Endothelial-mesenchymal transition contributes to blood–brain barrier disruption and circDLGAP4 overexpression significantly inhibited endothelial-mesenchymal transition by regulating tight junction protein and mesenchymal cell marker expression. Together, the results of our study are illustrative of the involvement of circDLGAP4 and its coupling mechanism in cerebral ischemia, providing translational evidence that circDLGAP4 serves as a novel therapeutic target for acute cerebrovascular protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in the regulation of physiological and pathophysiological processes. However, whether circRNAs are involved in ischemic injury, particularly cerebrovascular disorders, remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate a critical role for circular RNA DLGAP4 (circDLGAP4), a novel circular RNA originally identified as a sponge for microRNA-143 (miR-143), in ischemic stroke outcomes. Overexpression of circDLGAP4 significantly attenuated neurological deficits and decreased infarct areas and blood–brain barrier damage in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse stroke model. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the efficacy of circRNA injection in an ischemic stroke model. Our investigation suggests that circDLGAP4 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for acute ischemic injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multiple Lines of Evidence Indicate That Gliotransmission Does Not Occur under Physiological Conditions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A major controversy persists within the field of glial biology concerning whether or not, under physiological conditions, neuronal activity leads to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent release of neurotransmitters from astrocytes, a phenomenon known as gliotransmission. Our perspective is that, while we and others can apply techniques to cause gliotransmission, there is considerable evidence gathered using astrocyte-specific and more physiological approaches which suggests that gliotransmission is a pharmacological phenomenon rather than a physiological process. Approaches providing evidence against gliotransmission include stimulation of Gq-GPCRs expressed only in astrocytes, as well as removal of the primary proposed source of astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responsible for gliotransmission. These approaches contrast with those supportive of gliotransmission, which include mechanical stimulation, strong astrocytic depolarization using whole-cell patch-clamp or optogenetics, uncaging Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or IP3, chelating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; using BAPTA, and nonspecific bath application of agonists to receptors expressed by a multitude of cell types. These techniques are not subtle and therefore are not supportive of recent suggestions that gliotransmission requires very specific and delicate temporal and spatial requirements. Other evidence, including lack of propagating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; waves between astrocytes in healthy tissue, lack of expression of vesicular release machinery, and the demise of the d-serine gliotransmission hypothesis, provides additional evidence against gliotransmission. Overall, the data suggest that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent release of neurotransmitters is the province of neurons, not astrocytes, in the intact brain under physiological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Functional Organization and Dynamic Activity in the Superior Colliculus of the Echolocating Bat, Eptesicus fuscus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory-guided behaviors require the transformation of sensory information into task-specific motor commands. Prior research on sensorimotor integration has emphasized visuomotor processes in the context of simplified orienting movements in controlled laboratory tasks rather than an animal's more complete, natural behavioral repertoire. Here, we conducted a series of neural recording experiments in the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) of echolocating bats engaged in a sonar target-tracking task that invoked dynamic active sensing behaviors. We hypothesized that SC activity in freely behaving animals would reveal dynamic shifts in neural firing patterns within and across sensory, sensorimotor, and premotor layers. We recorded neural activity in the SC of freely echolocating bats (three females and one male) and replicated the general trends reported in other species with sensory responses in the dorsal divisions and premotor activity in ventral divisions of the SC. However, within this coarse functional organization, we discovered that sensory and motor neurons are comingled within layers throughout the volume of the bat SC. In addition, as the bat increased pulse rate adaptively to increase resolution of the target location with closing distance, the activity of sensory and vocal premotor neurons changed such that auditory response times decreased, and vocal premotor lead times shortened. This finding demonstrates that SC activity can be modified dynamically in concert with adaptive behaviors and suggests that an integrated functional organization within SC laminae supports rapid and local integration of sensory and motor signals for natural, adaptive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Natural sensory-guided behaviors involve the rapid integration of information from the environment to direct flexible motor actions. The vast majority of research on sensorimotor integration has used artificial stimuli and simplified behaviors, leaving open questions about nervous system function in the context of natural tasks. Our work investigated mechanisms of dynamic sensorimotor feedback control by analyzing patterns of neural activity in the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) of an echolocating bat tracking and intercepting moving prey. Recordings revealed that sensory and motor neurons comingle within laminae of the SC to support rapid sensorimotor integration. Further, we discovered that neural activity in the bat SC changes with dynamic adaptations in the animal's echolocation behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: CaMKII{alpha} Mediates the Effect of IL-17 To Promote Ongoing Spontaneous and Evoked Pain in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/232?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/232?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pain is a common and severe symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the CNS. The neurobiological mechanism underlying MS pain is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) in driving chronic pain in MS using a mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. We found that spinal CaMKIIα activity was enhanced in EAE, correlating with the development of ongoing spontaneous pain and evoked hypersensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimuli. Prophylactic or acute administration of KN93, a CaMKIIα inhibitor, significantly reduced the clinical scores of EAE and attenuated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in EAE. siRNA targeting CaMKIIα reversed established mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in EAE mice. Furthermore, CaMKIIαT286A point mutation mice showed significantly reduced EAE clinical scores, an absence of evoked pain, and ongoing spontaneous pain when compared with littermate wild-type mice. We found that IL-17 is responsible for inducing but not maintaining mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia that is mediated by CaMKIIα signaling in EAE. Together, these data implicate a critical role of CaMKIIα as a cellular mechanism for pain and neuropathy in multiple sclerosis and IL-17 may act upstream of CaMKIIα in the generation of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pain is highly prevalent in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), significantly reducing patients' quality of life. Using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, we were able to study not only evoked hyperalgesia, but also for the first time to demonstrate spontaneous pain that is also experienced by patients. Our study identified a role of spinal CaMKIIα in promoting and maintaining persistent ongoing spontaneous pain and evoked hyperalgesia pain in EAE. We further demonstrated that IL-17 contributes to persistent pain in EAE and functions as an upstream regulator of CaMKIIα signaling. These data for the first time implicated CaMKIIα and IL-17 as critical regulators of persistent pain in EAE, which may ultimately offer new therapeutic targets for mitigating pain in multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Dual Function of the Polybasic Juxtamembrane Region of Syntaxin 1A in Clamping Spontaneous Release and Stimulating Ca2+-Triggered Release in Neuroendocrine Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/220?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/220?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The exact function of the polybasic juxtamembrane region (5RK) of the plasma membrane neuronal SNARE, syntaxin 1A (Syx), in vesicle exocytosis, although widely studied, is currently not clear. Here, we addressed the role of 5RK in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered release, using our Syx-based intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe, which previously allowed us to resolve a depolarization-induced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent close-to-open transition (CDO) of Syx that occurs concomitant with evoked release, both in PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons and was abolished upon charge neutralization of 5RK. First, using dynamic FRET analysis in PC12 cells, we show that CDO occurs following assembly of SNARE complexes that include the vesicular SNARE, synaptobrevin 2, and that the participation of 5RK in CDO goes beyond its participation in the final zippering of the complex, because mutations of residues adjacent to 5RK, believed to be crucial for final zippering, do not abolish this transition. In addition, we show that CDO is contingent on membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which is fundamental for maintaining regulated exocytosis, as depletion of membranal PIP2 abolishes CDO. Prompted by these results, which underscore a potentially significant role of 5RK in exocytosis, we next amperometrically analyzed catecholamine release from PC12 cells, revealing that charge neutralization of 5RK promotes spontaneous and inhibits Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered release events. Namely, 5RK acts as a fusion clamp, making release dependent on stimulation by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Syntaxin 1A (Syx) is a central protein component of the SNARE complex, which underlies neurotransmitter release. Although widely studied in relation to its participation in SNARE complex formation and its interaction with phosphoinositides, the function of Syx's polybasic juxtamembrane region (5RK) remains unclear. Previously, we showed that a conformational transition of Syx, related to calcium-triggered release, reported by a Syx-based FRET probe, is abolished upon charge neutralization of 5RK (5RK/A). Here we show that this conformational transition is dependent on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and is related to SNARE complex formation. Subsequently, we show that the 5RK/A mutation enhances spontaneous release and inhibits calcium-triggered release in neuroendocrine cells, indicating a previously unrecognized role of 5RK in neurotransmitter release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is an 11 zinc finger DNA-binding domain protein that regulates gene expression by modifying 3D chromatin structure. Human mutations in &lt;i&gt;CTCF&lt;/i&gt; cause intellectual disability and autistic features. Knocking out &lt;i&gt;Ctcf&lt;/i&gt; in mouse embryonic neurons is lethal by neonatal age, but the effects of CTCF deficiency in postnatal neurons are less well studied. We knocked out &lt;i&gt;Ctcf&lt;/i&gt; postnatally in glutamatergic forebrain neurons under the control of &lt;i&gt;Camk2a-Cre. Ctcf&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;loxP/loxP&lt;/sup&gt;;&lt;i&gt;Camk2a-Cre&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Ctcf&lt;/i&gt; CKO) mice of both sexes were viable and exhibited profound deficits in spatial learning/memory, impaired motor coordination, and decreased sociability by 4 months of age. &lt;i&gt;Ctcf&lt;/i&gt; CKO mice also had reduced dendritic spine density in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Microarray analysis of mRNA from &lt;i&gt;Ctcf&lt;/i&gt; CKO mouse hippocampus identified increased transcription of inflammation-related genes linked to microglia. Separate microarray analysis of mRNA isolated specifically from &lt;i&gt;Ctcf&lt;/i&gt; CKO mouse hippocampal neurons by ribosomal affinity purification identified upregulation of chemokine signaling genes, suggesting crosstalk between neurons and microglia in &lt;i&gt;Ctcf&lt;/i&gt; CKO hippocampus. Finally, we found that microglia in &lt;i&gt;Ctcf&lt;/i&gt; CKO mouse hippocampus had abnormal morphology by Sholl analysis and increased immunostaining for CD68, a marker of microglial activation. Our findings confirm that &lt;i&gt;Ctcf&lt;/i&gt; KO in postnatal neurons causes a neurobehavioral phenotype in mice and provide novel evidence that CTCF depletion leads to overexpression of inflammation-related genes and microglial dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a DNA-binding protein that organizes nuclear chromatin topology. Mutations in &lt;i&gt;CTCF&lt;/i&gt; cause intellectual disability and autistic features in humans. CTCF deficiency in embryonic neurons is lethal in mice, but mice with postnatal CTCF depletion are less well studied. We find that mice lacking &lt;i&gt;Ctcf&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Camk2a&lt;/i&gt;-expressing neurons (&lt;i&gt;Ctcf&lt;/i&gt; CKO mice) have spatial learning/memory deficits, impaired fine motor skills, subtly altered social interactions, and decreased dendritic spine density. We demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;Ctcf&lt;/i&gt; CKO mice overexpress inflammation-related genes in the brain and have microglia with abnormal morphology that label positive for CD68, a marker of microglial activation. Our findings suggest that inflammation and dysfunctional neuron–microglia interactions are factors in the pathology of CTCF deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: PKD1 Promotes Functional Synapse Formation Coordinated with N-Cadherin in Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/183?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional synapse formation is critical for the wiring of neural circuits in the developing brain. The cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin plays important roles in target recognition and synaptogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the localization of N-cadherin and the subsequent effects remain poorly understood. Here, we show that protein kinase D1 (PKD1) directly binds to N-cadherin at amino acid residues 836–871 and phosphorylates it at Ser 869, 871, and 872, thereby increasing the surface localization of N-cadherin and promoting functional synapse formation in primary cultured hippocampal neurons obtained from embryonic day 18 rat embryos of either sex. Intriguingly, neuronal activity enhances the interactions between N-cadherin and PKD1, which are critical for the activity-dependent growth of dendritic spines. Accordingly, either disruption the binding between N-cadherin and PKD1 or preventing the phosphorylation of N-cadherin by PKD1 in the hippocampal CA1 region of male rat leads to the reduction in synapse number and impairment of LTP. Together, this study demonstrates a novel mechanism of PKD1 regulating the surface localization of N-cadherin and suggests that the PKD1-N-cadherin interaction is critical for synapse formation and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Defects in synapse formation and function lead to various neurological diseases, although the mechanisms underlying the regulation of synapse development are far from clear. Our results suggest that protein kinase D1 (PKD1) functions upstream of N-cadherin, a classical synaptic adhesion molecule, to promote functional synapse formation. Notably, we identified a crucial binding fragment to PKD1 at C terminus of N-cadherin, and this fragment also contains PKD1 phosphorylation sites. Through this interaction, PKD1 enhances the stability of N-cadherin on cell membrane and promotes synapse morphogenesis and synaptic plasticity in an activity-dependent manner. Our study reveals the role of PKD1 and the potential downstream mechanism in synapse development, and contributes to the research for neurodevelopment and the therapy for neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Normal Topography and Binocularity of the Superior Colliculus in Strabismus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/173?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/173?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In subjects with alternating strabismus, either eye can be used to saccade to visual targets. The brain must calculate the correct vector for each saccade, which will depend on the eye chosen to make it. The superior colliculus, a major midbrain center for saccade generation, was examined to determine whether the maps serving each eye were shifted to compensate for strabismus. Alternating exotropia was induced in two male macaques at age 1 month by sectioning the tendons of the medial recti. Once the animals grew to maturity, they were trained to fixate targets with either eye. Receptive fields were mapped in the superior colliculus using a sparse noise stimulus while the monkeys alternated fixation. For some neurons, sparse noise was presented dichoptically to probe for anomalous retinal correspondence. After recordings, microstimulation was applied to compare sensory and motor maps. The data showed that receptive fields were offset in position by the ocular deviation, but otherwise remained aligned. In one animal, the left eye's coordinates were rotated ~20° clockwise with respect to those of the right eye. This was explained by a corresponding cyclorotation of the ocular fundi, which produced an A-pattern deviation. Microstimulation drove the eyes accurately to the site of receptive fields, as in normal animals. Single-cell recordings uncovered no evidence for anomalous retinal correspondence. Despite strabismus, neurons remained responsive to stimulation of either eye. Misalignment of the eyes early in life does not alter the organization of topographic maps or disrupt binocular convergence in the superior colliculus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Patients with strabismus are able to make rapid eye movements, known as saccades, toward visual targets almost as gracefully as subjects with normal binocular alignment. They can even exercise the option of using the right eye or the left eye. It is unknown how the brain measures the degree of ocular misalignment and uses it to compute the appropriate saccade for either eye. The obvious place to investigate is the superior colliculus, a midbrain oculomotor center responsible for the generation of saccades. Here, we report the first experiments in the superior colliculus of awake primates with strabismus using a combination of single-cell recordings and microstimulation to explore the organization of its topographic maps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ventral Midline Thalamus Is Necessary for Hippocampal Place Field Stability and Cell Firing Modulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/158?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The reuniens (Re) and rhomboid (Rh) nuclei of the ventral midline thalamus are reciprocally connected with the hippocampus (Hip) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Growing evidence suggests that these nuclei might play a crucial role in cognitive processes requiring Hip–mPFC interactions, including spatial navigation. Here, we tested the effect of ReRh lesions on the firing properties and spatial activity of dorsal hippocampal CA1 place cells as male rats explored a familiar or a novel environment. We found no change in the spatial characteristics of CA1 place cells in the familiar environment following ReRh lesions. Contrariwise, spatial coherence was decreased during the first session in a novel environment. We then investigated field stability of place cells recorded across 5 d both in the familiar and in a novel environment presented in a predefined sequence. While the remapping capacity of the place cells was not affected by the lesion, our results clearly demonstrated a disruption of the CA1 cellular representation of both environments in ReRh rats. More specifically, we found ReRh lesions to produce (1) a pronounced and long-lasting decrease of place field stability and (2) a strong alteration of overdispersion (i.e., firing variability). Thus, in ReRh rats, exploration of a novel environment appears to interfere with the representation of the familiar one, leading to decreased field stability in both environments. The present study shows the involvement of ReRh nuclei in the long-term spatial stability of CA1 place fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Growing evidence suggest that the ventral midline thalamic nuclei (reuniens and rhomboid) might play a substantial role in various cognitive tasks including spatial memory. In the present article, we show that the lesions of these nuclei impair the spatial representations encoded by CA1 place cells of both familiar and novel environments. First, reduced variability of place cell firing appears to indicate an impairment of attentional processes. Second, impaired stability of place cell representations could explain the long-term memory deficits observed in previous behavioral studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Attention Priority Map of Face Images in Human Early Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/149?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/149?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Attention priority maps are topographic representations that are used for attention selection and guidance of task-related behavior during visual processing. Previous studies have identified attention priority maps of simple artificial stimuli in multiple cortical and subcortical areas, but investigating neural correlates of priority maps of natural stimuli is complicated by the complexity of their spatial structure and the difficulty of behaviorally characterizing their priority map. To overcome these challenges, we reconstructed the topographic representations of upright/inverted face images from fMRI BOLD signals in human early visual areas primary visual cortex (V1) and the extrastriate cortex (V2 and V3) based on a voxelwise population receptive field model. We characterized the priority map behaviorally as the first saccadic eye movement pattern when subjects performed a face-matching task relative to the condition in which subjects performed a phase-scrambled face-matching task. We found that the differential first saccadic eye movement pattern between upright/inverted and scrambled faces could be predicted from the reconstructed topographic representations in V1–V3 in humans of either sex. The coupling between the reconstructed representation and the eye movement pattern increased from V1 to V2/3 for the upright faces, whereas no such effect was found for the inverted faces. Moreover, face inversion modulated the coupling in V2/3, but not in V1. Our findings provide new evidence for priority maps of natural stimuli in early visual areas and extend traditional attention priority map theories by revealing another critical factor that affects priority maps in extrastriate cortex in addition to physical salience and task goal relevance: image configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Prominent theories of attention posit that attention sampling of visual information is mediated by a series of interacting topographic representations of visual space known as attention priority maps. Until now, neural evidence of attention priority maps has been limited to studies involving simple artificial stimuli and much remains unknown about the neural correlates of priority maps of natural stimuli. Here, we show that attention priority maps of face stimuli could be found in primary visual cortex (V1) and the extrastriate cortex (V2 and V3). Moreover, representations in extrastriate visual areas are strongly modulated by image configuration. These findings extend our understanding of attention priority maps significantly by showing that they are modulated, not only by physical salience and task–goal relevance, but also by the configuration of stimuli images.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Gliotransmission: Beyond Black-and-White</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/14?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/14?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes are highly complex cells with many emerging putative roles in brain function. Of these, gliotransmission (active information transfer from glia to neurons) has probably the widest implications on our understanding of how the brain works: do astrocytes really contribute to information processing within the neural circuitry? &quot;Positive evidence&quot; for this stems from work of multiple laboratories reporting many examples of modulatory chemical signaling from astrocytes to neurons in the timeframe of hundreds of milliseconds to several minutes. This signaling involves, but is not limited to, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent vesicular transmitter release, and results in a variety of regulatory effects at synapses in many circuits that are abolished by preventing Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations or blocking exocytosis selectively in astrocytes. In striking contradiction, methodologically advanced studies by a few laboratories produced &quot;negative evidence,&quot; triggering a heated debate on the actual existence and properties of gliotransmission. In this context, a skeptics' camp arose, eager to dismiss the whole positive evidence based on a number of assumptions behind the negative data, such as the following: (1) deleting a single Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release pathway (IP3R2) removes all the sources for Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent gliotransmission; (2) stimulating a transgenically expressed Gq-GPCR (MrgA1) mimics the physiological Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling underlying gliotransmitter release; (3) age-dependent downregulation of an endogenous GPCR (mGluR5) questions gliotransmitter release in adulthood; and (4) failure by transcriptome analysis to detect vGluts or canonical synaptic SNAREs in astrocytes proves inexistence/functional irrelevance of vesicular gliotransmitter release. We here discuss how the above assumptions are likely wrong and oversimplistic. In light of the most recent literature, we argue that gliotransmission is a more complex phenomenon than originally thought, possibly consisting of multiple forms and signaling processes, whose correct study and understanding require more sophisticated tools and finer scientific experiments than done until today. Under this perspective, the opposing camps can be reconciled and the field moved forward. Along the path, a more cautious mindset and an attitude to open discussion and mutual respect between opponent laboratories will be good companions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Trajectory Analysis Unveils Reelin's Role in the Directed Migration of Granule Cells in the Dentate Gyrus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reelin controls neuronal migration and layer formation. Previous studies in &lt;i&gt;reeler&lt;/i&gt; mice deficient in Reelin focused on the result of the developmental process in fixed tissue sections. It has remained unclear whether Reelin affects the migratory process, migration directionality, or migrating neurons guided by the radial glial scaffold. Moreover, Reelin has been regarded as an attractive signal because newly generated neurons migrate toward the Reelin-containing marginal zone. Conversely, Reelin might be a stop signal because migrating neurons in &lt;i&gt;reeler&lt;/i&gt;, but not in wild-type mice, invade the marginal zone. Here, we monitored the migration of newly generated &lt;i&gt;proopiomelanocortin-EGFP&lt;/i&gt;-expressing dentate granule cells in slice cultures from &lt;i&gt;reeler&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;reeler&lt;/i&gt;-like mutants and wild-type mice of either sex using real-time microscopy. We discovered that not the actual migratory process and migratory speed, but migration directionality of the granule cells is controlled by Reelin. While wild-type granule cells migrated toward the marginal zone of the dentate gyrus, neurons in cultures from &lt;i&gt;reeler&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;reeler&lt;/i&gt;-like mutants migrated randomly in all directions as revealed by vector analyses of migratory trajectories. Moreover, live imaging of granule cells in &lt;i&gt;reeler&lt;/i&gt; slices cocultured to wild-type dentate gyrus showed that the &lt;i&gt;reeler&lt;/i&gt; neurons changed their directions and migrated toward the Reelin-containing marginal zone of the wild-type culture, thus forming a compact granule cell layer. In contrast, directed migration was not observed when Reelin was ubiquitously present in the medium of &lt;i&gt;reeler&lt;/i&gt; slices. These results indicate that topographically administered Reelin controls the formation of a granule cell layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuronal migration and the various factors controlling its onset, speed, directionality, and arrest are poorly understood. Slice cultures offer a unique model to study the migration of individual neurons in an almost natural environment. In the present study, we took advantage of the expression of &lt;i&gt;proopiomelanocortin-EGFP&lt;/i&gt; by newly generated, migrating granule cells to analyze their migratory trajectories in hippocampal slice cultures from wild-type mice and mutants deficient in Reelin signaling. We show that the compartmentalized presence of Reelin is essential for the directionality, but not the actual migratory process or speed, of migrating granule cells leading to their characteristic lamination in the dentate gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Restoration of Dendritic Complexity, Functional Connectivity, and Diversity of Regenerated Retinal Bipolar Neurons in Adult Zebrafish</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/1/120?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adult zebrafish (&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;) are capable of regenerating retinal neurons that have been lost due to mechanical, chemical, or light damage. In the case of chemical damage, there is evidence that visually mediated behaviors are restored after regeneration, consistent with recovery of retinal function. However, the extent to which regenerated retinal neurons attain appropriate morphologies and circuitry after such tissue-disrupting lesions has not been investigated. Adult zebrafish of both sexes were subjected to intravitreal injections of ouabain, which destroys the inner retina. After retinal regeneration, cell-selective markers, confocal microscopy, morphometrics, and electrophysiology were used to examine dendritic and axonal morphologies, connectivities, and the diversities of each, as well as retinal function, for a subpopulation of regenerated bipolar neurons (BPs). Although regenerated BPs were reduced in numbers, BP dendritic spreads, dendritic tree morphologies, and cone–bipolar connectivity patterns were restored in regenerated retinas, suggesting that regenerated BPs recover accurate input pathways from surviving cone photoreceptors. Morphological measurements of bipolar axons found that numbers and types of stratifications were also restored; however, the thickness of the inner plexiform layer and one measure of axon branching were slightly reduced after regeneration, suggesting some minor differences in the recovery of output pathways to downstream partners. Furthermore, ERG traces from regenerated retinas displayed waveforms matching those of controls, but with reduced b-wave amplitudes. These results support the hypothesis that regenerated neurons of the adult zebrafish retina are capable of restoring complex morphologies and circuitry, suggesting that complex visual functions may also be restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Adult zebrafish generate new retinal neurons after a tissue-disrupting lesion. Existing research does not address whether regenerated neurons of adults successfully reconnect with surrounding neurons and establish complex morphologies and functions. We report that, after a chemical lesion that ablates inner retinal neurons, regenerated retinal bipolar neurons (BPs), although reduced in numbers, reconnected to undamaged cone photoreceptors with correct wiring patterns. Regenerated BPs had complex morphologies similar to those within undamaged retina and a physiological measure of photoreceptor–BP connectivity, the ERG, was restored to a normal waveform. This new understanding of neural connectivity, morphology, and physiology suggests that complex functional processing is possible within regenerated adult retina and offers a system for the future study of synaptogenesis during adult retinal regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pretreatment Lesional Volume Impacts Clinical Outcome and Thrombectomy Efficacy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25133</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25133</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: We aimed to characterize the association between pretreatment lesional volume measured on diffusion-weighted images and functional outcome, and estimate the impact on thrombectomy efficacy for ischemic stroke with anterior proximal intracranial arterial occlusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Anterior circulation ischemic stroke patients who had pretreatment diffusion-weighted imaging in the THRACE study were included. Lesional volume was semi-automatically segmented. Logistic regression was applied to model clinical outcome as a function of lesional volume. Outcomes included functional independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0-2), degree of disability (ordinal mRS 0-6), and mortality at 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Of 298 included patients, with median lesional volume 17.2 mL (interquartile range [IQR] 9.2-51.8) and median mRS 2 (IQR 1-4), 51.0% achieved functional independence. Increased lesional volume was an independent predictor for a lower probability of functional independence (odds ratio [OR] 0.90 [95% CI 0.81-0.99] per 10 mL, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), a less favorable degree of disability (common OR [cOR] 0.86 [95% CI 0.81-0.90] per 10 mL, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), and a higher mortality rate (OR 1.21 [95% CI 1.08-1.37] per 10 mL, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). For additional thrombectomy, the number of patients needed to treat to achieve functional independence in 1 patient increased with lesional volume (10 for a volume of 80 mL; 15 for 135 mL). No significant treatment-by-dichotomized volume interaction for functional independence and mortality was observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Pretreatment lesional volume is an independent predictor for functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke with proximal intracranial occlusion. The clinical benefit of adding mechanical thrombectomy to thrombolysis decreased with the increase of lesional volume. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Association of prothrombin complex concentrates administration and hematoma enlargement in NOAC-related intracerebral hemorrhage</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate parameters associated with hematoma enlargement in non-vitamin-K-antagonist-anticoagulant(NOAC)-related intracerebral hemorrhage(ICH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Retrospective cohort study including individual patient data of 190 patients with NOAC-associated ICH over a 5-year-period(2011-2015) at 19 Departments of Neurology across Germany. Primary outcome was the association of PCC-administration with hematoma enlargement. Subanalyses were calculated for blood-pressure management and its association with the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include associations with in-hospital mortality and functional outcome at 3 months assessed using the modified Rankin scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The study population for analysis of primary and secondary outcomes consisted of 146 NOAC-ICH-patients with available follow-up imaging. Hematoma enlargement occurred in 49/146(33.6%) patients with NOAC-related ICH. Parameters associated with hematoma enlargement were blood pressure above 160mmHg within 4hours and – in case of factor-Xa-inhibitor-ICH – anti-Xa-levels on admission. PCC-administration prior to follow-up imaging was not significantly associated with a reduced rate of hematoma enlargement neither in overall NOAC-related ICH nor in patients with factor-Xa-inhibitor intake (RR(95%CI):NOAC 1.150(0.632-2.090);factor-Xa-inhibitor: 1.057(0.565-1.977)), regardless of PCC-dosage given or time interval until imaging or treatment. Systolic blood pressure levels&amp;lt;160mmHg within 4 hours after admission were significantly associated with a reduction in the proportion of patients with hematoma enlargement (RR(95%CI):1.057(0.565-1.977)). PCC-administration had no effect on mortality and functional outcome neither at discharge nor at 3months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: In contrast to blood-pressure control, PCC-administration was not associated with a reduced rate of hematoma enlargement in NOAC-related ICH. Our findings support the need of further investigations exploring new hemostatic reversal strategies for patients with factor-Xa-inhibitor-related ICH. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Accurate reconstruction of image stimuli from human fMRI based on the decoding model with capsule network architecture. (arXiv:1801.00602v1 [cs.CV])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In neuroscience, all kinds of computation models were designed to answer the
open question of how sensory stimuli are encoded by neurons and conversely, how
sensory stimuli can be decoded from neuronal activities. Especially, functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies have made many great achievements
with the rapid development of the deep network computation. However, comparing
with the goal of decoding orientation, position and object category from
activities in visual cortex, accurate reconstruction of image stimuli from
human fMRI is a still challenging work. In this paper, the capsule network
(CapsNet) architecture based visual reconstruction (CNAVR) method is developed
to reconstruct image stimuli. The capsule means containing a group of neurons
to perform the better organization of feature structure and representation,
inspired by the structure of cortical mini column including several hundred
neurons in primates. The high-level capsule features in the CapsNet includes
diverse features of image stimuli such as semantic class, orientation, location
and so on. We used these features to bridge between human fMRI and image
stimuli. We firstly employed the CapsNet to train the nonlinear mapping from
image stimuli to high-level capsule features, and from high-level capsule
features to image stimuli again in an end-to-end manner. After estimating the
serviceability of each voxel by encoding performance to accomplish the
selecting of voxels, we secondly trained the nonlinear mapping from
dimension-decreasing fMRI data to high-level capsule features. Finally, we can
predict the high-level capsule features with fMRI data, and reconstruct image
stimuli with the CapsNet. We evaluated the proposed CNAVR method on the dataset
of handwritten digital images, and exceeded about 10% than the accuracy of all
existing state-of-the-art methods on the structural similarity index (SSIM).

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modeling and interpreting spike train data is a task of central importance in
computational neuroscience, with significant translational implications. Two
popular classes of data-driven models for this task are autoregressive Point
Process Generalized Linear models (PPGLM) and latent State-Space models (SSM)
with point-process observations. In this letter, we derive a mathematical
connection between these two classes of models. By introducing an auxiliary
history process, we represent exactly a PPGLM in terms of a latent, infinite
dimensional dynamical system, which can then be mapped onto an SSM by basis
function projections and moment closure. This representation provides a new
perspective on widely used methods for modeling spike data, and also suggests
novel algorithmic approaches to fitting such models. We illustrate our results
on a phasic bursting neuron model, showing that our proposed approach provides
an accurate and efficient way to capture neural dynamics.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prenatal stress (PS) impacts early postnatal behavioural and cognitive
development. This process of 'fetal programming' is mediated by the effects of
the prenatal experience on the developing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
axis and autonomic nervous system (ANS). The HPA axis is a dynamic system
regulating homeostasis, especially the stress response, and is highly sensitive
to adverse early life experiences. We review the evidence for the effects of PS
on fetal programming of the HPA axis and the ANS. We derive a multi-scale
multi-species approach to devising preclinical and clinical studies to identify
early non-invasively available pre- and postnatal biomarkers of these
programming effects. Such approach would identify adverse postnatal brain
developmental trajectories, a prerequisite for designing therapeutic
interventions. The multiple scales include the biomarkers reflecting changes in
the brain epigenome, metabolome, microbiome and the ANS activity gauged via an
array of advanced non-invasively obtainable properties of fetal heart rate
fluctuations. The proposed framework has the potential to reveal mechanistic
links between maternal stress during pregnancy and changes across these
physiological scales. Such biomarkers may hence be useful as early and
non-invasive predictors of neurodevelopmental trajectories influenced by the
PS. We conclude that studies into PS effects must be conducted on multiple
scales derived from concerted observations in multiple animal models and human
cohorts performed in an interactive and iterative manner and deploying machine
learning for data synthesis, identification and validation of the best
non-invasive biomarkers.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Animal behaviour depends on learning to associate sensory stimuli with the
desired motor command. Understanding how the brain orchestrates the necessary
synaptic modifications across different brain areas has remained a longstanding
puzzle. Here, we introduce a multi-area neuronal network model in which
synaptic plasticity continuously adapts the network towards a global desired
output. In this model synaptic learning is driven by a local dendritic
prediction error that arises from a failure to predict the top-down input given
the bottom-up activities. Such errors occur at apical dendrites of pyramidal
neurons where both long-range excitatory feedback and local inhibitory
predictions are integrated. When local inhibition fails to match excitatory
feedback an error occurs which triggers plasticity at bottom-up synapses at
basal dendrites of the same pyramidal neurons. We demonstrate the learning
capabilities of the model in a number of tasks and show that it approximates
the classical error backpropagation algorithm. Finally, complementing this
cortical circuit with a disinhibitory mechanism enables attention-like stimulus
denoising and generation. Our framework makes several experimental predictions
on the function of dendritic integration and cortical microcircuits, is
consistent with recent observations of cross-area learning, and suggests a
biological implementation of deep learning.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hierarchies are of fundamental interest in both stochastic optimal control
and biological control due to their facilitation of a range of desirable
computational traits in a control algorithm and the possibility that they may
form a core principle of sensorimotor and cognitive control systems. However, a
theoretically justified construction of state-space hierarchies over all
spatial resolutions and their evolution through a policy inference process
remains elusive. Here, a formalism for deriving such normative representations
of discrete Markov decision processes is introduced in the context of graphs.
The resulting hierarchies correspond to a hierarchical policy inference
algorithm approximating a discrete gradient flow between state-space trajectory
densities generated by the prior and optimal policies.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This document has an unorthodox structure to accomplish an unorthodox goal:
presenting the scaffolding for a zero-parameter Unified Theory of Life inside
several dozen pages. Ideally, that length is short enough to be understood in a
few hours, yet complete and principled enough to unfold into solutions to
civilization's most urgent problem: the accelerating de-calibration of fluid
human brains by compelling digitized signals. The stakes of understanding
humans as informational beings are huge. Without drastic changes, crucial human
functionality will vanish in a generation. Fortunately, the cures are cheap and
easy if promoted properly. These ten hypotheses re-present in more abstract,
encapsulated form a Framework published a few months ago in a reputable
peer-reviewed journal, which concluded that human sensory systems must be
accorded data of the same quality as the data which already trains algorithmic
intelligences. While the lack of experiment-grade detail might make these
hypotheses seem &quot;unscientific,&quot; in compensation the breadth of this Framework
ought to provide the virtues of theory: clarity, simplicity, coherence, and
self-evidence. Five of the hypotheses span humanity's current problem-space,
and five a possible solution space. They are: H1.0 Stably evolving
distributions must balance themselves between narrowing and broadening H2.0
Stabilization and homeostasis are fragile in multiple ways H3.0 Representing
spacetime requires micro-timing and mega-assumptions H4.0 When in doubt, ping!
H5.0 Mediated communication becomes infected with pinging H6.0 If scaling and
incentives are the problems, then entropy and affection are the solutions H7.0
&quot;Paleo everything but violence&quot; provides sensorimotor nutrition H8.0 Humans
evolved to resonate ecstatically H9.0 Symmetric spinal health syndrome H9.5

	<description>α-Synuclein resides in Lewy bodies in Parkinson’s disease. Ordonez et al. now show that α-syn disrupts the actin network, causing Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission defects. This is similar to defects induced by the PD risk factor Tau, suggesting converging pathways in neurodegeneration.</description>

	<description>In this issue of Neuron, Helfrich et al. (2017) demonstrate that phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between slow oscillations and spindles is crucial for memory consolidation, and shifts in its phase relationship may explain age-related deficits in memory performance. These results also suggest a more general function of PAC in synaptic plasticity.</description>

	<description>The key driver of Alzheimer’s pathophysiology remains controversial. Frere and Slutsky describe the integrated homeostasis network, composed of firing, genome, proteome, calcium, energy, and immune modules, that enables functional stability of neural circuits. The authors propose that firing homeostasis failure triggers a vicious cycle that dysregulates the whole homeostatic network, driving Alzheimer’s degeneration.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/242388v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>EEG changes across vigilance states have been observed after ischemic stroke in patients and experimental stroke models, but their relation to functional recovery remains unclear. Here, we evaluate motor function, as measured by single pellet reaching (SPR), as well as local EEG changes in NREM, REM and wakefulness during a 30-day recovery period after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham surgery in rats. Small cortical infarcts resulted in poor SPR performance and induced widespread changes in EEG spectra in the ipsilesional hemisphere in all vigilance states, without causing major changes in sleep-wake architecture. Ipsilesional 1-4 Hz power was increased after stroke, whereas power in higher frequencies was reduced, resulting in a steeper slope of the power spectrum. Multielectrode array analysis of ipsilesional M1 showed that these spectral changes were present on the microelectrode level throughout M1 and were not related to increased synchronization between electrodes. Spectrum slope was significantly correlated with post-stroke motor function.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Time-restricted foraging under natural light/dark condition shifts the molecular clock in the honey bee, Apis mellifera</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/242289v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Honey bees have a remarkable sense of time and individual honey bee foragers are capable to adjust their foraging activity with respect to the time of food availability. Although, there is plenty of experimental evidence that foraging behavior is guided by the circadian clock, nothing is known about the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Here we present a first study exploring whether the time-restricted foraging under natural light-dark condition affects the molecular clock in honey bees. In an enclosed flight chamber (12m x 4m x 4m), food was presented either for 2 hours in the morning or 2 hours in the afternoon for several consecutive days and daily cycling of the two major clock genes, cryptochrome2 (cry2) and period (per), were analyzed in three different tissues involved in feeding-related behaviors: brain, antennae and subesophageal ganglion (SEG). We found that morning and afternoon trained foragers showed significant phase-differences in the cycling of both clock genes in all three tissues. Furthermore, the phase-differences were more pronounced when the feeder was scented with the general plant odor linalool. Our results clearly demonstrate that foraging time functions as a strong circadian Zeitgeber in honey bees. More surprisingly our results suggest that foraging time might have the potential to override the entrainment effect of the light-dark cycle.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/242214v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The everyday environment brings about many competing inputs from different modalities to our sensory systems. The ability to filter these multisensory inputs in order to identify and efficiently utilize useful spatial cues is necessary to detect and process the relevant information. In the present study, we investigate how feature-based attention affects the detection of motion across sensory modalities. We were interested to determine how subjects use intramodal, crossmodal auditory, and combined audiovisual motion cues to attend to specific visual motion signals. The results show that in most cases, both visual and auditory cues enhance feature-based orienting to a visual motion pattern that is presented among distractor patterns. Furthermore, in many cases, detection of transparent motion patterns was significantly more accurate after combined visual-auditory than unimodal attention cues. Whereas previous studies have shown crossmodal effects of spatial attention, our results demonstrate a spread of crossmodal feature-based attention cues, which have been matched for the detection threshold of the visual target. These effects were evident in comparisons between cued and uncued conditions, as well as in analyses comparing the effects of valid vs. invalid cues.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/242198v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>An aged circulatory environment can promote brain dysfunction and we hypothesized that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) mediates at least some of these effects. We observe brain endothelial cells (BECs) in the aged mouse hippocampus express an inflammatory transcriptional profile with focal upregulation of Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (VCAM1), a protein that facilitates vascular-immune cell interactions. Concomitantly, the shed, soluble form of VCAM1 is prominently increased in the aged circulation of humans and mice, and aged plasma is sufficient to increase VCAM1 expression in cultured BECs and young mouse hippocampi. Systemic anti-VCAM1 antibody or genetic ablation of VCAM1 in BECs counteracts the detrimental effects of aged plasma on young brains and reverses aging aspects in old mouse brains. Thus, VCAM1 is a negative regulator of adult neurogenesis and inducer of microglial reactivity, establishing VCAM1 and the luminal side of the BBB as possible targets to treat age-related neurodegeneration.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mathematical modeling identifies optimum lapatinib dosing schedules for the treatment of glioblastoma patients</title>

Human primary glioblastomas (GBM) often harbor mutations within the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Treatment of EGFR-mutant GBM cell lines with the EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib can effectively induce cell death in these models. However, EGFR inhibitors have shown little efficacy in the clinic, partly because of inappropriate dosing. Here, we developed a computational approach to model the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cellular dynamics of the EGFR-mutant cell line SF268 in response to different lapatinib concentrations and dosing schedules. We then used this approach to identify an effective treatment strategy within the clinical toxicity limits of lapatinib, and developed a partial differential equation modeling approach to study the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; GBM treatment response by taking into account the heterogeneous and diffusive nature of the disease. Despite the inability of lapatinib to induce tumor regressions with a continuous daily schedule, our modeling approach consistently predicts that continuous dosing remains the best clinically feasible strategy for slowing down tumor growth and lowering overall tumor burden, compared to pulsatile schedules currently known to be tolerated, even when considering drug resistance, reduced lapatinib tumor concentrations due to the blood brain barrier, and the phenotypic switch from proliferative to migratory cell phenotypes that occurs in hypoxic microenvironments. Our mathematical modeling and statistical analysis platform provides a rational method for comparing treatment schedules in search for optimal dosing strategies for glioblastoma and other cancer types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9ffKwWuBqlk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Gene expression is orchestrated by distinct regulatory regions to ensure a wide variety of cell types and functions. A challenge is to identify which regulatory regions are active, what are their associated features and how they work together in each cell type. Several approaches have tackled this problem by modeling gene expression based on epigenetic marks, with the ultimate goal of identifying driving regions and associated genomic variations that are clinically relevant in particular in precision medicine. However, these models rely on experimental data, which are limited to specific samples (even often to cell lines) and cannot be generated for all regulators and all patients. In addition, we show here that, although these approaches are accurate in predicting gene expression, inference of TF combinations from this type of models is not straightforward. Furthermore these methods are not designed to capture regulation instructions present at the sequence level, before the binding of regulators or the opening of the chromatin. Here, we probe sequence-level instructions for gene expression and develop a method to explain mRNA levels based solely on nucleotide features. Our method positions nucleotide composition as a critical component of gene expression. Moreover, our approach, able to rank regulatory regions according to their contribution, unveils a strong influence of the gene body sequence, in particular introns. We further provide evidence that the contribution of nucleotide content can be linked to co-regulations associated with genome 3D architecture and to associations of genes within topologically associated domains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/isBV1L_-p0A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition promotes intra-tumoral heterogeneity, by enhancing tumor cell invasiveness and promoting drug resistance. We integrated transcriptomic data for two clonal subpopulations from a prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) into a genome-scale metabolic network model to explore their metabolic differences and potential vulnerabilities. In this dual cell model, PC-3/S cells express Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition markers and display high invasiveness and low metastatic potential, while PC-3/M cells present the opposite phenotype and higher proliferative rate. Model-driven analysis and experimental validations unveiled a marked metabolic reprogramming in long-chain fatty acids metabolism. While PC-3/M cells showed an enhanced entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, PC-3/S cells used long-chain fatty acids as precursors of eicosanoid metabolism. We suggest that this metabolic reprogramming endows PC-3/M cells with augmented energy metabolism for fast proliferation and PC-3/S cells with increased eicosanoid production impacting angiogenesis, cell adhesion and invasion. PC-3/S metabolism also promotes the accumulation of docosahexaenoic acid, a long-chain fatty acid with antiproliferative effects. The potential therapeutic significance of our model was supported by a differential sensitivity of PC-3/M cells to etomoxir, an inhibitor of long-chain fatty acid transport to the mitochondria.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1miMpMwymts&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Integrating data from multiple regulatory layers across cancer types could elucidate additional mechanisms of oncogenesis. Using antibody-based protein profiling of 736 cancer cell lines, along with matching transcriptomic data, we show that pan-cancer bimodality in the amounts of mRNA, protein, and protein phosphorylation reveals mechanisms related to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Based on the bimodal expression of E-cadherin, we define an EMT signature consisting of 239 genes, many of which were not previously associated with EMT. By querying gene expression signatures collected from cancer cell lines after small-molecule perturbations, we identify enrichment for histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as inducers of EMT, and kinase inhibitors as mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) promoters. Causal modeling of protein-based signaling identifies putative drivers of EMT. In conclusion, integrative analysis of pan-cancer proteomic and transcriptomic data reveals key regulatory mechanisms of oncogenic transformation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8JHO-bLweh0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Proteome balance is safeguarded by the proteostasis network (PN), an intricately regulated network of conserved processes that evolved to maintain native function of the diverse ensemble of protein species, ensuring cellular and organismal health. Proteostasis imbalances and collapse are implicated in a spectrum of human diseases, from neurodegeneration to cancer. The characteristics of PN disease alterations however have not been assessed in a systematic way. Since chaperome is among the central components of PN, we focused on chaperome in our study by utilizing a curated functional ontology of the human chaperome that we connect in a high-confidence physical protein-protein interaction network. Challenged by the lack of a systems-level understanding of proteostasis alterations in the heterogeneous spectrum of human cancers, we assessed gene expression across more than 10,000 patient biopsies covering 22 solid cancers. We derived a novel customized Meta-PCA dimension reduction approach yielding M-scores as quantitative indicators of disease expression changes to condense the complexity of cancer transcriptomics datasets into quantitative functional network topographies. We confirm upregulation of the HSP90 family and also highlight HSP60s, Prefoldins, HSP100s, ER- and mitochondria-specific chaperones as pan-cancer enriched. Our analysis also reveals a surprisingly consistent strong downregulation of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) and we stratify two cancer groups based on the preferential upregulation of ATP-dependent chaperones. Strikingly, our analysis highlight similarities between stem cell and cancer proteostasis, and diametrically opposed chaperome deregulation between cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. We developed a web-based Proteostasis Profiler tool (Pro&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) enabling intuitive analysis and visual exploration of proteostasis disease alterations using gene expression data. Our study showcases a comprehensive profiling of chaperome shifts in human cancers and sets the stage for a systematic global analysis of PN alterations across the human diseasome towards novel hypotheses for therapeutic network re-adjustment in proteostasis disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Fr0tWafT6PQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Improving pairwise comparison of protein sequences with domain co-occurrence</title>

Comparing and aligning protein sequences is an essential task in bioinformatics. More specifically, local alignment tools like BLAST are widely used for identifying conserved protein sub-sequences, which likely correspond to protein domains or functional motifs. However, to limit the number of false positives, these tools are used with stringent sequence-similarity thresholds and hence can miss several hits, especially for species that are phylogenetically distant from reference organisms. A solution to this problem is then to integrate additional contextual information to the procedure. Here, we propose to use domain co-occurrence to increase the sensitivity of pairwise sequence comparisons. Domain co-occurrence is a strong feature of proteins, since most protein domains tend to appear with a limited number of other domains on the same protein. We propose a method to take this information into account in a typical BLAST analysis and to construct new domain families on the basis of these results. We used &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; as a case study to evaluate our method. The experimental findings showed an increase of 14% of the number of significant BLAST hits and an increase of 25% of the proteome area that can be covered with a domain. Our method identified 2240 new domains for which, in most cases, no model of the Pfam database could be linked. Moreover, our study of the quality of the new domains in terms of alignment and physicochemical properties show that they are close to that of standard Pfam domains. Source code of the proposed approach and supplementary data are available at: https://gite.lirmm.fr/menichelli/pairwise-comparison-with-cooccurrence&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7Yzat0vdZqA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Dissimilatory phosphite oxidation (DPO), a microbial metabolism by which phosphite (HPO32−) is oxidized to phosphate (PO43−), is the most energetically favorable chemotrophic electron-donating process known. Only one DPO organism has been described to date, and little is known about the environmental relevance of this metabolism. In this study, we used...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/WlX49lApS14&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>There is an urgent need for a vaccine to combat the hepatitis C virus (HCV) pandemic, and induction of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) against HCV is a major goal of vaccine development.

	<description>Sexual selection is a fundamental evolutionary process but remains debated, particularly in the complexity of polyandrous populations where females mate with multiple males. This lack of resolution is partly because studies have largely ignored the structure of the sexual network, that is, the pattern of mate sharing.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objectives&lt;/b&gt; We evaluate incidence and prevalence of autoimmune encephalitis and compare the epidemiology of autoimmune and infectious encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt; We performed a population-based comparative study of the incidence and prevalence of autoimmune and infectious encephalitis in Olmsted County, USA. Autoimmune encephalitis diagnosis and subgroups were defined by 2016 diagnostic criteria and infectious encephalitis diagnosis required a confirmed infectious pathogen. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence and incidence rates were calculated. Patients with encephalitis of uncertain etiology were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt; The prevalence of autoimmune encephalitis on January 1, 2014 of 13.7/100,000 was not significantly different from that of all infectious encephalitides (11.6/100,000; p=0.63) or the viral subcategory (8.3/100,000; p=0.17). The incidence rates (1995-2015) of autoimmune and infectious encephalitis were 0.8/100,000 and 1.0/100,000 person-years respectively (p=0.58). The number of relapses or recurrent hospitalizations was higher for autoimmune than infectious encephalitis (p=0.03). The incidence of autoimmune encephalitis increased over time from 0.4/100,000 person-years (1995-2005) to 1.2/100,000 person-years (2006-2015) (p=0.02), attributable to increased recognition of autoantibody-positive cases. The incidence (2.8 vs 0.7/100,000 person-years; p=0.01) and prevalence (38.3 vs 13.7/100,000; p=0.04) of autoimmune encephalitis was higher among African-Americans than Caucasians. The prevalence of specific neural autoantibodies was: myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprotein (MOG) (1.9/100,000); glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 (GAD65) (1.9/100,000); unclassified neural autoantibody (1.4/100,000); leucine-rich glioma-inactivated-protein-1 (LGI1) (0.7/100,000); collapsin response-mediator protein-5 (CRMP5) (0.7/100,000); N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor (NMDAR) (0.6/100,000); anti-neuronal nuclear antibody-2 (ANNA-2/anti-Ri) (0.6/100,000) and glial fibrillary acidic protein-α (GFAPα) (0.6/100,000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt; This study shows that the prevalence and incidence of autoimmune encephalitis is comparable to infectious encephalitis and its detection is increasing over time.

	<description>Here we present an open-source R package 'meaRtools' that provides a platform for analyzing neuronal networks recorded on Multi-Electrode Arrays (MEAs). Cultured neuronal networks monitored with MEAs are now being widely used to characterize in vitro models of neurological disorders and to evaluate pharmaceutical compounds. meaRtools provides core algorithms for MEA spike train analysis, feature extraction, statistical analysis and plotting of multiple MEA recordings with multiple genotypes and treatments. meaRtools functionality covers novel solutions for spike train analysis, including algorithms to assess electrode cross-correlation using the spike train tiling coefficient (STTC), mutual information, network burst synchronization and entropy within cultured wells. Also integrated is a solution to account for bursts variability originating from mixed-cell neuronal cultures. The package provides a statistical platform built specifically for MEA data that can combine multiple MEA recordings and compare extracted features between different genetic models or treatments. We demonstrate the utilization of meaRtools to successfully identify epilepsy-like phenotypes in neuronal networks from Celf4 KO mice as well as the pharmacological correction of phenotypes. The package is freely available under the GPL license (GPL&amp;gt;=3) and is updated frequently on the CRAN web-server repository. The package, along with full documentation can be downloaded from: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meaRtools/.</description>

	<description>Much is known about the neural circuits of conditioned fear and its relevance to understanding anxiety disorders, but less is known about other anxiety-related behaviors such as active avoidance. Using a tone-signaled, platform-mediated active avoidance task, we observed that pharmacological inactivation of the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL) delayed initiation of avoidance. However, optogenetic silencing of PL neurons did not delay avoidance. Consistent with this finding, inhibitory, but not excitatory, responses of rostral PL neurons to the tone were correlated with initiation of avoidance. To oppose inhibitory responses, we photoactivated rostral PL neurons during the tone to maintain pre-tone firing rate. Photoactivation of rostral PL (but not caudal PL) neurons at 4 Hz (but not 2 Hz) delayed or prevented avoidance. These findings suggest that the initiation of active avoidance requires inhibitory neuronal responses in rostral PL, and underscores the importance of designing behavioral optogenetic studies based on neuronal firing patterns.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: An unbiased decoding of ventral striatal oscillations in a rat model of binge eating: Finding the balance between model complexity and performance.</title>

	<description>Binge eating is a disruptive and treatment-resistant behavior that complicates the management of obesity and comorbid psychiatric disorders. The distributed network that governs feeding behavior, particularly of palatable food, has a nexus point within the ventral striatum (VS) -- integrating information from energy homeostasis circuits of the hypothalamus and brain stem, cognitive control regions of the prefrontal cortex and central nodes of learning and memory. The VS is thus a consensus target for neuromodulation-based interventions (e.g., deep brain stimulation -- DBS) for appetitive disorders. Here, in a rat model of binge eating, we determined what information could be decoded from VS oscillations related to feeding behavior that could be utilized in closed-loop or adaptive systems. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 12) were implanted with electrodes targeting bilateral nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell (regions within the VS) and local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded during binge sessions in which the conditions were varied. These included normal baseline sessions, sessions following 24 or 48 hours of food deprivation or with an alternative food type. The LFP features (60) were used as predictors in statistical (logistic regression) and machine learning (lasso) models to predict the type and quantity of food consumed, classify rat behavior (feeding or not feeding) in real time, and predict the impending onset of future feeding bouts. The complexity of the real-time models were then manipulated to determine the impact on model stability and performance. Models were able to outperform by-chance models to predict the amount of food eaten at baseline (effect size -- d = 0.43), the increase in binge size following food deprivation (d = 1.1) and the type of food being eaten (d = 0.55). LFP features could also be used to predicted whether initiation of feeding was imminent (d = 2.68) up to 42.5 seconds before feeding began or classify current behavior as feeding or not feeding (d = 3.27). Together these findings show that a relatively simple model (~3 LFP features) can derive information about feeding behavior from VS oscillations for responsive neuromodulation systems or serve as potential targets for treatment development.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Organization of Area hV5/MT+ in Subjects with Homonymous Visual Field Defects</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/241836v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Damage to the primary visual cortex (V1) leads to a visual field loss (scotoma) in the retinotopically corresponding part of the visual field. Nonetheless, a small amount of residual visual sensitivity persists within the blind field. This residual capacity has been linked to activity observed in the middle temporal area complex (V5/MT+). However, it remains unknown whether the organization of hV5/MT+ changes following V1 lesions. We studied the organization of area hV5/MT+ of five patients with dense homonymous defects in a quadrant of the visual field as a result of partial V1+ or optic radiation lesions. To do so, we developed a new method, which models the boundaries of population receptive fields directly from the BOLD signal of each voxel in the visual cortex. We found responses in hV5/MT+ arising inside the scotoma for all patients and identified two possible sources of activation: 1) responses might originate from partially lesioned parts of area V1 corresponding to the scotoma, and 2) responses can also originate independent of area V1 input suggesting the existence of functional V1-bypassing pathways. Apparently, visually driven activity observed in hV5/MT+ is not sufficient to mediate conscious vision. More surprisingly, visually driven activity in corresponding regions of V1 and early extrastriate areas including hV5/MT+ did not guarantee visual perception in the group of patients with post-geniculate lesions that we examined. This suggests that the fine coordination of visual activity patterns across visual areas may be an important determinant of whether visual perception persists following visual cortical lesions.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Turing Machines are universal computing machines in theory. It has been a
long debate whether Turing Machines can simulate the consciousness mind
behaviors in the materialistic universe. Three different hypotheses come out of
such debate, in short:(A) Can; (B) Cannot; (C) Super-Turing machines can.
Because Turing Machines or other kinds of theoretical computing models are
abstract objects while behaviors are real observables, this debate involves at
least three distinct fields of science and technology: physics, computer
engineering, and experimental neuroscience. However, the languages used in
these different fields are highly heterogeneous and not easily interpretable
for each other, making it very difficult to reach partial agreements regarding
this debate, Therefore, the main goal of this manuscript is to establish a
proper language that can translate among those different fields. First, I
propose a theoretical model for analyzing how theoretical computing machines
would physically run in physical time. This model, termed as the xInf, is at
first place Turing-complete in theory, and depending on the properties of
physical time, it can be either Turing-equivalent or Super-Turing in the
physical universe. The xInf Model is demonstrated to be a suitable universal
language to translate among physics, computer engineering, and neuroscience.
Finally, I propose a conjecture that there exists a Minimal Complete Set of
rules in the xInf Model that enables the construction of a physical machine
using inorganic materials that can pass the Turing Test in physical time. I
cannot demonstrate whether such a conjecture to be testified or falsified on
paper using finite-order logic, my only solution is physical time itself, i.e.
an evolutionary competition will eventually tell the conclusion.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning weights in a spiking neural network with hidden neurons, using
local, stable and online rules, to control non-linear body dynamics is an open
problem. Here, we employ a supervised scheme, Feedback-based Online Local
Learning Of Weights (FOLLOW), to train a network of heterogeneous spiking
neurons with hidden layers, to control a two-link arm so as to reproduce a
desired state trajectory. The network first learns an inverse model of the
non-linear dynamics, i.e. from state trajectory as input to the network, it
learns to infer the continuous-time command that produced the trajectory.
Connection weights are adjusted via a local plasticity rule that involves
pre-synaptic firing and post-synaptic feedback of the error in the inferred
command. We choose a network architecture, termed differential feedforward,
that gives the lowest test error from different feedforward and recurrent
architectures. The learned inverse model is then used to generate a
continuous-time motor command to control the arm, given a desired trajectory.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning and memory are intertwined in our brain and their relationship is at
the core of several recent neural network models. In particular, the
Attention-Gated MEmory Tagging model (AuGMEnT) is a reinforcement learning
network with an emphasis on biological plausibility of memory dynamics and
learning. We find that the AuGMEnT network does not solve some hierarchical
tasks, where higher-level stimuli have to be maintained over a long time, while
lower-level stimuli need to be remembered and forgotten over a shorter
timescale. To overcome this limitation, we introduce hybrid AuGMEnT, with leaky
or short-timescale and non-leaky or long-timescale units in memory, that allow
to exchange lower-level information while maintaining higher-level one, thus
solving both hierarchical and distractor tasks.

	<description>Neuromodulation-based interventions continue to be evaluated across an array of appetitive disorders but broader implementation of these approaches remains limited due to variable treatment outcomes. We hypothesize that individual variation in treatment outcomes may be linked to differences in the networks underlying these disorders. Here, Sprague-Dawley rats received deep brain stimulation separately within each nucleus accumbens (NAc) sub-region (core and shell) using a within-animal crossover design in a rat model of binge eating. Significant reductions in binge size were observed with stimulation of either target but with significant variation in effectiveness across individuals. When features of local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the NAc were used as predictors of the pre-defined stimulation outcomes (response or non-response) from each rat using a machine-learning approach (lasso), stimulation outcomes could be predicted with greater accuracy than expected by chance (effect sizes: core = 1.13, shell = 1.05). Further, these LFP features could be used to identify the best stimulation target for each animal (core vs. shell) with an effect size = 0.96. These data suggest that individual differences in underlying network activity may contribute to the variable outcomes of circuit based interventions and that measures of network activity have the potential to individually guide the selection of an optimal stimulation target and improve overall treatment response rates.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The influence of cortical depth on neuronal responses in mouse visual cortex</title>

	<description>With the advent of two-photon imaging as a tool for systems neuroscience, the mouse has become a preeminent model system for studying sensory processing. One notable difference that has been found however, between mice and traditional model species like cats and primates is the responsiveness of the cortex. In the primary visual cortex of cats and primates, nearly all neurons respond to simple visual stimuli like drifting gratings. In contrast, imaging studies in mice consistently find that only around half of the neurons respond to such stimuli. Here we show that visual responsiveness is strongly dependent on the cortical depth of neurons. Moving from superficial layer 2 down to layer 4, the percentage of responsive neurons increases dramatically, ultimately reaching levels similar to what is seen in other species. Over this span of cortical depth, neuronal response amplitude also increases and orientation selectivity moderately decreases. These depth dependent response properties may be explained by the distribution of thalamic inputs in mouse V1. Unlike in cats and primates where thalamic projections to the granular layer are constrained to layer 4, in mice they spread up into layer 2/3, qualitatively matching the distribution of response properties we see. These results show that the analysis of neural response properties must take into consideration not only the overall cortical lamina boundaries but also the depth of recorded neurons within each cortical layer. Furthermore, the inability to drive the majority of neurons in superficial layer 2/3 of mouse V1 with grating stimuli indicates that there may be fundamental differences in the role of V1 between rodents and other mammals.</description>

	<description>Neurological and psychiatric diseases often involve the dysfunction of specific neural circuits in particular regions of the brain. Existing treatments, including drugs and implantable brain stimulators, aim to modulate the activity of these circuits, but are typically not cell type-specific, lack spatial targeting or require invasive procedures. Here, we introduce an approach to modulating neural circuits noninvasively with spatial, cell-type and temporal specificity. This approach, called acoustically targeted chemogenetics, or ATAC, uses transient ultrasonic opening of the blood brain barrier to transduce neurons at specific locations in the brain with virally-encoded engineered G-protein-coupled receptors, which subsequently respond to systemically administered bio-inert compounds to activate or inhibit the activity of these neurons. We demonstrate this concept in mice by using ATAC to noninvasively modify and subsequently activate or inhibit excitatory neurons within the hippocampus, showing that this enables pharmacological control of memory formation. This technology allows a brief, noninvasive procedure to make one or more specific brain regions capable of being selectively modulated using orally bioavailable compounds, thereby overcoming some of the key limitations of conventional brain therapies.</description>

	<description>Primates--including humans--can typically recognize objects in visual images at a glance, even in the face of naturally occurring identity preserving image transformations such as changes in viewpoint. A primary neuroscience goal is to uncover neuron-level mechanistic models that quantitatively explain this behavior, not only predicting average primate performance, but also predicting primate performance for each and every image. Here, we applied this stringent behavioral prediction test to the leading mechanistic models of primate vision (specifically, deep, convolutional, artificial neural networks; ANNs) by directly comparing their behavioral patterns, at high resolution over a large number of object discrimination tasks, against those of humans and rhesus macaque monkeys. Using high-throughput data collection systems for human and monkey psychophysics, we collected over one million behavioral trials for 2400 images of 24 broadly sampled basic-level objects, resulting in 276 binary object discrimination tasks. Consistent with previous work, we observed that state-of-the-art deep, feed-forward, convolutional ANNs trained for visual categorization (termed DCNNIC models) accurately predicted primate patterns of object-level confusion (e.g. how often a camel is confused with a dog, on average). However, when we examined behavioral performance for individual images within each object discrimination task, we found that all of the DCNNIC models were significantly non-predictive of primate performance. We found that this prediction failure was not accounted for by simple image attributes, nor was it rescued by simple model modifications. These results show that current DCNNIC models cannot account for the image-level behavioral patterns of primates, even when images are not optimized to be adversarial. This suggests that new ANN models are needed to more precisely capture the neural mechanisms underlying primate object vision, and that high-resolution, large-scale behavioral metrics could serve as a strong constraint for discovering such models.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Transcranial alternating current stimulation modulates auditory temporal resolution in elderly people</title>

	<description>Recent research provides evidence for a functional role of brain oscillations for perception. For example, auditory temporal resolution seems to be linked to individual gamma frequency of auditory cortex. Individual gamma frequency not only correlates with performance in between-channel gap detection tasks but can be modulated via auditory transcranial alternating current stimulation. Modulation of individual gamma frequency is accompanied by an improvement in gap detection performance. Aging changes electrophysiological frequency components and sensory processing mechanisms. Therefore, we conducted a study to investigate the link between individual gamma frequency and gap detection performance in elderly people using auditory transcranial alternating current stimulation. In a within-subject design, nine participants were electrically stimulated with two individualized transcranial alternating current stimulation frequencies: 3 Hz above their individual gamma frequency (experimental condition) and 4 Hz below their individual gamma frequency (control condition) while they were performing a between-channel gap detection task. As expected, individual gamma frequencies correlated significantly with gap detection performance at baseline and in the experimental condition, transcranial alternating current stimulation modulated gap detection performance. In the control condition, stimulation did not modulate gap detection performance. In addition, in elderly, the effect of transcranial alternating current stimulation on auditory temporal resolution seems to be dependent on endogenous frequencies in auditory cortex: elderlies with slower individual gamma frequencies and lower auditory temporal resolution profit from auditory transcranial alternating current stimulation and show increased gap detection performance during stimulation. Our results strongly suggest individualized transcranial alternating current stimulation protocols for successful modulation of performance.</description>

	<description>I elaborate binocular geometry with a novel eye model that incorporates the fovea's temporalward displacement and the cornea and the lens' misalignment. The formulated binocular correspondence results in longitudinal horopters that are conic sections resembling empirical horopters. When the eye model's asymmetry parameters' range is that which is observed in healthy eyes, abathic distance also falls within its experimentally observed range. This range in abathic distance is similar to that of the vergence resting position distance. Further, the conic's orientation is specified by the eyes' version angle, integrating binocular geometry with eye movement. This integration presents the possibility for modeling 3D perceptual stability during physiological eye movements.</description>

	<description>A fundamental goal in neuroscience is to uncover common principles by which different modalities of information are processed. In the mammalian brain, thalamus acts as the essential hub for forebrain circuits handling inputs from sensory, motor, limbic, and cognitive pathways. Whether thalamus imposes common transformations on each of these modalities is unknown. Molecular characterization offers a principled approach to revealing the organization of thalamus. Using near-comprehensive and projection-specific transcriptomic sequencing, we found that almost all thalamic nuclei fit into one of three profiles. These profiles lie on a single axis of genetic variance which is aligned with the mediolateral spatial axis of thalamus. Genes defining this axis of variance include receptors and ion channels, providing a systematic diversification of input/output transformations across the topography of thalamus. Single cell transcriptional profiling revealed graded heterogeneity within individual thalamic nuclei, demonstrating that a spectrum of cell types and potentially diverse input/output transforms exist within a given thalamic nucleus. Together, our data argue for an archetypal organization of pathways serving diverse input modalities, and provides a comprehensive organizational scheme for thalamus.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Class I E3 Ubiquitin Ligase TRIM67 Modulates Brain Development and Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/241331v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Specific class I members of the TRIM family of E3 ubiquitin ligases have been implicated in neuronal development from invertebrates to mammals. The single invertebrate class I TRIM and mammalian TRIM9 regulate axon branching and guidance in response to the axon guidance cue netrin-1, whereas mammalian TRIM46 establishes the axon initial segment. In humans, mutations in TRIM1 and TRIM18 are implicated in Optiz Syndrome, characterized by midline defects and often mild intellectual disability. TRIM67 is the most evolutionarily conserved vertebrate class I TRIM, yet is the least studied. Here we show that TRIM67 interacts with both its closest paralog TRIM9 and the netrin receptor DCC, and is differentially enriched in specific brain regions at specific developmental points. We describe the anatomical and behavioral consequences of deletion of murine Trim67. While viable, mice lacking Trim67 display severe impairments in spatial memory, cognitive flexibility, social novelty preference, muscle function and sensorimotor gating. Additionally, they exhibit abnormal anatomy of several brain regions, including the hippocampus, striatum and thalamus, as well as the corpus callosum. This study demonstrates the necessity for TRIM67 in appropriate brain development and function.</description>

	<description>Manipulating the dynamics of neural systems through targeted stimulation is a frontier of research and clinical neuroscience; however, the control schemes considered for neural systems are mismatched for the unique needs of manipulating neural dynamics. An appropriate control method should respect the variability in neural systems, incorporating moment to moment &quot;input&quot; to the neural dynamics and behaving based on the current neural state, irrespective of the past trajectory. We propose such a controller under a nonlinear state-space feedback framework that steers one dynamical system to function as through it were another dynamical system entirely. This &quot;myopic&quot; controller is formulated through a novel variant of a model reference control cost that manipulates dynamics in a step-wise manner, omitting the need to pre-calculate a rigid and computationally costly neural feedback control solution. To demonstrate the breadth of this control's utility, two examples with distinctly different applications in neuroscience are studied. First an unhealthy motor-like system containing an unwanted beta-oscillation spiral attractor is controlled to function as a healthy motor system, a relevant clinical example for neurological disorders. Second, we show the myopic control's utility to probe the causal dynamics of cognitive processes by transforming a winner-take-all decision-making system to operate as a robust neural integrator of evidence.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Unconsciously Implanted Visuoauditory Memory in the Presence of Cholecystokinin Retrieved in Behavioral Contexts</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/241141v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/241141v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We investigated whether visuoauditory association can be artificially implanted in rodents and then retrieved in a behaviorally relevant context. Rats were trained to approach the left or right hole of a behavioral apparatus to retrieve a reward depending on the side of electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex (EAC) they received and mice were fear-conditioned to EAC. Next, an irrelevant visual stimulus (VS) was repeatedly paired with EAC in the presence of cholecystokinin (CCK) or with activation of terminals of entorhinal CCK neurons in the auditory cortex. In subsequent behavioral testing with VS, rats approached the hole associated with reward availability and mice showed a freezing response to the VS. A CCK antagonist blocked the establishment of visuoauditory association, whereas a CCK agonist rescued the deficit of association. Our findings provide a scientific foundation for &quot;memory implantation&quot; and indicate that CCK is the switching chemical for formation of visuoauditory association.</description>

	<description>In primates, proximal cortical areas are interconnected via within-cortex ''intrinsic'' pathway, whereas distant areas are connected via ''extrinsic'' white matter pathway. It is not well known how cortical areas are interconnected in small-brained mammals like rodents. In this study, we systematically analyzed the data of Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas to answer this question and found that the ipsilateral cortical connections in mice are almost exclusively contained within the grey matter with the exception of the retrosplenial area. We analyzed the layer-specific distribution of axonal projections within the grey matter using Cortical Box method and obtained the following results. First, widespread axonal projections were observed in both upper and lower layers in the vicinity of injections, whereas highly specific ''point-to-point'' projections were observed toward remote areas. Second, such long-range projections were predominantly aligned in the anteromedial-posterolateral direction. Third, in majority of these projections, the connecting axons traveled through layer 6. Finally, the projections from the primary and higher order areas to distant targets preferentially terminated in the middle and superficial layers, respectively, suggesting hierarchical connections similar to those of primates. Overall, our study suggests the conserved nature of neocortical organization across species despite conspicuous differences in wiring strategy.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Disrupted structural connectivity in Pediatric Bipolar Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/241091v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/241091v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) has been linked to disrupted structural and functional connectivity between prefrontal networks and limbic brain regions. Studies of patients with pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) can help elucidate the developmental origins of altered structural connectivity underlying BD and provide novel insights into the aetiology of BD. Methods: The network properties of whole-brain structural connectomes, constructed using probabilistic tractography and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), were compared between groups of un-medicated PBD patients with psychosis euthymic and matched healthy controls. Specific network measures were correlated with neurocognitive and psychotic scores, thus providing a comprehensive characterization of topological brain changes underlying PBD. Results: Widespread changes in the structural connectivity of PBD patients were found in both cortical and subcortical networks, notably affecting the orbitofrontal cortex, frontal gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampus. Graph theoretical analysis revealed that PBD connectomes have fewer hubs, weaker rich club organization, different modular structure and increased network asymmetries compared to healthy participants. Moreover, patients' IQ and psychotic symptoms significantly correlated with the local efficiency of the orbitofrontal cortex. Conclusion: The results show that PBD is associated with significant changes in structural network topology, which may indicate a reduced capacity for balanced whole-brain integration of information. Localized network changes involve brain regions associated with emotional processing and regulation, as well as cognitive processing, some of which correlate with cognitive and clinical measures. These findings suggest that structural brain connectivity changes may contribute to the deficits in emotion processing and regulation found in PBD.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Firing rate equations require a spike synchrony mechanism to correctly describe fast oscillations in inhibitory networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005881</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Federico Devalle, Alex Roxin, Ernest Montbrió&lt;/p&gt;

Recurrently coupled networks of inhibitory neurons robustly generate oscillations in the gamma band. Nonetheless, the corresponding Wilson-Cowan type firing rate equation for such an inhibitory population does not generate such oscillations without an explicit time delay. We show that this discrepancy is due to a voltage-dependent spike-synchronization mechanism inherent in networks of spiking neurons which is not captured by standard firing rate equations. Here we investigate an exact low-dimensional description for a network of heterogeneous canonical Class 1 inhibitory neurons which includes the sub-threshold dynamics crucial for generating synchronous states. In the limit of slow synaptic kinetics the spike-synchrony mechanism is suppressed and the standard Wilson-Cowan equations are formally recovered as long as external inputs are also slow. However, even in this limit synchronous spiking can be elicited by inputs which fluctuate on a time-scale of the membrane time-constant of the neurons. Our meanfield equations therefore represent an extension of the standard Wilson-Cowan equations in which spike synchrony is also correctly described.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oZ1Gs-satsc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Deep Architectures for Automated Seizure Detection in Scalp EEGs. (arXiv:1712.09776v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Automated seizure detection using clinical electroencephalograms is a
challenging machine learning problem because the multichannel signal often has
an extremely low signal to noise ratio. Events of interest such as seizures are
easily confused with signal artifacts (e.g, eye movements) or benign variants
(e.g., slowing). Commercially available systems suffer from unacceptably high
false alarm rates. Deep learning algorithms that employ high dimensional models
have not previously been effective due to the lack of big data resources. In
this paper, we use the TUH EEG Seizure Corpus to evaluate a variety of hybrid
deep structures including Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term
Memory Networks. We introduce a novel recurrent convolutional architecture that
delivers 30% sensitivity at 7 false alarms per 24 hours. We have also evaluated
our system on a held-out evaluation set based on the Duke University Seizure
Corpus and demonstrate that performance trends are similar to the TUH EEG
Seizure Corpus. This is a significant finding because the Duke corpus was
collected with different instrumentation and at different hospitals. Our work
shows that deep learning architectures that integrate spatial and temporal
contexts are critical to achieving state of the art performance and will enable
a new generation of clinically-acceptable technology.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: A clinical decision support tool that automatically interprets
EEGs can reduce time to diagnosis and enhance real-time applications such as
ICU monitoring. Clinicians have indicated that a sensitivity of 95% with a
specificity below 5% was the minimum requirement for clinical acceptance. We
propose a highperformance classification system based on principles of big data
and machine learning. Methods: A hybrid machine learning system that uses
hidden Markov models (HMM) for sequential decoding and deep learning networks
for postprocessing is proposed. These algorithms were trained and evaluated
using the TUH EEG Corpus, which is the world's largest publicly available
database of clinical EEG data. Results: Our approach delivers a sensitivity
above 90% while maintaining a specificity below 5%. This system detects three
events of clinical interest: (1) spike and/or sharp waves, (2) periodic
lateralized epileptiform discharges, (3) generalized periodic epileptiform
discharges. It also detects three events used to model background noise: (1)
artifacts, (2) eye movement (3) background. Conclusions: A hybrid HMM/deep
learning system can deliver a low false alarm rate on EEG event detection,
making automated analysis a viable option for clinicians. Significance: The TUH
EEG Corpus enables application of highly data consumptive machine learning
algorithms to EEG analysis. Performance is approaching clinical acceptance for
real-time applications.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Integrated information theory provides a mathematical framework to fully
characterize the cause-effect structure of a physical system. Here, we
introduce PyPhi, a Python software package that implements this framework for
causal analysis and unfolds the full cause-effect structure of discrete
dynamical systems of binary elements. The software allows users to easily study
these structures, serves as an up-to-date reference implementation of the
formalisms of integrated information theory, and has been applied in research
on complexity, emergence, and certain biological questions. We first provide an
overview of the main algorithm and demonstrate PyPhi's functionality in the
course of analyzing an example system, and then describe details of the
algorithm's design and implementation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyPhi can be installed with Python's package manager via the command 'pip
install pyphi' on Linux and macOS systems equipped with Python 3.4 or higher.
PyPhi is open-source and licensed under the GPLv3; the source code is hosted on
GitHub at https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi . Comprehensive and
continually-updated documentation is available at https://pyphi.readthedocs.io/

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Analysis of BOLD fMRI Signal Preprocessing Pipeline on Different Datasets while Reducing False Positive Rates. (arXiv:1712.09479v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The technology of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) based on Blood
Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal has been widely used in clinical
treatments and brain function researches. The BOLD signal has to be
preprocessed before being analyzed using either functional connectivity
measurements or statistical methods. Current researches show that data
preprocessing steps may influence the results of analysis, yet there is no
consensus on preprocessing method. In this paper, an evaluation method is
proposed for analyzing the preprocessing pipeline of resting state BOLD fMRI
(rs-BOLD fMRI) data under putative task experiment designs to cast some lights
on the preprocessing stage, covering both first and second level analysis. The
choices of preprocessing parameters and steps are altered to investigate
preprocessing pipelines while observing statistical analysis results, trying to
reduce false positives as reported by Eklund et al. in their 2016 PNAS paper.
All of the experiment data are separated into 7 datasets, consisting of 220
healthy control samples and 136 patient data that are from 38 incomplete Spinal
Cord Injury (SCI) patients and 16 Cerebral Stroke (CS) patients, including
multiple scans of some patients at different time. These data were acquired
from two different MRI scanners, which may cause difference in analysis
results. The evaluation result shows that it has little effect to change
parameters in each steps of the classical preprocessing pipeline, which
consists head motion correction, normalization and smoothing. Removing time
points and the following detrend step can reduce false positives. However,
covariates regression and filtering has complicated effects on the data. Note
that for single subject analysis, false positives declined consistently after
filtering. The result of patient data and healthy controls data which are
scanned under the same machine with ...

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We show that dynamical gain modulation of neurons' stimulus response is
described as an information-theoretic cycle that generates entropy associated
with the stimulus-related activity from entropy produced by the modulation. To
articulate this theory, we describe stimulus-evoked activity of a neural
population based on the maximum entropy principle with constraints on two types
of overlapping activities, one that is controlled by stimulus conditions and
the other, termed internal activity, that is regulated internally in an
organism. We demonstrate that modulation of the internal activity realises gain
control of stimulus response, and controls stimulus information. A cycle of
neural dynamics is then introduced to model information processing by the
neurons during which the stimulus information is dynamically enhanced by the
internal gain-modulation mechanism. Based on the conservation law for entropy
production, we demonstrate that the cycle generates entropy ascribed to the
stimulus-related activity using entropy supplied by the internal mechanism,
analogously to a heat engine that produces work from heat. We provide an
efficient cycle that achieves the highest entropic efficiency to retain the
stimulus information. The theory allows us to quantify efficiency of the
internal computation and its theoretical limit.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Homozygous Boricua TBCK Mutation Causes Neurodegeneration and Aberrant Autophagy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25130</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Autosomal recessive mutations in &lt;em&gt;TBCK&lt;/em&gt; cause intellectual disability of variable severity. Although the physiologic function of TBCK remains unclear, loss-of-function mutations are associated with inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. As mTORC1 signaling is known to regulate autophagy, we hypothesized that TBCK-encephalopathy patients with a neurodegenerative course have defects in autophagic-lysosomal dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Children (n=8) of Puerto Rican (Boricua) descent affected with homozygous &lt;em&gt;TBCK&lt;/em&gt; p.R126X mutations underwent extensive neurological phenotyping and neurophysiological studies. We quantified autophagosome content in TBCK&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; patient-derived fibroblasts by immunostaining and assayed autophagic markers by Western assay. Free sialylated oligosaccharide profiles were assayed in patient's urine and fibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The neurologic phenotype of children with &lt;em&gt;TBCK&lt;/em&gt; p.R126X mutations, which we call TBCK-encephaloneuronopathy (TBCKE), include congenital hypotonia, progressive motor neuronopathy, leukoencephalopathy and epilepsy. Systemic features include coarse facies, dyslipidemia, and osteoporosis. TBCK&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; fibroblasts &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; exhibit increased numbers of LC3+ autophagosomes, and increased autophagic flux by immunoblots. Free oligosaccharide profiles in fibroblasts and urine of TBCKE patients differ from control fibroblasts and are ameliorated by treatment with the mTORC1 activator leucine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: TBCKE is a clinically distinguishable syndrome with progressive central and peripheral nervous system dysfunction, consistently seen in patients with the p.R126X mutation. We provide evidence that inappropriate autophagy in the absence of cellular stressors may play a role in this disorder, and that mTORC1 activation may ameliorate the autophagic-lysosomal system dysfunction. Free oligosaccharide profiles could serve as a novel biomarker for this disorder as well as a tool to evaluate potential therapeutic interventions. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Vasodilator Dysfunction and Oligodendrocyte Dysmaturation in Aging White Matter</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Microvascular brain injury (mVBI) is a common pathologic correlate of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) that leads to white matter injury (WMI). VCID appears to arise from chronic recurrent white matter ischemia that triggers oxidative stress and an increase in total oligodendrocyte lineage cells. We hypothesized that mVBI involves vasodilator dysfunction of white matter penetrating arterioles and aberrant oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) responses to WMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We analyzed cases of mVBI with low Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change in prefrontal cortex WM from rapid autopsies in a population-based cohort where VCID frequently occurs. Arteriolar vasodilator function was quantified by videomicroscopy. OPC maturation was quantified using lineage specific markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: ACh-mediated arteriolar dilation in mVBI was significantly reduced in WM penetrators relative to pial arterioles. Astrogliosis-defined WMI was positively associated with increased OPCs and was negatively associated with decreased mature oligodendrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Selectively impaired vasodilator function of WM penetrating arterioles in mVBI occurs in association with aberrant differentiation of OPCs in WMI, which supports that myelination disturbances in VCID are related to disrupted maturation of myelinating oligodendrocytes.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective. Single, large-scale deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are a common cause of mitochondrial disease. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the genetic defect and molecular phenotype to improve understanding of pathogenic mechanisms associated with single, large-scale mtDNA deletions in skeletal muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods. We investigated 23 muscle biopsies taken from adult patients (6 males/17 females with a mean age of 43y) with characterised single, large-scale mtDNA deletions. Mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in skeletal muscle biopsies was quantified by immunoreactivity levels for complex I and complex IV proteins. Single muscle fibres with varying degrees of deficiency were selected from six patient biopsies for determination of mtDNA deletion level and copy number by quantitative qPCR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results. We have defined three ‘classes' of single, large-scale deletion with distinct patterns of mitochondrial deficiency, determined by the size and location of the deletion. Single fibre analyses showed that fibres with greater respiratory chain deficiency harboured higher levels of mtDNA deletion with an increase in total mtDNA copy number. For the first time, we have demonstrated that threshold levels for complex I and complex IV deficiency differ based on deletion class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation. Combining genetic and immunofluorescent assays, we conclude that thresholds for complex I and complex IV deficiency are modulated by the deletion of complex-specific protein-encoding genes. Furthermore, removal of mt-tRNA genes impacts specific complexes only at high deletion levels, when complex-specific protein-encoding genes remain. These novel findings provide valuable insight into the pathogenic mechanisms associated with these mutations. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Myeloid cell plasticity in the evolution of central nervous system autoimmunity</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Myeloid cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, are a prominent component of central nervous system (CNS) infiltrates during multiple sclerosis (MS) and the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Although myeloid cells are generally thought to be pro-inflammatory, alternatively-polarized subsets can serve non-inflammatory and/or reparative functions. Here we investigate the heterogeneity and biological properties of myeloid cells during central nervous system autoimmunity. Methods: Myeloid cell phenotypes in chronic active MS lesions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In addition, immune cells were isolated from the CNS during exacerbations and remissions of EAE and characterized by flow cytometric, genetic and functional assays. Results: Myeloid cells expressing iNOS, indicative of a pro-inflammatory phenotype, were detected in the actively demyelinating rim of chronic active MS lesions, whereas macrophages expressing mannose receptor (CD206), a marker of alternatively-polarized human myeloid cells, were enriched in the quiescent lesion core. During EAE, CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells, as well as microglia, shifted from expression of pro- to non-inflammatory markers immediately prior to clinical remissions. Murine CNS myeloid cells expressing the alternative lineage marker arginase-1 (Arg1) were partially derived from iNOS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; precursors and were deficient in activating encephalitogenic T cells compared with their Arg1&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; counterparts. Interpretation: These observations demonstrate the heterogeneity of CNS myeloid cells, their evolution during the course of autoimmune demyelinating disease, and their plasticity on the single cell level. Future therapeutic strategies for disease modification in individuals with MS may be focused on accelerating the transition of CNS myeloid cells from a pro- to a non-inflammatory phenotype.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Local motion adaptation enhances the representation of spatial structure at EMD arrays</title>

Neuronal representation and extraction of spatial information are essential for behavioral control. For flying insects, a plausible way to gain spatial information is to exploit distance-dependent optic flow that is generated during translational self-motion. Optic flow is computed by arrays of local motion detectors retinotopically arranged in the second neuropile layer of the insect visual system. These motion detectors have adaptive response characteristics, i.e. their responses to motion with a constant or only slowly changing velocity decrease, while their sensitivity to rapid velocity changes is maintained or even increases. We analyzed by a modeling approach how motion adaptation affects signal representation at the output of arrays of motion detectors during simulated flight in artificial and natural 3D environments. We focused on translational flight, because spatial information is only contained in the optic flow induced by translational locomotion. Indeed, flies, bees and other insects segregate their flight into relatively long intersaccadic translational flight sections interspersed with brief and rapid saccadic turns, presumably to maximize periods of translation (80% of the flight). With a novel adaptive model of the insect visual motion pathway we could show that the motion detector responses to background structures of cluttered environments are largely attenuated as a consequence of motion adaptation, while responses to foreground objects stay constant or even increase. This conclusion even holds under the dynamic flight conditions of insects.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/M2ZXTJ0hcKU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Due to the recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, it becomes possible to directly analyze microbial communities in human body and environment. To understand how microbial communities adapt, develop, and interact with the human body and the surrounding environment, one of the fundamental challenges is to infer the interactions among different microbes. However, due to the compositional and high-dimensional nature of microbial data, statistical inference cannot offer reliable results. Consequently, new approaches that can accurately and robustly estimate the associations (putative interactions) among microbes are needed to analyze such compositional and high-dimensional data. We propose a novel framework called Microbial Prior Lasso (MPLasso) which integrates graph learning algorithm with microbial co-occurrences and associations obtained from scientific literature by using automated text mining. We show that MPLasso outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, microbial network recovery rate, and reproducibility. Furthermore, the association networks we obtain from the Human Microbiome Project datasets show credible results when compared against laboratory data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YyG4OvVgNL0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cells decode information of signaling activation at a scale of tens of minutes by downstream gene expression with a scale of hours to days, leading to cell fate decisions such as cell differentiation. However, no system identification method with such different time scales exists. Here we used compressed sensing technology and developed a system identification method using data of different time scales by recovering signals of missing time points. We measured phosphorylation of ERK and CREB, immediate early gene expression products, and mRNAs of decoder genes for neurite elongation in PC12 cell differentiation and performed system identification, revealing the input–output relationships between signaling and gene expression with sensitivity such as graded or switch-like response and with time delay and gain, representing signal transfer efficiency. We predicted and validated the identified system using pharmacological perturbation. Thus, we provide a versatile method for system identification using data with different time scales.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w9dIuKnCqY0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Peptide-protein interactions contribute a significant fraction of the protein-protein interactome. Accurate modeling of these interactions is challenging due to the vast conformational space associated with interactions of highly flexible peptides with large receptor surfaces. To address this challenge we developed a fragment based high-resolution peptide-protein docking protocol. By streamlining the Rosetta fragment picker for accurate peptide fragment ensemble generation, the PIPER docking algorithm for exhaustive fragment-receptor rigid-body docking and Rosetta FlexPepDock for flexible full-atom refinement of PIPER docked models, we successfully addressed the challenge of accurate and efficient global peptide-protein docking at high-resolution with remarkable accuracy, as validated on a small but representative set of peptide-protein complex structures well resolved by X-ray crystallography. Our approach opens up the way to high-resolution modeling of many more peptide-protein interactions and to the detailed study of peptide-protein association in general. PIPER-FlexPepDock is freely available to the academic community as a server at http://piperfpd.furmanlab.cs.huji.ac.il.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hYhEtP3vh8E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In computational biology, modeling is a fundamental tool for formulating, analyzing and predicting complex phenomena. Most neuron models, however, are designed to reproduce certain small sets of empirical data. Hence their outcome is usually not compatible or comparable with other models or datasets, making it unclear how widely applicable such models are. In this study, we investigate these aspects of modeling, namely credibility and generalizability, with a specific focus on auditory neurons involved in the localization of sound sources. The primary cues for binaural sound localization are comprised of interaural time and level differences (ITD/ILD), which are the timing and intensity differences of the sound waves arriving at the two ears. The lateral superior olive (LSO) in the auditory brainstem is one of the locations where such acoustic information is first computed. An LSO neuron receives temporally structured excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs that are driven by ipsi- and contralateral sound stimuli, respectively, and changes its spike rate according to binaural acoustic differences. Here we examine seven contemporary models of LSO neurons with different levels of biophysical complexity, from predominantly functional ones (‘shot-noise’ models) to those with more detailed physiological components (variations of integrate-and-fire and Hodgkin-Huxley-type). These models, calibrated to reproduce known monaural and binaural characteristics of LSO, generate largely similar results to each other in simulating ITD and ILD coding. Our comparisons of physiological detail, computational efficiency, predictive performances, and further expandability of the models demonstrate (1) that the simplistic, functional LSO models are suitable for applications where low computational costs and mathematical transparency are needed, (2) that more complex models with detailed membrane potential dynamics are necessary for simulation studies where sub-neuronal nonlinear processes play important roles, and (3) that, for general purposes, intermediate models might be a reasonable compromise between simplicity and biological plausibility.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1q5zmINJAsQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Mass cytometry (CyTOF) has greatly expanded the capability of cytometry. It is now easy to generate multiple CyTOF samples in a single study, with each sample containing single-cell measurement on 50 markers for more than hundreds of thousands of cells. Current methods do not adequately address the issues concerning combining multiple samples for subpopulation discovery, and these issues can be quickly and dramatically amplified with increasing number of samples. To overcome this limitation, we developed Partition-Assisted Clustering and Multiple Alignments of Networks (PAC-MAN) for the fast automatic identification of cell populations in CyTOF data closely matching that of expert manual-discovery, and for alignments between subpopulations across samples to define dataset-level cellular states. PAC-MAN is computationally efficient, allowing the management of very large CyTOF datasets, which are increasingly common in clinical studies and cancer studies that monitor various tissue samples for each subject.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aHhVhLnyCbQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anatomical studies demonstrate that brain reformats input information to
generate reliable responses for performing computations. However, it remains
unclear how neural circuits encode complex spatio-temporal patterns. We show
that neural dynamics are strongly influenced by the phase alignment between the
input and the spontaneous chaotic activity. Input structuring along the
dominant chaotic projections causes the chaotic trajectories to become stable
channels (or attractors), hence, improving the computational capability of a
recurrent network. Using mean field analysis, we derive the impact of input
structuring on the overall stability of attractors formed. Our results indicate
that input alignment determines the extent of intrinsic noise suppression and
hence, alters the attractor state stability, thereby controlling the network's
inference ability.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Geometric Analysis of Synchronization in Neuronal Networks with Global Inhibition and Coupling Delays. (arXiv:1712.08547v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We study synaptically coupled neuronal networks to identify the role of
coupling delays in network's synchronized behaviors. We consider a network of
excitable, relaxation oscillator neurons where two distinct populations, one
excitatory and one inhibitory, are coupled and interact with each other. The
excitatory population is uncoupled, while the inhibitory population is tightly
coupled. A geometric singular perturbation analysis yields existence and
stability conditions for synchronization states under different firing patterns
between the two populations, along with formulas for the periods of such
synchronous solutions. Our results demonstrate that the presence of coupling
delays in the network promotes synchronization. Numerical simulations are
conducted to supplement and validate analytical results. We show the results
carry over to a model for spindle sleep rhythms in thalamocortical networks,
one of the biological systems which motivated our study. The analysis helps to
explain how coupling delays in either excitatory or inhibitory synapses
contribute to producing synchronized rhythms.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Can we hear the sound of our brain? Is there any technique which can enable
us to hear the neuro-electrical impulses originating from the different lobes
of brain? The answer to all these questions is YES. In this paper we present a
novel method with which we can sonify the Electroencephalogram (EEG) data
recorded in rest state as well as under the influence of a simplest acoustical
stimuli - a tanpura drone. The tanpura drone has a very simple yet very complex
acoustic features, which is generally used for creation of an ambiance during a
musical performance. Hence, for this pilot project we chose to study the
correlation between a simple acoustic stimuli (tanpura drone) and sonified EEG
data. Till date, there have been no study which deals with the direct
correlation between a bio-signal and its acoustic counterpart and how that
correlation varies under the influence of different types of stimuli. This is
the first of its kind study which bridges this gap and looks for a direct
correlation between music signal and EEG data using a robust mathematical
microscope called Multifractal Detrended Cross Correlation Analysis (MFDXA).
For this, we took EEG data of 10 participants in 2 min 'rest state' (i.e. with
white noise) and in 2 min 'tanpura drone' (musical stimulus) listening
condition. Next, the EEG signals from different electrodes were sonified and
MFDXA technique was used to assess the degree of correlation (or the cross
correlation coefficient) between tanpura signal and EEG signals. The variation
of {\gamma}x for different lobes during the course of the experiment also
provides major interesting new information. Only music stimuli has the ability
to engage several areas of the brain significantly unlike other stimuli (which
engages specific domains only).

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Construction and Evaluation of Hierarchical Parcellation of the Brain using fMRI with Prewhitening. (arXiv:1712.08180v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08180</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain atlases are a ubiquitous tool used for analyzing and interpreting brain
imaging datasets. Traditionally, brain atlases divided the brain into regions
separated by anatomical landmarks. In the last decade, several attempts have
been made to parcellate the brain into regions with distinct functional
activity using fMRI. To construct a brain atlas using fMRI, data driven
algorithms are used to group voxels with similar functional activity together
to form regions. Hierarchical clustering is one parcellation method that has
been used for functional parcellation of the brain, resulting in parcellations
that align well with cytoarchitectonic divisions of the brain. However, few
rigorous data driven evaluations of the method have been performed. Moreover,
the effect of removing autocorrelation trends from fMRI time series
(prewhitening) on the structure of the resultant atlas has not been previously
explored. In this paper, we use hierarchical clustering to produce functional
parcellations of the brain using hierarchical clustering. We use both
prewhitened and raw fMRI time series to construct the atlas. The resultant
atlases were then evaluated for their homogeneity, separation between regions,
reproducibility across subjects, and reproducibility across scans.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mechanistic modeling quantifies the influence of tumor growth kinetics on the response to anti-angiogenic treatment</title>

Tumors exploit angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature, in order to obtain nutrients required for continued growth and proliferation. Targeting factors that regulate angiogenesis, including the potent promoter vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is therefore an attractive strategy for inhibiting tumor growth. Computational modeling can be used to identify tumor-specific properties that influence the response to anti-angiogenic strategies. Here, we build on our previous systems biology model of VEGF transport and kinetics in tumor-bearing mice to include a tumor compartment whose volume depends on the “angiogenic signal” produced when VEGF binds to its receptors on tumor endothelial cells. We trained and validated the model using published &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; measurements of xenograft tumor volume, producing a model that accurately predicts the tumor’s response to anti-angiogenic treatment. We applied the model to investigate how tumor growth kinetics influence the response to anti-angiogenic treatment targeting VEGF. Based on multivariate regression analysis, we found that certain intrinsic kinetic parameters that characterize the growth of tumors could successfully predict response to anti-VEGF treatment, the reduction in tumor volume. Lastly, we use the trained model to predict the response to anti-VEGF therapy for tumors expressing different levels of VEGF receptors. The model predicts that certain tumors are more sensitive to treatment than others, and the response to treatment shows a nonlinear dependence on the VEGF receptor expression. Overall, this model is a useful tool for predicting how tumors will respond to anti-VEGF treatment, and it complements pre-clinical &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; mouse studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Fxm9nfQQELA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Theoretical perspectives on central chemosensitivity: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive neurons in the locus coeruleus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria C. Quintero, Robert W. Putnam, Juan M. Cordovez&lt;/p&gt;

Central chemoreceptors are highly sensitive neurons that respond to changes in pH and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels. An increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; typically reflects a rise in the firing rate of these neurons, which stimulates an increase in ventilation. Here, we present an ionic current model that reproduces the basic electrophysiological activity of individual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive neurons from the locus coeruleus (LC). We used this model to explore chemoreceptor discharge patterns in response to electrical and chemical stimuli. The modeled neurons showed both stimulus-evoked activity and spontaneous activity under physiological parameters. Neuronal responses to electrical and chemical stimulation showed specific firing patterns of spike frequency adaptation, postinhibitory rebound, and post-stimulation recovery. Conversely, the response to chemical stimulation alone (based on physiological CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; changes), in the absence of external depolarizing stimulation, showed no signs of postinhibitory rebound or post-stimulation recovery, and no depolarizing sag. A sensitivity index for the firing-rate response to the different stimuli revealed that the contribution of an applied stimulus current exceeded that of the chemical signals. The firing-rate response increased indefinitely with injected depolarizing current, but reached saturation with chemical stimuli. Our computational model reproduced the regular pacemaker-like spiking pattern, action potential shape, and most of the membrane properties that characterize CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive neurons from the locus coeruleus. This validates the model and highlights its potential as a tool for studying the cellular mechanisms underlying the altered central chemosensitivity present in a variety of disorders such as sudden infant death syndrome, depression, and anxiety. In addition, the model results suggest that small external electrical signals play a greater role in determining the chemosensitive response to changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; than previously thought. This highlights the importance of considering electrical synaptic transmission in studies of intrinsic chemosensitivity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oQuj4KpDgu4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Synaptic plasticity – the directed modulation of synaptic connections by specific activity histories or physiological signals – is believed to be a major mechanism for the modification of neuronal network function. This belief, however, has a ‘flip side’: the supposition that synapses do not change spontaneously in manners unrelated to such signals. Contrary to this supposition, recent studies reveal that synapses do change spontaneously, and to a fairly large extent. Here we review experimental results on spontaneous synaptic remodeling, its relative contributions to total synaptic remodeling, its statistical characteristics, and its physiological importance.</description>

	<description>Exposure to early adverse experiences is associated with an increased risk of developing social dysfunction later in life. Shin et al. show that Drd3 signaling and its corresponding effects on neural activity in the LS are both necessary and sufficient to cause early life stress-induced social abnormalities in adulthood.</description>

Metabolic, neuroradiological, and genetic findings are reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25110-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty-seven individuals (39 previously unreported) from 59 families were included (age range = 5 days–33.4 years, median age = 9 years). A total of 41 different &lt;em&gt;SERAC1&lt;/em&gt; variants were identified, including 20 that have not been reported before. With the exception of 2 families with a milder phenotype, all affected individuals showed a strikingly homogeneous phenotype and time course. Severe, reversible neonatal liver dysfunction and hypoglycemia were seen in &amp;gt;40% of all cases. Starting at a median age of 6 months, muscular hypotonia (91%) was seen, followed by progressive spasticity (82%, median onset = 15 months) and dystonia (82%, 18 months). The majority of affected individuals never learned to walk (68%). Seventy-nine percent suffered hearing loss, 58% never learned to speak, and nearly all had significant intellectual disability (88%). Magnetic resonance imaging features were accordingly homogenous, with bilateral basal ganglia involvement (98%); the characteristic “putaminal eye” was seen in 53%. The urinary marker 3-methylglutaconic aciduria was present in virtually all patients (98%). Supportive treatment focused on spasticity and drooling, and was effective in the individuals treated; hearing aids or cochlear implants did not improve communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Note the bundles of descending cortical axons, and the ramifications and small axonal boutons scattered within the striatum. A few large dendrites covered with spines are seen in the upper part of the field, due to leakage of virus to transfect some medium spiny neurons in the striatum as well. In rats with brain iron deficiency, these synaptic terminals become hypersensitive in their ability to release glutamate upon direct light stimulation. See Yepes et al., p. 951 for details.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Ischemic core thresholds change with time to reperfusion: A case control study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25109</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25109-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aimed to identify whether acute ischemic stroke patients with known complete reperfusion after thrombectomy had the same baseline computed tomography perfusion (CTP) ischemic core threshold to predict infarction as thrombolysis patients with complete reperfusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25109-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who underwent thrombectomy were matched by age, clinical severity, occlusion location, and baseline perfusion lesion volume to patients who were treated with intravenous alteplase alone from the International Stroke Perfusion Imaging Registry. A pixel-based analysis of coregistered pretreatment CTP and 24-hour diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was then undertaken to define the optimum CTP thresholds for the ischemic core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25109-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 132 eligible thrombectomy patients and 132 matched controls treated with alteplase alone. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (median, 15; interquartile range [IQR], 11–19), age (median, 65; IQR, 59–80), and time to intravenous treatment (median, 153 minutes; IQR, 82–315) were well matched (all &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Despite similar baseline CTP ischemic core volumes using the previously validated measure (relative cerebral blood flow [rCBF], &amp;lt;30%), thrombectomy patients had a smaller median 24-hour infarct core of 17.3ml (IQR, 11.3–32.8) versus 24.3ml (IQR, 16.7–42.2; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.011) in alteplase-treated controls. As a result, the optimal threshold to define the ischemic core in thrombectomy patients was rCBF &amp;lt;20% (area under the curve [AUC], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84, 0.94), whereas in alteplase controls the optimal ischemic core threshold remained rCBF &amp;lt;30% (AUC, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77, 0.85).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25109-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrombectomy salvaged tissue with lower CBF, likely attributed to earlier reperfusion. For patients who achieve rapid reperfusion, a stricter rCBF threshold to estimate the ischemic core should be considered. Ann Neurol 2017;82:995–1003&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Boys in a famous choir: Singing and ticcing</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This informal observational study on the tic prevalence in 40 young singers was carried out during a public concert of Bach's Christmas Oratorio. Tics were highly prevalent (present in 35% = 14 boys). Given the possibility of an overrepresentation of perioral tics in this group of highly achieving young vocal artists, one might speculate that there is a relationship between the ability of the motor system to produce a surplus of movements (tics) and high performance (exquisite singing). Despite the unusual study design, with all its limitations, our observations strengthen the view that tics may be related to motor learning. However, alternative explanations, for example, that repetitive motor performance or personality traits in singers drive tic development, could also be true. In light of the boys choir's enchantment, the sole perception of tics as a disorder falls short of the properties of the motor system. Ann Neurol 2017;82:1029–1031&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Molecular recognition and packing frustration in a helical protein</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005909</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/OC7JzGxYhIA/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Loan Huynh, Chris Neale, Régis Pomès, Hue Sun Chan&lt;/p&gt;

Biomolecular recognition entails attractive forces for the functional native states and discrimination against potential nonnative interactions that favor alternate stable configurations. The challenge posed by the competition of nonnative stabilization against native-centric forces is conceptualized as frustration. Experiment indicates that frustration is often minimal in evolved biological systems although nonnative possibilities are intuitively abundant. Much of the physical basis of minimal frustration in protein folding thus remains to be elucidated. Here we make progress by studying the colicin immunity protein Im9. To assess the energetic favorability of nonnative versus native interactions, we compute free energies of association of various combinations of the four helices in Im9 (referred to as H1, H2, H3, and H4) by extensive explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations (total simulated time &amp;gt; 300 μs), focusing primarily on the pairs with the largest native contact surfaces, H1-H2 and H1-H4. Frustration is detected in H1-H2 packing in that a nonnative packing orientation is significantly stabilized relative to native, whereas such a prominent nonnative effect is not observed for H1-H4 packing. However, in contrast to the favored nonnative H1-H2 packing in isolation, the native H1-H2 packing orientation is stabilized by H3 and loop residues surrounding H4. Taken together, these results showcase the contextual nature of molecular recognition, and suggest further that nonnative effects in H1-H2 packing may be largely avoided by the experimentally inferred Im9 folding transition state with native packing most developed at the H1-H4 rather than the H1-H2 interface.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OC7JzGxYhIA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A Prospective Trial of Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound Thalamotomy for Essential Tremor: Results at the 2-year Follow-up</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25126</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25126</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has recently been investigated as a new treatment modality for essential tremor (ET), but the durability of the procedure has not yet been evaluated. This study reports results at a 2- year follow-up after MRgFUS thalamotomy for ET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 76 patients with moderate-to-severe ET, who had not responded to at least two trials of medical therapy, were enrolled in the original randomized study of unilateral thalamotomy and evaluated using the clinical rating scale for tremor. Sixty-seven of the patients continued in the open-label extension phase of the study with monitoring for 2 years. Nine patients were excluded by two years, for example because of alternative therapy such as deep brain stimulation (n = 3) or inadequate thermal lesioning (n = 1). However, all patients in each follow-up period were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Mean hand tremor score at baseline (19.8±4.9, 76 patients) improved by 55% at 6 months (8.6±4.5, 75 patients). The improvement in tremor score from baseline was durable at 1 year (53%, 8.9±4.8, 70 patients) and at 2 years (56%, 8.8±5.0, 67 patients). Similarly, the disability score at baseline (16.4±4.5, 76 patients) improved by 64% at 6 months (5.4±4.7, 75 patients). This improvement was also sustained at 1 year (5.4±5.3, 70 patients) and at 2 years (6.5±5.0, 67 patients). Paresthesias and gait disturbances were the most common adverse effects at 1 year-each observed in 10 patients with an additional 5 patients experiencing neurological adverse effects. None of the adverse events worsened over the period of follow up and 2 of these resolved. There were no new delayed complications at 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Tremor suppression after MRgFUS thalamotomy for ET is stably maintained at 2 years. Latent or delayed complications do not develop after treatment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: MYRF is associated with encephalopathy with reversible myelin vacuolization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25125</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25125</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reversible myelin vacuolization is associated with variable conditions including mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS), which is characterized by mildly impaired consciousness and transient splenial lesion. Familial and/or recurrent cases with a clinical diagnosis of MERS suggest the presence of genetic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined a family in which the proband presented with a history of recurrent encephalopathy with extensive but reversible cerebral myelin vacuolization and neurological symptoms similar to those of MERS spanning over three generations. Whole-exome sequencing was performed in family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight rare nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants shared by all patients were identified. By filtering genes expressed in the corpus callosum, we identified a heterozygous c.1208A&amp;gt;G predicting p.Gln403Arg in the highly conserved DNA-binding domain in the myelin regulatory factor (&lt;em&gt;MYRF&lt;/em&gt;) gene. We subsequently screened the coding regions of &lt;em&gt;MYRF&lt;/em&gt; by Sanger sequencing in our cohort comprised of 33 sporadic cases with MERS and three cases in another family with extensive myelin vacuolization, and identified the same heterozygous c.1208A&amp;gt;G in all affected members in the second family. Luciferase assay revealed that transcriptional activity of N-terminal region of MYRF was significantly diminished by introducing the c.1208A&amp;gt;G variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MYRF is a transcriptional regulator that is necessary for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin maintenance. Functional defects of MYRF are likely to be causally associated with encephalopathy with extensive myelin vacuolization. We propose the term “&lt;em&gt;MYRF&lt;/em&gt;-related mild encephalopathy with reversible myelin vacuolization (MMERV)”. Our findings provide a new perspective on the pathogenesis of myelin vacuolization. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: LRSSLMDA: Laplacian Regularized Sparse Subspace Learning for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005912</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Xing Chen, Li Huang&lt;/p&gt;

Predicting novel microRNA (miRNA)-disease associations is clinically significant due to miRNAs’ potential roles of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for various human diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated the viability of utilizing different types of biological data to computationally infer new disease-related miRNAs. Yet researchers face the challenge of how to effectively integrate diverse datasets and make reliable predictions. In this study, we presented a computational model named Laplacian Regularized Sparse Subspace Learning for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (LRSSLMDA), which projected miRNAs/diseases’ statistical feature profile and graph theoretical feature profile to a common subspace. It used Laplacian regularization to preserve the local structures of the training data and a &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-norm constraint to select important miRNA/disease features for prediction. The strength of dimensionality reduction enabled the model to be easily extended to much higher dimensional datasets than those exploited in this study. Experimental results showed that LRSSLMDA outperformed ten previous models: the AUC of 0.9178 in global leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) and the AUC of 0.8418 in local LOOCV indicated the model’s superior prediction accuracy; and the average AUC of 0.9181+/-0.0004 in 5-fold cross validation justified its accuracy and stability. In addition, three types of case studies further demonstrated its predictive power. Potential miRNAs related to Colon Neoplasms, Lymphoma, Kidney Neoplasms, Esophageal Neoplasms and Breast Neoplasms were predicted by LRSSLMDA. Respectively, 98%, 88%, 96%, 98% and 98% out of the top 50 predictions were validated by experimental evidences. Therefore, we conclude that LRSSLMDA would be a valuable computational tool for miRNA-disease association prediction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8AF4L8T4qyg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Optimal number of spacers in CRISPR arrays</title>

Prokaryotic organisms survive under constant pressure of viruses. CRISPR-Cas system provides its prokaryotic host with an adaptive immune defense against viruses that have been previously encountered. It consists of two components: Cas-proteins that cleave the foreign DNA and CRISPR array that suits as a virus recognition key. CRISPR array consists of a series of spacers, short pieces of DNA that originate from and match the corresponding parts of viral DNA called protospacers. Here we estimate the number of spacers in a CRISPR array of a prokaryotic cell which maximizes its protection against a viral attack. The optimality follows from a competition between two trends: too few distinct spacers make host vulnerable to an attack by a virus with mutated corresponding protospacers, while an excessive variety of spacers dilutes the number of the CRISPR complexes armed with the most recent and thus most useful spacers. We first evaluate the optimal number of spacers in a simple scenario of an infection by a single viral species and later consider a more general case of multiple viral species. We find that depending on such parameters as the concentration of CRISPR-Cas interference complexes and its preference to arm with more recently acquired spacers, the rate of viral mutation, and the number of viral species, the predicted optimal number of spacers lies within a range that agrees with experimentally-observed values.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1nIpevm5XbY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: High-frequency oscillations are not better biomarkers of epileptogenic tissues than spikes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25124</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25124</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracerebral EEG (stereoelectroencephalography, SEEG) are considered as better biomarkers of epileptogenic tissues than spikes. How this can be applied at the patient level remains poorly understood. We investigated how well the HFOs and the spikes can predict epileptogenic regions with a large spatial sampling at the patient level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We analyzed non-REM sleep SEEG recordings sampled at 2,048Hz of thirty patients. Ripples (R, 80-250Hz), fast ripples (FR, 250-500Hz) and spikes were automatically detected. Rates of these markers and several combinations – spikes co-occurring with HFOs or FRs and cross rate (Spk⊗HFO) – were compared to a quantified measure of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) by performing a receiver operating characteristic analysis for each patient individually. We used a Wilcoxon sign rank test corrected for false-discovery rate to assess whether a marker was better than the others for predicting the SOZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 2930 channels was analyzed (median of 100 channels per patient). The HFOs or any of its variants were not statistically better than spikes. Only one feature, the cross-rate was better than all the other markers. Moreover, fast ripples, even though very specific, were not delineating all epileptogenic tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: At the patient level, the performance of the HFOs is weakened by the presence of strong physiological HFO generators. Fast ripples are not sensitive enough to be the unique biomarker of epileptogenicity. Nevertheless, combining HFOs and spikes using our proposed measure –the cross rate– is a better strategy than using only one marker. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Person-specific contribution of neuropathologies to cognitive loss in old age</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25123</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Mixed neuropathologies are the most common cause of dementia at the population level, but how different neuropathologies contribute to cognitive decline at the individual level remains unknown. We quantified the contribution of nine neuropathologies to cognitive loss at an individual level. Methods: Participants (n=1,079) came from 2 longitudinal clinical-pathologic studies of aging. All completed 2+ cognitive evaluations (maximum = 22), died and underwent neuropathologic examinations to identify Alzheimer's disease (AD), other neurodegenerative diseases, and vascular pathologies. Linear mixed models examined associations of neuropathologies with cognitive decline and estimated the proportion of cognitive loss accounted for by each neuropathology at a person-specific level. Results: Neuropathology was ubiquitous, with 94% of participants having 1+, 78% having 2+, 58% having 3+, and 35% having 4+. AD was most frequent (65%) but rarely occurred in isolation (9%). Remarkably, more than 230 different neuropathologic combinations were observed, each of which occurred in &amp;lt;6% of the cohort. The relative contributions of specific neuropathologies to cognitive loss varied widely across individuals. Although AD accounted for an average of about 50% of the observed cognitive loss, the proportion accounted for at the individual level ranged widely from 22% to 100%. Lewy bodies and hippocampal sclerosis also had potent effects, but again their impacts varied at the person-specific level. Interpretation: There is much greater heterogeneity in the comorbidity and cognitive impact of age-related neuropathologies than currently appreciated, suggesting an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches that embrace the complexity of disease to combat cognitive decline in old age.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: B Cell Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis: Entering an Era</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25119</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monoclonal antibodies that target CD20 expressing B cells represent an important new treatment option for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). B cell depleting therapy is highly effective against relapsing forms of the disease, and is also the first treatment approach proven to protect against disability worsening in primary progressive MS. Moreover, evolving clinical experience with B cell therapy, combined with a more sophisticated understanding of humoral immunity in preclinical models and in patients with MS, have led to major progress in deciphering the immune pathogenesis of MS. Here, we review the nuanced roles of B cells in MS autoimmunity, the clinical data supporting use of ocrelizumab and other anti-CD20 therapies in the treatment of MS, as well as safety and practical considerations for prescribing. Lastly, we summarize remaining unanswered questions regarding the proper role of anti-CD20 therapy in MS, its limitations, and the future landscape of B cell based approaches to treatment.

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Translational Control Mechanisms in Persistent Pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30233-3?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30233-3?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Persistent pain, which is poorly treated and estimated to afflict one third of the world’s population, is largely mediated by the sensitization of nociceptive neurons. This sensitization involves de novo gene expression to support biochemical and structural changes required to maintain amplified pain signaling that frequently persists even after injury to tissue resolves. While transcription-dependent changes in gene expression are important, recent work demonstrates that activity-dependent regulation of mRNA translation is key to controlling the cellular proteome and the development and maintenance of persistent pain.</description>

	<description>Using induced human dopamine (DA) neurons, a study by Burbulla and colleagues demonstrated a toxic cascade of cellular dysfunctions which may underlie Parkinson’s disease (PD) progression. Their findings reveal what could be the causal relationship between multiple pathogenic pathways in human neurons obtained from idiopathic and familial cases, and suggest novel targets for therapeutic intervention.</description>

These correlate with release synchronization and synaptic short-term facilitation, revealing a mechanism for Syt1-mediated synchronous release.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/f8uxgMRV7SI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Using genetically engineered mice in which the C-terminal domains of AMPA receptor subtypes are switched, the authors reveal that GluA1 and GluA2 differentially regulate synaptic plasticity and contribute to different forms of learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/RfP9BrgyaLw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The authors note diverse cell-type-specific programs in pyramidal neuron subtypes and robust non-neuronal responses that may regulate experience-dependent neurovascular coupling and myelination.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/VH5ROaccFLA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anticipated moments: temporal structure in attention&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anticipated moments: temporal structure in attention, Published online: 07 December 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2017.141&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrn.2017.141&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The brain uses predictable temporal structure to anticipate and select relevant events in time. Nobre and van Ede introduce different types of this 'temporal expectation' and its neural underpinnings, and describe how temporal expectation interacts with other forms of expectation in guiding adaptive behaviour.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/YYxCPYGC8Kc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Early brain activity is crucial for neurogenesis and the development of brain networks. However, it has been challenging to localize regions in the developing human brain that contribute to spontaneous waves of neuronal activity. Recently, Arichi and colleagues reported that the temporal and heteromodal insular cortices have a central role in propagating these neural instructional signals.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Bioprinting for Neural Tissue Engineering</title>

	<description>Bioprinting is a method by which a cell-encapsulating bioink is patterned to create complex tissue architectures. Given the potential impact of this technology on neural research, we review the current state-of-the-art approaches for bioprinting neural tissues. While 2D neural cultures are ubiquitous for studying neural cells, 3D cultures can more accurately replicate the microenvironment of neural tissues. By bioprinting neuronal constructs, one can precisely control the microenvironment by specifically formulating the bioink for neural tissues, and by spatially patterning cell types and scaffold properties in three dimensions.</description>
