	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Control of Functional Connectivity in Cerebral Cortex by Basal Ganglia Mediated Synchronization. (arXiv:1708.00779v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00779</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since the earliest electroencephalography experiments, large scale
oscillations have been observed in the mammalian brain. In more recent studies
they have been identified not only in the cerebral cortex and thalamus, but
pervasively in the healthy basal ganglia. While correlations with stimuli,
behavior, and mental states have long been recognized, the precise function of
these oscillations has often been mysterious, particularly in the basal
ganglia. In this paper, I propose the basal ganglia mediated synchronization
model to help explain many of these correlated oscillatory phenomena, relating
stimulus-response and reinforcement mechanisms to associative synchrony
mechanisms. In this model, patterns of activity in cortex stimulate striatal
responses whose spike timing precisely reflects that prevailing in the input
pattern. These responses are then recirculated in closed and open loops,
chiefly via the thalamus, to the feedback-recipient layers of cortex, where
they selectively establish and reinforce effective connections by controlling
spike-timing-dependent gain. Corticostriatal and striatonigral conduction
delays are critical to this mechanism, and evidence suggests that these delays
are unusually long, and unusually varied, in arrangements that might facilitate
learning of useful time alignments. Structural arrangements in the basal
ganglia show further specialization for this role, with convergence in the
inputs from cortex, and divergence in many of the return paths to cortex, that
systematically reflect corticocortical anatomical connectivity. The basal
ganglia also target the dopaminergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic centers of
the brainstem and basal forebrain, and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus,
structures broadly implicated in the modulation of oscillatory network activity
and expressions of plasticity. The basal ganglia, by learning to coordinate
[...]

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: WAND: A 128-channel, closed-loop, wireless artifact-free neuromodulation device. (arXiv:1708.00556v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Closed-loop neuromodulation systems aim to treat a variety of neurological
conditions by dynamically delivering and adjusting therapeutic electrical
stimulation in response to the neural state of a patient. Closed-loop devices
must simultaneously record neural signals, remove stimulation artifact from
recorded data, and extract neural biomarkers to deliver timely and optimized
stimulation. We have integrated these capabilities into the Wireless
Artifact-free Neuromodulation Device (WAND). WAND features custom neural
interface ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) and on-board
computational components for neural signal processing and closed-loop control.
Wireless communication and low power consumption enable chronic monitoring of a
freely behaving subject, overcoming the limitations of traditional wired
systems. Concurrent sensing and stimulation is enabled by co-designed
integration of the recording, stimulation, and processing subsystems. These
capabilities are demonstrated in wireless neural recordings in a behaving
nonhuman primate (NHP) and on-board cancellation of open-loop stimulation.
Using WAND, we demonstrate a functional response to closed-loop neuromodulation
application during a delayed-reach task by stimulating in response to measured
local field potential (LFP) beta band power modulation to disrupt neural
preparatory activity. WAND removes stimulation artifacts that perturb online
computation of biomarkers such as beta power, thus enabling the accurate
biomarker estimation that is fundamental to closed-loop control.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A silicon-based microelectrode array with a microdrive for monitoring brainstem regions of freely moving rats. (arXiv:1708.00540v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00540</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00540</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective. Exploring neural activity behind synchronization and time locking
in brain circuits is one of the most important tasks in neuroscience. Our goal
was to design and characterize a microelectrode array (MEA) system specifically
for obtaining in vivo extracellular recordings from three deep-brain areas of
freely moving rats, simultaneously. The target areas, the deep mesencephalic
reticular-, pedunculopontine tegmental- and pontine reticular nuclei are
related to the regulation of sleep-wake cycles. Approach. The three targeted
nuclei are collinear, therefore a single-shank MEA was designed in order to
contact them. The silicon-based device was equipped with 3*4 recording sites,
located according to the geometry of the brain regions. Furthermore, a
microdrive was developed to allow fine actuation and post-implantation
relocation of the probe. The probe was attached to a rigid printed circuit
board, which was fastened to the microdrive. A flexible cable was designed in
order to provide not only electronic connection between the probe and the
amplifier system, but sufficient freedom for the movements of the probe as
well. Main results. The microdrive was stable enough to allow precise electrode
targeting into the tissue via a single track. The microelectrodes on the probe
were suitable for recording neural activity from the three targeted brainstem
areas. Significance. The system offers a robust solution to provide long-term
interface between an array of precisely defined microelectrodes and deep-brain
areas of a behaving rodent. The microdrive allowed us to fine-tune the probe

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Characterization of cortical motor function and imagery-related cortical activity: Potential application for prehabilitation. (arXiv:1708.00525v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To minimize functional morbidity associated with brain surgery, new
preventive approaches (also referred to as &quot;prehabilitation&quot;) by using
motor-imagery-based computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) can be utilized. To achieve
successful MI-BCI performance for prehabilitation purposes, the characteristics
of an electrocorticographic (ECoG) signal that is associated with overt motor
function (&quot;real movement&quot; - RM) versus covert motor function (&quot;motor imagery&quot; -
MI) need to be determined. In our current study, 5 patients with
pharmacoresistant epilepsy (2 males, average age 25 years, SD 15), undergoing
evaluation for epilepsy surgery participated in both RM and MI tasks. Although
the RM- and MI- related ECoG changes had some common features, they also
differed in a number of ways, such as location, frequency ranges, signal
synchronization and desynchronization. These similarities and differences are
discussed in a view of other neuroimaging studies, including
magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
We emphasize the need for inclusion of a broad spectrum of frequencies in ECoG
analysis, when RM- and MI- related activities are concerned.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The Stochastic Early Reaction, Inhibition, and late Action (SERIA) model for antisaccades</title>

The antisaccade task is a classic paradigm used to study the voluntary control of eye movements. It requires participants to suppress a reactive eye movement to a visual target and to concurrently initiate a saccade in the opposite direction. Although several models have been proposed to explain error rates and reaction times in this task, no formal model comparison has yet been performed. Here, we describe a Bayesian modeling approach to the antisaccade task that allows us to formally compare different models on the basis of their evidence. First, we provide a formal likelihood function of actions (pro- and antisaccades) and reaction times based on previously published models. Second, we introduce the &lt;i&gt;Stochastic Early Reaction&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Inhibition&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;and late Action model&lt;/i&gt; (SERIA), a novel model postulating two different mechanisms that interact in the antisaccade task: an early GO/NO-GO race decision process and a late GO/GO decision process. Third, we apply these models to a data set from an experiment with three mixed blocks of pro- and antisaccade trials. Bayesian model comparison demonstrates that the SERIA model explains the data better than competing models that do not incorporate a late decision process. Moreover, we show that the early decision process postulated by the SERIA model is, to a large extent, insensitive to the cue presented in a single trial. Finally, we use parameter estimates to demonstrate that changes in reaction time and error rate due to the probability of a trial type (pro- or antisaccade) are best explained by faster or slower inhibition and the probability of generating late voluntary prosaccades.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LblUApm-_g4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Bacteria of many species rely on a simple molecule, the intracellular secondary messenger c-di-GMP (Bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate), to make a vital choice: whether to stay in one place and form a biofilm, or to leave it in search of better conditions. The c-di-GMP network has a bow-tie shaped architecture that integrates many signals from the outside world—the input stimuli—into intracellular c-di-GMP levels that then regulate genes for biofilm formation or for swarming motility—the output phenotypes. How does the ‘uninformed’ process of evolution produce a network with the right input/output association and enable bacteria to make the right choice? Inspired by new data from 28 clinical isolates of &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; and strains evolved in laboratory experiments we propose a mathematical model where the c-di-GMP network is analogous to a machine learning classifier. The analogy immediately suggests a mechanism for learning through evolution: adaptation though incremental changes in c-di-GMP network proteins acquires knowledge from past experiences and enables bacteria to use it to direct future behaviors. Our model clarifies the elusive function of the ubiquitous c-di-GMP network, a key regulator of bacterial social traits associated with virulence. More broadly, the link between evolution and machine learning can help explain how natural selection across fluctuating environments produces networks that enable living organisms to make sophisticated decisions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PcGMsGeA7o8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A model of human motor sequence learning explains facilitation and interference effects based on spike-timing dependent plasticity</title>

The ability to learn sequential behaviors is a fundamental property of our brains. Yet a long stream of studies including recent experiments investigating motor sequence learning in adult human subjects have produced a number of puzzling and seemingly contradictory results. In particular, when subjects have to learn multiple action sequences, learning is sometimes impaired by proactive and retroactive interference effects. In other situations, however, learning is accelerated as reflected in facilitation and transfer effects. At present it is unclear what the underlying neural mechanism are that give rise to these diverse findings. Here we show that a recently developed recurrent neural network model readily reproduces this diverse set of findings. The self-organizing recurrent neural network (SORN) model is a network of recurrently connected threshold units that combines a simplified form of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) with homeostatic plasticity mechanisms ensuring network stability, namely intrinsic plasticity (IP) and synaptic normalization (SN). When trained on sequence learning tasks modeled after recent experiments we find that it reproduces the full range of interference, facilitation, and transfer effects. We show how these effects are rooted in the network’s changing internal representation of the different sequences across learning and how they depend on an interaction of training schedule and task similarity. Furthermore, since learning in the model is based on fundamental neuronal plasticity mechanisms, the model reveals how these plasticity mechanisms are ultimately responsible for the network’s sequence learning abilities. In particular, we find that all three plasticity mechanisms are essential for the network to learn effective internal models of the different training sequences. This ability to form effective internal models is also the basis for the observed interference and facilitation effects. This suggests that STDP, IP, and SN may be the driving forces behind our ability to learn complex action sequences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3MjCSVpb4ug&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Subcellular Distribution of HDAC1 in Neurotoxic Conditions Is Dependent on Serine Phosphorylation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Calcium-dependent nuclear export of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) was shown previously to precede axonal damage in culture, but the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; relevance of these findings and the potential posttranslational modifications of HDAC1 remained elusive. Using acute hippocampal slices from mice of either sex with genetic conditional ablation of &lt;i&gt;Hdac1&lt;/i&gt; in CA1 hippocampal neurons (i.e., &lt;i&gt;Camk2a-cre;Hdac1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;), we show significantly diminished axonal damage in response to neurotoxic stimuli. The protective effect of &lt;i&gt;Hdac1&lt;/i&gt; ablation was detected also in CA3 neurons in &lt;i&gt;Grik4-cre;Hdac1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;fl/f&lt;/sup&gt; mice, which were more resistant to the excitotoxic damage induced by intraventricular injection of kainic acid. The amino acid residues modulating HDAC1 subcellular localization were identified by site-directed mutagenesis, which identified serine residues 421 and 423 as critical for its nuclear localization. The physiological phosphorylation of HDAC1 was decreased by neurotoxic stimuli, which stimulated the phosphatase enzymatic activity of calcineurin. Treatment of neurons with the calcineurin inhibitors FK506 or cyclosporin A resulted in nuclear accumulation of phospho-HDAC1 and was neuroprotective. Together, our data identify HDAC1 and the phosphorylation of specific serine residues in the molecule as potential targets for neuroprotection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The importance of histone deacetylation in normal brain functions and pathological conditions is unquestionable, yet the molecular mechanisms responsible for the neurotoxic potential of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and its subcellular localization are not fully understood. Here, we use transgenic lines to define the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; relevance of HDAC1 and identify calcineurin-dependent serine dephosphorylation as the signal modulating the neurotoxic role of HDAC1 in response to neurotoxic stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Loss of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex1 in Adult Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells Enhances Axon Remyelination and Increases Myelin Thickness after a Focal Demyelination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/31/7534?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an essential regulator of developmental oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, oligodendrocyte-specific deletion of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a major upstream inhibitor of mTOR, surprisingly also leads to hypomyelination during CNS development. However, the function of TSC has not been studied in the context of remyelination. Here, we used the inducible Cre-lox system to study the function of TSC in the remyelination of a focal, lysolecithin-demyelinated lesion in adult male mice. Using two different mouse models in which &lt;i&gt;Tsc1&lt;/i&gt; is deleted by Cre expression in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) or in premyelinating oligodendrocytes, we reveal that deletion of &lt;i&gt;Tsc1&lt;/i&gt; affects oligodendroglia differently depending on the stage of the oligodendrocyte lineage. &lt;i&gt;Tsc1&lt;/i&gt; deletion from NG2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; OPCs accelerated remyelination. Conversely, &lt;i&gt;Tsc1&lt;/i&gt; deletion from proteolipid protein (PLP)-positive oligodendrocytes slowed remyelination. Contrary to developmental myelination, there were no changes in OPC or oligodendrocyte numbers in either model. Our findings reveal a complex role for TSC in oligodendrocytes during remyelination in which the timing of &lt;i&gt;Tsc1&lt;/i&gt; deletion is a critical determinant of its effect on remyelination. Moreover, our findings suggest that TSC has different functions in developmental myelination and remyelination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Myelin loss in demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis results in disability due to loss of axon conductance and axon damage. Encouragingly, the nervous system is capable of spontaneous remyelination, but this regenerative process often fails. Many chronically demyelinated lesions have oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) within their borders. It is thus of great interest to elucidate mechanisms by which we might enhance endogenous remyelination. Here, we provide evidence that deletion of &lt;i&gt;Tsc1&lt;/i&gt; from OPCs, but not differentiating oligodendrocytes, is beneficial to remyelination. This finding contrasts with the loss of oligodendroglia and hypomyelination seen with &lt;i&gt;Tsc1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt; deletion in the oligodendrocyte lineage during CNS development and points to important differences in the regulation of developmental myelination and remyelination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mesoscale Mapping of Mouse Cortex Reveals Frequency-Dependent Cycling between Distinct Macroscale Functional Modules</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Connectivity mapping based on resting-state activity in mice has revealed functional motifs of correlated activity. However, the rules by which motifs organize into larger functional modules that lead to hemisphere wide spatial-temporal activity sequences is not clear. We explore cortical activity parcellation in head-fixed, quiet awake GCaMP6 mice from both sexes by using mesoscopic calcium imaging. Spectral decomposition of spontaneous cortical activity revealed the presence of two dominant frequency modes (&amp;lt;1 and ~3 Hz), each of them associated with a unique spatial signature of cortical macro-parcellation not predicted by classical cytoarchitectonic definitions of cortical areas. Based on assessment of 0.1–1 Hz activity, we define two macro-organizing principles: the first being a rotating polymodal-association pinwheel structure around which activity flows sequentially from visual to barrel then to hindlimb somatosensory; the second principle is correlated activity symmetry planes that exist on many levels within a single domain such as intrahemispheric reflections of sensory and motor cortices. In contrast, higher frequency activity &amp;gt;1 Hz yielded two larger clusters of coactivated areas with an enlarged default mode network-like posterior region. We suggest that the apparent constrained structure for intra-areal cortical activity flow could be exploited in future efforts to normalize activity in diseases of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Increasingly, functional connectivity mapping of spontaneous activity is being used to reveal the organization of the brain. However, because the brain operates across multiple space and time domains a more detailed understanding of this organization is necessary. We used &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; wide-field calcium imaging of the indicator GCaMP6 in head-fixed, awake mice to characterize the organization of spontaneous cortical activity at different spatiotemporal scales. Correlation analysis defines the presence of two to three superclusters of activity that span traditionally defined functional territories and were frequency dependent. This work helps define the rules for how different cortical areas interact in time and space. We provide a framework necessary for future studies that explore functional reorganization of brain circuits in disease models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cooperation Not Competition: Bihemispheric tDCS and fMRI Show Role for Ipsilateral Hemisphere in Motor Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/31/7500?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/31/7500?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;What is the role of ipsilateral motor and premotor areas in motor learning? One view is that ipsilateral activity suppresses contralateral motor cortex and, accordingly, that inhibiting ipsilateral regions can improve motor learning. Alternatively, the ipsilateral motor cortex may play an active role in the control and/or learning of unilateral hand movements. We approached this question by applying double-blind bihemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over both contralateral and ipsilateral motor cortex in a between-group design during 4 d of unimanual explicit sequence training in human participants. Independently of whether the anode was placed over contralateral or ipsilateral motor cortex, bihemispheric stimulation yielded substantial performance gains relative to unihemispheric or sham stimulation. This performance advantage appeared to be supported by plastic changes in both hemispheres. First, we found that behavioral advantages generalized strongly to the untrained hand, suggesting that tDCS strengthened effector-independent representations. Second, functional imaging during speed-matched execution of trained sequences conducted 48 h after training revealed sustained, polarity-independent increases in activity in both motor cortices relative to the sham group. These results suggest a cooperative rather than competitive interaction of the two motor cortices during skill learning and suggest that bihemispheric brain stimulation during unimanual skill learning may be beneficial because it harnesses plasticity in the ipsilateral hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Many neurorehabilitation approaches are based on the idea that is beneficial to boost excitability in the contralateral hemisphere while attenuating that of the ipsilateral cortex to reduce interhemispheric inhibition. We observed that bihemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with the excitatory anode either over contralateral or ipsilateral motor cortex facilitated motor learning nearly twice as strongly as unihemispheric tDCS. These increases in motor learning were accompanied by increases in fMRI activation in both motor cortices that outlasted the stimulation period, as well as increased generalization to the untrained hand. Collectively, our findings suggest a cooperative rather than a competitive role of the hemispheres and imply that it is most beneficial to harness plasticity in both hemispheres in neurorehabilitation of motor deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The MNK-eIF4E Signaling Axis Contributes to Injury-Induced Nociceptive Plasticity and the Development of Chronic Pain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Injury-induced sensitization of nociceptors contributes to pain states and the development of chronic pain. Inhibiting activity-dependent mRNA translation through mechanistic target of rapamycin and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways blocks the development of nociceptor sensitization. These pathways convergently signal to the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4F complex to regulate the sensitization of nociceptors, but the details of this process are ill defined. Here we investigated the hypothesis that phosphorylation of the 5' cap-binding protein eIF4E by its specific kinase MAPK interacting kinases (MNKs) 1/2 is a key factor in nociceptor sensitization and the development of chronic pain. Phosphorylation of ser209 on eIF4E regulates the translation of a subset of mRNAs. We show that pronociceptive and inflammatory factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and carrageenan, produce decreased mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity, decreased affective pain behaviors, and strongly reduced hyperalgesic priming in mice lacking eIF4E phosphorylation (&lt;i&gt;eIF4E&lt;sup&gt;S209A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;). Tests were done in both sexes, and no sex differences were found. Moreover, in patch-clamp electrophysiology and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging experiments on dorsal root ganglion neurons, NGF- and IL-6-induced increases in excitability were attenuated in neurons from &lt;i&gt;eIF4E&lt;sup&gt;S209A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. These effects were recapitulated in &lt;i&gt;Mnk1/2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice and with the MNK1/2 inhibitor cercosporamide. We also find that cold hypersensitivity induced by peripheral nerve injury is reduced in &lt;i&gt;eIF4E&lt;sup&gt;S209A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mnk1/2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice and following cercosporamide treatment. Our findings demonstrate that the MNK1/2–eIF4E signaling axis is an important contributing factor to mechanisms of nociceptor plasticity and the development of chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Chronic pain is a debilitating disease affecting approximately one in three Americans. Chronic pain is thought to be driven by changes in the excitability of peripheral nociceptive neurons, but the precise mechanisms controlling these changes are not elucidated. Emerging evidence demonstrates that mRNA translation regulation pathways are key factors in changes in nociceptor excitability. Our work demonstrates that a single phosphorylation site on the 5' cap-binding protein eIF4E is a critical mechanism for changes in nociceptor excitability that drive the development of chronic pain. We reveal a new mechanistic target for the development of a chronic pain state and propose that targeting the upstream kinase, MAPK interacting kinase 1/2, could be used as a therapeutic approach for chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Integrated Stress Response in Hypoxia-Induced Diffuse White Matter Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/31/7465?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/31/7465?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Currently no treatments exist for preterm infants with diffuse white matter injury (DWMI) caused by hypoxia. Due to the improved care of preterm neonates and increased recognition by advanced imaging techniques, the prevalence of DWMI is increasing. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of DWMI is therefore of critical importance. The integrated stress response (ISR), a conserved eukaryotic response to myriad stressors including hypoxia, may play a role in hypoxia-induced DWMI and may represent a novel target for much needed therapies. In this study, we use &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; hypoxic models of DWMI to investigate whether the ISR is involved in DWMI. We demonstrate that hypoxia activates the ISR in primary mouse oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and that genetically inhibiting the ISR in differentiating OPCs increases their susceptibility to &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; hypoxia. We also show that a well established &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; mild chronic hypoxia (MCH) mouse model and a new severe acute hypoxia (SAH) mouse model of DWMI activates the initial step of the ISR. Nonetheless, genetic inhibition of the ISR has no detectable effect on either MCH- or SAH-induced DWMI. In addition, we demonstrate that genetic enhancement of the ISR does not ameliorate MCH- or SAH-induced DWMI. These studies suggest that, while the ISR protects OPCs from hypoxia &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, it does not appear to play a major role in either MCH- or SAH-induced DWMI and is therefore not a likely target for therapies aimed at improving neurological outcome in preterm neonates with hypoxia-induced DWMI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Diffuse white matter injury (DWMI) caused by hypoxia is a leading cause of neurological deficits following premature birth. An increased understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease is critical. The integrated stress response (ISR) is activated by hypoxia and protects oligodendrocyte lineage cells in other disease models. This has led to an interest in the potential role of the ISR in DWMI. Here we examine the ISR in hypoxia-induced DWMI and show that while the ISR protects oligodendrocyte lineage cells from hypoxia &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, genetic inhibition or enhancement of the ISR has no effect on hypoxia-induced DWMI &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting that the ISR does not play a major role in and is not a likely therapeutic target for DWMI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Erbb4 Deletion from Medium Spiny Neurons of the Nucleus Accumbens Core Induces Schizophrenia-Like Behaviors via Elevated GABAA Receptor {alpha}1 Subunit Expression</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Medium spiny neurons (MSNs), the major GABAergic projection neurons in the striatum, are implicated in many neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We found that a deficiency in &lt;i&gt;Erbb4&lt;/i&gt;, a schizophrenia risk gene, in MSNs of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core, but not the dorsomedial striatum, markedly induced schizophrenia-like behaviors such as hyperactivity, abnormal marble-burying behavior, damaged social novelty recognition, and impaired sensorimotor gating function in male mice. Using immunohistochemistry, Western blot, RNA interference, electrophysiology, and behavior test studies, we found that these phenomena were mediated by increased GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor α1 subunit (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R α1) expression, which enhanced inhibitory synaptic transmission on MSNs. These results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Erbb4&lt;/i&gt; in MSNs of the NAc core may contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia by regulating GABAergic transmission and raise the possibility that GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R α1 may therefore serve as a new therapeutic target for schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although ErbB4 is highly expressed in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), its role in this type of neuron has not been reported previously. The present study demonstrates that &lt;i&gt;Erbb4&lt;/i&gt; deletion in nucleus accumbens (NAc) core MSNs can induce schizophrenia-like behaviors via elevated GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor α1 subunit (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R α1) expression. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that ErbB4 signaling in the MSNs is involved in the pathology of schizophrenia. Furthermore, restoration of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R α1 in the NAc core, but not the dorsal medium striatum, alleviated the abnormal behaviors. Here, we highlight the role of the NAc core in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and suggest that GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R α1 may be a potential pharmacological target for its treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Connectome-Wide Phenotypical and Genotypical Associations in Focal Dystonia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Isolated focal dystonia is a debilitating movement disorder of unknown pathophysiology. Early studies in focal dystonias have pointed to segregated changes in brain activity and connectivity. Only recently has the notion that dystonia pathophysiology may lie in abnormalities of large-scale brain networks appeared in the literature. Here, we outline a novel concept of functional connectome-wide alterations that are linked to dystonia phenotype and genotype. Using a neural community detection strategy and graph theoretical analysis of functional MRI data in human patients with the laryngeal form of dystonia (LD) and healthy controls (both males and females), we identified an abnormally widespread hub formation in LD, which particularly affected the primary sensorimotor and parietal cortices and thalamus. Left thalamic regions formed a delineated functional community that highlighted differences in network topology between LD patients with and without family history of dystonia. Conversely, marked differences in the topological organization of parietal regions were found between phenotypically different forms of LD. The interface between sporadic genotype and adductor phenotype of LD yielded four functional communities that were primarily governed by intramodular hub regions. Conversely, the interface between familial genotype and abductor phenotype was associated with numerous long-range hub nodes and an abnormal integration of left thalamus and basal ganglia. Our findings provide the first comprehensive atlas of functional topology across different phenotypes and genotypes of focal dystonia. As such, this study constitutes an important step toward defining dystonia as a large-scale network disorder, understanding its causative pathophysiology, and identifying disorder-specific markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The architecture of the functional connectome in focal dystonia was analyzed in a large population of patients with laryngeal dystonia. Breaking with the empirical concept of dystonia as a basal ganglia disorder, we discovered large-scale alterations of neural communities that are significantly influenced by the disorder's clinical phenotype and genotype.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Loss of CDKL5 in Glutamatergic Neurons Disrupts Hippocampal Microcircuitry and Leads to Memory Impairment in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by epileptic seizures, severe intellectual disability, and autistic features. Mice lacking CDKL5 display multiple behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of the disorder, but the cellular origins of these phenotypes remain unclear. Here, we find that ablating CDKL5 expression specifically from forebrain glutamatergic neurons impairs hippocampal-dependent memory in male conditional knock-out mice. Hippocampal pyramidal neurons lacking CDKL5 show decreased dendritic complexity but a trend toward increased spine density. This morphological change is accompanied by an increase in the frequency of spontaneous miniature EPSCs and interestingly, miniature IPSCs. Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging to interrogate the evoked response of the CA1 microcircuit, we find that CA1 pyramidal neurons lacking CDKL5 show hyperexcitability in their dendritic domain that is constrained by elevated inhibition in a spatially and temporally distinct manner. These results suggest a novel role for CDKL5 in the regulation of synaptic function and uncover an intriguing microcircuit mechanism underlying impaired learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;CDKL5&lt;/i&gt; gene. Although &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; constitutive knock-out mice have recapitulated key aspects of human symptomatology, the cellular origins of CDKL5 deficiency-related phenotypes are unknown. Here, using conditional knock-out mice, we show that hippocampal-dependent learning and memory deficits in CDKL5 deficiency have origins in glutamatergic neurons of the forebrain and that loss of CDKL5 results in the enhancement of synaptic transmission and disruptions in neural circuit dynamics in a spatially and temporally specific manner. Our findings demonstrate that CDKL5 is an important regulator of synaptic function in glutamatergic neurons and serves a critical role in learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Enhanced Excitatory Connectivity and Disturbed Sound Processing in the Auditory Brainstem of Fragile X Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/31/7403?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/31/7403?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hypersensitivity to sounds is one of the prevalent symptoms in individuals with Fragile X syndrome (FXS). It manifests behaviorally early during development and is often used as a landmark for treatment efficacy. However, the physiological mechanisms and circuit-level alterations underlying this aberrant behavior remain poorly understood. Using the mouse model of FXS (&lt;i&gt;Fmr1 KO&lt;/i&gt;), we demonstrate that functional maturation of auditory brainstem synapses is impaired in FXS. &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice showed a greatly enhanced excitatory synaptic input strength in neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO), a prominent auditory brainstem nucleus, which integrates ipsilateral excitation and contralateral inhibition to compute interaural level differences. Conversely, the glycinergic, inhibitory input properties remained unaffected. The enhanced excitation was the result of an increased number of cochlear nucleus fibers converging onto one LSO neuron, without changing individual synapse properties. Concomitantly, immunolabeling of excitatory ending markers revealed an increase in the immunolabeled area, supporting abnormally elevated excitatory input numbers. Intrinsic firing properties were only slightly enhanced. In line with the disturbed development of LSO circuitry, auditory processing was also affected in adult &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice as shown with single-unit recordings of LSO neurons. These processing deficits manifested as an increase in firing rate, a broadening of the frequency response area, and a shift in the interaural level difference function of LSO neurons. Our results suggest that this aberrant synaptic development of auditory brainstem circuits might be a major underlying cause of the auditory processing deficits in FXS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inheritable form of intellectual impairment, including autism. A core symptom of FXS is extreme sensitivity to loud sounds. This is one reason why individuals with FXS tend to avoid social interactions, contributing to their isolation. Here, a mouse model of FXS was used to investigate the auditory brainstem where basic sound information is first processed. Loss of the Fragile X mental retardation protein leads to excessive excitatory compared with inhibitory inputs in neurons extracting information about sound levels. Functionally, this elevated excitation results in increased firing rates, and abnormal coding of frequency and binaural sound localization cues. Imbalanced early-stage sound level processing could partially explain the auditory processing deficits in FXS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: No Effect of Commercial Cognitive Training on Brain Activity, Choice Behavior, or Cognitive Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/31/7390?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increased preference for immediate over delayed rewards and for risky over certain rewards has been associated with unhealthy behavioral choices. Motivated by evidence that enhanced cognitive control can shift choice behavior away from immediate and risky rewards, we tested whether training executive cognitive function could influence choice behavior and brain responses. In this randomized controlled trial, 128 young adults (71 male, 57 female) participated in 10 weeks of training with either a commercial web-based cognitive training program or web-based video games that do not specifically target executive function or adapt the level of difficulty throughout training. Pretraining and post-training, participants completed cognitive assessments and functional magnetic resonance imaging during performance of the following validated decision-making tasks: delay discounting (choices between smaller rewards now vs larger rewards in the future) and risk sensitivity (choices between larger riskier rewards vs smaller certain rewards). Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no evidence that cognitive training influences neural activity during decision-making; nor did we find effects of cognitive training on measures of delay discounting or risk sensitivity. Participants in the commercial training condition improved with practice on the specific tasks they performed during training, but participants in both conditions showed similar improvement on standardized cognitive measures over time. Moreover, the degree of improvement was comparable to that observed in individuals who were reassessed without any training whatsoever. Commercial adaptive cognitive training appears to have no benefits in healthy young adults above those of standard video games for measures of brain activity, choice behavior, or cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Engagement of neural regions and circuits important in executive cognitive function can bias behavioral choices away from immediate rewards. Activity in these regions may be enhanced through adaptive cognitive training. Commercial brain training programs claim to improve a broad range of mental processes; however, evidence for transfer beyond trained tasks is mixed. We undertook the first randomized controlled trial of the effects of commercial adaptive cognitive training (Lumosity) on neural activity and decision-making in young adults (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 128) compared with an active control (playing on-line video games). We found no evidence for relative benefits of cognitive training with respect to changes in decision-making behavior or brain response, or for cognitive task performance beyond those specifically trained.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Retinotopic Organization of Scene Areas in Macaque Inferior Temporal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/31/7373?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/31/7373?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Primates have specialized domains in inferior temporal (IT) cortex that are responsive to particular image categories. Though IT traditionally has been regarded as lacking retinotopy, several recent studies in monkeys have shown that retinotopic maps extend to face patches along the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and neighboring regions of IT cortex. Here, we used fMRI to map the retinotopic organization of medial ventral temporal cortex in four monkeys (2 male and 2 female). We confirm the presence of visual field maps within and around the lower bank of the STS and extend these prior findings to scene-selective cortex in the ventral-most regions of IT. Within the occipitotemporal sulcus (OTS), we identified two retinotopic areas, OTS1 and OTS2. The polar angle representation of OTS2 was a mirror reversal of the OTS1 representation. These regions contained representations of the contralateral periphery and were selectively active for scene versus face, body, or object images. The extent of this retinotopy parallels that in humans and shows that the organization of the scene network is preserved across primate species. In addition retinotopic maps were identified in dorsal extrastriate, posterior parietal, and frontal cortex as well as the thalamus, including both the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar. Together, it appears that most, if not all, of the macaque visual system contains organized representations of visual space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Primates have specialized domains in inferior temporal (IT) cortex that are responsive to particular image categories. Though retinotopic maps are considered a fundamental organizing principle of posterior visual cortex, IT traditionally has been regarded as lacking retinotopy. Recent imaging studies have demonstrated the presence of several visual field maps within the lateral IT. Using neuroimaging, we found multiple representations of visual space within ventral IT cortex of macaques that included scene-selective cortex. Scene domains were biased toward the peripheral visual field. These data demonstrate the prevalence of visual field maps throughout the primate visual system, including late stages in the ventral visual hierarchy, and support the idea that domains representing different categories are biased toward different parts of the visual field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Relevance of AgRP Neuron-Derived GABA Inputs to POMC Neurons Differs for Spontaneous and Evoked Release</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons potently stimulate food intake, whereas proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons inhibit feeding. Whether AgRP neurons exert their orexigenic actions, at least in part, by inhibiting anorexigenic POMC neurons remains unclear. Here, the connectivity between GABA-releasing AgRP neurons and POMC neurons was examined in brain slices from male and female mice. GABA-mediated spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) in POMC neurons were unaffected by disturbing GABA release from AgRP neurons either by cell type-specific deletion of the vesicular GABA transporter or by expression of botulinum toxin in AgRP neurons to prevent vesicle-associated membrane protein 2-dependent vesicle fusion. Additionally, there was no difference in the ability of μ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists to inhibit sIPSCs in POMC neurons when MORs were deleted from AgRP neurons, and activation of the inhibitory designer receptor hM4Di on AgRP neurons did not affect sIPSCs recorded from POMC neurons. These approaches collectively indicate that AgRP neurons do not significantly contribute to the strong spontaneous GABA input to POMC neurons. Despite these observations, optogenetic stimulation of AgRP neurons reliably produced evoked IPSCs in POMC neurons, leading to the inhibition of POMC neuron firing. Thus, AgRP neurons can potently affect POMC neuron function without contributing a significant source of spontaneous GABA input to POMC neurons. Together, these results indicate that the relevance of GABAergic inputs from AgRP to POMC neurons is state dependent and highlight the need to consider different types of transmitter release in circuit mapping and physiologic regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons play an important role in driving food intake, while proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons inhibit feeding. Despite the importance of these two well characterized neuron types in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, communication between these cells remains poorly understood. To provide clarity to this circuit, we made electrophysiological recordings from mouse brain slices and found that AgRP neurons do not contribute spontaneously released GABA onto POMC neurons, although when activated with channelrhodopsin AgRP neurons inhibit POMC neurons through GABA-mediated transmission. These findings indicate that the relevance of AgRP to POMC neuron GABA connectivity depends on the state of AgRP neuron activity and suggest that different types of transmitter release should be considered when circuit mapping.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Decreased Axon Caliber Underlies Loss of Fiber Tract Integrity, Disproportional Reductions in White Matter Volume, and Microcephaly in Angelman Syndrome Model Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Angelman syndrome (AS) is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss of function of the maternally inherited &lt;i&gt;UBE3A&lt;/i&gt; allele. It is currently unclear how the consequences of this genetic insult unfold to impair neurodevelopment. We reasoned that by elucidating the basis of microcephaly in AS, a highly penetrant syndromic feature with early postnatal onset, we would gain new insights into the mechanisms by which maternal &lt;i&gt;UBE3A&lt;/i&gt; loss derails neurotypical brain growth and function. Detailed anatomical analysis of both male and female maternal &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt;-null mice reveals that microcephaly in the AS mouse model is primarily driven by deficits in the growth of white matter tracts, which by adulthood are characterized by densely packed axons of disproportionately small caliber. Our results implicate impaired axon growth in the pathogenesis of AS and identify noninvasive structural neuroimaging as a potentially valuable tool for gauging therapeutic efficacy in the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; People who maternally inherit a deletion or nonfunctional copy of the &lt;i&gt;UBE3A&lt;/i&gt; gene develop Angelman syndrome (AS), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. To better understand how loss of maternal &lt;i&gt;UBE3A&lt;/i&gt; function derails brain development, we analyzed brain structure in a maternal &lt;i&gt;Ube3a&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mouse model of AS. We report that the volume of white matter (WM) is disproportionately reduced in AS mice, indicating that deficits in WM development are a major factor underlying impaired brain growth and microcephaly in the disorder. Notably, we find that axons within the WM pathways of AS model mice are abnormally small in caliber. This defect is associated with slowed nerve conduction, which could contribute to behavioral deficits in AS, including motor dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Representation of Multidimensional Stimuli: Quantifying the Most Informative Stimulus Dimension from Neural Responses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/31/7332?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/31/7332?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A common way to assess the function of sensory neurons is to measure the number of spikes produced by individual neurons while systematically varying a given dimension of the stimulus. Such measured tuning curves can then be used to quantify the accuracy of the neural representation of the stimulus dimension under study, which can in turn be related to behavioral performance. However, tuning curves often change shape when other dimensions of the stimulus are varied, reflecting the simultaneous sensitivity of neurons to multiple stimulus features. Here we illustrate how one-dimensional information analyses are misleading in this context, and propose a framework derived from Fisher information that allows the quantification of information carried by neurons in multidimensional stimulus spaces. We use this method to probe the representation of sound localization in auditory neurons of chinchillas and guinea pigs of both sexes, and show how heterogeneous tuning properties contribute to a representation of sound source position that is robust to changes in sound level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sensory neurons' responses are typically modulated simultaneously by numerous stimulus properties, which can result in an overestimation of neural acuity with existing one-dimensional neural information transmission measures. To overcome this limitation, we develop new, compact expressions of Fisher information-derived measures that bound the robust encoding of separate stimulus dimensions in the context of multidimensional stimuli. We apply this method to the problem of the representation of sound source location in the face of changes in sound source level by neurons of the auditory midbrain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Identified Serotonergic Modulatory Neurons Have Heterogeneous Synaptic Connectivity within the Olfactory System of Drosophila</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modulatory neurons project widely throughout the brain, dynamically altering network processing based on an animal's physiological state. The connectivity of individual modulatory neurons can be complex, as they often receive input from a variety of sources and are diverse in their physiology, structure, and gene expression profiles. To establish basic principles about the connectivity of individual modulatory neurons, we examined a pair of identified neurons, the &quot;contralaterally projecting, serotonin-immunoreactive deutocerebral neurons&quot; (CSDns), within the olfactory system of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Specifically, we determined the neuronal classes providing synaptic input to the CSDns within the antennal lobe (AL), an olfactory network targeted by the CSDns, and the degree to which CSDn active zones are uniformly distributed across the AL. Using anatomical techniques, we found that the CSDns received glomerulus-specific input from olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and projection neurons (PNs), and networkwide input from local interneurons (LNs). Furthermore, we quantified the number of CSDn active zones in each glomerulus and found that CSDn output is not uniform, but rather heterogeneous, across glomeruli and stereotyped from animal to animal. Finally, we demonstrate that the CSDns synapse broadly onto LNs and PNs throughout the AL but do not synapse upon ORNs. Our results demonstrate that modulatory neurons do not necessarily provide purely top-down input but rather receive neuron class-specific input from the networks that they target, and that even a two cell modulatory network has highly heterogeneous, yet stereotyped, pattern of connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Modulatory neurons often project broadly throughout the brain to alter processing based on physiological state. However, the connectivity of individual modulatory neurons to their target networks is not well understood, as modulatory neuron populations are heterogeneous in their physiology, morphology, and gene expression. In this study, we use a pair of identified serotonergic neurons within the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; olfactory system as a model to establish a framework for modulatory neuron connectivity. We demonstrate that individual modulatory neurons can integrate neuron class-specific input from their target network, which is often nonreciprocal. Additionally, modulatory neuron output can be stereotyped, yet nonuniform, across network regions. Our results provide new insight into the synaptic relationships that underlie network function of modulatory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Prefrontal Cortex Dysfunction in Fragile X Mice Depends on the Continued Absence of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein in the Adult Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/31/7305?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/31/7305?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fragile X Syndrome (FX) is generally considered a developmental disorder, arising from a mutation that disrupts the transcription of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). However, FMRP regulates the transcription of other proteins and participates in an unknown number of protein–protein interactions throughout life. In addition to known developmental issues, it is thus likely that some dysfunction is also due to the ongoing absence of FMRP. Dissociating dysfunction due to developmental dysregulation from dysfunction due to the continued absence of FMRP is necessary to understand the different roles of FMRP and to treat patients effectively throughout life. We show here that FX model mice display substantial deficits in a PFC-dependent task. We then use conditional knock-out mice to eliminate FMRP only in the PFC alone of adult mice. We observe an increase in the proportion of nonlearners and a delay in the onset of learning in both FX and conditional knock-out mice. The results suggest that these deficits (1) are due to the absence of FMRP in the PFC alone and (2) are not the result of developmental dysregulation. Furthermore, PFC-associated deficits are rescued by initiating production of FMRP in adult conditional restoration mice, suggesting that PFC dysfunction may persist as long as FMRP is absent and therefore can be rescued after development. The data suggest that it is possible to dissociate the roles of FMRP in neural function from developmental dysregulation, and that PFC function can be restored in the adult FX brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The absence of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) from birth results in developmental disabilities and lifelong impairments. We show here that in mouse models PFC dysfunction in Fragile X Syndrome (FX) can be attributed to the continued absence of FMRP from the PFC, independent of FMRP status during development. Furthermore, initiation of FMRP production in the PFC of adult FX animals rescues PFC function. The results suggest that at least some FX-specific neurological defects can be rescued in the adult FX brain after development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Theories of reinforcement learning and approach behavior suggest that reward can increase the perceptual salience of environmental stimuli, ensuring that potential predictors of outcome are noticed in the future. However, outcome commonly follows visual processing of the environment, occurring even when potential reward cues have long disappeared. How can reward feedback retroactively cause now-absent stimuli to become attention-drawing in the future? One possibility is that reward and attention interact to prime lingering visual representations of attended stimuli that sustain through the interval separating stimulus and outcome. Here, we test this idea using multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data collected from male and female humans. While in the scanner, participants searched for examples of target categories in briefly presented pictures of cityscapes and landscapes. Correct task performance was followed by reward feedback that could randomly have either high or low magnitude. Analysis showed that high-magnitude reward feedback boosted the lingering representation of target categories while reducing the representation of nontarget categories. The magnitude of this effect in each participant predicted the behavioral impact of reward on search performance in subsequent trials. Other analyses show that sensitivity to reward—as expressed in a personality questionnaire and in reactivity to reward feedback in the dopaminergic midbrain—predicted reward-elicited variance in lingering target and nontarget representations. Credit for rewarding outcome thus appears to be assigned to the target representation, causing the visual system to become sensitized for similar objects in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How do reward-predictive visual stimuli become salient and attention-drawing? In the real world, reward cues precede outcome and reward is commonly received long after potential predictors have disappeared. How can the representation of environmental stimuli be affected by outcome that occurs later in time? Here, we show that reward acts on lingering representations of environmental stimuli that sustain through the interval between stimulus and outcome. Using naturalistic scene stimuli and multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data, we show that reward boosts the representation of attended objects and reduces the representation of unattended objects. This interaction of attention and reward processing acts to prime vision for stimuli that may serve to predict outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human similarity judgments are inconsistent with Euclidean, Hamming,
Mahalanobis, and the majority of measures used in the extensive literatures on
similarity and dissimilarity. From intrinsic properties of brain circuitry, we
derive principles of perceptual metrics, showing their conformance to
Riemannian geometry. As a demonstration of their utility, the perceptual
metrics are shown to outperform JPEG compression. Unlike machine-learning
approaches, the outperformance uses no statistics, and no learning. Beyond the
incidental application to compression, the metrics offer broad explanatory
accounts of empirical perceptual findings such as Tverskys triangle inequality
violations, contradictory human judgments of identical stimuli such as speech
sounds, and a broad range of other phenomena on percepts and concepts that may
initially appear unrelated. The findings constitute a set of fundamental
principles underlying perceptual similarity.

	<description>Michelassi et al. uncover a novel inhibitory function of the C1-C2B protein domain of the essential synaptic protein Munc13 in regulating calcium-triggered exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. This inhibition is relieved by calcium and DAG in analogy with conventional PKCs and is required for proper nervous system function.</description>

	<description>Thomson et al. use TRAP-seq to identify excessive translation of muscarinic receptor M4 in Fmr1−/y neurons. Surprisingly, enhancement rather than inhibition of M4 corrects neurological Fmr1−/y phenotypes. This suggests that elevated translation of certain mRNAs in the FX brain may be protective rather than pathological.</description>

	<description>Lai et al. discovered that Munc13 promotes proper SNARE complex assembly together with Munc18, increasing evoked release probability. This suggests that the physiological functions of Munc13 in priming and short-term presynaptic plasticity are related to regulation of proper assembly of synaptic complexes.</description>

	<description>Visual perception is profoundly affected by spatial context. In visual cortex, neuronal responses to stimuli inside their receptive field (RF) are suppressed by contextual stimuli in the RF surround (surround suppression). How do neuronal RFs integrate information across visual space, and what role do different cortical layers play in the processing of spatial context? By recording simultaneously across all layers of macaque primary visual cortex, while presenting visual stimuli at increasing distances from the recorded cells RF, we find that near vs. far stimuli activate distinct layers. Stimuli in the near-surround evoke the earliest subthreshold responses in superficial and deep layers, and cause the earliest surround suppression of spiking responses in superficial layers. Instead, far-surround stimuli evoke the earliest subthreshold responses in feedback-recipient layers, i.e. 1 and the lower half of the deep layers, and suppress visually-evoked spiking responses almost simultaneously in all layers, except 4C, where suppression emerges latest. Our results reveal unique contributions of the cortical layers to the processing of local and global spatial context, and suggest distinct underlying circuits for local and global signal integration.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/171744v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Understanding the neural implementation of value-based choice has been an important focus of neuroscience for several decades. Although a consensus has emerged regarding the brain regions involved, disagreement persists regarding precise regional functions and how value information flows between value-based choice regions. In the current study, we isolate neural activity related to decision-making using a gambling task where expected gains and losses are dissociated from the received outcomes of choices. We apply multilevel modelling and mediation analysis to formally test whether brain regions identified as part of the value-based choice network mediate between perceptions of expected value and choices to take or pass a gamble. A critical function in decision-making is accruing and representing value information to drive choice. Several regions have been assigned this role, including ventromedial prefrontal (vmPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and the ventral striatum (VStr). The implied chain of events is one where regions that support the process of gathering relevant information mediate the relationship between choice and representations of value in other brain regions. Here, we formally test whether distinct brain regions express interregional mediation consistent with this chain of processes. We observe that activity in vmPFC does not predict choice, but rather is highly associated with outcome evaluation. By contrast, both PPC and VStr (bilaterally) mediate between expected value and choice. Interregional mediation analyses reveal that VStr fully mediates between PPC and choice. Together these results suggest that VStr, and not vmPFC nor PPC, functions as an important driver of late stage choice.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Functional histamine H3 and adenosine A2A receptor heteromers in recombinant cells and rat striatum</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/171736v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In the striatum, histamine H3 receptors (H3Rs) are co-expressed with adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) in the cortico-striatal glutamatergic afferents and the GABAergic medium-sized spiny neurons that originate the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia. This location allows H3Rs and A2ARs to regulate the striatal GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission. However, whether these receptors interact to modulate the intra-striatal synaptic transmission has not yet been assessed. To test this hypothesis a heteromer-selective in vitro assay was used to detect functional complementation between a chimeric A2AR302-Gqi4 and wild-type H3Rs in transfected HEK-293 cells. H3R activation with the agonist RAMH resulted in Ca2+ mobilization (pEC50 7.31 {+/-} 0.23; maximal stimulation, Emax 449 {+/-} 25% of basal) indicative of receptor heterodimerization. This response was not observed with histamine, suggesting a RAMH bias for heteromers. Functional A2AR-H3R heteromers were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and observations of differential cAMP signaling when both receptors were co-expressed in the same cell. In membranes from rat striatal synaptosomes, H3R activation decreased A2AR affinity for the agonist CGS-21680 (pKi values 8.10 {+/-} 0.04 and 7.70 {+/-} 0.04). Moreover, H3Rs and A2ARs co-immunoprecipitated in protein extracts from striatal synaptosomes. These results support the existence of a H3R/A2AR heteromer, and reveal a new mechanism by which these receptors may modulate the function of the striatum and the basal ganglia.</description>

	<description>We used intracranial recordings to study brain oscillations during a working memory task. To analyze sites involved in working memory, we focused on sites at which the elevation of the broadband gamma signal depended on which letter was presented. During the encoding and maintenance periods of the task, gamma and theta power were affected, but in opposing ways. Nevertheless, cross-frequency coupling (CFC) was present during both periods, suggesting that CFC is fundamental to the task. We tested a previously proposed model according to which different items are active at different phases of the theta cycle (in different gamma cycles within the theta cycle). Consistent with this model, the theta phase of letter-induced gamma elevation during maintenance reflected the order of letter presentation. These results suggest that working memory is organized by a theta-gamma code and provide strong support for the serial representation of items held in working memory.</description>

	<description>Visual brain areas exhibit tuning characteristics that are well suited for image statistics present in our natural environment. However, visual sensation is an active process, and if there are any brain areas that ought to be particularly 'in tune' with natural scene statistics, it would be sensory-motor areas critical for guiding behavior. Here we found that the primate superior colliculus, a structure instrumental for rapid visual exploration with saccades, detects low spatial frequencies, which are the most prevalent in natural scenes, much more rapidly than high spatial frequencies. Importantly, this accelerated detection happens independently of whether a neuron is more or less sensitive to low spatial frequencies to begin with. At the population level, the superior colliculus additionally over-represents low spatial frequencies in neural response sensitivity, even at near-foveal eccentricities. Thus, the superior colliculus possesses both temporal and response gain mechanisms for efficient gaze realignment in low-spatial-frequency dominated natural environments.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Predicting motivation: computational models of PFC can explain neural coding of motivation and effort-based decision-making in health and disease</title>

	<description>Human behavior is strongly driven by the pursuit of rewards. In daily life, however, benefits mostly come at a cost, often requiring that effort be exerted in order to obtain potential benefits. Medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are frequently implicated in the expectation of effortful control, showing increased activity as a function of predicted task difficulty. Such activity partially overlaps with expectation of reward, and has been observed both during decision-making and during task preparation. Recently, novel computational frameworks have been developed to explain activity in these regions during cognitive control, based on the principle of prediction and prediction error (PRO model, Alexander and Brown, 2011, HER Model, Alexander and Brown, 2015). Despite the broad explanatory power of these models, it is not clear whether they can also accommodate effects related to the expectation of effort observed in MPFC and DLPFC. Here, we propose a translation of these computational frameworks to the domain of effort-based behavior. First, we discuss how the PRO model, based on prediction error, can explain effort-related activity in MPFC, by reframing effort-based behavior in a predictive context. We propose that MPFC activity reflects monitoring of motivationally relevant variables (such as effort and reward), by coding expectations, and discrepancies from such expectations. Moreover, we derive behavioral and neural model-based predictions for healthy controls and clinical populations with impairments of motivation. Second, we illustrate the possible translation to effort-based behavior of the HER model, an extended version of PRO model based on hierarchical error prediction, developed to explain MPFC-DLPFC interactions. We derive behavioral predictions which describe how effort and reward information is coded in PFC, and how changing the configuration of such environmental information might affect decision-making and task-performance involving motivation.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/171629v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The pronounced, long lasting, regenerative NMDA-spike is initiated in individual dendritic branches of different types of neurons and is known to play a key role in dendritic computations and plasticity. Combining dynamic system theory and computational approaches, we systematically analyzed how timed synaptic inhibition activated during the NMDA-spike time-course, sculpts this spike and its associated current influx. When impinging on its early phase, individual GABAergic synapse activation transiently, but strongly, dampened the NMDA-spike; later inhibition prematurely terminated it. This inhibition reduced the NMDA-mediated Ca2+ current by up to 60%. NMDA-spikes in distal dendritic branches/spines are longer lasting and more resilient to inhibition, and thus enhance synaptic plasticity at these branches. Examination of this sensitivity of the NMDA-spike to well-timed synaptic inhibition suggests that NMDA-spikes are highly modifiable signals which enable sparse weak distal dendritic inhibition to finely tune both the neuron's output spikes as well as the branch's/spine's Ca2+ current associated with the local NMDA spike.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/171587v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Dopamine has been associated with risky decision-making, as well as with pathological gambling, a behavioural addiction characterized by excessive risk-taking behaviour. However, the specific mechanisms through which dopamine might act to foster risk-taking and pathological gambling remain elusive. Here we test the hypothesis that this might be achieved, in part, via modulation of subjective probability weighing during decision-making. Healthy controls (n = 21) and pathological gamblers (n = 16) played a decision-making task involving choices between sure monetary options and risky gambles both in the gain and loss domains. Each participant played the task twice, either under placebo or the dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist sulpiride, in a double-blind, counter-balanced, design. A prospect theory modelling approach was used to estimate subjective probability weighting and sensitivity to monetary outcomes. Consistent with prospect theory, we found that participants presented a distortion in the subjective weighting of probabilities, i.e. they overweighted low probabilities and underweighted moderate to high probabilities, both in the gain and loss domains. Compared with placebo, sulpiride attenuated this distortion in the gain domain. Across drugs, the groups did not differ in their probability weighting, although in the placebo condition, gamblers consistently underweighted losing probabilities. Overall, our results reveal that dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonism modulates the subjective weighting of probabilities in the gain domain, in the direction of more objective, economically rational decision-making.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/171454v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Decision-making is typically studied as a sequential process from the selection of what to attend (e.g., between possible tasks, stimuli, or stimulus attributes) to the selection of which actions to take based on the attended information. However, people often gather information across these levels in parallel. For instance, even as they choose their actions, they may continue to evaluate how much to attend other tasks or dimensions of information within a task. We scanned participants while they made such parallel evaluations, simultaneously weighing how much to attend two dynamic stimulus attributes and which response to give based on the attended information. Regions of prefrontal cortex tracked information about the stimulus attributes in dissociable ways, related to either the predicted reward (ventromedial prefrontal cortex) or the degree to which that attribute was being attended (dorsal anterior cingulate, dACC). Within dACC, adjacent regions tracked uncertainty at different levels of the decision, regarding what to attend versus how to respond. These findings bridge research on perceptual and value-based decision-making, demonstrating that people dynamically integrate information in parallel across different levels of decision making.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/167841v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) suffer from chronic pain that severely affects quality of life. Although the underlying pathophysiology is not well understood, inhibition of bladder sensory afferents temporarily relieves pain. Here, we explored the possibility that optogenetic inhibition of bladder sensory afferents could be used to modulate bladder pain. Specifically, we chose to study the role of Nav1.8+ sensory afferents before and after induction of a mouse model of bladder pain. The light-activated inhibitory proton pump Archaerhodopsin (Arch) was expressed under control of the Nav1.8+ promoter to selectively silence these neurons. Optically silencing Nav1.8+ afferents significantly blunted the evoked visceromotor response to bladder distension and led to small but significant changes in bladder function. To study of the role of these fibers in freely behaving mice, we developed a fully implantable, flexible, wirelessly powered optoelectronic system for the long-term manipulation of bladder afferent expressed opsins. We found that optogenetic inhibition of Nav1.8+ fibers reduced both ongoing pain and evoked cutaneous hypersensitivity in the context of cystitis, but had no effect in uninjured, naive mice. These results suggest that selective optogenetic silencing of bladder afferents may represent a potential future therapeutic strategy for the treatment of bladder pain.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Philippe Gambette, Leo van Iersel, Mark Jones, Manuel Lafond, Fabio Pardi, Celine Scornavacca&lt;/p&gt;

Phylogenetic tree reconstruction is usually done by local search heuristics that explore the space of the possible tree topologies via simple rearrangements of their structure. Tree rearrangement heuristics have been used in combination with practically all optimization criteria in use, from maximum likelihood and parsimony to distance-based principles, and in a Bayesian context. Their basic components are rearrangement moves that specify all possible ways of generating alternative phylogenies from a given one, and whose fundamental property is to be able to transform, by repeated application, any phylogeny into any other phylogeny. Despite their long tradition in tree-based phylogenetics, very little research has gone into studying similar rearrangement operations for phylogenetic network—that is, phylogenies explicitly representing scenarios that include reticulate events such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer, population admixture, and recombination. To fill this gap, we propose “horizontal” moves that ensure that every network of a certain complexity can be reached from any other network of the same complexity, and “vertical” moves that ensure reachability between networks of different complexities. When applied to phylogenetic trees, our horizontal moves—named rNNI and rSPR—reduce to the best-known moves on rooted phylogenetic trees, nearest-neighbor interchange and rooted subtree pruning and regrafting. Besides a number of reachability results—separating the contributions of horizontal and vertical moves—we prove that rNNI moves are local versions of rSPR moves, and provide bounds on the sizes of the rNNI neighborhoods. The paper focuses on the most biologically meaningful versions of phylogenetic networks, where edges are oriented and reticulation events clearly identified. Moreover, our rearrangement moves are robust to the fact that networks with higher complexity usually allow a better fit with the data. Our goal is to provide a solid basis for practical phylogenetic network reconstruction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/77DGneO75rE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep convolutional neural networks follow roughly the architecture of
biological visual systems, and have shown a performance comparable to human
observers in object recognition tasks. In this study, I test a pre-trained deep
neural network in some classic visual search tasks. The results reveal a
qualitative difference from human performance. It appears that there is no
difference between searches for simple features that pop out in experiments
with humans, and for feature configurations that exhibit strict capacity
limitations in human vision. Both types of stimuli reveal moderate capacity
limitations in the neural network tested here.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: What dominates the time dependence of diffusion transverse to axons: Intra- or extra-axonal water?. (arXiv:1707.09426v1 [physics.bio-ph])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brownian motion of water molecules provides an essential length scale, the
diffusion length, commensurate with cell dimensions in biological tissues.
Measuring the diffusion coefficient as a function of diffusion time makes in
vivo diffusion MRI uniquely sensitive to the cellular features about three
orders of magnitude below imaging resolution. However, there is a longstanding
debate, regarding which contribution --- intra- or extra-cellular --- is more
relevant in the overall time-dependence of the diffusion metrics. Here we
resolve this debate in the human brain white matter. By varying not just the
diffusion time, but also the gradient pulse duration of a standard diffusion
pulse sequence, we identify a functional form of the measured time-dependent
diffusion coefficient transverse to white matter tracts in 5 healthy
volunteers. This specific functional form is shown to originate from the
extra-axonal space, and provides estimates of the fiber packing correlation
length for axons in a bundle. Our results offer a metric for the outer axonal
diameter, a promising candidate marker for demyelination in neurodegenerative
diseases. From the methodological perspective, our analysis demonstrates how
competing models, which describe different physics yet interpolate standard
measurements equally well, can be distinguished based on their prediction for
an independent &quot;orthogonal&quot; measurement.

	<description>Stress is a primary risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders; at times, even a single trauma can trigger psychopathology. Many rodent models of neuropsychiatric disorders use chronic stress, measuring readouts at the end of long protocols. In a way, traditional chronic models overlook a crucial question: how does the physiological response to stressor(s) turn into a maladaptive pathway that may verge towards psychopathology? Recent evidence suggests that studying the long-term consequences of acute stress would provide critical information on the role of stress in psychopathology.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Development of subcortical volumes across adolescence in males and females: A multisample study of longitudinal changes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/171389v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/171389v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The developmental patterns of subcortical brain volumes in males and females observed in previous studies have been inconsistent. To help resolve these discrepancies, we examined developmental trajectories in three independent longitudinal samples of participants with the age-span of 8-22 years (total 216 participants and 467 scans). These datasets, including Pittsburgh (PIT; University of Pittsburgh, USA), NeuroCognitive Development (NCD; University of Oslo, Norway), and Orygen Adolescent Development Study (OADS; The University of Melbourne, Australia), span three countries and were analyzed in parallel using mixed-effects modeling with both generalized additive models and general linear models. The results showed that absolute volume estimates largely overlapped across samples for the thalamus, caudate, putamen, hippocampus, and amygdala in each sex, whereas volumes were less consistent across samples for the pallidum and nucleus accumbens. In males, the thalamus showed increasing volume until mid-adolescence, whereas females showed no change in two samples and an inverse-U trajectory in NCD. For the caudate and putamen, decreases were seen for both sexes and all samples, except for males in PIT. The trajectories for the pallidum varied by sample, with males and females in OADS having smaller volumes in childhood, but catching up with the other samples by adulthood. Although absolute volumes were different for the nucleus accumbens across samples, sex differences in volume changes were similar with linear decreases observed for females and stability in males. Slightly curvilinear patterns of hippocampal growth were seen in all samples. For the amygdala, females showed early increases followed by little change, whereas males displayed steady increases in volume. Our results help to clarify sex specific patterns in subcortical brain changes across adolescence, and highlight region-specific variations in congruency of developmental trajectories.</description>

	<description>Data assimilation, defined as the fusion of data with preexisting knowledge, is particularly suited to elucidating underlying phenomena from noisy/insufficient observations. Although this approach has been widely used in diverse fields, only recently have efforts been directed to problems in neuroscience, using mainly intracranial data and thus limiting its applicability to invasive measurements involving electrode implants. Here we intend to apply data assimilation to non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) measurements to infer brain states and their characteristics. For this purpose, we use Kalman filtering to combine synthetic EEG data with a coupled neural-mass model together with Ary's model of the head, which projects intracranial signals onto the scalp. Our results show that using several extracranial electrodes allows to successfully estimate the state and parameters of the neural masses and their interactions, whereas one single electrode provides only a very partial and insufficient view of the system. The superiority of using multiple extracranial electrodes over using only one, be it intra- or extracranial, is shown over a wide variety of dynamical behaviours. Our results show potential towards future clinical applications of the method.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Triple dissociation of attention and decision computations across prefrontal cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/171173v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/171173v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Anatomical, neuroimaging and lesion studies indicate that prefrontal cortex (PFC) can be subdivided into different subregions supporting distinct aspects of decision making. However, explanations of neuronal computations within these subregions varies widely across studies. An integrated and mechanistic account of PFC function therefore remains elusive. Resolving these debates demands a rich dataset that directly contrasts neuronal activity across multiple PFC subregions within a single paradigm, whilst experimentally controlling factors such as the order, duration and frequency in which choice options are attended and compared. Here, we contrast neuronal population responses between macaque orbitofrontal (OFC), anterior cingulate (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC) during sequential value-guided information search and choice. From the first fixation of choice-related stimuli, a strong triple dissociation of information encoding emerges in parallel across these PFC subregions. As further information is gathered, population responses in OFC reflect an attention-guided value comparison process. Meanwhile, parallel signals in ACC reflect belief updating in light of new evidence, integration of that evidence to a decision bound, and an emerging action plan for which option should be chosen. Our findings demonstrate the co-existence of multiple, distributed decision-related computations across PFC subregions during value-guided choice. They provide a synthesis of several competing accounts of PFC function.</description>

	<description>Background: On July 18th, 2017, X, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. announced the successor to Google Glass. Glass Enterprise Edition could function as an assistive technology for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet its acceptability, desirability, and the willingness of children with ASD to wear it, are not known. The authors review key issues surrounding smartglasses and social communication, child development, and the school environment. Methods: The smartglasses were evaluated by eight children with ASD, who ranged from moderately non-verbal to verbal, in the context of whether they would desire to wear it and use it as an assistive device each day at their respective schools. Children represented the full range of school ages (6 to 17yrs). Results: All eight children responded that they would want to wear and use Glass Enterprise Edition at school. Additionally, all eight parents said their child had fun during the testing session, and six of eight parents said the experience went better than they had thought. Conclusion: The results show that children with ASD are willing to use Glass Enterprise Edition in a school setting, highlighting its desirability and social acceptability in this population, as well as its future potential as an assistive technology.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Transferring and Generalizing Deep-Learning-based Neural Encoding Models across Subjects</title>

	<description>Recent studies have shown the value of using deep learning models for mapping and characterizing how the brain represents and organizes information for natural vision. However, modeling the relationship between deep learning models and the brain (or encoding models), requires measuring cortical responses to large and diverse sets of natural visual stimuli from single subjects. This requirement limits prior studies to few subjects, making it difficult to generalize findings across subjects or for a population. In this study, we developed new methods to transfer and generalize encoding models across subjects. To train encoding models specific to a subject, the models trained for other subjects were used as the prior models and were refined efficiently using Bayesian inference with a limited amount of data from the specific subject. To train encoding models for a population, the models were progressively trained and updated with incremental data from different subjects. For the proof of principle, we applied these methods to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from three subjects watching tens of hours of naturalistic videos, while deep residual neural network driven by image recognition was used to model the visual cortical processing. Results demonstrate that the methods developed herein provide an efficient and effective strategy to establish subject-specific or population-wide predictive models of cortical representations of high-dimensional and hierarchical visual features.</description>

	<description>Category learning distorts perceptual space by enhancing the discriminability of physically similar yet categorically distinct exemplars. These distortions could in part reflect changes in how sensory neural populations selective for category-defining features encode information. Here, we tested this possibility by using fMRI and EEG to quantify the feature-selective information content of signals measured in early visual cortical areas after participants learned to classify a set of oriented stimuli into discrete categories. Reconstructed representations of orientation in early visual areas were systematically biased by category membership. These biases were strongest for orientations near the category boundary, predicted category discrimination performance, and emerged rapidly after stimulus onset, suggesting that category learning can produce significant changes in how neural populations in early visual areas respond to incoming sensory signals.</description>

With the recent technological developments a vast amount of high-throughput data has been profiled to understand the mechanism of complex diseases. The current bioinformatics challenge is to interpret the data and underlying biology, where efficient algorithms for analyzing heterogeneous high-throughput data using biological networks are becoming increasingly valuable. In this paper, we propose a software package based on the Prize-collecting Steiner Forest graph optimization approach. The PCSF package performs fast and user-friendly network analysis of high-throughput data by mapping the data onto a biological networks such as protein-protein interaction, gene-gene interaction or any other correlation or coexpression based networks. Using the interaction networks as a template, it determines high-confidence subnetworks relevant to the data, which potentially leads to predictions of functional units. It also interactively visualizes the resulting subnetwork with functional enrichment analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/g_v_ITDl4uo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Learning and executing goal-directed choices by internally generated sequences in spiking neural circuits</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by John Palmer, Adam Keane, Pulin Gong&lt;/p&gt;

Recent neural ensemble recordings have established a link between goal-directed spatial decision making and internally generated neural sequences in the hippocampus of rats. To elucidate the synaptic mechanisms of these sequences underlying spatial decision making processes, we develop and investigate a spiking neural circuit model endowed with a combination of two synaptic plasticity mechanisms including spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and synaptic scaling. In this model, the interplay of the combined synaptic plasticity mechanisms and network dynamics gives rise to neural sequences which propagate ahead of the animals’ decision point to reach goal locations. The dynamical properties of these forward-sweeping sequences and the rates of correct binary choices executed by these sequences are quantitatively consistent with experimental observations; this consistency, however, is lost in our model when only one of STDP or synaptic scaling is included. We further demonstrate that such sequence-based decision making in our network model can adaptively respond to time-varying and probabilistic associations of cues and goal locations, and that our model performs as well as an optimal Kalman filter model. Our results thus suggest that the combination of plasticity phenomena on different timescales provides a candidate mechanism for forming internally generated neural sequences and for implementing adaptive spatial decision making.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JtsBqkZhKPk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Time Divergence-Convergence Learning Scheme in Multi-Layer Dynamic Synapse Neural Networks. (arXiv:1707.09046v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09046</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09046</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A new learning scheme called time divergence-convergence (TDC) is proposed
for two-layer dynamic synapse neural networks (DSNN). DSNN is an artificial
neural network model, in which the synaptic transmission is modeled by a
dynamic process and the information between neurons are transmitted through
spike timing. In TDC, the intra-layer neurons of a DSNN are trained to map
input spike trains to a higher dimension of spike trains called a
feature-domain, and the output neurons are trained to build the desired spike
trains by processing the spike timing of intralayer neurons. The DSNN
performance was examined in a jittered spike train classification task which
shows more than 92\% accuracy in classifying different spike trains. The DSNN
performance is comparable with the recurrent multi-layer neural networks and
surpasses a single-layer DSNN with a 22\% margin. Synaptic dynamics have been
proposed as the neural substrate for sub-second temporal processing; we can
utilize TDC to train a DSNN to perform diverse forms of sub-second temporal
processing. The TDC learning proposed here is scalable in terms of the synaptic
adaptation of deeper layers of multi-layer DSNNs. The DSNN along with TDC
learning proposed here can be used in to replicate the processing observed in
neural circuitry and in pattern recognition tasks.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Estimating Excitatory and Inhibitory Synaptic Conductances from Spike Trains using a Recursive Bayesian Approach</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/170878v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/170878v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Inference of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances (SCs) from the spike trains is poorly addressed in the literature due to the complexity of the problem. As recent technological advancements make recording spikes from multiple (neighbor) neurons of a behaving animal (in some rare cases from humans) possible, this paper tackles the problem of estimating SCs solely from the recorded spike trains. Given an ensemble of spikes corresponding to population of neighbor neurons, we aim to infer the average excitatory and inhibitory SCs underlying the shared neural activity. In this paper, we extended our previously established Kalman filtering (KF) based algorithm to incorporate the voltage-to-spike nonlinearity (mapping from membrane potential to spike rate). Having estimated the instantaneous spike rate using optimal linear filtering (Gaussian kernel), our proposed algorithm uses KF followed by expectation maximization (EM) algorithm in a recursive fashion to infer the average SCs. As the dynamics of SCs and membrane potential is included in our model, the proposed algorithm, unlike other related works, considers different sources of stochasticity, i.e., the variabilities of SCs, membrane potential, and spikes. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that our algorithm is blind to the external stimulus, and it performs only based on observed spikes. We validate the accuracy and practicality of our technique through simulation studies where leaky integrate and fire (LIF) model is used to generate spikes. We show that the estimated SCs can precisely track the original ones. Moreover, we show that the performance of our algorithm can be further improved given enough number of trials (spikes). As a rule of thumb, 50 trials of neurons with the average firing rate of 5 Hz can guarantee the accuracy of our proposed algorithm.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Bayesian Optimisation of Large-Scale Biophysical Networks</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/170779v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The relationship between structure and function in the human brain is well established, but not yet well characterised. Large-scale biophysical models allow us to investigate this relationship, by leveraging structural information (e.g. derived from diffusion tractography) in order to couple dynamical models of local neuronal activity into networks of interacting regions distributed across the cortex. In practice however, these models are difficult to parametrise, and their simulation is often delicate and computationally expensive. This undermines the experimental aspect of scientific modelling, and stands in the way of comparing different parametrisations, network architectures, or models in general, with confidence. Here, we advocate the use of Bayesian optimisation for assessing the capabilities of biophysical network models, given a set of desired properties (e.g. band-specific functional connectivity); and in turn the use of this assessment as a principled basis for incremental modelling and model comparison. We adapt an optimisation method designed to cope with costly, high-dimensional, non-convex problems, and demonstrate its use and effectiveness. We find that this method is able to converge to regions of high functional similarity with real MEG data, with very few samples given the number of parameters, without getting stuck in local extrema, and while building and exploiting a map of uncertainty defined smoothly across the parameter space. We compare the results obtained using different methods of structural connectivity estimation from diffusion tractography, and find that one method leads to better simulations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Microbial-host metabolic systems interactions and the gut-brain axis: protective effects of microbial propionate upon the blood-brain barrier</title>

	<description>Gut microbiome composition and function are symbiotically linked with host health, and altered in metabolic, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. Three recognized mechanisms exist by which the microbiome influences the gut-brain axis: modification of autonomic/sensorimotor connections, immune activation, and neuroendocrine pathway regulation. We hypothesized interactions between circulating gut-derived microbial metabolites and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) also contribute to the gut-brain axis. Propionate, produced from dietary substrates by colonic bacteria, stimulates intestinal gluconeogenesis and is associated with reduced stress behaviours, but its potential endocrine role has not been addressed. After demonstrating expression of the propionate receptor FFAR3 on human brain endothelium, we examined the impact of a physiologically relevant propionate concentration (1 M) on BBB properties in vitro. Propionate inhibited pathways associated with non-specific microbial infections via a CD14-dependent mechanism, suppressed expression of LRP-1 and protected the BBB from oxidative stress via NRF2 (NFE2L2) signaling. Together, these results suggest gut-derived microbial metabolites interact with the BBB, representing a fourth facet of the gut-brain axis that warrants further attention.</description>

	<description>Inferring neural mechanisms from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is challenging because the fMRI signal integrates over millions of neurons. One approach is to compare computational models that map neural activity to fMRI responses, to see which best predicts fMRI data. We used this approach to compare four possible neural mechanisms of fMRI adaptation to repeated stimuli (scaling, sharpening, repulsive shifting and attractive shifting), acting across three domains (global, local and remote). Six features of fMRI repetition effects were identified, both univariate and multivariate, from two independent fMRI experiments. After searching over parameter values, only the local scaling model could simultaneously fit all data features from both experiments. Thus fMRI stimulus repetition effects are best captured by down-scaling neuronal tuning curves in proportion to the difference between the stimulus and neuronal preference. These results emphasize the importance of formal modelling for bridging neuronal and fMRI levels of investigation.</description>

It is not known whether vascular amylin deposition is a consequence or a trigger of vascular injury. We tested the hypothesis that the vascular amylin deposits cause endothelial dysfunction and microvascular injury and are modulated by amylin transport in the brain via plasma apolipoproteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

HIP rats have brain microhemorrhages, white matter injury, and neurologic deficits. Vascular amylin deposition provokes loss of endothelial cell coverage and tight junctions. Intravenous infusion in AKO rats of human amylin, or combined human amylin and apolipoprotein E4, showed that amylin binds to plasma apolipoproteins. The intravenous infusion of apolipoprotein E4 exacerbated the brain accumulation of aggregated amylin and vascular pathology in HIP rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Status epilepticus is an emergency; however, prompt treatment of patients with status epilepticus is challenging. Clinical trials, such as the ESETT (Established Status Epilepticus Treatment Trial), compare effectiveness of antiepileptic medications, and rigorous examination of effectiveness of care delivery is similarly warranted. We reviewed the medical literature on observed deviations from guidelines, clinical significance, and initiatives to improve timely treatment. We found pervasive, substantial gaps between recommended and “real-world” practice with regard to timing, dosing, and sequence of antiepileptic therapy. Applying quality improvement methodology at the institutional level can increase adherence to guidelines and may improve patient outcomes. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Our work addresses two key challenges, one biological and one methodological. First, we aim to understand how proliferation and cell migration rates in the intestinal epithelium are related under healthy, damaged (Ara-C treated) and recovering conditions, and how these relations can be used to identify mechanisms of repair and regeneration. We analyse new data, presented in more detail in a companion paper, in which BrdU/IdU cell-labelling experiments were performed under these respective conditions. Second, in considering how to more rigorously process these data and interpret them using mathematical models, we use a probabilistic, hierarchical approach. This provides a best-practice approach for systematically modelling and understanding the uncertainties that can otherwise undermine the generation of reliable conclusions—uncertainties in experimental measurement and treatment, difficult-to-compare mathematical models of underlying mechanisms, and unknown or unobserved parameters. Both spatially discrete and continuous mechanistic models are considered and related via hierarchical conditional probability assumptions. We perform model checks on both in-sample and out-of-sample datasets and use them to show how to test possible model improvements and assess the robustness of our conclusions. We conclude, for the present set of experiments, that a primarily proliferation-driven model suffices to predict labelled cell dynamics over most time-scales.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4Zl7XdCngvY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Self-regulation strategy, feedback timing and hemodynamic properties modulate learning in a simulated fMRI neurofeedback environment</title>

Direct manipulation of brain activity can be used to investigate causal brain-behavior relationships. Current noninvasive neural stimulation techniques are too coarse to manipulate behaviors that correlate with fine-grained spatial patterns recorded by fMRI. However, these activity patterns can be manipulated by having people learn to self-regulate their own recorded neural activity. This technique, known as fMRI neurofeedback, faces challenges as many participants are unable to self-regulate. The causes of this non-responder effect are not well understood due to the cost and complexity of such investigation in the MRI scanner. Here, we investigated the temporal dynamics of the hemodynamic response measured by fMRI as a potential cause of the non-responder effect. Learning to self-regulate the hemodynamic response involves a difficult temporal credit-assignment problem because this signal is both delayed and blurred over time. Two factors critical to this problem are the prescribed self-regulation strategy (cognitive or automatic) and feedback timing (continuous or intermittent). Here, we sought to evaluate how these factors interact with the temporal dynamics of fMRI without using the MRI scanner. We first examined the role of cognitive strategies by having participants learn to regulate a simulated neurofeedback signal using a unidimensional strategy: pressing one of two buttons to rotate a visual grating that stimulates a model of visual cortex. Under these conditions, continuous feedback led to faster regulation compared to intermittent feedback. Yet, since many neurofeedback studies prescribe implicit self-regulation strategies, we created a computational model of automatic reward-based learning to examine whether this result held true for automatic processing. When feedback was delayed and blurred based on the hemodynamics of fMRI, this model learned more reliably from intermittent feedback compared to continuous feedback. These results suggest that different self-regulation mechanisms prefer different feedback timings, and that these factors can be effectively explored and optimized via simulation prior to deployment in the MRI scanner.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZQ5GinhSHsY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Dissociating error-based and reinforcement-based loss functions during sensorimotor learning</title>

It has been proposed that the sensorimotor system uses a loss (cost) function to evaluate potential movements in the presence of random noise. Here we test this idea in the context of both error-based and reinforcement-based learning. In a reaching task, we laterally shifted a cursor relative to true hand position using a skewed probability distribution. This skewed probability distribution had its mean and mode separated, allowing us to dissociate the optimal predictions of an error-based loss function (corresponding to the mean of the lateral shifts) and a reinforcement-based loss function (corresponding to the mode). We then examined how the sensorimotor system uses error feedback and reinforcement feedback, in isolation and combination, when deciding where to aim the hand during a reach. We found that participants compensated differently to the same skewed lateral shift distribution depending on the form of feedback they received. When provided with error feedback, participants compensated based on the mean of the skewed noise. When provided with reinforcement feedback, participants compensated based on the mode. Participants receiving both error and reinforcement feedback continued to compensate based on the mean while repeatedly missing the target, despite receiving auditory, visual and monetary reinforcement feedback that rewarded hitting the target. Our work shows that reinforcement-based and error-based learning are separable and can occur independently. Further, when error and reinforcement feedback are in conflict, the sensorimotor system heavily weights error feedback over reinforcement feedback.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jOE9OkvdHBc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Gene regulatory networks are ultimately encoded by the sequence-specific binding of (TFs) to short DNA segments. Although it is customary to represent the binding specificity of a TF by a position-specific weight matrix (PSWM), which assumes each position within a site contributes independently to the overall binding affinity, evidence has been accumulating that there can be significant dependencies between positions. Unfortunately, methodological challenges have so far hindered the development of a practical and generally-accepted extension of the PSWM model. On the one hand, simple models that only consider dependencies between nearest-neighbor positions are easy to use in practice, but fail to account for the distal dependencies that are observed in the data. On the other hand, models that allow for arbitrary dependencies are prone to overfitting, requiring regularization schemes that are difficult to use in practice for non-experts. Here we present a new regulatory motif model, called dinucleotide weight tensor (DWT), that incorporates arbitrary pairwise dependencies between positions in binding sites, rigorously from first principles, and free from tunable parameters. We demonstrate the power of the method on a large set of ChIP-seq data-sets, showing that DWTs outperform both PSWMs and motif models that only incorporate nearest-neighbor dependencies. We also demonstrate that DWTs outperform two previously proposed methods. Finally, we show that DWTs inferred from ChIP-seq data also outperform PSWMs on HT-SELEX data for the same TF, suggesting that DWTs capture inherent biophysical properties of the interactions between the DNA binding domains of TFs and their binding sites. We make a suite of DWT tools available at dwt.unibas.ch, that allow users to automatically perform ‘motif finding’, i.e. the inference of DWT motifs from a set of sequences, binding site prediction with DWTs, and visualization of DWT ‘dilogo’ motifs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JT2SR82WOJ4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Power spectrum and diffusion of the Amari's neural field. (arXiv:1504.07523v5 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07523</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We study the power spectrum of a space-time dependent neural field which
describes the average membrane potential of neurons in a single layer. This
neural field is modelled by a dissipative integro-differential equation, the
so-called Amari equation. By considering a small perturbation with respect to a
stationary and uniform configuration of the neural field we derive a linearized
equation which is solved for a generic external stimulus by using the Fourier
transform into wavevector-freqency domain, finding an analytical formula for
the power spectrum of the neural field. In the case of an istantaneous and
localized external stimulus, we show that for large frequencies $\omega$ the
power spectrum scales as $1/\omega^2$. In addition, after proving that for
large wavelengths the linearized Amari equation is equivalent to a diffusion
equation which admits space-time dependent analytical solutions, we take into
account the nonlinearity of the Amari equation. We find that for large
wavelengths a weak nonlinearity in the Amari equation gives rise to a
reaction-diffusion equation. For some initial conditions, we discuss analytical
solutions of this reaction-diffusion equation.

Although deep learning approaches have had tremendous success in image, video and audio processing, computer vision, and speech recognition, their applications to three-dimensional (3D) biomolecular structural data sets have been hindered by the geometric and biological complexity. To address this problem we introduce the element-specific persistent homology (ESPH) method. ESPH represents 3D complex geometry by one-dimensional (1D) topological invariants and retains important biological information via a multichannel image-like representation. This representation reveals hidden structure-function relationships in biomolecules. We further integrate ESPH and deep convolutional neural networks to construct a multichannel topological neural network (TopologyNet) for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and protein stability changes upon mutation. To overcome the deep learning limitations from small and noisy training sets, we propose a multi-task multichannel topological convolutional neural network (MM-TCNN). We demonstrate that TopologyNet outperforms the latest methods in the prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities, mutation induced globular protein folding free energy changes, and mutation induced membrane protein folding free energy changes.

Plasma insulin oscillations are known to have physiological importance in the regulation of blood glucose. In insulin-secreting β-cells of pancreatic islets, K(ATP) channels play a key role in regulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion. In addition, they convey oscillations in cellular metabolism to the membrane by sensing adenine nucleotides, and are thus instrumental in mediating pulsatile insulin secretion. Blocking K(ATP) channels pharmacologically depolarizes the β-cell plasma membrane and terminates islet oscillations. Surprisingly, when K(ATP) channels are genetically knocked out, oscillations in islet activity persist, and relatively normal blood glucose levels are maintained. Compensation must therefore occur to overcome the loss of K(ATP) channels in K(ATP) knockout mice. In a companion study, we demonstrated a substantial increase in Kir2.1 protein occurs in β-cells lacking K(ATP) because of SUR1 deletion. In this report, we demonstrate that β-cells of SUR1 null islets have an upregulated inward rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current that helps to compensate for the loss of K(ATP) channels. This current is likely due to the increased expression of Kir2.1 channels. We used mathematical modeling to determine whether an ionic current having the biophysical characteristics of Kir2.1 is capable of rescuing oscillations that are similar in period to those of wild-type islets. By experimentally testing a key model prediction we suggest that Kir2.1 current upregulation is a likely mechanism for rescuing the oscillations seen in islets from mice deficient in K(ATP) channels.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qT_rASktB7w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Growth of bacteria in 3-d colonies</title>

The dynamics of growth of bacterial populations has been extensively studied for planktonic cells in well-agitated liquid culture, in which all cells have equal access to nutrients. In the real world, bacteria are more likely to live in physically structured habitats as colonies, within which individual cells vary in their access to nutrients. The dynamics of bacterial growth in such conditions is poorly understood, and, unlike that for liquid culture, there is not a standard broadly used mathematical model for bacterial populations growing in colonies in three dimensions (3-d). By extending the classic Monod model of resource-limited population growth to allow for spatial heterogeneity in the bacterial access to nutrients, we develop a 3-d model of colonies, in which bacteria consume diffusing nutrients in their vicinity. By following the changes in density of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; in liquid and embedded in glucose-limited soft agar, we evaluate the fit of this model to experimental data. The model accounts for the experimentally observed presence of a sub-exponential, diffusion-limited growth regime in colonies, which is absent in liquid cultures. The model predicts and our experiments confirm that, as a consequence of inter-colony competition for the diffusing nutrients and of cell death, there is a non-monotonic relationship between total number of colonies within the habitat and the total number of individual cells in all of these colonies. This combined theoretical-experimental study reveals that, within 3-d colonies, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; cells are loosely packed, and colonies produce about 2.5 times as many cells as the liquid culture from the same amount of nutrients. We verify that this is because cells in liquid culture are larger than in colonies. Our model provides a baseline description of bacterial growth in 3-d, deviations from which can be used to identify phenotypic heterogeneities and inter-cellular interactions that further contribute to the structure of bacterial communities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bHzgI9SGQqw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Recurrently connected and localized neuronal communities initiate coordinated spontaneous activity in neuronal networks</title>

Developing neuronal systems intrinsically generate coordinated spontaneous activity that propagates by involving a large number of synchronously firing neurons. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, waves of spikes transiently characterize the activity of developing brain circuits and are fundamental for activity-dependent circuit formation. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, coordinated spontaneous spiking activity, or network bursts (NBs), interleaved within periods of asynchronous spikes emerge during the development of 2D and 3D neuronal cultures. Several studies have investigated this type of activity and its dynamics, but how a neuronal system generates these coordinated events remains unclear. Here, we investigate at a cellular level the generation of network bursts in spontaneously active neuronal cultures by exploiting high-resolution multielectrode array recordings and computational network modelling. Our analysis reveals that NBs are generated in specialized regions of the network (functional neuronal communities) that feature neuronal links with high cross-correlation peak values, sub-millisecond lags and that share very similar structural connectivity motifs providing recurrent interactions. We show that the particular properties of these local structures enable locally amplifying spontaneous asynchronous spikes and that this mechanism can lead to the initiation of NBs. Through the analysis of simulated and experimental data, we also show that AMPA currents drive the coordinated activity, while NMDA and GABA currents are only involved in shaping the dynamics of NBs. Overall, our results suggest that the presence of functional neuronal communities with recurrent local connections allows a neuronal system to generate spontaneous coordinated spiking activity events. As suggested by the rules used for implementing our computational model, such functional communities might naturally emerge during network development by following simple constraints on distance-based connectivity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RBdJfX6Zb8Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: mRNA/protein sequence complementarity and its determinants: The impact of affinity scales</title>

It has recently been demonstrated that the nucleobase-density profiles of mRNA coding sequences are related in a complementary manner to the nucleobase-affinity profiles of their cognate protein sequences. Based on this, it has been proposed that cognate mRNA/protein pairs may bind in a co-aligned manner, especially if unstructured. Here, we study the dependence of mRNA/protein sequence complementarity on the properties of the nucleobase/amino-acid affinity scales used. Specifically, we sample the space of randomly generated scales by employing a Monte Carlo strategy with a fitness function that depends directly on the level of complementarity. For model organisms representing all three domains of life, we show that even short searches reproducibly converge upon highly optimized scales, implying that the topology of the underlying fitness landscape is decidedly funnel-like. Furthermore, the optimized scales, generated without any consideration of the physicochemical attributes of nucleobases or amino acids, resemble closely the nucleobase/amino-acid binding affinity scales obtained from experimental structures of RNA-protein complexes. This provides support for the claim that mRNA/protein sequence complementarity may indeed be related to binding between the two. Finally, we characterize suboptimal scales and show that intermediate-to-high complementarity can be reached by substantially diverse scales, but with select amino acids contributing disproportionally. Our results expose the dependence of cognate mRNA/protein sequence complementarity on the properties of the underlying nucleobase/amino-acid affinity scales and provide quantitative constraints that any physical scales need to satisfy for the complementarity to hold.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_qkvCuBSD8s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25004</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To describe the clinical and distinctive imaging features of myelopathy associated with Behçet's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We evaluated the records of patients meeting the following criteria: a) fulfillment of the International Study Group criteria for Behçet's disease; b) clinically suggestive of myelopathy; c) simultaneous spinal cord and brain MRIs within 1 month of acute worsening of myelopathy; d) follow-up duration ≥1 year after initial MRI evaluation. Patients not fulfilling all inclusion criteria and having MRIs with poor quality or missing sequences were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: In 11 patients (9 men, 2 women), we studied 14 MRIs during distinct myelopathy episodes and 9 follow-up MRIs. Two distinct MRI patterns of spinal cord involvement were described according to T2W axial images: 1) “Bagel Sign” pattern: A central lesion with hypo-intense core and hyper-intense rim with or without contrast enhancement; 2) “Motor Neuron” pattern: A symmetric involvement of the anterior horn cells. “Bagel Sign” was present in 13 of 14 myelopathy episodes whereas “Motor Neuron” pattern was observed in 1 of 14 MRIs. Of the 13 MRIs with “Bagel Sign” long myelopathy (n=9), both long and short myelopathy (n=2), and short myelopathy (n=2) was observed. All patterns cleared with some residual lesions after steroid use and immunomodulation with associated clinical recovery in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: The signal characteristics of the “Bagel Sign” potentially represent venous engorgement and/or acute blood products within the spinal cord. To our knowledge, “Bagel Sign” has not been observed in other forms of longitudinal myelopathy outside of BD including neuromyelitis optica. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Seizure activity per se does not induce tissue damage markers in human neocortical focal epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25005</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt; The contribute of recurring seizures to the progression of epileptogenesis is debated. Seizure-induced brain damage is not conclusively demonstrated both in humans and in animal models of epilepsy. We evaluated the expression of brain injury biomarkers on post-surgical brain tissue obtained from 20 patients with frequent seizures and a long history of drug-resistant focal epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt; The expression patterns of specific glial, neuronal and inflammatory molecules was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in the core of type II focal cortical dysplasias (FCD-II), at the FCD boundary (perilesion) and in the adjacent normal-appearing area included in the epileptogenic region. We also analysed surgical specimens from cryptogenic patients not presenting structural alterations at imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt; Astroglial and microglial activation, reduced neuronal density, peri-vascular CD3-positive T lymphocytes clustering and fibrinogen extravasation were demonstrated in the core of FCD-II lesions. No pathological immunoreactivity was observed outside the FCD-II and in cryptogenetic specimens, where the occurrence of interictal and ictal epileptiform activity was confirmed by either stereo-EEG or intraoperative electrocorticography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt; Recurrent seizures do not induce the expression of brain damage markers in non-lesional epileptogenic cortex studied on post-surgical tissue from cryptogenic and FCD patients. This evidence argues against the hypothesis that epileptiform activity &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; contributes to focal brain injury, at least in the neocortical epilepsies here considered.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Combined EEG-fMRI and ESI improves localisation of paediatric focal epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25003</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgical treatment in epilepsy is effective if the epileptogenic zone (EZ) can be correctly localized and characterized. Here we use simultaneous Electroencephalography-functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) data to derive EEG-fMRI and Electrical Source Imaging (ESI) maps. Their yield and their individual and combined ability to 1) localize the epileptogenic zone and 2) predict seizure outcome was then evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-three children with drug-resistant epilepsy underwent EEG-fMRI. Interictal discharges were mapped using both EEG-fMRI haemodynamic responses and Electrical Source Imaging (ESI). A single localization was derived from each individual test (EEG-fMRI global maxima (GM)/ESI maxima) and from the combination of both maps (EEG-fMRI/ESI spatial intersection). To determine the localisation accuracy and its predictive performance the individual and combined test localisations were compared to the presumed EZ and to the postsurgical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-two/53 patients had significant maps; 47/53 for EEG-fMRI; 44/53 for ESI; 34/53 had both. The epileptogenic zone was well characterised in 29 patients; 26 had an EEG-fMRI GM localisation which was correct in 11; 22 patients had ESI localisation which was correct in 17; 12 patients had combined EEG-fMRI and ESI which was correct in 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seizure outcome following resection was correctly predicted by EEG-fMRI GM in 8/20 patients, by the ESI maxima in 13/16. The combined EEG-fMRI/ESI region entirely predicted outcome in 9/9 patients including 3 with no lesion visible on MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;EEG-fMRI combined with ESI provides a simple unbiased localisation that may predict surgery better than each individual test including in MRI-negative patients.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A double blind, placebo-controlled study of rituximab in patients with stiff person syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25002</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25002</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Stiff-Person Syndrome (SPS), an antibody-mediated impaired GABAergic neurotransmission is believed to cause muscle stiffness and spasms. Patients improve with GABA-enhancing drugs and IVIg, but several respond poorly and remain disabled. The need for more effective therapy prompted a trial with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a placebo-controlled randomized trial of rituximab (two bi-weekly infusions of 1gr each). The primary outcome was a change in stiffness scores at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were changes in heightened-sensitivity and quality of life scores. Enrolling 24 patients was calculated to detect 50% change in stiffness scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randomization was balanced for age, sex, disease duration and GAD autoantibody titers. No significant changes were noted at 6 months after treatment in all outcomes. Specifically, no differences were noted in the stiffness index, the primary outcome, or sensitivity scores, the secondary outcome, at 3 or 6 months. Quality of life scores improved significantly (p&amp;lt;0.01) at 3 months in both groups, but not at 6 months, denoting an early placebo effect. Blinded self-assessment rating of the overall stiffness for individual patients revealed improvement in four patients in each group. At 6 months, improvement persisted in one patient in the placebo group vs. three out of 4 in the rituximab group, where these meaningful improvements were also captured by video recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the largest controlled trial conducted in SPS patients demonstrating no statistically significant difference in the efficacy measures between rituximab and placebo. The lack of rituximab's efficacy could be due to a considerable placebo effect; insensitivity of scales to quantify stiffness especially in the less severely affected patients; or drug effectiveness only in a small patient subset.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Networks of randomly connected neurons are among the most popular models in
theoretical neuroscience. The connectivity between neurons in the cortex is
however not fully random, the simplest and most prominent deviation from
randomness found in experimental data being the overrepresentation of
bidirectional connections among pyramidal cells. Using numerical and analytical
methods, we investigated the effects of partially symmetric connectivity on
dynamics in networks of rate units. We considered the two dynamical regimes
exhibited by random neural networks: the weak-coupling regime, where the firing
activity decays to a single fixed point unless the network is stimulated, and
the strong-coupling or chaotic regime, characterized by internally generated
fluctuating firing rates. In the weak-coupling regime, we computed analytically
for an arbitrary degree of symmetry the auto-correlation of network activity in
presence of external noise. In the chaotic regime, we performed simulations to
determine the timescale of the intrinsic fluctuations. In both cases, symmetry
increases the characteristic asymptotic decay time of the autocorrelation
function and therefore slows down the dynamics in the network.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Temporal lobe surgical resection brings seizure remission in up to 80% of
patients, with long-term complete seizure freedom in 41%. However, it is
unclear how surgery impacts on the structural white matter network, and how the
network changes relate to seizure outcome. We used white matter fibre
tractography on preoperative diffusion MRI to generate a structural white
matter network, and postoperative T1-weighted MRI to retrospectively infer the
impact of surgical resection on this network. We then applied graph theory and
machine learning to investigate the properties of change between the
preoperative and predicted postoperative networks. Temporal lobe surgery had a
modest impact on global network efficiency, despite the disruption caused. This
was due to alternative shortest paths in the network leading to widespread
increases in betweenness centrality post-surgery. Measurements of network
change could retrospectively predict seizure outcomes with 79% accuracy and 65%
specificity, which is twice as high as the empirical distribution. Fifteen
connections which changed due to surgery were identified as useful for
prediction of outcome, eight of which connected to the ipsilateral temporal
pole. Our results suggest that the use of network change metrics may have
clinical value for predicting seizure outcome. This approach could be used to
prospectively predict outcomes given a suggested resection mask using
preoperative data only.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a matrix-factorization algorithm that scales to input matrices
with both huge number of rows and columns. Learned factors may be sparse or
dense and/or non-negative, which makes our algorithm suitable for dictionary
learning, sparse component analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization. Our
algorithm streams matrix columns while subsampling them to iteratively learn
the matrix factors. At each iteration, the row dimension of a new sample is
reduced by subsampling, resulting in lower time complexity compared to a simple
streaming algorithm. Our method comes with convergence guarantees to reach a
stationary point of the matrix-factorization problem. We demonstrate its
efficiency on massive functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data (2 TB), and on
patches extracted from hyperspectral images (103 GB). For both problems, which
involve different penalties on rows and columns, we obtain significant
speed-ups compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a practical approach to addressing limitations posed by
use of single active electrodes in applications for sleep stage classification.
Electroencephalography (EEG)-based characterizations of sleep stage progression
contribute the diagnosis and monitoring of the many pathologies of sleep.
Several prior reports have explored ways of automating the analysis of sleep
EEG and of reducing the complexity of the data needed for reliable
discrimination of sleep stages in order to make it possible to perform sleep
studies at lower cost in the home (rather than only in specialized clinical
facilities). However, these reports have involved recordings from electrodes
placed on the cranial vertex or occiput, which can be uncomfortable or
difficult for subjects to position. Those that have utilized single EEG
channels which contain less sleep information, have showed poor classification
performance. We have taken advantage of Rectifier Neural Network for feature
detection and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequential data
learning to optimize classification performance with single electrode
recordings. After exploring alternative electrode placements, we found a
comfortable configuration of a single-channel EEG on the forehead and have
shown that it can be integrated with additional electrodes for simultaneous
recording of the electroocuolgram (EOG). Evaluation of data from 62 people
(with 494 hours sleep) demonstrated better performance of our analytical
algorithm for automated sleep classification than existing approaches using
vertex or occipital electrode placements. Use of this recording configuration
with neural network deconvolution promises to make clinically indicated home
sleep studies practical.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Clinical Facts Along With a Feedback Control Perspective Suggest That Increased Response Time Might be the Cause of Parkinsonian Rest Tremor. (arXiv:1403.0296v3 [q-bio.QM] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
increased response times leading to a variety of biomechanical symptoms such as
tremors, stooping and gait instability. Although the deterioration in
biomechanical control can intuitively be related to sluggish response times,
how the delay leads to such biomechanical symptoms as tremor is not yet
understood. Only recently has it been explained from the perspective of
feedback control theory that delay beyond a threshold can be the cause of
Parkinsonian tremor [1]. This paper correlates several observations from this
perspective to clinical facts and reinforces them with simple numerical and
experimental examples. This work provides a framework towards developing a
deeper conceptual understanding of the mechanism behind PD symptoms.
Furthermore, it lays a foundation for developing tools for diagnosis and
progress tracking of the disease by identifying some key trends.

OpenMM is a molecular dynamics simulation toolkit with a unique focus on extensibility. It allows users to easily add new features, including forces with novel functional forms, new integration algorithms, and new simulation protocols. Those features automatically work on all supported hardware types (including both CPUs and GPUs) and perform well on all of them. In many cases they require minimal coding, just a mathematical description of the desired function. They also require no modification to OpenMM itself and can be distributed independently of OpenMM. This makes it an ideal tool for researchers developing new simulation methods, and also allows those new methods to be immediately available to the larger community.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2d0q0lhNXr0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Trade or sharing that moves infectious planting material between farms can, for vertically-transmitted plant diseases, act as a significant force for dispersal of pathogens, particularly where the extent of material movement may be greater than that of infected vectors or inoculum. The network over which trade occurs will then effect dispersal, and is important to consider when attempting to control the disease. We consider the difference that planting material exchange can make to successful control of cassava brown streak disease, an important viral disease affecting one of Africa's staple crops. We use a mathematical model of smallholders’ fields to determine the effect of informal trade on both the spread of the pathogen and its control using clean-seed systems, determining aspects that could limit the damage caused by the disease. In particular, we identify the potentially detrimental effects of markets, and the benefits of a community-based approach to disease control.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3-AOPyaPHvI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The perceptual representation of individual faces is often explained with reference to a norm-based face space. In such spaces, individuals are encoded as vectors where identity is primarily conveyed by direction and distinctiveness by eccentricity. Here we measured human fMRI responses and psychophysical similarity judgments of individual face exemplars, which were generated as realistic 3D animations using a computer-graphics model. We developed and evaluated multiple neurobiologically plausible computational models, each of which predicts a representational distance matrix and a regional-mean activation profile for 24 face stimuli. In the fusiform face area, a face-space coding model with sigmoidal ramp tuning provided a better account of the data than one based on exemplar tuning. However, an image-processing model with weighted banks of Gabor filters performed similarly. Accounting for the data required the inclusion of a measurement-level population averaging mechanism that approximates how fMRI voxels locally average distinct neuronal tunings. Our study demonstrates the importance of comparing multiple models and of modeling the measurement process in computational neuroimaging.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SUiQg1Y4lJ4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A comparison of single-trial EEG classification and EEG-informed fMRI across three MR compatible EEG recording systems. (arXiv:1707.08077v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to non-invasively measure the
spatiotemporal dynamics of the human brain. One challenge is dealing with the
artifacts that each modality introduces into the other when the two are
recorded concurrently, for example the ballistocardiogram (BCG). We conducted a
preliminary comparison of three different MR compatible EEG recording systems
and assessed their performance in terms of single-trial classification of the
EEG when simultaneously collecting fMRI. We found tradeoffs across all three
systems, for example varied ease of setup and improved classification accuracy
with reference electrodes (REF) but not for pulse artifact subtraction (PAS) or
reference layer adaptive filtering (RLAF).

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Functional connectivity patterns of autism spectrum disorder identified by deep feature learning. (arXiv:1707.07932v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07932</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07932</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is regarded as a brain disease with globally
disrupted neuronal networks. Even though fMRI studies have revealed abnormal
functional connectivity in ASD, they have not reached a consensus of the
disrupted patterns. Here, a deep learning-based feature extraction method
identifies multivariate and nonlinear functional connectivity patterns of ASD.
Resting-state fMRI data of 972 subjects (465 ASD 507 normal controls) acquired
from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange were used. A functional
connectivity matrix of each subject was generated using 90 predefined brain
regions. As a data-driven feature extraction method without prior knowledge
such as subjects diagnosis, variational autoencoder (VAE) summarized the
functional connectivity matrix into 2 features. Those feature values of ASD
patients were statistically compared with those of controls. A feature was
significantly different between ASD and normal controls. The extracted features
were visualized by VAE-based generator which can produce virtual functional
connectivity matrices. The ASD-related feature was associated with
frontoparietal connections, interconnections of the dorsal medial frontal
cortex and corticostriatal connections. It also showed a trend of negative
correlation with full-scale IQ. A data-driven feature extraction based on deep
learning could identify complex patterns of functional connectivity of ASD.
This approach will help discover complex patterns of abnormalities in brain
connectivity in various brain disorders.

	<description>As we recently reviewed [1], studies from at least six laboratories now indicate that neurons rather than astrocytes are the major sources for D-serine and preferentially express its synthetic enzyme, serine racemase (SR), in the normal brain [1]. We described how several unforeseen artifacts misled established scientists (including ourselves) into believing that serine racemase and D-serine are localized exclusively to astrocytes and represent prima face exemplars of gliotransmission. We were concerned that the purported astrocytic source of D-serine was being perpetuated to this day, despite compelling evidence to the contrary published over the past decade [1].</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A mixture of sparse coding models explaining properties of face neurons related to holistic and parts-based processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005667</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Haruo Hosoya, Aapo Hyvärinen&lt;/p&gt;

Experimental studies have revealed evidence of both parts-based and holistic representations of objects and faces in the primate visual system. However, it is still a mystery how such seemingly contradictory types of processing can coexist within a single system. Here, we propose a novel theory called mixture of sparse coding models, inspired by the formation of category-specific subregions in the inferotemporal (IT) cortex. We developed a hierarchical network that constructed a mixture of two sparse coding submodels on top of a simple Gabor analysis. The submodels were each trained with face or non-face object images, which resulted in separate representations of facial parts and object parts. Importantly, evoked neural activities were modeled by Bayesian inference, which had a top-down explaining-away effect that enabled recognition of an individual part to depend strongly on the category of the whole input. We show that this explaining-away effect was indeed crucial for the units in the face submodel to exhibit significant selectivity to face images over object images in a similar way to actual face-selective neurons in the macaque IT cortex. Furthermore, the model explained, qualitatively and quantitatively, several tuning properties to facial features found in the middle patch of face processing in IT as documented by Freiwald, Tsao, and Livingstone (2009). These included, in particular, tuning to only a small number of facial features that were often related to geometrically large parts like face outline and hair, preference and anti-preference of extreme facial features (e.g., very large/small inter-eye distance), and reduction of the gain of feature tuning for partial face stimuli compared to whole face stimuli. Thus, we hypothesize that the coding principle of facial features in the middle patch of face processing in the macaque IT cortex may be closely related to mixture of sparse coding models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Lg2uKR4gUHg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restrengthening of the residual language network is likely to be crucial for speech recovery in poststroke aphasia. Eight participants with chronic aphasia received intensive speech therapy for 3 weeks, with standardized naming tests and brain magnetic resonance imaging before and after therapy. Kurtosis-based diffusion tensor tractography was used to measure mean kurtosis (MK) along a segment of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). Therapy-related reduction in the number of semantic but not phonemic errors was associated with strengthening (renormalization) of ILF MK (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = −0.90, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 corrected), suggesting that speech recovery is related to structural plasticity of language-specific components of the residual language network.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A novel cause of chronic viral meningoencephalitis: Cache Valley virus</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24982-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunodeficient patients are particularly vulnerable to neuroinvasive infections that can be challenging to diagnose. Metagenomic next generation sequencing can identify unusual or novel microbes and is therefore well suited for investigating the etiology of chronic meningoencephalitis in immunodeficient patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24982-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We present the case of a 34-year-old man with X-linked agammaglobulinemia from Australia suffering from 3 years of meningoencephalitis that defied an etiologic diagnosis despite extensive conventional testing, including a brain biopsy. Metagenomic next generation sequencing of his cerebrospinal fluid and brain biopsy tissue was performed to identify a causative pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24982-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sequences aligning to multiple Cache Valley virus genes were identified via metagenomic next generation sequencing. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry subsequently confirmed the presence of Cache Valley virus in the brain biopsy tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24982-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cache Valley virus, a mosquito-borne orthobunyavirus, has only been identified in 3 immunocompetent North American patients with acute neuroinvasive disease. The reported severity ranges from a self-limiting meningitis to a rapidly fatal meningoencephalitis with multiorgan failure. The virus has never been known to cause a chronic systemic or neurologic infection in humans. Cache Valley virus has also never previously been detected on the Australian continent. Our research subject traveled to North and South Carolina and Michigan in the weeks prior to the onset of his illness. This report demonstrates that metagenomic next generation sequencing allows for unbiased pathogen identification, the early detection of emerging viruses as they spread to new locales, and the discovery of novel disease phenotypes.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24981-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incontinentia pigmenti&lt;/em&gt; (IP) is a genetic disease leading to severe neurological symptoms, such as epileptic seizures, but no specific treatment is available. IP is caused by pathogenic variants that inactivate the &lt;em&gt;Nemo&lt;/em&gt; gene. Replacing &lt;em&gt;Nemo&lt;/em&gt; through gene therapy might provide therapeutic benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24981-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a mouse model of IP, we administered a single intravenous dose of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, AAV-BR1-CAG-NEMO, delivering the &lt;em&gt;Nemo&lt;/em&gt; gene to the brain endothelium. Spontaneous epileptic seizures and the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) were monitored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24981-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The endothelium-targeted gene therapy improved the integrity of the BBB. In parallel, it reduced the incidence of seizures and delayed their occurrence. Neonate mice intravenously injected with the AAV-BR1-CAG-NEMO vector developed no hepatocellular carcinoma or other major adverse effects 11 months after vector injection, demonstrating that the vector has a favorable safety profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain: A biomarker of survival for C9ORF72-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As potential treatments for &lt;em&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/em&gt;-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (c9ALS) approach clinical trials, the identification of prognostic biomarkers for c9ALS becomes a priority. We show that levels of phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNFH) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) predict disease status and survival in c9ALS patients, and are largely stable over time. Moreover, c9ALS patients exhibit higher pNFH levels, more rapid disease progression, and shorter survival after disease onset than ALS patients without &lt;em&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/em&gt; expansions. These data support the use of CSF pNFH as a prognostic biomarker for clinical trials, which will increase the likelihood of successfully developing a treatment for c9ALS.

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24979-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients were identified through service neural autoantibody evaluation. Ninety-five had longitudinal follow-up (7–456 months; median = 35).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24979-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 3,910 patients tested, 196 were LGI1-IgG positive, 51 were CASPR2-IgG positive, and 9 were dual positive. Cerebrospinal fluid testing was less sensitive than serum testing, detecting only 24 of 38 (63%) LGI1-IgG–positive and 5 of 6 (83%) CASPR2-IgG–positive patients. LGI1-IgG–positive specimens had higher voltage-gated potassium channel–IgG immunoprecipitation values (0.33nmol/l, range = 0.02–5.14) than CASPR2-IgG–positive specimens (0.10nmol/l, range = 0.00–0.45, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Of patients presenting with pain or peripheral nervous system (PNS) manifestations, 39% were LGI1-IgG seropositive (7% had solely neuropathy or pain). Multivariate analysis identified age as the only significant predictor of central nervous system (CNS) versus PNS involvement (&amp;gt;50 years; odds ratio = 15, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Paroxysmal dizziness spells (PDS), a unique LGI1-IgG accompaniment (14% of patients), frequently delayed the diagnosis. T2-mesiotemporal hyperintensity was more common in LGI1-IgG–positive (41%) than in CASPR2-IgG–positive patients (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.033). T1-bright basal ganglia were confined to LGI1-IgG–positive patients with faciobrachial–dystonic seizures (9 of 39, 31%). Cancer was found in 44% of LGI1-IgG/CASPR2-IgG dual seropositive patients (one-third thymoma). Response to initial immunotherapy was favorable in 97%; mean modified Rankin score was 3 (range = 1–5) at onset and 1.74 (range = 0–6) at last follow-up, with 9% having severe refractory disability, 20% being asymptomatic, 28% receiving immunotherapy, and 58% receiving antiepileptic medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24979-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older age is a strong predictor of CNS involvement in patients seropositive for CASPR2-IgG or LGI1-IgG. Pain, peripheral manifestations, and stereotypic paroxysmal dizziness spells are common with LGI1-IgG. Response to initial immunotherapy is often favorable, but some patients remain severely disabled, requiring long-term immunotherapy and/or antiepileptic medications.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We investigated the association of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related rare variants &lt;em&gt;APP&lt;/em&gt; A673T and &lt;em&gt;ABCA7&lt;/em&gt; rs200538373-C with the levels of β-amyloid (Aβ) and parameters of metabolic and cardiovascular health in a population-based cohort of healthy middle-aged and elderly men. Carriers of protective &lt;em&gt;APP&lt;/em&gt; A673T variant had, on average, 28% lower levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in plasma as compared to the controls and the carriers of &lt;em&gt;ABCA7&lt;/em&gt; rs200538373-C. This is the first report to show decreased Aβ levels in plasma in &lt;em&gt;APP&lt;/em&gt; A673T carriers and thus provides evidence that lower Aβ levels throughout life may be protective against AD.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A simple blood test expedites the diagnosis of glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) deficiency syndrome (GLUT1-DS) leads to a wide range of neurological symptoms. Ketogenic diets are very efficient to control epilepsy and movement disorders. We tested a novel simple and rapid blood test in 30 patients with GLUT1-DS with predominant movement disorders, 18 patients with movement disorders attributed to other genetic defects, and 346 healthy controls. We detected significantly reduced GLUT1 expression only on red blood cells from patients with GLUT1-DS (23 patients; 78%), including patients with inconclusive genetic analysis. This test opens perspectives for the screening of GLUT1-DS in children and adults with cognitive impairment, movement disorder, or epilepsy.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Epileptic networks in action: Synchrony between distant hemodynamic responses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24973</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24973-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural and functional imaging studies in focal epilepsy often reveal distributed regions of abnormality. These are interpreted as representing the existence of epileptic networks, but the presence of actual neuronal interactions between these regions has not been demonstrated. We sought to determine whether the distributed hemodynamic responses often seen in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of scalp interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) actually correspond to synchronized neuronal activities when examining the intracerebral electroencephalogram (iEEG) at distant nodes of the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24973-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We studied 28 patients who underwent first EEG-fMRI and then iEEG, and had significant hemodynamic responses in the gray matter. We coregistered the hemodynamic responses to the iEEG electrode contact positions and analyzed synchrony, measured by correlation, between IEDs recorded by iEEG in regions with and without hemodynamic responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24973-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The synchrony of intracerebral IED activity between pairs of regions showing a hemodynamic response was higher compared to that between pairs of regions without (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and between pairs of regions, one with and one without hemodynamic response (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). These differences were found during the interictal periods with IEDs but were absent during the interictal periods without IEDs. Higher synchrony was also observed between regions involved at seizure onset (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24973-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;EEG-fMRI studies are unique in their ability to reveal hemodynamic concomitants of IEDs anywhere in the brain. This study proves that iEEG activity is synchronized between these regions of hemodynamic response, thus demonstrating the existence of an actual neuronally based interictal epileptic network. This also validates the EEG-fMRI approach to reveal this network noninvasively. Ann Neurol 2017;82:57–66&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Serum insulin-like growth factor-I levels are associated with improved white matter recovery after traumatic brain injury</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24971-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common disabling condition with limited treatment options. Diffusion tensor imaging measures recovery of axonal injury in white matter (WM) tracts after TBI. Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) after TBI may impair axonal and neuropsychological recovery, and serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) may mediate this effect. We conducted a longitudinal study to determine the effects of baseline serum IGF-I concentrations on WM tract and neuropsychological recovery after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24971-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-nine adults after TBI (84.6% male, median age = 30.5 years, 87.2% moderate–severe, median time since TBI = 16.3 months, n = 4 with GHD) were scanned twice, 13.3 months (range = 12.1–14.9) apart, and 35 healthy controls were scanned once. Symptom and quality of life questionnaires and cognitive assessments were completed at both visits (n = 33). Our main outcome measure was fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of WM tract integrity, in a priori regions of interest: splenium of corpus callosum (SPCC) and posterior limb of internal capsule (PLIC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24971-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At baseline, FA was reduced in many WM tracts including SPCC and PLIC following TBI compared to controls, indicating axonal injury, with longitudinal increases indicating axonal recovery. There was a significantly greater increase in SPCC FA over time in patients with serum IGF-I above versus below the median for age. Only the higher IGF-I group had significant improvements in immediate verbal memory recall over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24971-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;WM recovery and memory improvements after TBI were greater in patients with higher serum IGF-I at baseline. These findings suggest that the growth hormone/IGF-I system may be a potential therapeutic target following TBI. Ann Neurol 2017;82:30–43&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Chance, long tails, and inference: a non-Gaussian, Bayesian theory of vocal learning in songbirds. (arXiv:1707.07247v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07247</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07247</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional theories of sensorimotor learning posit that animals use sensory
error signals to find the optimal motor command in the face of Gaussian sensory
and motor noise. However, most such theories cannot explain common behavioral
observations, for example that smaller sensory errors are more readily
corrected than larger errors and that large abrupt (but not gradually
introduced) errors lead to weak learning. Here we propose a new theory of
sensorimotor learning that explains these observations. The theory posits that
the animal learns an entire probability distribution of motor commands rather
than trying to arrive at a single optimal command, and that learning arises via
Bayesian inference when new sensory information becomes available. We test this
theory using data from a songbird, the Bengalese finch, that is adapting the
pitch (fundamental frequency) of its song following perturbations of auditory
feedback using miniature headphones. We observe the distribution of the sung
pitches to have long, non-Gaussian tails, which, within our theory, explains
the observed dynamics of learning. Further, the theory makes surprising
predictions about the dynamics of the shape of the pitch distribution, which we
confirm experimentally.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Long-time analytic approximation of large stochastic oscillators: Simulation, analysis and inference</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005676</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/lQP3vGwRoEk/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Giorgos Minas, David A. Rand&lt;/p&gt;

In order to analyse large complex stochastic dynamical models such as those studied in systems biology there is currently a great need for both analytical tools and also algorithms for accurate and fast simulation and estimation. We present a new stochastic approximation of biological oscillators that addresses these needs. Our method, called phase-corrected LNA (pcLNA) overcomes the main limitations of the standard Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) to remain uniformly accurate for long times, still maintaining the speed and analytically tractability of the LNA. As part of this, we develop analytical expressions for key probability distributions and associated quantities, such as the Fisher Information Matrix and Kullback-Leibler divergence and we introduce a new approach to system-global sensitivity analysis. We also present algorithms for statistical inference and for long-term simulation of oscillating systems that are shown to be as accurate but much faster than leaping algorithms and algorithms for integration of diffusion equations. Stochastic versions of published models of the circadian clock and NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B system are used to illustrate our results.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lQP3vGwRoEk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Vidaki et al. provide evidence that Mena, an actin regulator, forms a ribonucleoprotein complex in neurons, which involves translational repressors HnrnpK and PCBP1, and is required for local translation of dyrk1a and potentially other associated mRNAs in developing axons.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Microglia play a part in protein clearance and synaptic pruning. This latter process is re-activated in Alzheimer disease (AD) and promoted by amyloid-β (Aβ). A screen of 18 AD-associated genes revealed that loss of the DNA–RNA binding protein TDP43 led to a considerable increase in &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mice, the ventricular–subventricular zone (V–SVZ) continuously produces neural stem cells (NSCs). Proopiomelanocortin-expressing (POMC+) neurons of the hypothalamus were found to project selectively to anterior ventral (AV) regions of the V–SVZ. Ablation of these neurons decreased NSC proliferation selectively in the AV V–SVZ, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory traces of long-term auditory fear memories are stored in the auditory cortex. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are stable components of the extracellular matrix that could potentially provide a scaffold for long-term synaptic plasticity. In a model of auditory fear conditioning, mRNAs encoding three lecticans — &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Vocal learning is an exclusively human trait among primates. However, songbirds demonstrate behavioral features resembling human speech learning. Two circuits have a preeminent role in this human behavior; namely, the corticostriatal and the cerebrocerebellar motor loops. While the striatal contribution can be traced back to the avian anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), the sensorimotor adaptation functions of the cerebellum appear to be human specific in acoustic communication. This review contributes to an ongoing discussion on how birdsong translates into human speech.</description>

	<description>In a recent study, Ebitz and Moore described how subthreshold electrical microstimulation of the macaque frontal eye fields (FEF) modulates the pupillary light reflex. This elegant study suggests that the influence of the FEF and prefrontal cortex on attentional modulation of cortical visual processing extends to the subcortical circuit that mediates a very basic reflex, the pupillary light reflex.</description>

	<description>Specific forms of firing rate correlations can limit efficient information coding in neuronal populations. How this is mitigated is an important topic of current research. A novel study shows that increasing cortical acetylcholine (ACh) levels alter specific aspects of the population correlation structure, which in turn improves population-coding abilities.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: The Lateral Habenula and Adaptive Behaviors</title>

	<description>The evolutionarily conserved lateral habenula (LHb) enables dynamic responses to continually changing contexts and environmental conditions. A model is proposed to account for greater mnemonic and contextual control over LHb-mediated response flexibility as vertebrate brains became more complex. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) provides instructions for context-specific responses to LHb, which assesses the extent to which this response information matches the motivation or internal state of the individual.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Efficient Prevention of Neurodegenerative Diseases by Depletion of Starvation Response Factor Ataxin-2</title>

	<description>Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) homologs exist in all eukaryotic organisms and may have contributed to their origin. Apart from a role in endocytosis, they are known for global effects on mRNA repair and ribosomal translation. Cell size, protein synthesis, and fat and glycogen storage are repressed by ATXN2 via mTORC1 signaling. However, specific liver mitochondrial matrix enzymes and the mitochondrial repair factor PINK1 require ATXN2 abundance. During periods of starvation, ATXN2 is transcriptionally induced and localized to cytosolic stress granules, where nuclear factors dock to compensate RNA pathology.</description>

	<description>The human brain undergoes rapid growth in both structure and function from infancy through early childhood, and this significantly influences cognitive and behavioral development in later life. A newly emerging research framework, developmental connectomics, provides unprecedented opportunities for exploring the developing brain through non-invasive mapping of structural and functional connectivity patterns. Within this framework, we review recent neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies investigating connectome development from 20 postmenstrual weeks to 5 years of age.</description>

	<description>The quest to comprehend genetic, biological, and symptomatic heterogeneity underlying Alzheimer’s disease (AD) requires a deep understanding of mechanisms affecting complex brain systems. Neuroimaging genetics is an emerging field that provides a powerful way to analyze and characterize intermediate biological phenotypes of AD. Here, we describe recent studies showing the differential effect of genetic risk factors for AD on brain functional connectivity in cognitively normal, preclinical, prodromal, and AD dementia individuals.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Frans B. M. de Waal &amp;amp; Stephanie D. Preston&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research on empathy in humans and other mammals seeks to dissociate emotional and cognitive empathy. These forms, however, remain interconnected in evolution, across species and at the level of neural mechanisms.

&lt;p&gt;The past decade has witnessed a consolidation and refinement of the extraordinary progress made in taste research. This Review describes recent advances in our understanding of taste receptors, taste buds, and the connections between taste buds and sensory afferent fibres. The article discusses new findings &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Brice A Kuhl &amp;amp; Nicole M Long&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A computational model explains how memories of past rewards guide value-based choices. Incorporating behavioral and functional MRI evidence, the findings indicate that 'sampling' from individual memories of past rewards influences choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Michael Hirth, Jagadeesh Gandla &amp;amp; Rohini Kuner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The checkpoint pathway consisting of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and its receptor, PD-1, modulates immune function in cancer and infection, but unexpectedly, it also silences pain signals in nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Qi Fang &amp;amp; Huizhong W Tao&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disruption of retinal direction selectivity reveals both peripheral and central computations contributing to direction selectivity in mouse visual cortex. These mechanisms work together to better encode motion directions and speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: László Acsády&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most thalamic research has focused on sensory transmission. Now three independent groups reveal the thalamus to be critical in behaviors linked to frontal cortex and the maintenance of persistent cortical activity during delays.&lt;/p&gt;
