	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Feature Purification: How Adversarial Training Performs Robust Deep Learning. (arXiv:2005.10190v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10190</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10190</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the great empirical success of adversarial training to defend deep
learning models against adversarial perturbations, so far, it still remains
rather unclear what the principles are behind the existence of adversarial
perturbations, and what adversarial training does to the neural network to
remove them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present a principle that we call &quot;feature purification&quot;,
where we show the existence of adversarial examples are due to the accumulation
of certain &quot;dense mixtures&quot; in the hidden weights during the training process
of a neural network; and more importantly, one of the goals of adversarial
training is to remove such mixtures to &quot;purify&quot; hidden weights. We present both
experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset to illustrate this principle, and a
Theoretical Result proving that for certain natural classification tasks,
training a two-layer neural network with ReLU activation using randomly
initialized gradient descent indeed satisfies this principle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, we give, to the best of our knowledge, the first result proving
that the following two can hold simultaneously for training a neural network
with ReLU activation. (1) Training over the original data is indeed non-robust
to small adversarial perturbations of some radius. (2) Adversarial training,
even with an empirical perturbation algorithm such as FGM, can in fact be
provably robust against ANY perturbations of the same radius. Finally, we also
prove a complexity lower bound, showing that low complexity models such as
linear classifiers, low-degree polynomials, or even the neural tangent kernel
for this network, CANNOT defend against perturbations of this same radius, no
matter what algorithms are used to train them.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Decoding behavior, perception, or cognitive state directly from neural
signals has applications in brain-computer interface research as well as
implications for systems neuroscience. In the last decade, deep learning has
become the state-of-the-art method in many machine learning tasks ranging from
speech recognition to image segmentation. The success of deep networks in other
domains has led to a new wave of applications in neuroscience. In this article,
we review deep learning approaches to neural decoding. We describe the
architectures used for extracting useful features from neural recording
modalities ranging from spikes to EEG. Furthermore, we explore how deep
learning has been leveraged to predict common outputs including movement,
speech, and vision, with a focus on how pretrained deep networks can be
incorporated as priors for complex decoding targets like acoustic speech or
images. Deep learning has been shown to be a useful tool for improving the
accuracy and flexibility of neural decoding across a wide range of tasks, and
we point out areas for future scientific development.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most current research in the domain of image compression focuses solely on
achieving state of the art compression ratio, but that is not always usable in
today's workflow due to the constraints on computing resources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constant market requirements for a low-complexity image codec have led to the
recent development and standardization of a lightweight image codec named JPEG
XS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work we show that JPEG XS compression can be adapted to a specific
given task and content, such as preserving visual quality on desktop content or
maintaining high accuracy in neural network segmentation tasks, by optimizing
its gain and priority parameters using the covariance matrix adaptation
evolution strategy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social, supervised, learning from others might amplify individual, possibly
unsupervised, learning by individuals, and might underlie the development and
evolution of culture. We studied a minimal model of the interaction of
individual unsupervised and social supervised learning by interacting agents.
Agents attempted to learn to track a hidden fluctuation &quot;source&quot;, which,
linearly mixed with other masking fluctuations, generated observable input
vectors. Learning was driven either solely by direct observation of inputs
(unsupervised, Hebbian) or, in addition, by observation of another agent's
output (supervised, Delta rule). To enhance biological realism, the learning
rules were made slightly connection-inspecific, so that incorrect learning
sometimes occurs. We found that social interaction can foster both correct and
incorrect learning. Useful social learning therefore presumably involves
additional factors some of which we outline.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Flying insects are capable of vision-based navigation in cluttered
environments, reliably avoiding obstacles through fast and agile maneuvers,
while being very efficient in the processing of visual stimuli. Meanwhile,
autonomous micro air vehicles still lag far behind their biological
counterparts, displaying inferior performance at a much higher energy
consumption. In light of this, we want to mimic flying insects in terms of
their processing capabilities, and consequently show the efficiency of this
approach in the real world. This letter does so through evolving spiking neural
networks for controlling landings of micro air vehicles using optical flow
divergence from a downward-looking camera. We demonstrate that the resulting
neuromorphic controllers transfer robustly from a highly abstracted simulation
to the real world, performing fast and safe landings while keeping network
spike rate minimal. Furthermore, we provide insight into the resources required
for successfully solving the problem of divergence-based landing, showing that
high-resolution control can be learned with only a single spiking neuron. To
the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to integrate spiking neural
networks in the control loop of a real-world flying robot. Videos of the
experiments can be found at https://bit.ly/neuro-controller .

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Rapid Quantification of White Matter Disconnection in the Human Brain. (arXiv:2002.09035v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With an estimated five million new stroke survivors every year and a rapidly
aging population suffering from hyperintensities and diseases of presumed
vascular origin that affect white matter and contribute to cognitive decline,
it is critical that we understand the impact of white matter damage on brain
structure and behavior. Current techniques for assessing the impact of lesions
consider only location, type, and extent, while ignoring how the affected
region was connected to the rest of the brain. Regional brain function is a
product of both local structure and its connectivity. Therefore, obtaining a
map of white matter disconnection is a crucial step that could help us predict
the behavioral deficits that patients exhibit. In the present work, we
introduce a new practical method for computing lesion-based white matter
disconnection maps that require only moderate computational resources. We
achieve this by creating diffusion tractography models of the brains of healthy
adults and assessing the connectivity between small regions. We then interrupt
these connectivity models by projecting patients' lesions into them to compute
predicted white matter disconnection. A quantified disconnection map can be
computed for an individual patient in approximately 35 seconds using a single
core CPU-based computation. In comparison, a similar quantification performed
with other tools provided by MRtrix3 takes 5.47 minutes.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accurate identification of brain function is necessary to understand the
neurobiology of cognitive ageing, and thereby promote well-being across the
lifespan. A common tool used to investigate neurocognitive ageing is functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, although fMRI data are often
interpreted in terms of neuronal activity, the blood-oxygen-level-dependent
(BOLD) signal measured by fMRI includes contributions of both vascular and
neuronal factors, which change differentially with age. While some studies
investigate vascular ageing factors, the results of these studies are not well
known within the field of neurocognitive ageing and therefore vascular
confounds in neurocognitive fMRI studies are common. In contrast to over 10,000
BOLD-fMRI papers on ageing, fewer than 20 have applied techniques to correct
for vascular effects. However, neurovascular ageing is not only a confound in
fMRI, but an important feature in its own right, to be assessed alongside
measures of neuronal ageing. We review current approaches to dissociate
neuronal and vascular components of BOLD-fMRI of regional activity and
functional connectivity. We highlight emerging evidence that vascular
mechanisms in the brain do not simply control blood flow to support the
metabolic needs of neurons, but form complex neurovascular interactions that
influence neuronal function in health and disease.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Analysis of Railway Accidents' Narratives Using Deep Learning. (arXiv:1810.07382v3 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07382</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Automatic understanding of domain specific texts in order to extract useful
relationships for later use is a non-trivial task. One such relationship would
be between railroad accidents' causes and their correspondent descriptions in
reports. From 2001 to 2016 rail accidents in the U.S. cost more than $4.6B.
Railroads involved in accidents are required to submit an accident report to
the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). These reports contain a variety of
fixed field entries including primary cause of the accidents (a coded variable
with 389 values) as well as a narrative field which is a short text description
of the accident. Although these narratives provide more information than a
fixed field entry, the terminologies used in these reports are not easy to
understand by a non-expert reader. Therefore, providing an assisting method to
fill in the primary cause from such domain specific texts(narratives) would
help to label the accidents with more accuracy. Another important question for
transportation safety is whether the reported accident cause is consistent with
narrative description. To address these questions, we applied deep learning
methods together with powerful word embeddings such as Word2Vec and GloVe to
classify accident cause values for the primary cause field using the text in
the narratives. The results show that such approaches can both accurately
classify accident causes based on report narratives and find important
inconsistencies in accident reporting.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 21 May 2020; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16227-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-020-16227-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Solar-driven CO2 reduction by abundant water to alcohols is hindered by the sluggish water oxidation reaction. Here, the authors demonstrate that the microwave-synthesized carbon-dots possess unique hole-accepting nature, allowing stoichiometric oxygen and methanol production from water and CO2 with nearly 100% selectivity to methanol.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/xQse5TOt7zU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Functional Neuroanatomy of the Human Accommodation Response to an “E” Target Varying from -3 to -6 Diopters</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00029</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00029</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: We aimed to identify the functional brain networks involved in the regulation of visual accommodation by contrasting the cortical functional areas evoked by foveal fixation to an “E” target, which were subservient to the accommodation responses to a -3/-6 diopter stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Neural activity was assessed in healthy volunteers by changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-five right-handed subjects viewed the “E” target presented in a hierarchical block design. They participated in two monocular tasks: (i) sustained foveal fixation upon an “E” target on a white background at 33 cm (-3.03D accommodative demand); and (ii) sustained fixation through an attached -3D concave lens (-6D accommodative demand) in front of the fixated eye; each condition cycled through a standard alternating 30-s eye open/30-s eye closed design to provide the BOLD contrast. The total sustained period was 480 s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The contrast between the -3D and the rest condition revealed activation in the occipital lobe (Lingual gyrus, Cuneus, Calcarine_L, and Calcarine_R); cerebellum (Cerebellum_Crus1_L and Cerebellum_6_L); precentral lobe (Precentral_R); frontal lobe (Frontal_Inf_Oper_R and Frontal_Mid_R); and cingulate cortex (Cingulum_Ant_L). With the -3D concave lenses (-6D accommodative demand) in front of the fixated eye, the voxel size and peak intensity of activation in the occipital lobe and cerebellum were greater than with the -3D accommodative demand; emergent activated brain areas included the parietal lobe (bilateral precuneus gyrus and right supramarginal gyrus); the precentral lobe and cingulate cortex failed to reach the threshold in the -6D vs. rest contrast. In the -3D and -6D contrast comparison, the frontal lobe (Frontal_Sup_Medial_L) and parietal lobe (Precuneus_L and Precuneus_R) passed the significance threshold of cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) correction. The mean activation in the -3D and -6D contrast revealed an incremental summation of the activations than that found in the previous -3D vs. rest and -6D vs. rest comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Neural circuits were selectively activated during the -3D/-6D accommodative response to blur cues. Cognitive-perceptual processing is involved in signal regulation of ocular accommodative functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Chronic Bumetanide Infusion Alters Young Neuron Morphology in the Dentate Gyrus Without Affecting Contextual Fear Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00514</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00514</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Young neurons in the adult brain are key to some types of learning and memory. They integrate in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus contributing to such cognitive processes following timely developmental events. While experimentally impairing GABAergic transmission through the blockade or elimination of the ionic cotransporter NKCC1 leads to alterations in the proper maturation of young neurons, it is still unknown if the in vivo administration of common use diuretic drugs that block the cotransporter, alters the development of young hippocampal neurons and affects DG-related functions. In this study, we delivered chronically and intracerebroventricularly the NKCC1 blocker bumetanide to young-adult rats. We analyzed doublecortin density and development parameters (apical dendrite length and angle and dendritic arbor length) in doublecortin positive neurons from different subregions in the DG and evaluated the performance of animals in contextual fear learning and memory. Our results show that in bumetanide-treated subjects, doublecortin density is diminished in the infra and suprapyramidal blades of the DG; the length of primary dendrites is shortened in the infrapyramidal blade and; the growth angle of primary dendrites in the infrapyramidal blade is different from control animals. Behaviorally, treated animals showed the typical learning curve in a contextual fear task, and freezing-time displayed during contextual fear memory was not different from controls. Thus, in vivo icv delivery of bumetanide negatively alters DCX density associated to young neurons and its proper development but not to the extent of affecting a DG dependent task as aversive context learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Emerging Roles of Dysregulated MicroRNAs in Myasthenia Gravis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00507</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00507</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare acquired autoimmune neuromuscular disease. Autoantibodies, cellular immunity, complement, and cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of MG. It is characterized by the dysfunction of neuromuscular junction transmission and skeletal muscle weakness. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small molecule ribonucleic acids that regulate various biological processes (e.g., development, differentiation, and immunity) at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels of gene expression. miRNAs play an important regulatory role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including MG. In recent studies, the functional mechanisms underlying the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of MG have received increasing attention. miRNAs are highly stable and have high specificity in peripheral body fluids. Therefore, the miRNAs in body fluids may represent promising biomarkers for determining the prognosis of MG and the efficacy of treatment. This article reviews the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of MG, highlights the potential of miRNAs as new biomarkers for the diagnosis of MG, and deepens our understanding of disease processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: LRRK2 at the Interface Between Peripheral and Central Immune Function in Parkinson’s</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00443</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00443</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is becoming increasingly accepted that there is an interplay between the peripheral immune response and neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Mutations in the leucine-rich-repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are associated with familial and sporadic cases of PD but are also found in immune-related disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and leprosy. Furthermore, LRRK2 has been associated with bacterial infections such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella typhimurium. Recent evidence suggests a role of LRRK2 in the regulation of the immune system and modulation of inflammatory responses, at a systemic level, with LRRK2 functionally implicated in both the immune system of the central nervous system (CNS) and the periphery. It has therefore been suggested that peripheral immune signaling may play an important role in the regulation of neurodegeneration in LRRK2 as well as non-LRRK2-associated PD. This review will discuss the current evidence for this hypothesis and will provide compelling rationale for placing LRRK2 at the interface between peripheral immune responses and neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A 3D Fully Convolutional Neural Network With Top-Down Attention-Guided Refinement for Accurate and Robust Automatic Segmentation of Amygdala and Its Subnuclei</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00260</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00260</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in deep learning have improved the segmentation accuracy of subcortical brain structures, which would be useful in neuroimaging studies of many neurological disorders. However, most existing deep learning based approaches in neuroimaging do not investigate the specific difficulties that exist in segmenting extremely small but important brain regions such as the subnuclei of the amygdala. To tackle this challenging task, we developed a dual-branch dilated residual 3D fully convolutional network with parallel convolutions to extract more global context and alleviate the class imbalance issue by maintaining a small receptive field that is just the size of the regions of interest (ROIs). We also conduct multi-scale feature fusion in both parallel and series to compensate the potential information loss during convolutions, which has been shown to be important for small objects. The serial feature fusion enabled by residual connections is further enhanced by a proposed top-down attention-guided refinement unit, where the high-resolution low-level spatial details are selectively integrated to complement the high-level but coarse semantic information, enriching the final feature representations. As a result, the segmentations resulting from our method are more accurate both volumetrically and morphologically, compared with other deep learning based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first deep learning-based approach that targets the subregions of the amygdala. We also demonstrated the feasibility of using a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to harmonize multi-site MRI data, and show that our method generalizes well to challenging traumatic brain injury (TBI) datasets collected from multiple centers. This appears to be a promising strategy for image segmentation for multiple site studies and increased morphological variability from significant brain pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Corticomotor Excitability Changes Associated With Freezing of Gait in People With Parkinson Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00190</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00190</link>
	<description>Background and Purpose&lt;p&gt;Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating gait disorder in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). While various neuroimaging techniques have been used to investigate the pathophysiology of FOG, changes in corticomotor excitability associated with FOG have yet to be determined. Research to date has not concluded if changes in corticomotor excitability are associated with gait disturbances in this patient population. This study aimed to use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate corticomotor excitability changes associated with FOG. Furthermore, the relationship between corticomotor excitability and gait performances would be determined.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Eighteen participants with PD and FOG (PD + FOG), 15 without FOG (PD − FOG), and 15 non-disabled adults (Control) were recruited for this study. Single and paired-pulse TMS paradigms were used to assess corticospinal and intracortical excitability, respectively. Gait performance was measured by the 10-Meter-Walk test. Correlation analysis was performed to evaluate relationships between TMS outcomes and gait parameters.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with the Control group, the PD + FOG group showed a significantly lower resting motor threshold and reduced short intracortical inhibition (SICI). Correlation analysis revealed a relationship between resting motor evoked potential and step length, and between SICI and walking velocity in the Control group. While the silent period correlated with step length in the PD − FOG group, no significant relationship was observed in the PD + FOG group.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion and Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Compared to the Control group, the PD + FOG group exhibited reduced corticomotor inhibition. Distinct correlations observed among the three groups suggest that the function of the corticomotor system plays an important role in mediating walking ability in non-disabled adults and people with PD − FOG, while people with PD + FOG may rely on neural networks other than the corticomotor system to control gait.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Empathy-Related Brain Activity in Somatosensory Cortex Protects From Tactile Priming Effects: A Pilot Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00142</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00142</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Empathy influences how we perceive, understand, and interact with our social environment. Previous studies suggested a network of different brain regions as a neural substrate for empathy, including, in particular, insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In addition, a contribution of the somatosensory cortices for this empathy related network has been suggested. This is remarkable, given that other recent studies have revealed a role for the somatosensory cortex in various social tasks. For example, in experiments using tactile priming, incidental haptic sensations are found to influence judgment recommendations. Here, we aimed to test if this engagement of the somatosensory cortices during tactile priming can be predicted by the participant’s empathy personality traits. We assessed participant’s empathy and personality traits by means of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and NEO-FFI and tested whether trait empathy is associated with the tactile priming effect in social judgments. Results revealed that empathy predicted the tactile priming effect negatively. This was accompanied by a reduced engagement of the somatosensory cortex, which has been shown to be associated with the priming effect. We conclude that empathy seems to protect people from tactile priming effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor Acts on Distinctive Hypothalamic Arcuate Neurons and Promotes Leptin Entry Into and Action on the Mouse Hypothalamus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00140</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00140</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In humans and experimental animals, the administration of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) reduces food intake and body weight. To gain further insights into the mechanism(s) underlying its satiety effect, we: (i) evaluated the CNTF-dependent activation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway in mouse models where neuropeptide Y (NPY) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons can be identified by green fluorescent protein (GFP); and (ii) assessed whether CNTF promotes leptin signaling in hypothalamic feeding centers. Immunohistochemical experiments enabled us to establish that intraperitoneal injection of mouse recombinant CNTF activated the JAK2-STAT3 pathway in a substantial proportion of arcuate nucleus (ARC) NPY neurons (18.68% ± 0.60 in 24-h fasted mice and 25.50% ± 1.17 in fed mice) but exerted a limited effect on POMC neurons (4.15% ± 0.33 in 24-h fasted mice and 2.84% ± 0.45 in fed mice). CNTF-responsive NPY neurons resided in the ventromedial ARC, facing the median eminence (ME), and were surrounded by albumin immunoreactivity, suggesting that they are located outside the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In both normally fed and high-fat diet (HFD) obese animals, CNTF activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in ME β1- and β2-tanycytes, an effect that has been linked to the promotion of leptin entry into the brain. Accordingly, compared to the animals treated with leptin, mice treated with leptin/CNTF showed: (i) a significantly greater leptin content in hypothalamic protein extracts; (ii) a significant increase in phospho-STAT3 (P-STAT3)-positive neurons in the ARC and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus of normally fed mice; and (iii) a significantly increased number of P-STAT3-positive neurons in the ARC and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus of HFD obese mice. Collectively, these data suggest that exogenously administered CNTF reduces food intake by exerting a leptin-like action on distinctive NPY ARC neurons and by promoting leptin signaling in hypothalamic feeding centers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia, the innate immune effector cells of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), are involved in the development, homeostasis, and pathology of CNS. Microglia become activated in response to various insults and injuries and protect the CNS by phagocytosing the invading pathogens, dead neurons, and other cellular debris. Recent studies have demonstrated that the epigenetic mechanisms ensure the coordinated regulation of genes involved in microglial activation. In this study, we performed a microRNA (miRNA) microarray in activated primary microglia derived from rat pup’s brain and identified differentially expressed miRNAs targeting key genes involved in cell survival, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses. Interestingly, miR-142-3p, one of the highly up-regulated miRNAs in microglia upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated activation, compared to untreated primary microglia cells was predicted to target Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin dependent kinase 2a (CAMK2A). Further, luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-142-3p targets the 3′UTR of Camk2a. CAMK2A has been implicated in regulating the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular mechanism underlying memory and learning. Given this, this study further focused on understanding the miR-142-3p mediated regulation of the CAMK2A-BDNF pathway via Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) in activated microglia. The results revealed that CAMK2A was downregulated in activated microglia, suggesting an inverse relationship between miR-142-3p and Camk2a in activated microglia. Overexpression of miR-142-3p in microglia was found to decrease the expression of CAMK2A and subsequently BDNF through regulation of CREB phosphorylation. Functional analysis through shRNA-mediated stable knockdown of CAMK2A in microglia confirmed that the regulation of BDNF by miR-142-3p is via CAMK2A. Overall, this study provides a database of differentially expressed miRNAs in activated primary microglia and reveals that microglial miR-142-3p regulates the CAMK2A-CREB-BDNF pathway which is involved in synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Laser Lesion in the Mouse Visual Cortex Induces a Stem Cell Niche-Like Extracellular Matrix, Produced by Immature Astrocytes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is characterized by a severely limited regeneration capacity. Comparison with lower species like amphibians, which are able to restore even complex tissues after damage, indicates the presence of an inhibitory environment that restricts the cellular response in mammals. In this context, signals provided by the extracellular matrix (ECM) are important regulators of events like cell survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation or neurite outgrowth. Therefore, knowledge of the post-lesional ECM and of cells that produce these factors might support development of new treatment strategies for patients suffering from traumatic brain injury and other types of CNS damage. In the present study, we analyzed the surround of focal infrared laser lesions of the adult mouse visual cortex. This lesion paradigm avoids direct contact with the brain, as the laser beam passes the intact bone. Cell type-specific markers revealed a distinct spatial distribution of different astroglial subtypes in the penumbra after injury. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as marker for reactive astrocytes was found broadly up-regulated, whereas the more immature markers vimentin and nestin were only expressed by a subset of cells. Dividing astrocytes could be identified via the proliferation marker Ki-67. Different ECM molecules, among others the neural stem cell-associated glycoprotein tenascin-C and the DSD-1 chondroitin sulfate epitope, were found on astrocytes in the penumbra. Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) and aggrecan as markers for perineuronal nets, a specialized ECM limiting synaptic plasticity, appeared normal in the vicinity of the necrotic lesion core. In sum, expression of progenitor markers by astrocyte subpopulations and the identification of proliferating astrocytes in combination with an ECM that contains components typically associated with neural stem/progenitor cells suggest that an immature cell fate is facilitated as response to the injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Safety and Efficacy of 630-nm Red Light on Cognitive Function in Older Adults With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00143</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00143</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Studies have shown that excess formaldehyde accumulation in the brain accelerates cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recently, reports from our research team revealed that red light treatment (RLT) improved memory in AD mice by activating formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH) and thus reducing formaldehyde levels. Here, we developed a medical RLT device to investigate the safety and efficacy of this device in older adults with mild to moderate AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will include 60 participants who will be recruited and randomly divided into an RLT group and a control group. The RLT group will receive RLT intervention 5 days a week for 30 min each time for 24 weeks while the control group will continue their routine treatments without RLT. All participants will undergo neuropsychological and functional assessments including the Mini-Mental State Examination, the AD assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the Barthel Index at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. All participants will undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning and blood/urine biomarkers tests at baseline and 24 weeks. The primary outcome will be the ADAS-cog score while the secondary outcomes will be the GDS and NPI scores. Adverse events will be recorded and treated when necessary. Both an intention-to-treat analysis and a per-protocol analysis will be performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RLT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: This protocol outlines the objectives of the study and explained the RLT device developed by the research team. The study is designed as an RCT to evaluate the safety and effects of the RLT device on older adults with mild to moderate AD. This study will provide evidence for the clinical use of RLT on treatment for AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, ChiCTR1800020163; Pre-results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment Using Convolutional Neural Network: Temporal-Feature Maps of Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00141</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the clinical precursor of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is considered the most common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. Some MCI patients tend to remain stable over time and do not evolve to AD. It is essential to diagnose MCI in its early stages and provide timely treatment to the patient. In this study, we propose a neuroimaging approach to identify MCI using a deep learning method and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). For this purpose, fifteen MCI subjects and nine healthy controls (HCs) were asked to perform three mental tasks: N-back, Stroop, and verbal fluency (VF) tasks. Besides examining the oxygenated hemoglobin changes (ΔHbO) in the region of interest, ΔHbO maps at 13 specific time points (i.e., 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65 s) during the tasks and seven temporal feature maps (i.e., two types of mean, three types of slope, kurtosis, and skewness) in the prefrontal cortex were investigated. A four-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied to identify the subjects into either MCI or HC, individually, after training the CNN model with ΔHbO maps and temporal feature maps above. Finally, we used the 5-fold cross-validation approach to evaluate the performance of the CNN. The results of temporal feature maps exhibited high classification accuracies: The average accuracies for the N-back task, Stroop task, and VFT, respectively, were 89.46, 87.80, and 90.37%. Notably, the highest accuracy of 98.61% was achieved from the ΔHbO slope map during 20–60 s interval of N-back tasks. Our results indicate that the fNIRS imaging approach based on temporal feature maps is a promising diagnostic method for early detection of MCI and can be used as a tool for clinical doctors to identify MCI from their patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: A moth odorant receptor highly expressed in the ovipositor is involved in detecting host-plant volatiles</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53706</guid>

	<description>Antennae are often considered to be the nostrils of insects. Here, we sequenced the transcriptome of the pheromone gland-ovipositor complex of &lt;i&gt;Helicoverpa assulta&lt;/i&gt; and discovered that an odorant receptor (OR) gene, &lt;i&gt;HassOR31&lt;/i&gt;, had much higher expression in the ovipositor than in antennae or other tissues. To determine whether the ovipositor was involved in odorant detection, we co-expressed &lt;i&gt;HassOR31&lt;/i&gt; and its co-receptor, &lt;i&gt;HassORco&lt;/i&gt;, in a &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocyte model system, and demonstrated that the OR was responsive to 12 plant odorants, especially Z-3-hexenyl butyrate. These odorants elicited electrophysiological responses of some sensilla in the ovipositor, and &lt;i&gt;HassOR31&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HassORco&lt;/i&gt; were co-expressed within ovipositor sensilla. Two oviposition preference experiments showed that female moths lacking antennae still preferentially selected oviposition sites containing plant volatiles. We suggest that the expression of &lt;i&gt;HassOR31&lt;/i&gt; in the ovipositor of &lt;i&gt;H. assulta&lt;/i&gt; helps females to determine precise egg-laying sites in host plants.</description>

	<title>eLife: Axon-dependent expression of YAP/TAZ mediates Schwann cell remyelination but not proliferation after nerve injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.50138</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50138</link>
	<description>Previously we showed that YAP/TAZ promote not only proliferation but also differentiation of immature Schwann cells (SCs), thereby forming and maintaining the myelin sheath around peripheral axons (Grove et al., 2017). Here we show that YAP/TAZ are required for mature SCs to restore peripheral myelination, but not to proliferate, after nerve injury. We find that YAP/TAZ dramatically disappear from SCs of adult mice concurrent with axon degeneration after nerve injury. They reappear in SCs only if axons regenerate. YAP/TAZ ablation does not impair SC proliferation or transdifferentiation into growth promoting repair SCs. SCs lacking YAP/TAZ, however, fail to upregulate myelin-associated genes and completely fail to remyelinate regenerated axons. We also show that both YAP and TAZ are redundantly required for optimal remyelination. These findings suggest that axons regulate transcriptional activity of YAP/TAZ in adult SCs and that YAP/TAZ are essential for functional regeneration of peripheral nerve.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Modelling the dynamics of tuberculosis lesions in a virtual lung: Role of the bronchial tree in endogenous reinfection</title>

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that still causes more than 1.5 million deaths annually. The World Health Organization estimates that around 30% of the world’s population is latently infected. However, the mechanisms responsible for 10% of this reserve (i.e., of the latently infected population) developing an active disease are not fully understood, yet. The dynamic hypothesis suggests that endogenous reinfection has an important role in maintaining latent infection. In order to examine this hypothesis for falsifiability, an agent-based model of growth, merging, and proliferation of TB lesions was implemented in a computational bronchial tree, built with an iterative algorithm for the generation of bronchial bifurcations and tubes applied inside a virtual 3D pulmonary surface. The computational model was fed and parameterized with computed tomography (CT) experimental data from 5 latently infected minipigs. First, we used CT images to reconstruct the virtual pulmonary surfaces where bronchial trees are built. Then, CT data about TB lesion’ size and location to each minipig were used in the parameterization process. The model’s outcome provides spatial and size distributions of TB lesions that successfully reproduced experimental data, thus reinforcing the role of the bronchial tree as the spatial structure triggering endogenous reinfection. A sensitivity analysis of the model shows that the final number of lesions is strongly related with the endogenous reinfection frequency and maximum growth rate of the lesions, while their mean diameter mainly depends on the spatial spreading of new lesions and the maximum radius. Finally, the model was used as an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; experimental platform to explore the transition from latent infection to active disease, identifying two main triggering factors: a high inflammatory response and the combination of a moderate inflammatory response with a small breathing amplitude.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/48zZq2xcYt8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: GCNCDA: A new method for predicting circRNA-disease associations based on Graph Convolutional Network Algorithm</title>

Numerous evidences indicate that Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely involved in the occurrence and development of diseases. Identifying the association between circRNAs and diseases plays a crucial role in exploring the pathogenesis of complex diseases and improving the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. However, due to the complex mechanisms between circRNAs and diseases, it is expensive and time-consuming to discover the new circRNA-disease associations by biological experiment. Therefore, there is increasingly urgent need for utilizing the computational methods to predict novel circRNA-disease associations. In this study, we propose a computational method called GCNCDA based on the deep learning Fast learning with Graph Convolutional Networks (FastGCN) algorithm to predict the potential disease-associated circRNAs. Specifically, the method first forms the unified descriptor by fusing disease semantic similarity information, disease and circRNA Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel similarity information based on known circRNA-disease associations. The FastGCN algorithm is then used to objectively extract the high-level features contained in the fusion descriptor. Finally, the new circRNA-disease associations are accurately predicted by the Forest by Penalizing Attributes (Forest PA) classifier. The 5-fold cross-validation experiment of GCNCDA achieved 91.2% accuracy with 92.78% sensitivity at the AUC of 90.90% on circR2Disease benchmark dataset. In comparison with different classifier models, feature extraction models and other state-of-the-art methods, GCNCDA shows strong competitiveness. Furthermore, we conducted case study experiments on diseases including breast cancer, glioma and colorectal cancer. The results showed that 16, 15 and 17 of the top 20 candidate circRNAs with the highest prediction scores were respectively confirmed by relevant literature and databases. These results suggest that GCNCDA can effectively predict potential circRNA-disease associations and provide highly credible candidates for biological experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sxyqcAr41hA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (Mtb), the causative infectious agent of tuberculosis (TB), kills more individuals per year than any other infectious agent. Granulomas, the hallmark of Mtb infection, are complex structures that form in lungs, composed of immune cells surrounding bacteria, infected cells, and a caseous necrotic core. While granulomas serve to physically contain and immunologically restrain bacteria growth, some granulomas are unable to control Mtb growth, leading to bacteria and infected cells leaving the granuloma and disseminating, either resulting in additional granuloma formation (local or non-local) or spread to airways or lymph nodes. Dissemination is associated with development of active TB. It is challenging to experimentally address specific mechanisms driving dissemination from TB lung granulomas. Herein, we develop a novel hybrid multi-scale computational model, &lt;i&gt;MultiGran&lt;/i&gt;, that tracks Mtb infection within multiple granulomas in an entire lung. &lt;i&gt;MultiGran&lt;/i&gt; follows cells, cytokines, and bacterial populations within each lung granuloma throughout the course of infection and is calibrated to multiple non-human primate (NHP) cellular, granuloma, and whole-lung datasets. We show that &lt;i&gt;MultiGran&lt;/i&gt; can recapitulate patterns of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; local and non-local dissemination, predict likelihood of dissemination, and predict a crucial role for multifunctional CD8+ T cells and macrophage dynamics for preventing dissemination.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s01vVoOJjxc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Developing methods for anticipating the emergence or reemergence of infectious diseases is both important and timely; however, traditional model-based approaches are stymied by uncertainty surrounding the underlying drivers. Here, we demonstrate an operational, mechanism-agnostic detection algorithm for disease (re-)emergence based on early warning signals (EWSs) derived from the theory of critical slowing down. Specifically, we used computer simulations to train a supervised learning algorithm to detect the dynamical footprints of (re-)emergence present in epidemiological data. Our algorithm was then challenged to forecast the slowly manifesting, spatially replicated reemergence of mumps in England in the mid-2000s and pertussis post-1980 in the United States. Our method successfully anticipated mumps reemergence 4 years in advance, during which time mitigation efforts could have been implemented. From 1980 onwards, our model identified resurgent states with increasing accuracy, leading to reliable classification starting in 1992. Additionally, we successfully applied the detection algorithm to 2 vector-transmitted case studies, namely, outbreaks of dengue serotypes in Puerto Rico and a rapidly unfolding outbreak of plague in 2017 in Madagascar. Taken together, these findings illustrate the power of theoretically informed machine learning techniques to develop early warning systems for the (re-)emergence of infectious diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MMgEqDRtzdE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: GAD2 Expression Defines a Class of Excitatory Lateral Habenula Neurons in Mice that Project to the Raphe and Pontine Tegmentum</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The lateral habenula (LHb) sends complex projections to several areas of the mesopontine tegmentum, the raphe, and the hypothalamus. However, few markers have been available to distinguish subsets of LHb neurons that may serve these pathways. In order to address this complexity, we examined the mouse and rat LHb for neurons that express the GABA biosynthesis enzymes glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) and GAD2, and the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). The mouse LHb contains a population of neurons that express GAD2, while the rat LHb contains discrete populations of neurons that express GAD1 and VGAT. However, we could not detect single neurons in either species that co-express a GABA synthetic enzyme and VGAT, suggesting that these LHb neurons do not use GABA for conventional synaptic transmission. Instead, all of the neuronal types expressing a GABAergic marker in both species showed co-expression of the glutamate transporter VGluT2. Anterograde tract-tracing of the projections of GAD2-expressing LHb neurons in &lt;i&gt;Gad2&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, combined with retrograde tracing from selected downstream nuclei, show that LHb-GAD2 neurons project selectively to the midline structures in the mesopontine tegmentum, including the median raphe (MnR) and nucleus incertus (NI), and only sparsely innervate the hypothalamus, rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Postsynaptic recording of LHb-GAD2 neuronal input to tegmental neurons confirms that glutamate, not GABA, is the fast neurotransmitter in this circuit. Thus, GAD2 expression can serve as a marker for functional studies of excitatory neurons serving specific LHb output pathways in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Response-Related Signals Increase Confidence But Not Metacognitive Performance</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Confidence judgments are a central tool in metacognition research. In a typical task, participants first perform perceptual (first-order) decisions and then rate their confidence in these decisions. The relationship between confidence and first-order accuracy is taken as a measure of metacognitive performance. Confidence is often assumed to stem from decision-monitoring processes alone, but processes that co-occur with the first-order decision may also play a role in confidence formation. In fact, some recent studies have revealed that directly manipulating motor regions in the brain, or the time of first-order decisions relative to second-order decisions, affects confidence judgments. This finding suggests that confidence could be informed by a readout of reaction times in addition to decision-monitoring processes. To test this possibility, we assessed the contribution of response-related signals to confidence and, in particular, to metacognitive performance (i.e., a measure of the adequacy of these confidence judgments). In human volunteers, we measured the effect of making an overt (vs covert) decision, as well as the effect of pairing an action to the stimulus about which the first-order decision is made. Against our expectations, we found no differences in overall confidence or metacognitive performance when first-order responses were covert as opposed to overt. Further, actions paired to visual stimuli presented led to higher confidence ratings, but did not affect metacognitive performance. These results suggest that confidence ratings do not always incorporate motor information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Local brain signal variability [SD of the BOLD signal (SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt;]] correlates with age and cognitive performance, and recently differentiated Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients from healthy controls. However, it is unknown whether changes to SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; precede diagnosis of AD or mild cognitive impairment. We compared ostensibly healthy older adult humans who scored below the recommended threshold on the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) and who showed reduced medial temporal lobe (MTL) volume in a previous study (&quot;at-risk&quot; group, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20), with healthy older adults who scored within the normal range on the MoCA (&quot;control&quot; group, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20). Using multivariate partial least-squares analysis we assessed the correlations between SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; and age, MoCA score, global fractional anisotropy, global mean diffusivity, and four cognitive factors. Greater SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; in the MTL and occipital cortex positively correlated with performance on cognitive control/speed tasks but negatively correlated with memory scores in the control group. These relations were weaker in the at-risk group. A &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; analysis assessed associations between MTL volumes and SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; in both groups. This revealed a negative correlation, most robust in the at-risk group, between MTL SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; and MTL subregion volumetry, particularly the entorhinal and parahippocampal regions. Together, these results suggest that the association between SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; and cognition differs between the at-risk and control groups, which may be because of lower MTL volumes in the at-risk group. Our data indicate relations between MTL SD&lt;sub&gt;BOLD&lt;/sub&gt; and cognition may be helpful in understanding brain differences in individuals who may be at risk for further cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Social aggression, such as domestic violence, has been associated with a reduced ability to take on others’ perspectives. In this naturalistic imaging study, we investigated whether training human participants to take on a first-person embodied perspective during the experience of domestic violence enhances the identification with the victim and elicits brain activity associated with the monitoring of the body and surrounding space and the experience of threat. We combined fMRI measurements with preceding virtual reality exposure from either first-person perspective (1PP) or third-person perspective (3PP) to manipulate whether the domestic abuse stimulus was perceived as directed to oneself or another. We found that 1PP exposure increased body ownership and identification with the virtual victim. Furthermore, when the stimulus was perceived as directed toward oneself, the brain network that encodes the bodily self and its surrounding space was more strongly synchronized across participants and connectivity increased from premotor cortex (PM) and intraparietal sulcus towards superior parietal lobe. Additionally, when the stimulus came near the body, brain activity in the amygdala (AMG) strongly synchronized across participants. Exposure to 3PP reduced synchronization of brain activity in the personal space network, increased modulation of visual areas and strengthened functional connectivity between PM, supramarginal gyrus and primary visual cortex. In conclusion, our results suggest that 1PP embodiment training enhances experience from the viewpoint of the virtual victim, which is accompanied by synchronization in the fronto-parietal network to predict actions toward the body and in the AMG to signal the proximity of the stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine (DA) plays a crucial role in the control of motor and higher cognitive functions such as learning, working memory, and decision making. The primary motor cortex (M1), which is essential for motor control and the acquisition of motor skills, receives dopaminergic inputs in its superficial and deep layers from the midbrain. However, the precise action of DA and DA receptor subtypes on the cortical microcircuits of M1 remains poorly understood. The aim of this work was to investigate in mice how DA, through the activation of D2-like receptors (D2Rs), modulates the cellular and synaptic activity of M1 parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVINs) which are crucial to regulate the spike output of pyramidal neurons (PNs). By combining immunofluorescence, &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiology, pharmacology and optogenetics approaches, we show that D2R activation increases neuronal excitability of PVINs and GABAergic synaptic transmission between PVINs and PNs in Layer V of M1. Our data reveal how cortical DA modulates M1 microcircuitry, which could be important in the acquisition of motor skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Mouse hippocampus retains the capacity for neurogenesis throughout lifetime, but such plasticity decreases with age. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) involves the birth, maturation, and synaptic integration of newborn granule cells (GCs) into preexisting hippocampal circuitry. While functional integration onto adult-born GCs has been extensively studied, maturation of efferent projections onto CA3 pyramidal cells is less understood, particularly in aged brain. Here, using combined light and reconstructive electron microscopy (EM), we describe the maturation of mossy fiber bouton (MFB) connectivity with CA3 pyramidal cells in young adult and aged mouse brain. We found mature synaptic contacts of newborn GCs were formed in both young and aged brains. However, the dynamics of their spatiotemporal development and the cellular process by which these cells functionally integrated over time were different. In young brain newborn GCs either formed independent nascent MFB synaptic contacts or replaced preexisting MFBs, but these contacts were pruned over time to a mature state. In aged brain only replacement of preexisting MFBs was observed and new contacts were without evidence of pruning. These data illustrate that functional synaptic integration of AHN occurs in young adult and aged brain, but with distinct dynamics. They suggest elimination of preexisting connectivity is required for the integration of adult-born GCs in aged brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A faulty radial glia scaffold and an abnormal cell layering were observed in the hippocampus of male, but not female, biogenesis of lysosome‐related organelles complex‐1‐deficient mice, early postnatally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function(s) of the Biogenesis of Lysosome‐related Organelles Complex‐1 (BLOC‐1) during brain development is to date largely unknown. Here, we investigated how its absence alters the trajectory of postnatal brain development using as model the pallid mouse. Most of the defects observed early postnatally in the mutant mice were more prominent in males than in females and in the hippocampus. Male mutant mice, but not females, had smaller brains as compared to sex‐matching wild types at postnatal day 1 (P1), this deficit was largely recovered by P14 and P45. An abnormal cytoarchitecture of the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus was observed in P1 pallid male, but not female, or juvenile mice (P45), along with severely decreased expression levels of the radial glial marker Glutamate‐Aspartate Transporter. Transcriptomic analyses showed that the overall response to the lack of functional BLOC‐1 was more pronounced in hippocampi at P1 than at P45 or in the cerebral cortex. These observations suggest that absence of BLOC‐1 renders males more susceptible to perinatal brain maldevelopment and although most abnormalities appear to have been resolved in juvenile animals, still permanent defects may be present, resulting in faulty neuronal circuits, and contribute to previously reported cognitive and behavioral phenotypes in adult BLOC‐1‐deficient mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In real life, mostly problems are dynamic. Many algorithms have been proposed
to handle the static problems, but these algorithms do not handle or poorly
handle the dynamic environment problems. Although, many algorithms have been
proposed to handle dynamic problems but still, there are some limitations or
drawbacks in every algorithm regarding diversity of particles and tracking of
already found optima. To overcome these limitations/drawbacks, we have proposed
a new efficient algorithm to handle the dynamic environment effectively by
tracking and locating multiple optima and by improving the diversity and
convergence speed of algorithm. In this algorithm, a new method has been
proposed which explore the undiscovered areas of search space to increase the
diversity of algorithm. This algorithm also uses a method to effectively handle
the overlapped and overcrowded particles. Branke has proposed moving peak
benchmark which is commonly used MBP in literature. We also have performed
different experiments on Moving Peak Benchmark. After comparing the
experimental results with different state of art algorithms, it was seen that
our algorithm performed more efficiently.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional von Neumann architecture based processors become inefficient in
terms of energy and throughput as they involve separate processing and memory
units, also known as~\textit{memory wall}. The memory wall problem is further
exacerbated when massive parallelism and frequent data movement are required
between processing and memory units for real-time implementation of artificial
neural network (ANN) that enables many intelligent applications. One of the
most promising approach to address the memory wall problem is to carry out
computations inside the memory core itself that enhances the memory bandwidth
and energy efficiency for extensive computations. This paper presents an
in-memory computing architecture for ANN enabling artificial intelligence (AI)
and machine learning (ML) applications. The proposed architecture utilizes deep
in-memory architecture based on standard six transistor (6T) static random
access memory (SRAM) core for the implementation of a multi-layered perceptron.
Our novel on-chip training and inference in-memory architecture reduces energy
cost and enhances throughput by simultaneously accessing the multiple rows of
SRAM array per precharge cycle and eliminating the frequent access of data. The
proposed architecture realizes backpropagation which is the keystone during the
network training using newly proposed different building blocks such as weight
updation, analog multiplication, error calculation, signed analog to digital
conversion, and other necessary signal control units. The proposed architecture
was trained and tested on the IRIS dataset which exhibits $\approx46\times$
more energy efficient per MAC (multiply and accumulate) operation compared to
earlier classifiers.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Explainable Artificial Intelligence (or xAI) has become an important research
topic in the fields of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. In this paper, we
propose a Genetic Programming (GP) based approach, named Genetic Programming
Explainer (GPX), to the problem of explaining decisions computed by AI systems.
The method generates a noise set located in the neighborhood of the point of
interest, whose prediction should be explained, and fits a local explanation
model for the analyzed sample. The tree structure generated by GPX provides a
comprehensible analytical, possibly non-linear, symbolic expression which
reflects the local behavior of the complex model. We considered three machine
learning techniques that can be recognized as complex black-box models: Random
Forest, Deep Neural Network and Support Vector Machine in twenty data sets for
regression and classifications problems. Our results indicate that the GPX is
able to produce more accurate understanding of complex models than the state of
the art. The results validate the proposed approach as a novel way to deploy GP
to improve interpretability.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Real-valued genotypes together with the variation operators, mutation and
crossover, constitute some of the fundamental building blocks of Evolutionary
Algorithms. Real-valued genotypes are utilized in a broad range of contexts,
from weights in Artificial Neural Networks to parameters in robot control
systems. Shared between most uses of real-valued genomes is the need for
limiting the range of individual parameters to allowable bounds. In this paper
we will illustrate the challenge of limiting the parameters of real-valued
genomes and analyse the most promising method to properly limit these values.
We utilize both empirical as well as benchmark examples to demonstrate the
utility of the proposed method and through a literature review show how the
insight of this paper could impact other research within the field. The
proposed method requires minimal intervention from Evolutionary Algorithm
practitioners and behaves well under repeated application of variation
operators, leading to better theoretical properties as well as significant
differences in well-known benchmarks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Common end-to-end models like CTC or encoder-decoder-attention models use
characters or subword units like BPE as the output labels. We do systematic
comparisons between grapheme-based and phoneme-based output labels. These can
be single phonemes without context (~40 labels), or multiple phonemes together
in one output label, such that we get phoneme-based subwords. For this purpose,
we introduce phoneme-based BPE labels. In further experiments, we extend the
phoneme set by auxiliary units to be able to discriminate homophones (different
words with same pronunciation). This enables a very simple and efficient
decoding algorithm. We perform the experiments on Switchboard 300h and we can
show that our phoneme-based models are competitive to the grapheme-based
models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a novel neural network design that learns the heuristic
for Large Neighborhood Search (LNS). LNS consists of a destroy operator and a
repair operator that specify a way to carry out the neighborhood search to
solve the Combinatorial Optimization problems. The proposed approach in this
paper applies a Hierarchical Recurrent Graph Convolutional Network (HRGCN) as a
LNS heuristic, namely Dynamic Partial Removal, with the advantage of adaptive
destruction and the potential to search across a large scale, as well as the
context-awareness in both spatial and temporal perspective. This model is
generalized as an efficient heuristic approach to different combinatorial
optimization problems, especially to the problems with relatively tight
constraints. We apply this model to vehicle routing problem (VRP) in this paper
as an example. The experimental results show that this approach outperforms the
traditional LNS heuristics on the same problem as well. The source code is

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The RNN transducer is a promising end-to-end model candidate. We compare the
original training criterion with the full marginalization over all alignments,
to the commonly used maximum approximation, which simplifies, improves and
speeds up our training. We also generalize from the original neural network
model and study more powerful models, made possible due to the maximum
approximation. We further generalize the output label topology to cover RNN-T,
RNA and CTC. We perform several studies among all these aspects, including a
study on the effect of external alignments. We find that the transducer model
generalizes much better on longer sequences than the attention model. Our final
transducer model outperforms our attention model on Switchboard 300h by over 6%
relative WER.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Using language makes human beings surpass animals in wisdom. To let machines
understand, learn, and use language flexibly, we propose a human-like general
language processing (HGLP) architecture, which contains sensorimotor,
association, and cognitive systems. The HGLP network learns from easy to hard
like a child, understands word meaning by coactivating multimodal neurons,
comprehends and generates sentences by real-time constructing a virtual world
model, and can express the whole thinking process verbally. HGLP rapidly
learned 10+ different tasks including object recognition, sentence
comprehension, imagination, attention control, query, inference, motion
judgement, mixed arithmetic operation, digit tracing and writing, and
human-like iterative thinking process guided by language. Language in the HGLP
framework is not matching nor correlation statistics, but a script that can
describe and control the imagination.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite its short history, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has been
extensively studied and used for various tasks, including its original purpose,
i.e., synthetic sample generation. However, applying GAN to different data
types with diverse neural network architectures has been hindered by its
limitation in training, where the model easily diverges. Such a notorious
training of GANs is well known and has been addressed in numerous studies.
Consequently, in order to make the training of GAN stable, numerous
regularization methods have been proposed in recent years. This paper reviews
the regularization methods that have been recently introduced, most of which
have been published in the last three years. Specifically, we focus on general
methods that can be commonly used regardless of neural network architectures.
To explore the latest research trends in the regularization for GANs, the
methods are classified into several groups by their operation principles, and
the differences between the methods are analyzed. Furthermore, to provide
practical knowledge of using these methods, we investigate popular methods that
have been frequently employed in state-of-the-art GANs. In addition, we discuss
the limitations in existing methods and propose future research directions.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The role of the motor cortex in perceptual and cognitive functions is highly
controversial. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that the motor cortex can
be instrumental for translating foreign language vocabulary. Participants were
trained on foreign language (L2) words and their native language translations
over four consecutive days. L2 words were accompanied by complementary gestures
(sensorimotor enrichment) or pictures (sensory enrichment). Following training,
participants translated the auditorily-presented L2 words that they had learned
and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was applied to the
bilateral posterior motor cortices. Compared to sham stimulation, effective
perturbation by rTMS slowed down the translation of sensorimotor-enriched L2
words - but not sensory-enriched L2 words. This finding suggests that
sensorimotor-enriched training induced changes in L2 representations within the
motor cortex, which in turn facilitated the translation of L2 words. The motor
cortex may play a causal role in precipitating sensorimotor-based learning
benefits, and may directly aid in remembering the native language translations
of foreign language words following sensorimotor-enriched training. These
findings support multisensory theories of learning while challenging
reactivation-based theories.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With advances in reinforcement learning (RL), agents are now being developed
in high-stakes application domains such as healthcare and transportation.
Explaining the behavior of these agents is challenging, as the environments in
which they act have large state spaces, and their decision-making can be
affected by delayed rewards, making it difficult to analyze their behavior. To
address this problem, several approaches have been developed. Some approaches
attempt to convey the $\textit{global}$ behavior of the agent, describing the
actions it takes in different states. Other approaches devised $\textit{local}$
explanations which provide information regarding the agent's decision-making in
a particular state. In this paper, we combine global and local explanation
methods, and evaluate their joint and separate contributions, providing (to the
best of our knowledge) the first user study of combined local and global
explanations for RL agents. Specifically, we augment strategy summaries that
extract important trajectories of states from simulations of the agent with
saliency maps which show what information the agent attends to. Our results
show that the choice of what states to include in the summary (global
information) strongly affects people's understanding of agents: participants
shown summaries that included important states significantly outperformed
participants who were presented with agent behavior in a randomly set of chosen
world-states. We find mixed results with respect to augmenting demonstrations
with saliency maps (local information), as the addition of saliency maps did
not significantly improve performance in most cases. However, we do find some
evidence that saliency maps can help users better understand what information
the agent relies on in its decision making, suggesting avenues for future work
that can further improve explanations of RL agents.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has triggered the current rise of artificial intelligence and
is the workhorse of today's machine intelligence. Numerous success stories have
rapidly spread all over science, industry and society, but its limitations have
only recently come into focus. In this perspective we seek to distil how many
of deep learning's problem can be seen as different symptoms of the same
underlying problem: shortcut learning. Shortcuts are decision rules that
perform well on standard benchmarks but fail to transfer to more challenging
testing conditions, such as real-world scenarios. Related issues are known in
Comparative Psychology, Education and Linguistics, suggesting that shortcut
learning may be a common characteristic of learning systems, biological and
artificial alike. Based on these observations, we develop a set of
recommendations for model interpretation and benchmarking, highlighting recent
advances in machine learning to improve robustness and transferability from the
lab to real-world applications.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Biomagnetic signals recorded during transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked peripheral muscular activity. (arXiv:1909.11451v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11451</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11451</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: We present magnetomyograms (MMG) of TMS-evoked movement in a human
hand, together with a simultaneous surface electromyograph (EMG) and
electroencephalograph (EEG) data. Approach: We combined TMS with non-contact
magnetic detection of TMS-evoked muscle activity in peripheral limbs to explore
a new diagnostic modality that enhances the utility of TMS as a clinical tool
by leveraging technological advances in magnetometry. We recorded measurements
in a regular hospital room using an array of optically pumped magnetometers
(OPM) inside a portable shield that encompasses only the forearm and hand of
the subject. Main Results: The biomagnetic signals recorded in the MMG provide
detailed spatial and temporal information that is complementary to that of the
electric signal channels. Moreover, we identify features in the magnetic
recording beyond those of the EMG. Significance: These results validate the
viability of MMG recording with a compact OPM based setup in small-sized
magnetic shielding, and provide proof-of-principle for a non-contact data
channel for detection and analysis of TMS-evoked muscle activity from
peripheral limbs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 20 May 2020; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16369-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-020-16369-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Arene dearomatization reactions allow chemists to rapidly build unique chemical architectures from largely available starting materials. Here, the authors show a photocatalytic carboamination/dearomatization cascade process leading to 1,4-cyclohexadiene-fused sultams via N-centered radicals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/y_Uuvu9dZR4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Double UP: A Dual Color, Internally Controlled Platform for in utero Knockdown or Overexpression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00082</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In utero electroporation (IUE) is a powerful tool for testing the role of genes in neuronal migration and function, but this technique suffers from high degrees of variability. Such variability can result from inconsistent surgery, developmental gradients along both rostral-caudal and medial-lateral axes, differences within littermates and from one litter to another. Comparisons between control and experimental electroporations rely on section matching, which is inherently subjective. These sources of variability are cumulative, leading to difficult to interpret data and an increased risk of both false positives and false negatives. To address these limitations, we developed two tools: (1) a new plasmid, termed Double UP, which combines LoxP-flanked reporters and limiting Cre dosages to generate internal controls, and (2) an automated program for unbiased and precise quantification of migration. In concert, these tools allow for more rigorous and objective experiments, while decreasing the mice, time, and reagents required to complete studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: In vivo MRI Successfully Reveals the Malformation of Cortical Development in Infant Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00510</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Malformations of cortical development (MCDs) are major causes of intractable epilepsies. To characterize the early neuroimaging findings of MCDs, we tried to identify the MRI features consistent with pathological findings in an infant rat MCD model, prenatally exposed to methylazoxymethanol (MAM), by using newly developed MRI techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: At gestational day 15, two doses of MAM (15 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or normal saline were injected into pregnant rats. The offspring underwent in vivo MRI, including glutamate chemical exchange saturation transfer (GluCEST), &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MR spectroscopy, and diffusion tensor imaging, at postnatal day (P) 15 using a 7T small-animal imaging system. Another set of prenatally MAM-exposed rats were sacrificed for histological staining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: At P15, the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) of rats with MCDs showed decreased neuronal nuclei, parvalbumin, and reelin expressions. Moreover, dendritic arborization of pyramidal cells in the RSC significantly decreased in infant rats with MCDs. In vivo MRI showed significantly decreased GluCEST (%) in the RSC of rats with MCDs (p = 0.000) and a significant correlation between GluCEST (%) and RSC thickness (r = 0.685, p = 0.003). The rats with MCDs showed reduced glutamate (p = 0.002), N-acetylaspartate (p = 0.002), and macromolecule and lipid levels (p = 0.027) and significantly reduced fractional anisotropy values in the RSC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:In vivo MRI revealed reduced neuronal population and dendritic arborization in the RSC of infant rats with MCDs during the early postnatal period. These pathological changes of the cortex could serve as clinical imaging biomarkers of MCDs in infants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Noisy Light Augments the Na+ Current in Somatosensory Pyramidal Neurons of Optogenetic Transgenic Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In previous reports, we developed a method to apply Brownian optogenetic noise-photostimulation (BONP, 470 nm) up to 0.67 mW on the barrel cortex of in vivo ChR2 transgenic mice. In such studies, we found that the BONP produces an increase in the evoked field potentials and the neuronal responses of pyramidal neurons induced by somatosensory mechanical stimulation. Here we extended such findings by examining whether the same type of BONP augments the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current amplitude elicited by voltage-clamp ramps of dissociated pyramidal neurons from the somatosensory cortex of ChR2 transgenic and wild type mice. We found that in all neurons from the ChR2 transgenic mice, but none of the wild type mice, the peak amplitude of a TTX-sensitive Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current and its inverse of latency exhibited inverted U-like graphs as a function of the BONP level. It means that an intermediate level of BONP increases both the peak amplitude of the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current and its inverse of latency. Our research suggests that the impact of BONP on the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels of pyramidal neurons could be associated with the observed augmentation-effects in our previous in vivo preparation. Moreover, it provides caution information for the use of an appropriate range of light intensity, &amp;lt;0.67 mW, which could avoid opto non-genetics (also termed “optonongenetic”) related responses due to light-induced temperature changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;The reactivity enhancement of pain sensitive neurons in the nervous system is a feature of the pathogenesis for neuropathic pain (NP), yet the underlying mechanisms need to be fully understood. In this study, we made an attempt to clarify the NP-related hub genes and signaling pathways so as to provide effective diagnostic and therapeutic methods toward NP.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Microarray expression profile GSE30691 including the mRNA-seq data of the spared nerve injury (SNI)-induced NP rats was accessed from the GEO database. Then, genes associated with NP development were screened using differential analysis along with random walk with restart (RWR). GO annotation and KEGG pathway analyses were performed to explore the biological functions and signaling pathways where the genes were activated. Afterward, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and GO analysis were conducted to further identify the hub genes which showed an intimate correlation with NP development.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Totally 94 genes associated with NP development were screened by differential analysis and RWR analysis, and they were observed to be predominantly enriched in hormone secretion and transport, cAMP signaling pathway and other NP occurrence associated functions and pathways. Thereafter, the 94 genes were subjected to PPI analysis to find the genes much more associated with NP and a functional module composed of 48 genes were obtained. 8 hub genes including C3, C1qb, Ccl2, Cxcl13, Timp1, Fcgr2b, Gal, and Lyz2 were eventually identified after further association and functional enrichment analyses, and the expression of these 8 genes were all higher in SNI rats by comparison with those in Sham rats.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Based on the data collected from GEO database, this study discovered 8 hub genes that were closely related to NP occurrence and development, which help to provide potent theoretical basis for NP treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Guilt-by-Association – Functional Insights Gained From Studying the LRRK2 Interactome</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Parkinson’s disease-associated Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a complex multi-domain protein belonging to the Roco protein family, a unique group of G-proteins. Variants of this gene are associated with an increased risk of Parkinson’s disease. Besides its well-characterized enzymatic activities, conferred by its GTPase and kinase domains, and a central dimerization domain, it contains four predicted repeat domains, which are, based on their structure, commonly involved in protein-protein interactions (PPIs). In the past decades, tremendous progress has been made in determining comprehensive interactome maps for the human proteome. Knowledge of PPIs has been instrumental in assigning functions to proteins involved in human disease and helped to understand the connectivity between different disease pathways and also significantly contributed to the functional understanding of LRRK2. In addition to an increased kinase activity observed for proteins containing PD-associated variants, various studies helped to establish LRRK2 as a large scaffold protein in the interface between cytoskeletal dynamics and the vesicular transport. This review first discusses a number of specific LRRK2-associated PPIs for which a functional consequence can at least be speculated upon, and then considers the representation of LRRK2 protein interactions in public repositories, providing an outlook on open research questions and challenges in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The increasing incidence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease represents a significant burden for patients and national health systems. The conditions are primarily caused by the death of neurons and other neural cell types. One important aim of current stem cell research is to find a way to replace the lost cells. In this perspective, neural stem cells (NSCs) have been considered as a promising tool in the field of regenerative medicine. The behavior of NSCs is modulated by environmental influences, for example hormones, growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix molecules or biomechanics. These factors can be studied by using well-defined hydrogels, which are polymeric networks of synthetic or natural origin with the ability to swell in water. These gels can be modified with a variety of molecules and optimized with regard to their mechanical properties to mimic the natural extracellular environment. In particular modifications applying distinct units such as functional domains and peptides can modulate the development of NSCs with regard to proliferation, differentiation and migration. One well-known peptide sequence that affects the behavior of NSCs is the integrin recognition sequence RGD that has originally been derived from fibronectin. In the present review we provide an overview concerning the applications of modified hydrogels with an emphasis on synthetic hydrogels based on poly(acrylamides), as modified with either cationic moieties or the peptide sequence RGD. This knowledge might be used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for the therapy of spinal cord injuries, neurodegenerative diseases and traumata.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Systems Biology: Investigating the Effects of Brainstem Neuronal Adaptation on Cardiovascular Homeostasis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Central coordination of cardiovascular function is accomplished, in part, by the baroreceptor reflex, a multi-input multi-output physiological control system that regulates the activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems via interactions among multiple brainstem nuclei. Recent single-cell analyses within the brain revealed that individual neurons within and across brain nuclei exhibit distinct transcriptional states contributing to neuronal function. Such transcriptional heterogeneity complicates the task of understanding how neurons within and across brain nuclei organize and function to process multiple inputs and coordinate cardiovascular functions within the larger context of the baroreceptor reflex. However, prior analysis of brainstem neurons revealed that single-neuron transcriptional heterogeneity reflects an adaptive response to synaptic inputs and that neurons organize into distinct subtypes with respect to synaptic inputs received. Based on these results, we hypothesize that adaptation of neuronal subtypes support robust biological function through graded cellular responses. We test this hypothesis by examining the functional impact of neuronal adaptation on parasympathetic activity within the context of short-term baroreceptor reflex regulation. In this work, we extend existing quantitative closed-loop models of the baroreceptor reflex by incorporating into the model distinct input-driven neuronal subtypes and neuroanatomical groups that modulate parasympathetic activity. We then use this extended model to investigate, via simulation, the functional role of neuronal adaptation under conditions of health and systolic heart failure. Simulation results suggest that parasympathetic activity can be modulated appropriately by the coordination of distinct neuronal subtypes to maintain normal cardiovascular functions under systolic heart failure conditions. Moreover, differing degrees of adaptation of these neuronal subtypes contribute to cardiovascular behaviors corresponding to distinct clinical phenotypes of heart failure, such as exercise intolerance. Further, our results suggest that an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity regulating ventricular contractility contributes to exercise intolerance in systolic heart failure patients, and restoring this balance can improve the short-term cardiovascular performance of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Inhibition of TLR4 Induces M2 Microglial Polarization and Provides Neuroprotection via the NLRP3 Inflammasome in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00444</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence has indicated that activation of microglia and neuroinflammation reaction play a prominent role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Inhibition of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been shown to be associated with immune responses and brain damage, but its effects on AD remain unclear. This study mainly aimed to investigate the protective effect of TAK-242 (TLR4-specific inhibitor) on microglial polarization and neuroprotection in an AD mouse model and the underlying mechanisms. We found that APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice exhibited a dramatic increase in TLR4 levels concomitant with a significantly higher expression of inflammatory microglia compared to C57BL/6 wild-type mice. Furthermore, inhibition of TLR4 by TAK-242 administration significantly improved neurological function, decreased the level of Bax, and caused a significant reduction in the levels of M1-markers (iNOS and TNFα), while the expressions of M2-phenotype markers (Trem-2 and Arg-1) were increased both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, TAK-242 treatment enhanced BV2 microglial phagocytosis. Moreover, Aβ&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;35&lt;/sub&gt; caused the upregulation of inflammatory cytokine production, MyD88, NF-kappaB-p65, and NLRP3, which could be ameliorated by NLRP3-siRNA or TAK-242. These findings indicated that TLR4 inhibition provided neuroprotection and promoted a microglial switch from the inflammatory M1 phenotype to the protective M2 phenotype in AD. The mechanism involved may be related to modulation of the MyD88/NF-kappaB/NLRP3 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: OPETH: Open Source Solution for Real-Time Peri-Event Time Histogram Based on Open Ephys</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00021</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Single cell electrophysiology remains one of the most widely used approaches of systems neuroscience. Decisions made by the experimenter during electrophysiology recording largely determine recording quality, duration of the project and value of the collected data. Therefore, online feedback aiding these decisions can lower monetary and time investment, and substantially speed up projects as well as allow novel studies otherwise not possible due to prohibitively low throughput. Real-time feedback is especially important in studies that involve optogenetic cell type identification by enabling a systematic search for neurons of interest. However, such tools are scarce and limited to costly commercial systems with high degree of specialization, which hitherto prevented wide-ranging benefits for the community. To address this, we present an open-source tool that enables online feedback during electrophysiology experiments and provides a Python interface for the widely used Open Ephys open source data acquisition system. Specifically, our software allows flexible online visualization of spike alignment to external events, called the online peri-event time histogram (OPETH). These external events, conveyed by digital logic signals, may indicate photostimulation time stamps for in vivo optogenetic cell type identification or the times of behaviorally relevant events during in vivo behavioral neurophysiology experiments. Therefore, OPETH allows real-time identification of genetically defined neuron types or behaviorally responsive populations. By allowing “hunting” for neurons of interest, OPETH significantly reduces experiment time and thus increases the efficiency of experiments that combine in vivo electrophysiology with behavior or optogenetic tagging of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Methylene Blue Preserves Cytochrome Oxidase Activity and Prevents Neurodegeneration and Memory Impairment in Rats With Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00130</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in neurocognitive disorders diminishes cytochrome oxidase activity leading to neurodegenerative effects and impairment of learning and memory. Methylene blue at low doses stimulates cytochrome oxidase activity and may thus counteract the adverse effects of cerebral hypoperfusion. However, the effects of methylene blue on cytochrome oxidase activity during chronic cerebral hypoperfusion have not been described before. To test this hypothesis, rats underwent bilateral carotid artery occlusion or sham surgery, received daily 4 mg/kg methylene blue or saline injections, and learned a visual water task. Brain mapping of cytochrome oxidase activity was done by quantitative enzyme histochemistry. Permanent carotid occlusion for 1 month resulted in decreased cytochrome oxidase activity in visual cortex, prefrontal cortex, perirhinal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, and weaker interregional correlation of cytochrome oxidase activity between these regions. Methylene blue preserved cytochrome oxidase activity in regions affected by carotid occlusion and strengthened their interregional correlations of cytochrome oxidase activity, which prevented neurodegenerative effects and facilitated task-specific learning and memory. Brain-behavior correlations revealed positive correlations between performance and brain regions in which cytochrome oxidase activity was preserved by methylene blue. These results are the first to demonstrate that methylene blue prevents neurodegeneration and memory impairment by preserving cytochrome oxidase activity and interregional correlation of cytochrome oxidase activity in brain regions susceptible to chronic hypoperfusion. This demonstration provides further support for the hypothesis that lower cerebral blood flow results in an Alzheimer’s-like syndrome and that stimulating cytochrome oxidase activity with low-dose methylene blue is neuroprotective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, in vitro generation of donor cells for brain repair has been dominated by the application of extrinsic growth factors and morphogens. Recent advances in cell engineering strategies such as reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells and direct cell fate conversion have impressively demonstrated the feasibility to manipulate cell identities by the overexpression of cell fate-determining transcription factors. These strategies are now increasingly implemented for transcription factor-guided differentiation of neural precursors and forward programming of pluripotent stem cells toward specific neural subtypes. This review covers major achievements, pros and cons, as well as future prospects of transcription factor-based cell fate specification and the applicability of these approaches for the generation of donor cells for brain repair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and gene loss result in rapid changes in the gene content of bacteria. While HGT aids bacteria to adapt to new environments, it also carries risks such as selfish genetic elements (SGEs). Here, we use modelling to study how HGT of slightly beneficial genes impacts growth rates of bacterial populations, and if bacteria collectives can evolve to take up DNA despite selfish elements. We find four classes of slightly beneficial genes: indispensable, enrichable, rescuable, and unrescuable genes. Rescuable genes — genes with small fitness benefits that are lost from the population without HGT — can be collectively retained by a community that engages in costly HGT. While this `gene-sharing' cannot evolve in well-mixed cultures, it does evolve in a spatial population like a biofilm. Despite enabling infection by harmful SGEs, the uptake of DNA is evolutionarily maintained by the hosts, explaining the coexistence of bacteria and SGEs.</description>

	<description>Histone acetylation and deposition of H2A.Z variant are integral aspects of active transcription. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; an unknown mechanism. Here we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.V (the fly ortholog of H2A.Z) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, like the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex, instead, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene.</description>

	<description>Disruption of mitochondrial function selectively targets tumour cells that are dependent on oxidative phosphorylation. However, due to their high energy demands, cardiac cells are disproportionately targeted by mitochondrial toxins resulting in a loss of cardiac function. An analysis of the effects of mubritinib on cardiac cells showed that this drug did not inhibit HER2 as reported, but directly inhibits mitochondrial respiratory complex I, reducing cardiac-cell beat rate, with prolonged exposure resulting in cell death. We used a library of chemical variants of mubritinib and showed that modifying the 1H-1,2,3-triazole altered complex I inhibition, identifying the heterocyclic 1,3-nitrogen motif as the toxicophore. The same toxicophore is present in a second anti-cancer therapeutic carboxyamidotriazole (CAI) and we demonstrate that CAI also functions through complex I inhibition, mediated by the toxicophore. Complex I inhibition is directly linked to anti-cancer cell activity, with toxicophore modification ablating the desired effects of these compounds on cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis.</description>

	<title>eLife: R-spondins engage heparan sulfate proteoglycans to potentiate WNT signaling</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54469</link>
	<description>R-spondins (RSPOs) amplify WNT signaling during development and regenerative responses. We previously demonstrated that RSPOs 2 and 3 potentiate WNT/β-catenin signaling in cells lacking leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptors (LGRs) 4, 5 and 6 (Lebensohn and Rohatgi, 2018). We now show that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) act as alternative co-receptors for RSPO3 using a combination of ligand mutagenesis and ligand engineering. Mutations in RSPO3 residues predicted to contact HSPGs impair its signaling capacity. Conversely, the HSPG-binding domains of RSPO3 can be entirely replaced with an antibody that recognizes heparan sulfate (HS) chains attached to multiple HSPGs without diminishing WNT-potentiating activity in cultured cells and intestinal organoids. A genome-wide screen for mediators of RSPO3 signaling in cells lacking LGRs 4, 5 and 6 failed to reveal other receptors. We conclude that HSPGs are RSPO co-receptors that potentiate WNT signaling in the presence and absence of LGRs.</description>

	<description>Neuromodulatory systems are essential for remodeling glutamatergic connectivity during experience-dependent cortical plasticity. This permissive/enabling function of neuromodulators has been associated with their capacity to facilitate the induction of Hebbian forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) by affecting cellular and network excitability. In vitro studies indicate that neuromodulators also affect the expression of Hebbian plasticity in a pull-push manner: receptors coupled to the G-protein Gs promote the expression of LTP at the expense of LTD, and Gq-coupled receptors promote LTD at the expense of LTP. Here we show that pull-push mechanisms can be recruited in vivo by pairing brief monocular stimulation with pharmacological or chemogenetical activation of Gs- or Gq-coupled receptors to respectively enhance or reduce neuronal responses in primary visual cortex. These changes were stable, inducible in adults after the termination of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity, and can rescue deficits induced by prolonged monocular deprivation.</description>

	<description>A long-standing problem is how cells that lack one of the highly similar ribosomal proteins (RPs) often display distinct phenotypes. Yeast and other organisms live longer when they lack specific ribosomal proteins, especially of the large 60S subunit of the ribosome. However, longevity is neither associated with the generation time of RP deletion mutants nor with bulk inhibition of protein synthesis. Here, we queried actively dividing RP mutants through the cell cycle. Our data link transcriptional, translational, and metabolic changes to phenotypes associated with the loss of paralogous RPs. We uncovered translational control of transcripts encoding enzymes of methionine and serine metabolism, which are part of one-carbon (1C) pathways. Cells lacking Rpl22Ap, which are long-lived, have lower levels of metabolites associated with 1C metabolism. Loss of 1C enzymes increased the longevity of wild type cells. 1C pathways exist in all organisms and targeting the relevant enzymes could represent longevity interventions.</description>

	<description>Competitive selection, the transformation of multiple competing sensory inputs and internal states into a unitary choice, is a fundamental component of animal behavior. Selection behaviors have been studied under several intersecting umbrellas including decision-making, action selection, perceptual categorization, and attentional selection. Neural correlates of these behaviors and computational models have been investigated extensively. However, specific, identifiable neural circuit mechanisms underlying the implementation of selection remain elusive. Here, we employ a first principles approach to map competitive selection explicitly onto neural circuit elements. We decompose selection into six computational primitives, identify demands that their execution places on neural circuit design, and propose a canonical neural circuit framework. The resulting framework has several links to neural literature, indicating its biological feasibility, and has several common elements with prominent computational models, suggesting its generality. We propose that this framework can help catalyze experimental discovery of the neural circuit underpinnings of competitive selection.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Musical expertise is associated with improved neural statistical learning.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.20.106187v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>It is poorly known whether musical training leads to improvements in general cognitive abilities, such as statistical learning (SL). In standard SL paradigms, musicians have better performances than non-musicians. However, these better performances could be due to an improved ability to process sensory information, as opposed to an improved ability to learn sequence statistics. Unfortunately, these very different explanations make similar predictions on the performances averaged over multiple trials. To solve this controversy, we developed a Bayesian model and recorded electroencephalography (EEG) to study trial-by-trial responses. Our results confirm that musicians perform ~15% better than non-musicians at predicting items in auditory sequences that embed either simple or complex statistics. This higher performance is explained in the Bayesian model by parameters governing SL, as opposed to parameters governing sensory information processing. EEG recordings reveal a neural underpinning of the musicians advantage: the P300 amplitude correlates with the Bayesian model surprise elicited by each item, and so, more strongly for musicians than non-musicians. Finally, early EEG components correlate with the Bayesian model surprise elicited by simple statistics, as opposed to late EEG components that correlate with Bayesian model surprise elicited by complex statistics surprise, and so more strongly for musicians than non-musicians. Overall, our results prove that musical expertise is associated with improved neural SL, and support music-based intervention to fine tune general cognitive abilities.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Split-ends is modulating lipid droplet content in adult Drosophila glial cells and is protective against paraquat toxicity.</title>

	<description>Glial cells are early sensors of neuronal injury and are able to store lipids in lipid droplets under oxidative stress conditions. Here, we investigated the glial functions of Spen in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). Using a data mining approach, we first found that the human ortholog of spen, SPEN/SHARP belongs to the set of astrocyte-expressed genes which mRNA levels are significantly different in the substantia nigra of PD patients as compared to controls. Interestingly, the retrieved list of differentially expressed genes was enriched in genes involved in lipid metabolism. In a Drosophila model of PD, we observed that spen mutant flies were more sensitive to paraquat intoxication. Moreover, the glia-restricted knockdown of spen led to the expansion and the accumulation of lipid droplets as well as the inhibition of Notch pathway. Taken together our results show that Spen regulates lipid metabolism and storage in glial cells and by these means contribute to glia-mediated functions in the context of neurodegeneration.</description>

	<description>Activity-dependent local protein synthesis is critical for synapse-specific, persistent plasticity. Abnormalities in local protein synthesis have been implicated in psychiatric disorders. We have recently identified the translin/trax microRNA-degrading enzyme as a novel mediator of protein synthesis at activated synapses. Additionally, mice lacking translin/trax exhibit some of the behavioral abnormalities found in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome. Therefore, identifying signaling pathways interacting with translin/trax to support persistent synaptic plasticity is a translationally relevant goal. Here, as a first step to achieve this goal, we have assessed the requirement of translin/trax for multiple hippocampal synaptic plasticity paradigms that rely on distinct molecular mechanisms. We found that mice lacking translin/trax exhibited selective impairment in a form of persistent hippocampal plasticity, which requires postsynaptic PKA activity. In contrast, enduring forms of plasticity that are dependent on presynaptic PKA were unaffected. Furthermore, these mice did not display exaggerated metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term synaptic depression, a hallmark of the mouse model of fragile X syndrome. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that translin/trax mediates long-term synaptic plasticity that is dependent on postsynaptic PKA signaling.</description>

	<description>Our understanding of how the nervous system works is limited by our ability to identify the neuronal subtypes that comprise functional circuits. Using a genetic approach, we show that the transcription factor Gbx2 labels two amacrine cell (AC) subtypes in the mouse retina that have distinct morphological, physiological, and molecular properties. One subtype of Gbx2+ ACs are likely the previously characterized On-type GABAergic CRH-1 AC. The other Gbx2+ AC population is a previously uncharacterized non-GABAergic, non-Glycinergic (nGnG) AC subtype. Gbx2+ nGnG ACs are On-Off type cells with asymmetric dendritic arbors. Gbx2+ nGnG ACs also exhibit tracer coupling to bipolar cells (BCs) through gap junctions that are modulated by dopamine signaling. This study genetically identifies a previously uncharacterized AC subtype and reveals an unusual AC-BC connectivity through gap junctions that may provide a novel model of synaptic communication and visual circuit function.</description>

	<description>Mapping the causal effects of one brain region on another (effective connectivity) is a challenging problem in neuroscience, since it requires invasive direct manipulation of brain function, together with whole-brain measurement of the effects produced. Here we establish a unique resource and present data from 26 human patients who underwent electrical stimulation during functional magnetic resonance imaging (es-fMRI). The patients had medically refractory epilepsy requiring surgically implanted intracranial electrodes in cortical and subcortical locations. One or multiple contacts on these electrodes were stimulated while simultaneously recording BOLD-fMRI activity in a block design. Multiple runs exist for patients with different stimulation sites. We describe the resource, data collection process, preprocessing using the fMRIPrep analysis pipeline and management of artifacts, and provide end-user analyses to visualize distal brain activation produced by site-specific electrical stimulation. The data are organized according to the brain imaging data structure (BIDS) specification, and are available for analysis or future dataset contributions on openneuro.org including both raw and preprocessed data.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The AMPK-related kinase NUAK1 controls cortical axons branching though a local modulation of mitochondrial metabolic functions</title>

	<description>The precise regulation of the cellular mechanisms underlying axonal morphogenesis is essential to the formation of functional neuronal networks. We previously identified the autism-candidate kinase NUAK1 as a central regulator of axon branching in mouse cortical neurons through the control of mitochondria trafficking. How does local mitochondrial position or function regulate axon branching during development? Here, we characterized the metabolic regulation in the developing axon and report a marked metabolic decorrelation between axon elongation and collateral branching. We next solved the cascade of event leading to presynaptic clustering and mitochondria recruitment during spontaneous branch formation. Interestingly and contrary to peripheral neurons, mitochondria are recruited after but not prior to branch formation in cortical neurons. Using flux metabolomics and fluorescent biosensors, we observed that NUAK1 deficiency significantly impairs mitochondrial metabolism and axonal ATP concentration. Upregulation of mitochondrial function is sufficient to rescue axonal branching in NUAK1 null neurons in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, our results indicate that NUAK1 exerts a dual function during axon branching through its ability to control mitochondria distribution and activity, and suggest that a mitochondrial-dependent remodeling of local metabolic homeostasis plays a critical role during axon morphogenesis.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Practical gradient non-linearity correction of multi-site diffusion weighted MRI with empirical field maps</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.18.102558v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.18.102558v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Achieving inter-site / inter-scanner reproducibility of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) metrics has been challenging given differences in acquisition protocols, analysis models, and hardware factors. Purpose: Gradient fields impart scanner-dependent spatial variations in the applied diffusion weighting that can be corrected if the gradient non-linearities are known. However, retrieving manufacturer non-linearity specifications is not well supported and may introduce errors in interpretation of units or coordinate systems. We propose an empirical approach to mapping the gradient nonlinearities with sequences that are supported across the major scanner vendors. Study Type: Prospective observational study Subjects: Two diffusion phantoms (High Precision Devices diffusion phantom and a custom isotropic phantom), five human control volunteers. Field Strength/Sequence: 3T (three scanners). Stejskal-Tanner spin echo sequence with b-values of 1000, 2000 s/mm2 with 12 and 32 diffusion gradient directions per shell. Assessment: We compare the proposed correction with the prior approach using manufacturer specifications against typical diffusion pre-processing pipelines (i.e., ignoring spatial gradient non-linearities). In phantom data, we evaluate metrics against the ground truth. In human and phantom data, we evaluate reproducibility across scans, sessions, and hardware. Statistical Tests: Wilcoxon rank-sum test between uncorrected and corrected data. Results: In phantom data, our correction method reduces variation in metrics across sessions over uncorrected data (p&amp;lt;0.05). In human data, we show that this method can also reduce variation in mean diffusivity across scanners (p&amp;lt;0.05). Conclusion: Our method is relatively simple, fast, and can be applied retroactively. We advocate incorporating voxel-specific b-value and b-vector maps should be incorporated in DW-MRI harmonization preprocessing pipelines to improve quantitative accuracy of measured diffusion parameters.

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Population coding in the cerebellum and its implications for learning from error</title>

	<description>Artificial intelligence provides algorithms that describe how neural networks learn from error, but can the algorithms help uncover the neuronal wiring of the brain? Here, I consider the cerebellum, a major learning site that resembles a feedforward network of neurons. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells (P-cells) organize in populations that converge onto neurons in a deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN). The outputs produced by DCN neurons are predictions that are compared to the actual observations in the inferior olive, resulting in prediction errors that are fed back strongly to the P-cells, but rather weakly to the neurons in the nucleus. Furthermore, unlike an artificial neural network, a P-cell has a very limited view of the error space: it is aware of only those errors that it can sense via its single climbing fiber. The strength disparity in the error signals, and the limited view of the error space, are critical clues that suggest how the P-cells and their targets in the nucleus should be wired into populations. As a result, the fundamental unit of computation in the cerebellum is not a single neuron, but a group of neurons that share a single teacher. To learn efficiently, the error signal organizes the P-cells, which in turn act as surrogate teachers for the neurons that they project to in the nucleus. The result is a population coding that may be responsible for a number of remarkable features of behavior, including multiple timescales, protection from erasure, and spontaneous recovery.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A Purkinje cell model that simulates complex spikes</title>

	<description>Purkinje cells are the principal neurons of the cerebellar cortex. One of their distinguishing features is that they fire two distinct types of action potential, called simple and complex spikes, which interact with one another. Simple spikes are stereotypical action potentials that are elicited at high, but variable, rates (0 - 100 Hz) and have a consistent waveform. Complex spikes are composed of an initial action potential followed by a burst of lower amplitude spikelets. Complex spikes occur at comparatively low rates ([~] 1 Hz) and have a variable waveform. Although they are critical to cerebellar operation a simple model that describes the complex spike waveform is lacking. Here, a novel single-compartment model of Purkinje cell electrodynamics is presented. The simpler version of this model, withtwo active conductances and a leak channel, can simulate the features typical of complex spikes recorded in vitro. If calcium dynamics are also included, the model can capture the pause in simple spike activity that occurs after complex spike events.Together, these models provide an insight into the mechanisms behind complex spike spikelet generation, waveform variability and their interactions with simple spike activity.</description>

	<description>The recent Drosophila central brain connectome offers the possibility of analyzing the graph properties of the fly brain. Crucially, this connectome is dense, meaning all nodes and links are represented, within the limits of experimental error. We consider the connectome as a directed graph with weighted edges. This enables us to look at a number of graph properties, compare them to human designed logic systems, and speculate on how this may affect function. We look at input and output distributions, randomness of wiring, differences between compartments, path lengths, proximity of strong connections, known computational structures, electrical response as a function of compartment structure, and evidence for efficient packing.</description>

	<description>The default mode network (DMN) is a group of high-order brain regions recently implicated in processing external naturalistic events, yet it remains unclear what cognitive function it serves. Here we identified the cognitive states predictive of DMN fMRI coactivation. Particularly, we developed a state-fluctuation pattern analysis, matching network coactivations across a short movie with retrospective behavioral sampling of movie events. Network coactivation was selectively correlated with the state of surprise across movie events, compared to all other cognitive states (e.g. emotion, vividness). The effect was exhibited in the DMN, but not dorsal attention or visual networks. Furthermore, surprise was found to mediate DMN coactivations with hippocampus and nucleus accumbens. These unexpected findings point to the DMN as a major hub in high-level prediction-error representations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Alterations in resting-state network dynamics along the Alzheimer's disease continuum: a combined MEG-PET/MR approach</title>

	<description>Human brain activity is intrinsically organized into resting-state networks (RSNs) that transiently activate or deactivate at the sub-second timescale. Few neuroimaging studies have addressed how Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects these fast temporal brain dynamics, and how they relate to the cognitive, structural and metabolic abnormalities characterizing AD. We aimed at closing this gap by investigating both brain structure and function using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and hybrid positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance (PET/MR) in 10 healthy elders, 10 patients with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD), 10 patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) and 10 patients with typical Alzheimer's disease with dementia (AD). The fast activation/deactivation state dynamics of RSNs were assessed using hidden Markov modeling (HMM) of power envelope fluctuations at rest measured with MEG. HMM patterns were related to participants' cognitive test scores, whole hippocampal grey matter volume and regional brain glucose metabolism. The posterior default-mode network (DMN) was less often activated and for shorter durations in AD patients than matched healthy elders. No significant difference was found in patients with SCD or aMCI. The time spent by participants in the activated posterior DMN state did not correlate significantly with cognitive scores. However, it correlated positively with the whole hippocampal volume and regional glucose consumption in the right temporo-parietal junctions and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and negatively with glucose consumption in the cerebellum. In AD patients, alterations of posterior DMN power activation dynamics at rest correlate with structural and neurometabolic abnormalities. These findings represent an additional electrophysiological correlate of AD-related synaptic and neural dysfunction.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Effects of TMS over the anterior intraparietal area on anticipatory fingertip force scaling and the size-weight illusion</title>

	<description>In skilled object lifting, fingertip forces need to be carefully scaled to object weight, which can be inferred from object properties, such as size or material. This anticipatory force scaling ensures smooth and efficient lifting movements. However, even with accurate motor plans, weight perception can still be biased. In the size-weight illusion, objects of different size but equal weight are perceived to differ in heaviness, with the small object perceived to be heavier than the large object. The neural underpinnings of the size-weight illusion and anticipatory force scaling to object size are largely unknown. In this study, we hypothesized a possible role of the anterior intraparietal cortex (aIPS) in predictive force scaling and the size-weight illusion, which we investigated by applying continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) prior to participants lifting objects designed to induce the size-weight illusion. Participants received cTBS over aIPS, the primary motor cortex (control area), or sham stimulation. We found no evidence that aIPS stimulation affected the size-weight illusion. Small effects were, however, found on anticipatory force scaling, where grip force was less tuned to object size during initial lifts. These findings suggest that, while aIPS might be peripherally involved in sensorimotor prediction, other brain areas underpin the processes that mediate the size-weight illusion.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Whole-Brain High-Resolution Metabolite Mapping with 3D Compressed-Sensing-SENSE-LowRank 1H FID-MRSI</title>

	<description>There is a growing interest of the neuroscience community to map the distribution of brain metabolites in vivo. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) is often limited by either a poor spatial resolution and/or a long acquisition time which severely limits its applications for clinical or research purposes. We developed a novel acquisition-reconstruction technique combining fast 1H-FID-MRSI sequence accelerated by random k-space undersampling and a low-rank and total-generalized variation (TGV) constrained model. This framework was applied to the brain of four healthy volunteers. Following 20 min acquisition, reconstruction and quantification, the resulting metabolic maps with a 5mm isotropic resolution reflected the detailed neurochemical composition of all brain regions and revealed part of the underlying brain anatomy. Contrasts and features from the 3D metabolite distributions were in agreement with the literature and consistent across the four subjects. The successful combination of the 3D 1H-FID-MRSI with a constrained reconstruction enables the detailed mapping of metabolite concentrations at high-resolution in the whole brain and with an acquisition time that is compatible with clinical or research settings.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Lists with and without syntax: A new approach to measuring the neural processing of syntax</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.18.101469v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>In the neurobiology of language, a fundamental challenge is deconfounding syntax from semantics. Changes in syntactic structure usually correlate with changes in meaning. We approached this challenge from a new angle. We deployed word lists, which are usually the unstructured control in studies of syntax, as both the test and the control stimulus. Three-noun lists (lamps, dolls, guitars) were embedded in sentences (The eccentric man hoarded lamps, dolls, guitars...) and in longer lists (forks, pen, toilet, rodeo, graves, drums, mulch, lamps, dolls, guitars...). This allowed us to perfectly control both lexical characteristics and local combinatorics: the same words occurred in both conditions and in neither case did the list items locally compose into phrases (e.g. 'lamps' and 'dolls' do not form a phrase). But in one case, the list partakes in a syntactic tree, while in the other, it does not. Being embedded inside a syntactic tree increased source-localized MEG activity at ~250-300ms from word onset in the left inferior frontal cortex, at ~300-350ms in the left anterior temporal lobe and, most reliably, at ~330-400ms in left posterior temporal cortex. In contrast, effects of semantic association strength, which we also varied, localized in left temporo-parietal cortex, with high associations increasing activity at around 400ms. This dissociation offers a novel characterization of the structure vs. meaning contrast in the brain: The fronto-temporal network that is familiar from studies of sentence processing can be driven by the sheer presence of global sentence structure, while associative semantics has a more posterior neural signature.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A meta-analytic approach to mapping co-occurrent grey matter volume increases and decreases in psychiatric disorders</title>

	<description>Numerous studies have investigated gray matter (GM) volume changes in diverse patient groups. Reports of disorder-related GM reductions are common in such work, but many studies also report evidence for GM volume increases in patients. It is unclear whether these GM increases and decreases independent or related in some way. Here, we address this question using a novel meta-analytic network mapping approach. We used a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 64 voxel-based morphometry studies of psychiatric disorders to calculate the probability of finding a GM increase or decrease in one region given an observed change in the opposite direction in another region. Estimating this co-occurrence probability for every pair of brain regions allowed us to build a network of concurrent GM changes of opposing polarity. Our analysis revealed that disorder-related GM increases and decreases are not independent; instead, a GM change in one area is often statistically related to a change of opposite polarity in other areas, highlighting distributed yet coordinated changes in GM volume as a function of brain pathology. Most regions showing GM changes linked to an opposite change in a distal area were located in salience, executive-control and default mode networks, as well as the thalamus and basal ganglia. Moreover, pairs of regions showing coupled changes of opposite polarity were more likely to belong to different canonical networks than to the same one. Our results suggest that regional GM alterations in psychiatric disorders are often accompanied by opposing changes in distal regions that belong to distinct functional networks.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Eye movements in real-life search are guided by task-irrelevant working-memory content</title>

	<description>Attention is automatically guided towards stimuli that match the contents of working memory. This has been studied extensively using simplified computer tasks, but it has never been investigated whether (yet often assumed that) memory-driven guidance also affects real-life search. Here we tested this open question in a naturalistic environment that closely resembles real life. In two experiments, participants wore a mobile eye-tracker, and memorized a color, prior to a search task in which they looked for a target word among book covers on a bookshelf. The memory color was irrelevant to the search task. Nevertheless, we found that participants' gaze was strongly guided towards book covers that matched the memory color. Crucially, this memory-driven guidance was evident from the very start of the search period. These findings support that attention is guided towards working-memory content in real-world search, and that this is fast and therefore likely reflecting an automatic process.</description>

	<description>Selecting actions which achieve desired goals often requires three-dimensional (3D) representations of the environment. Because the sensory epithelia cannot directly encode the worlds 3D spatial features, sensory signals must be converted into 3D representations. Here we investigated the relationships between the quality of 3D visual representations, choice-related activity, and motor-related activity in the parietal cortex of macaque monkeys using an eight-alternative 3D orientation discrimination task, visually guided saccade task, and laminar probe recordings. We found that choice activity was preferentially carried by caudal intraparietal area neurons with more robust 3D representations. Choice activity further stabilized the 3D representations, rather than attenuating information not directly relevant to the behavioral task (nuisance variables). An experience-dependent, sensorimotor association additionally aligned sensory and saccade direction preferences, particularly for neurons with choice activity. These findings reveal novel roles for choice activity in improving the fidelity of ecologically relevant object representations and mediating sensorimotor associations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Another's pain in my brain: No evidence that placebo analgesia affects the sensory-discriminative component in empathy for pain</title>

	<description>The shared representations account of empathy suggests that sharing other people's emotions relies on neural processes similar to those engaged when directly experiencing such emotions. Recent research corroborated this by showing that placebo analgesia resulted in reduced pain empathy and decreased activation in shared neural networks. However, those studies did not report any placebo-related variation of somatosensory engagement during pain empathy. The experimental paradigms used in these studies did not direct attention towards a specific body part in pain, which may explain the absence of effects for somatosensation. The main objective of this preregistered study was to implement a paradigm overcoming this limitation, and to investigate whether placebo analgesia may also modulate the sensory-discriminative component of empathy for pain. We induced a localized, first-hand placebo analgesia effect in the right hand of 45 participants by means of a placebo gel and conditioning techniques, and compared this to the left hand as a control condition. Participants underwent a pain task in the MRI scanner, receiving painful or non-painful electrical stimulation on their left or right hand, or witnessing another person receiving such stimulation. In contrast to a robust localized placebo analgesia effect for self-experienced pain, the empathy condition showed no differences between the two hands, neither for behavioral nor neural responses. We thus report no evidence for somatosensory sharing in empathy, while replicating previous studies showing overlapping brain activity in the affective-motivational component for first-hand and empathy for pain. Hence, in a more rigorous test aiming to overcome limitations of previous work, we again find no causal evidence for the engagement of somatosensory sharing in empathy. Our study refines the understanding of the neural underpinnings of empathy for pain, and the use of placebo analgesia in investigating such models.</description>

	<description>During wakeful rest, individuals make small eye movements when asked to fixate. We examined how these endogenously-driven oculomotor patterns impact topography and topology of functional brain networks. We used a dataset consisting of eyes-open resting-state (RS) fMRI data with simultaneous eye-tracking (Nilsonne et al., 2016). The eye-tracking data indicated minor movements during rest, on the order of 1.0 degree on average when analyzed over 2sec epochs, which correlated modestly with RS BOLD data. However, the eye-tracking data correlated well with echo-planar imaging (EPI) time series sampled from the area of the Eye-Orbit (EO-EPI), which is a signal previously used to identify eye movements during exogenous saccades and movie viewing. We found that EO-EPI data correlated with activity in an extensive motor and sensori-motor network, but also some components of the dorsal attention network including the frontal and supplementary eye fields. Partialling out variance related to EO-EPI from RS data reduced connectivity, primarily between sensorimotor and visual areas. For three different network sparsity levels, the resulting RS connectivity networks showed higher modularity, lower mean connectivity strength, and lower mean clustering coefficient. Our results highlight new aspects of endogenous eye movement control during wakeful rest. They show that oculomotor-related contributions form an important component of RS network topology, and that those should be considered in interpreting differences in network structure between populations, or as a function of different experimental conditions.</description>

	<description>Diverse sensory neurons exhibit distinct neuronal morphologies with a variety of axon terminal arborizations used to subserve their functions. Due to its clinical significance, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of itch are being intensely studied. However, a complete analysis of itch-sensing terminal arborization morphology is missing. Using a novel MrgprC11CreERT2 transgenic mouse line, we labeled a small subset of itch-sensing neurons that express multiple itch-related molecules including MrgprA3, MrgprC11, histamine receptor H1, IL-31 receptor, 5-HT receptor 1F, natriuretic precursor peptide B, and neuromedin B. By combining sparse genetic labeling and whole-mount PLAP histochemistry, we found that itch-sensing skin arbors exhibit free endings with extensive axonal branching in the superficial epidermis and large receptive fields. These results revealed the unique morphological characteristics of itch-sensing neurons and provide novel insights into the basic mechanisms of itch transmission.</description>

Non-coding RNAs are fundamental to the competing endogenous RNA (CeRNA) hypothesis in oncology. Previous work focused on static CeRNA networks. We construct and analyze CeRNA networks for four sequential stages of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) based on multi-omics data of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs and mRNAs. We find that the networks possess a two-level bipartite structure: common competing endogenous network (CCEN) composed of an invariant set of microRNAs over all the stages and stage-dependent, unique competing endogenous networks (UCENs). A systematic enrichment analysis of the pathways of the mRNAs in CCEN reveals that they are strongly associated with cancer development. We also find that the microRNA-linked mRNAs from UCENs have a higher enrichment efficiency. A key finding is six microRNAs from CCEN that impact patient survival at all stages, and four microRNAs that affect the survival from a specific stage. The ten microRNAs can then serve as potential biomarkers and prognostic tools for LUAD.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1pKXGg7bnUY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

With exciting new NASA plans for a sustainable return to the moon, astronauts will once again leave Earth’s protective magnetosphere only to endure higher levels of radiation from galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and the possibility of a large solar particle event (SPE). Gateway, lunar landers, and surface habitats will be designed to protect crew against SPEs with vehicle optimization, storm shelter concepts, and/or active dosimetry; however, the ever penetrating GCR will continue to pose the most significant health risks especially as lunar missions increase in duration and as NASA sets its aspirations on Mars. The primary risks of concern include carcinogenesis, central nervous system (CNS) effects resulting in potential in-mission cognitive or behavioral impairment and/or late neurological disorders, degenerative tissue effects including circulatory and heart disease, as well as potential immune system decrements impacting multiple aspects of crew health. Characterization and mitigation of these risks requires a significant reduction in the large biological uncertainties of chronic (low-dose rate) heavy-ion exposures and the validation of countermeasures in a relevant space environment. Historically, most research on understanding space radiation-induced health risks has been performed using acute exposures of monoenergetic single-ion beams. However, the space radiation environment consists of a wide variety of ion species over a broad energy range. Using the fast beam switching and controls systems technology recently developed at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, a new era in radiobiological research is possible. NASA has developed the “GCR Simulator” to generate a spectrum of ion beams that approximates the primary and secondary GCR field experienced at human organ locations within a deep-space vehicle. The majority of the dose is delivered from protons (approximately 65%–75%) and helium ions (approximately 10%–20%) with heavier ions (Z ≥ 3) contributing the remainder. The GCR simulator exposes state-of-the art cellular and animal model systems to 33 sequential beams including 4 proton energies plus degrader, 4 helium energies plus degrader, and the 5 heavy ions of C, O, Si, Ti, and Fe. A polyethylene degrader system is used with the 100 MeV/n H and He beams to provide a nearly continuous distribution of low-energy particles. A 500 mGy exposure, delivering doses from each of the 33 beams, requires approximately 75 minutes. To more closely simulate the low-dose rates found in space, sequential field exposures can be divided into daily fractions over 2 to 6 weeks, with individual beam fractions as low as 0.1 to 0.2 mGy. In the large beam configuration (60 × 60 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), 54 special housing cages can accommodate 2 to 3 mice each for an approximately 75 min duration or 15 individually housed rats. On June 15, 2018, the NSRL made a significant achievement by completing the first operational run using the new GCR simulator. This paper discusses NASA’s innovative technology solution for a ground-based GCR simulator at the NSRL to accelerate our understanding and mitigation of health risks faced by astronauts. Ultimately, the GCR simulator will require validation across multiple radiogenic risks, endpoints, doses, and dose rates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QTWrG0NjKNI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex hormone transition may trigger severe depressive episodes in some women. In order to map mechanisms related to such phenomena we developed a pharmacological preclinical human model using sex hormone manipulation with gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) in a placebo‐controlled design. Here the findings from this model is synthesized and discussed in the context of related literature on hormonal contributions to reproductive mental health disorders. The GnRha model work points to an estradiol‐dependent depressive response in healthy women undergoing short‐term sex hormone manipulation with GnRHa, which is linked to serotonin transporter changes (a key regulator of synaptic serotonin), a disengagement of hippocampus, and overengagement of brain networks recruited when processing emotional salient information. Further, the GnRHa model suggest that key brain regions in the reward circuit are less engaged in positive stimuli when undergoing sex hormone manipulation, which may underlie anhedonia. Also, the work supports that enhanced sensitivity to estrogen signaling at the level of gene expression may drive increased risk for depressive symptoms when exposed to sex steroid hormone fluctuations. In conclusion, the GnRHa model work highlights the brain signatures of rapid and profound changes in sex steroid hormone milieu, which reflect plausible mechanisms by which risk for mood disorders works. This model points to the role of estrogen dynamics and sensitivity, and offers a rationale for personalized prevention in hormonal transition phases, for example pregnancy to postpartum transition, perimenopause, and hormone treatments, which now can move into clinical translation and ideally pave the way for protecting mental and cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Glial fibrillary acidic protein was identified as a network hub for the most altered proteins, and showed an isoform change during ageing (image created with Biorender.com).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a strong correlation between aging and onset of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, but little is known about whether cellular changes occur during normal aging that may explain this association. Here, proteomic and bioinformatic analysis was conducted on the substantia nigra (SN) of rats at four stages of life to identify and quantify protein changes throughout aging. This analysis revealed that proteins associated with cell adhesion, protein aggregation and oxidation‐reduction are dysregulated as early as middle age in rats. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was identified as a network hub connecting the greatest number of proteins altered during aging. Furthermore, the isoform of GFAP expressed in the SN varied throughout life. However, the expression levels of the rate‐limiting enzyme for dopamine production, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), were maintained even in the oldest animals, despite a reduction in the number of dopamine neurons in the SN pars compact(SNc) as aging progressed. This age‐related increase in TH expression per neuron would likely to increase the vulnerability of neurons, since increased dopamine production would be an additional source of oxidative stress. This, in turn, would place a high demand on support systems from local astrocytes, which themselves show protein changes that could affect their functionality. Taken together, this study highlights key processes that are altered with age in the rat SN, each of which converges upon GFAP. These findings offer insight into the relationship between aging and increased challenges to neuronal viability, and indicate an important role for glial cells in the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Single‐cell RNA sequencing study of retinal immune regulators identified CD47 and CD59a expression in photoreceptors—Implications in subretinal immune regulation&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e268d34d-c08a-4d41-8c51-5413225d2764/jnr24618-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the inner retina (from GCL to IPL), ganglion cells express high levels of CD200, CD47, and CX3CL1, followed by amacrine cells. Vascular endothelial cells express CD200 and CD47. They also express complement factor H and CD59a. In the outer retina (from INL to ONL), horizontal cells, on the one hand, express high levels of CD200 and CD47, whereas bipolar cells express only low levels of TGFβ2 and CD47. Photoreceptors, on the other hand, express CD59a and CD47 and the expression is increased in disease conditions such as retinal detachment and uveoretinitis. Immune activation (including microglial and complement activation) in the inner retina may be regulated predominately by ganglion cells and vascular endothelial cells with the support from amacrine cells, whereas immune activation in the outer retina may be regulated by horizontal cell and photoreceptors. Müller cells, which span throughout the neuroretina, express TGFβ2 and CD47 and may participate in the regulation of all types of retinal immune activation. BM, Bruch's membrane; GCL, ganglion cell layer; INL, inner nuclear layer; IPL, inner plexiform layer; ONL, outer nuclear layer; OPL, outer plexiform layer; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neuroretina is protected by its own defense system, that is microglia and the complement system. Under normal physiological conditions, microglial activation is tightly regulated by the neurons although the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Using published single‐cell RNA sequencing data sets, we found that immune regulatory molecules including CD200, CD47, CX3CL1, TGFβ, and complement inhibitor CD59a are expressed by various retinal neurons. Importantly, we found that photoreceptors express higher levels of CD47 and CD59a, which was further confirmed in cultured 661W cells, WERI‐Rb1 cells, and microdissected photoreceptors from human eyes. The expression of CD59a mRNA in 661W cells was upregulated by TNFα and hypoxia, whereas LPS, hypoxia, and IL‐4 upregulated CD47 mRNA expression in 661W cells. Immunofluorescence staining detected strong CD59a immunoreactivity in the outer nuclear layer, inner/outer segments, and discrete staining in ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), and outer plexiform layer. The expression of CD59a in photoreceptors was increased in the detached retina, but decreased in retinas from experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) mice. In EAU retina, CD59a was highly expressed by active immune cells. CD47 was detected in GCL, IPL, and inner nuclear layer and some photoreceptors. The expression of CD47 in photoreceptors was also increased in the detached retina but decreased in EAU retina. In a coculture system, 661W enhanced arginase‐1 and reduced IL‐6 mRNA expression in BV2 microglial cells. Our results suggest that photoreceptors express immune regulatory molecules and may have the potential to regulate immune activation in the outer retina/subretinal space under pathophysiological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Structural white matter alterations as compensatory mechanisms in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review of diffusion tensor imaging studies</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensation is described as normal or near to normal performance in Parkinson's disease (PD), despite the ongoing neural loss. Functional compensation typically proceeds in an inverse U‐shaped manner: compensation initiates in the prodromal phase, followed by an increasing episode until plateauing and diminishes in the advanced stages of the disease. The first evidence of the structural compensation was reported by functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Recent studies, which have used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as the basis for their investigation, have shown improved white matter diffusional properties both in motor‐ and non‐motor‐related structures in association with improved clinical scores in patients with PD. The majority of DTI studies have demonstrated microstructural compensation in the prodromal/early stages of PD at the regional scale. However, there have been reports of compensation in later stages of the disease and the whole‐brain/network scale that are probably due to the heterogeneous nature of PD. Although serving as a promising beginning to characterize compensation, lots remain to be clarified in understanding the underlying mechanisms of compensation and its structural pattern in PD. The existing knowledge gap necessitates studies that their main research questions are focused on structural compensation. This requirement becomes more apparent because structural compensation evidence has mostly emerged from the post hoc analysis of data and incidental findings of studies. Thus, future studies are required to investigate compensatory microstructural changes in PD to clarify the exact underlying mechanisms. These studies would also provide a basis to develop clinical improvements in the early diagnosis and management of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Dysregulation of synaptic pruning as a possible link between intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and neuropsychiatric disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24616?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24616?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prenatal and early postnatal stages represent a critical time window for human brain development. Interestingly, this window partly overlaps with the maturation of the intestinal flora (microbiota) that play a critical role in the bidirectional communication between the central and the enteric nervous systems (microbiota‐gut‐brain axis). The microbial composition has important influences on general health and the development of several organ systems, such as the gastrointestinal tract, the immune system, and also the brain. Clinical studies have shown that microbiota alterations are associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. In this review, we dissect the link between these neuropsychiatric disorders and the intestinal microbiota by focusing on their effect on synaptic pruning, a vital process in the maturation and establishing efficient functioning of the brain. We discuss in detail how synaptic pruning is dysregulated differently in the aforementioned neuropsychiatric disorders and how it can be influenced by dysbiosis and/or changes in the intestinal microbiota composition. We also review that the improvement in the intestinal microbiota composition by a change in diet, probiotics, prebiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation may play a role in improving neuropsychiatric functioning, which can be at least partly explained &lt;i&gt;via &lt;/i&gt; the optimization of synaptic pruning and neuronal connections. Altogether, the demonstration of the microbiota's influence on brain function &lt;i&gt;via &lt;/i&gt; microglial‐induced synaptic pruning addresses the possibility that the manipulation of microbiota‐immune crosstalk represents a promising strategy for treating neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Histone deacetylase inhibition reduces ventral tegmental area dopamine neuronal hyperexcitability involving AKAP150 signaling following maternal deprivation in juvenile male rats</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Histone deacetylase inhibition reduces ventral tegmental area dopamine neuronal hyperexcitability involving AKAP150 signaling following maternal deprivation in juvenile male rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3de54360-52ef-43ab-8595-b1480cc7b637/jnr24613-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maternal deprivation, a model of child neglect, increases VTA dopamine (DA) neuronal excitability through impaired interaction between AKAP150 and PKA resulting in GABAergic dysfunction. This neuroadaptation may be affected through HDAC2 and is reversible by in vivo HDAC inhibition suggesting the potential therapeutic efficacy of HDAC inhibitors in reversal of VTA DA dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic early life stress (ELS) is linked to dopamine (DA) dysregulation which increases the probability of developing psychiatric disorders in adolescence and adulthood. Our prior studies demonstrated that a severe early life stressor, a 24‐hr maternal deprivation (MD) in juvenile male rats, could lead to altered DA signaling from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) due to impairment of GABAergic synaptic plasticity (promoting GABAergic long‐term depression, LTD) with concomitant changes in the abundance of synaptic regulators including A‐kinase anchoring protein (AKAP150). Importantly, these MD‐induced synaptic changes in the VTA were accompanied by upregulation of histone deacetylase 2, histone hypoacetylation, and were reversible by HDAC inhibition. Using cell‐attached and whole‐cell patch clamp recordings, we found that MD stress also increased spontaneous VTA DA neuronal activity and excitability in juvenile male rats without affecting intrinsic excitability. Postsynaptic chemical disruption of AKAP150 and protein kinase A interaction increased VTA DA neuronal excitability in control non‐MD rats mimicking the effects of MD on DA cell excitability with similar changes in membrane properties. Interestingly, this disruption decreased MD‐induced VTA DA hyperexcitability. This MD‐induced DA neuronal hyperexcitability could also be normalized at 24 hr after injection of the class 1 HDAC inhibitor, CI‐994. Altogether, our data suggest that AKAP150 plays a critical role in the regulation of VTA DA neuronal excitability and that HDAC‐mediated targeting of AKAP150 signaling could normalize VTA DA dysfunction following ELS thereby providing novel therapeutic targets for prevention of later life psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: GDF15 promotes simultaneous astrocyte remodeling and tight junction strengthening at the blood–brain barrier</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;GDF15 promotes simultaneous astrocyte remodeling and tight junction strengthening at the blood–brain barrier&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1a549b2b-6b08-4f0d-9c01-eb0239d1bd38/jnr24611-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perivascular astrocyte processes (PAP, astrocyte endfeet) produce growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), which is released and modulates the astrocyte morphological changes and tight junction strengthening. Astrocytes and tight junctions are disrupted in diseased conditions and can be restored by pharmacologically driven increased GDF15 production at PAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perivascular astrocyte processes (PAP) surround cerebral endothelial cells (ECs) and modulate the strengthening of tight junctions to influence blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Morphologically altered astrocytes may affect barrier properties and trigger the onset of brain pathologies. However, astrocyte‐dependent mediators of these events remain poorly studied. Here, we show a pharmacologically driven elevated expression and release of growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) in rat primary astrocytes and cerebral PAP. GDF15 has been shown to possess trophic properties for motor neurons, prompting us to hypothesize similar effects on astrocytes. Indeed, its increased expression and release occurred simultaneously to morphological changes of astrocytes &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt; and PAP, suggesting modulatory effects of GDF15 on these cells, but also neighboring EC. Administration of recombinant GDF15 was sufficient to promote astrocyte remodeling and enhance barrier properties between ECs &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt;, whereas its pharmacogenetic abrogation prevented these effects. We validated our findings in male high anxiety‐related behavior rats, an animal model of depressive‐like behavior, with shrunk PAP associated with reduced expression of the junctional protein claudin‐5, which were both restored by a pharmacologically induced increase in GDF15 expression. Thus, we identified GDF15 as an astrocyte‐derived trigger of astrocyte process remodeling linked to enhanced tight junction strengthening at the BBB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Rare variants and biological pathways identified in treatment‐refractory depression&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/931837b5-89f8-4877-ae58-3d6b6e4a62b9/jnr24609-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common and rare exonic DNA variants were identified in treatment‐refractory major depressive disorder (TR‐MDD) patients (&lt;i&gt;n &lt;/i&gt; = 124) using whole exome sequencing. Common variants in three genes (&lt;i&gt;LARGE &lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;KMT2C &lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ROBO2 &lt;/i&gt;) were suggestive of association. Rare and likely damaging variants identified in TR‐MDD cases were enriched in biological pathways functional in the central nervous system (CNS); furthermore, these rare, damaging variants map to genes that are expressed in CNS tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder not responding to at least two adequate treatments are defined as treatment‐refractory major depressive disorder (TR‐MDD). Some TR‐MDD patients have altered metabolic phenotypes that may be pharmacologically reversed. The characterization of these phenotypes and their underlying etiologies is paramount, particularly their genetic components. In this study, TR‐MDD patients (&lt;i&gt;n &lt;/i&gt; = 124) were recruited and metabolites were quantified in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood. Three sub‐categories of deficiencies were examined, namely 5‐methyltetrahydrofolte (in CSF; &lt;i&gt;n &lt;/i&gt; = 13), tetrahydrobiopterin (in CSF; &lt;i&gt;n &lt;/i&gt; = 11), and abnormal acylcarnitine profiles (in peripheral blood; &lt;i&gt;n &lt;/i&gt; = 8). Whole exome sequencing was performed on genomic DNA from the entire TR‐MDD cohort and exonic variant allele frequencies for cases were compared to a control cohort (1:5 matching on ancestry). Low frequency, damaging alleles were identified and used for &lt;i&gt;in silico &lt;/i&gt; pathway analyses. Three association signals for TR‐MDD approached genome‐wide significance on chromosomes 22, 7, and 3. Three risk‐associated variants from a prior depression study were replicated. Relevant biological pathways were identified that contained an enrichment of rare, damaging variants in central nervous system (CNS)‐specific pathways, including neurotransmitter receptors, potassium channels, and synapse transmission. Some TR‐MDD patients had rare variants in genes that were previously associated with other psychiatric disorders, psychiatric endophenotypes, CNS structural defects, and CNS‐related cellular and molecular functions. Exome analysis of metabolically phenotyped TR‐MDD patients has identified potentially functional gene pathways and low frequency, deleterious gene variants for further investigation. Further studies in larger cohorts of biochemically phenotyped TR‐MDD patients are desirable to extend and confirm these findings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: The emerging roles of circular RNAs in CNS injuries</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With high morbidity and mortality worldwide, injuries to the central nervous system (CNS) usually result in devastating consequences. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood and current therapies are still limited. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a novel type of endogenous noncoding RNAs, characterized by covalently closed annular structure. It is gradually recognized that circRNAs are involved in multiple biological processes, such as acting as microRNA sponges or scaffolds during the assembly of protein complex and modulating the transcription of certain genes. Interestingly, circRNAs have been found to be highly expressed in the CNS, which indicates their neurospecificity. Several circRNAs have already been discovered to be associated with multiple pathophysiological processes following neurological diseases. Currently, the molecular roles of circRNAs in CNS injuries have gained increasing attention, leading to uninterrupted relevant researches. Herein, we presented a review of current studies on the role of circRNAs in CNS injuries. The therapeutic potency of circRNAs in CNS injuries was also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perinatal hypoxic‐ischemic (HI)‐related brain injury is an important cause of morbidity and long‐standing disability in newborns. The only currently approved therapeutic strategy available to reduce brain injury in the newborn is hypothermia. Therapeutic hypothermia can only be used to treat HI encephalopathy in full‐term infants and survivors remain at high risk for a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental abnormalities as a result of residual brain injury. Therefore, there is an urgent need for adjunctive therapeutic strategies. Inflammation and neurovascular damage are important factors that contribute to the pathophysiology of HI‐related brain injury and represent exciting potential targets for therapeutic intervention. In this review, we address the role of each component of the neurovascular unit (NVU) in the pathophysiology of HI‐related injury in the neonatal brain. Disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) observed in the early hours after an HI‐related event is associated with a response at the basal lamina level, which comprises astrocytes, pericytes, and immune cells, all of which could affect BBB function to further exacerbate parenchymal injury. Future research is required to determine potential drugs that could prevent or attenuate neurovascular damage and/or augment repair. However, some studies have reported beneficial effects of hypothermia, erythropoietin, stem cell therapy, anti‐cytokine therapy and metformin in ameliorating several different facets of damage to the NVU after HI‐related brain injury in the perinatal period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Remodeling of the interstitial extracellular matrix in white matter multiple sclerosis lesions: Implications for remyelination (failure)</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides protection, rigidity, and structure toward cells. It consists, among others, of a wide variety of glycoproteins and proteoglycans, which act together to produce a complex and dynamic environment, most relevant in transmembrane events. In the brain, the ECM occupies a notable proportion of its volume and maintains the homeostasis of central nervous system (CNS). In addition, remodeling of the ECM, that is transient changes in ECM proteins regulated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), is an important process that modulates cell behavior upon injury, thereby facilitating recovery. Failure of ECM remodeling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), a neurodegenerative demyelinating disease of the CNS with an inflammatory response against protective myelin sheaths that surround axons. Remyelination of denuded axons improves the neuropathological conditions of MS, but this regeneration process fails over time, leading to chronic disease progression. In this review, we uncover abnormal ECM remodeling in MS lesions by discussing ECM remodeling in experimental demyelination models, that is when remyelination is successful, and compare alterations in ECM components to the ECM composition and MMP expression in the parenchyma of demyelinated MS lesions, that is when remyelination fails. Inter‐ and intralesional differences in ECM remodeling in the distinct white matter MS lesions are discussed in terms of consequences for oligodendrocyte behavior and remyelination (failure). Hence, the review will aid to understand how abnormal ECM remodeling contributes to remyelination failure in MS lesions and assists in developing therapeutic strategies to promote remyelination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review article highlights the current state of perinatal depression (PND) research including established standards of care and innovative research in progress. PND can have a significant adverse impact on mother, child, and family; however, to date, wide‐scale identification, prevention, and treatment have been limited. PND is heterogenous in presentation with likely multifactorial etiologies for each woman. Challenges in PND research are discussed including a need for universal tools, standardized measures, benchmarks, and best practices. Current examples are reviewed that highlight approaches to novel treatment paradigms and interventions. This includes reviewing epidemiologic studies in PND research, examining the biological underpinnings of PND, and discussing examples from this field and other fields currently developing translational research that spans from bench to bedside. Current and future challenges and opportunities in developing best practices for the treatment of PND are outlined. We also discuss the use of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria approach for PND research and provide recommendations for future directions in PND research collaboration. In conclusion, greater precision in perinatal psychiatry can be possible in the future with the development of guidelines and best practices that build on current work and apply innovative and collaborative approaches of scientists, providers, patients, community members, and government officials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Characteristics of women with different perinatal depression trajectories&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4a497568-e99c-494d-8aaa-3f2388c35dc1/jnr24390-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depressive symptoms during and after pregnancy were assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Based on symptoms above clinical cut‐offs for depression, five distinct groups could be distinguished with different levels of depressive symptoms from during pregnancy through six months after childbirth. The associations were then tested between a number of background‐ and lifestyle‐, pregnancy‐, delivery‐, and postpartum‐related characteristics and these trajectory groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maternal perinatal depression (PND), a common mental disorder with a prevalence of over 10%, is associated with long‐term health risks for both mothers and offspring. This study aimed at describing characteristics related to background and lifestyle, pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum of different PND trajectories defined according to the onset of depressive symptoms. Participants were drawn from a large population‐based cohort study in Uppsala, Sweden (&lt;i&gt;n &lt;/i&gt; = 2,466). Five trajectory groups of depressive symptom onset were created using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ≥13 (pregnancy) or ≥12 points (postpartum): (a) &lt;i&gt;healthy &lt;/i&gt; (60.6%), (b) &lt;i&gt;pregnancy depression &lt;/i&gt; (8.5%), (c) &lt;i&gt;early postpartum onset &lt;/i&gt; (10.9%), (d) &lt;i&gt;late postpartum onset &lt;/i&gt; (5.4%), and (e) &lt;i&gt;chronic depression &lt;/i&gt; (14.6%). In multinomial logistic regressions, the associations between trajectories and the included characteristics were tested using the healthy trajectory as reference. Background characteristics (younger age, lower education, unemployment) were primarily associated with &lt;i&gt;pregnancy depression &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;chronic depression &lt;/i&gt;. Characteristics associated with all PND trajectories were smoking prior to pregnancy, migraine, premenstrual mood symptoms, intimate partner violence, interpersonal trauma, negative delivery expectations, pregnancy nausea, and symphysiolysis. Nulliparity, instrumental delivery, or a negative delivery experience was associated with &lt;i&gt;early postpartum onset &lt;/i&gt;. Postpartum factors (e.g., infantile colic, lack of sleep, low partner support, and bonding difficulties) were associated with &lt;i&gt;early  &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;late postpartum onset &lt;/i&gt; together with &lt;i&gt;chronic depression &lt;/i&gt;. The findings suggest that different PND trajectories have divergent characteristics, which could be used to create individualized treatment options. To find the most predictive characteristics for different PND trajectories, studies with even larger and more diverse samples are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Inflammatory markers in women with postpartum depressive symptoms</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postpartum depression (PPD) is a devastating disorder affecting not only more than 10% of all women giving birth, but also the baby, the family, and the society. Compiling evidence suggests the involvement of the immune system in the pathophysiology of major depression; yet, the immune response in perinatal depression is not as well studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the alterations in peripheral levels of inflammatory biomarkers in 169 Swedish women with and without depressive symptoms according to the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale or the M.I.N.I neuropsychiatric interview at eight weeks postpartum. Among the 70 markers analyzed with multiplex proximity extension assay, five were significantly elevated in women with postpartum depressive symptoms in the adjusted LASSO logistic regression analysis: Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member (TRANCE) (OR‐per 1 &lt;i&gt;SD &lt;/i&gt; increase = 1.20), Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (OR = 1.17) Interleukin (IL)‐18 (OR = 1.06), Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF‐23) (OR = 1.25), and C‐X‐C motif chemokine 1 (CXCL1) (OR 1.11). These results indicate that women with PPD have elevated levels of some inflammatory biomarkers. It is, therefore, plausible that PPD is associated with a compromised adaptability of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition to motherhood encompasses physiological and behavioral adaptations essential for the initiation and maintenance of offspring care and feeding and includes widespread changes throughout the brain. The growth of new neurons occurs across the lifespan in distinct regions of mammalian brains and changes dynamically across reproductive events in female mammals. The subventricular zone (SVZ) and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus undergo high rates of neurogenesis in adulthood and are sensitive to hormonal fluctuations. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with increased cell proliferation in the SVZ and interneuron survival in the olfactory bulb. In mice, peripartum prolactin signaling mediates SVZ neurogenesis and is important for enhanced olfactory recognition of offspring and maternal care. In contrast, cell proliferation and immature neuron survival decrease in the DG during the postpartum period. High baseline glucocorticoid concentrations suppress hippocampal neurogenesis, potentially representing an energetic trade‐off accompanying a reduced need for spatial navigation early postpartum. In women, hippocampal volume decline during pregnancy and partial recovery during the postpartum period could contribute to the risk of psychiatric illness. New evidence indicates that the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) is an additional site for adult neurogenesis sensitive to reproductive experience and offspring contact. In this review, we discuss the initial and lasting impact of maternal experience on adult neurogenesis. Because neurogenesis has been implicated in a variety of psychiatric and neurodegenerative illnesses, understanding how reproductive experience alters new neuron production in maternal mammals has far‐reaching implications for women's health and wellness across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Representative brain coronal sections to show the principal regions where PEDF (red dots on the left brain scheme) and PEDFR (blue dots on the right brain scheme) are detected by immunohistochemical study.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pigment epithelium‐derived factor (PEDF) is a multifunctional protein which was initially described in the retina, although it is also present in other tissues. It functions as an antioxidant agent promoting neuronal survival. Recently, a PEDF receptor has shown an elevated binding affinity for PEDF. There are no relevant data regarding the distribution of both proteins in the brain, therefore the main goal of this work was to investigate the spatiotemporal presence of PEDF and PEDFR in the adult mouse brain, and to determine the PEDF blood level in mouse and human. The localization of both proteins was analyzed by different experimental methods such as immunohistochemistry, western‐blotting, and also by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. Differential expression was found in some telencephalic structures and positive signals for both proteins were detected in the cerebellum. The magnitude of the PEDFR labeling pattern was higher than PEDF and included some cortical and subventricular areas. Age‐dependent changes in intensity of both protein immunoreactions were found in the cortical and hippocampal areas with greater reactivity between 4 and 8 months of age, whilst others, like the subventricular zones, these differences were more evident for PEDFR. Although ubiquitous presence was not found in the brain for these two proteins, their relevant functions must not be underestimated. It has been described that PEDF plays an important role in neuroprotection and data provided in the present work represents the first extensive study to understand the relevance of these two proteins in specific brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Parallel astrocyte calcium signaling modulates olfactory bulb responses&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d699cb1b-9a56-4238-8707-0232daf57996/jnr24634-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intersectional viral genetics allows for targeted expression in astrocytes. Olfactory bulb astrocyte calcium activity spatially matches neuronal activity patterns with odor stimulation. Manipulating astrocyte calcium activity alters neuronal activity and impacts olfactory behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell in the central nervous system. They modulate synaptic function through a variety of mechanisms, and yet remain relatively understudied with respect to overall neuronal circuit function. Exploiting the tractability of the mouse olfactory system, we manipulated astrocyte activity and examined how astrocytes modulate olfactory bulb responses. Toward this, we genetically targeted both astrocytes and neurons for &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; widefield imaging of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses to odor stimuli. We found that astrocytes exhibited odor response maps that overlap with excitatory neuronal activity. By manipulating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity in astrocytes using chemical genetics we found that odor‐evoked neuronal activity was reciprocally affected, suggesting that astrocyte activation inhibits neuronal odor responses. Subsequently, behavioral experiments revealed that astrocyte manipulations affect both odor detection threshold and discrimination, suggesting that astrocytes play an active role in olfactory sensory processing circuits. Together, these studies show that astrocyte calcium signaling contributes to olfactory behavior through modulation of sensory circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Prospective, longitudinal study. Patients (n=212) with MS (n=418 eyes), 59 healthy controls (HC, n=117 eyes) and 267 non–MS disease controls (534 eyes). OCT and Diffusion Tensor Imaging.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no PHOMS in HC eyes (0/117, 0%). The prevalence of PHOMS was significantly higher in patients with MS (34/212, p=0.001) and MS eyes (45/418, p=0.0002) if compared to HC (0/59, 0/117). The inter–rater agreement for PHOMS was 97.9%, kappa 0.951. PHOMS were present in 16% of patients with relapsing remitting, 16% of patients with progressive and 12% of patients with secondary progressive disease course (2% of eyes). There was no relationship of PHOMS with age, disease duration, disease course, disability or disease modifying treatments. The fractional anisotropy of the optic radiations was lower in patients without PHOMS (0.814) if compared to patients with PHOMS (0.845, p=0.03). The majority of PHOMS remained stable, but increase in size and de novo development of PHOMS were also observed. In non–MS disease controls, PHOMS were observed in intracranial hypertension (62%), ODD (47%), anomalous optic discs (44%), isolated optic neuritis (19%) and optic atrophy (12%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data suggest that PHOMS are a novel finding in MS pathology. Future research is needed to determine if development of PHOMS in MS is due to intermittently raised intracranial pressure or an otherwise impaired “glymphatic” outflow from eye to brain.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Mu opioid receptor knockout mouse: Phenotypes with implications on restless legs syndrome&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4e8b29e9-7156-49d4-b730-41eec31e9f35/jnr24637-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a complex sensorimotor disorder in which the role of the endogenous opioid system is not clear. This study suggests that the anemia of inflammation and loss of circadian variations in dopaminergic or serotonergic systems could underlie the pathogenesis of RLS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an irresistible need to move the legs while sitting or lying at night with insomnia as a frequent consequence. Human RLS has been associated with abnormalities in the endogenous opioid system, the dopaminergic system, the iron regulatory system, anemia, and inflammatory and auto‐immune disorders. Our previous work indicates that mice lacking all three subtypes of opioid receptors have a phenotype similar to that of human RLS. To study the roles of each opioid receptor subtype in RLS, we first used mu opioid receptor knockout (MOR KO) mice based on our earlier studies using postmortem brain and cell culture. The KO mice showed decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cells (RBCs), with an appearance of microcytic RBCs indicating anemia. Together with decreased serum iron and transferrin, but increased ferritin levels, the anemia is similar to that seen with chronic inflammation in humans. A decreased serum iron level was also observed in the wildtype mice treated with an MOR antagonist. Iron was increased in the liver and spleen of the KO mice. Normal circadian variations in the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems were absent in the KO mice. The KO mice showed hyperactivity and increased thermal sensitivity in wakefulness primarily during what would normally be the sleep phase similar to that seen in human RLS. Deficits in endogenous opioid system transmission could predispose to anemia of inflammation and loss of circadian variations in dopaminergic or serotonergic systems, thereby contributing to an RLS‐like phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An approach to implementing variational Bayesian inference in biological
systems is considered, under which the thermodynamic free energy of a system
directly encodes its variational free energy. In the case of the brain, this
assumption places constraints on the neuronal encoding of generative and
recognition densities, in particular requiring a stochastic population code.
The resulting relationship between thermodynamic and variational free energies
is prefigured in mind-brain identity theses in philosophy and in the Gestalt
hypothesis of psychophysical isomorphism.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Classification of Visual Perception and Imagery based EEG Signals Using Convolutional Neural Networks. (arXiv:2005.08842v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08842</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08842</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, visual perception (VP) and visual imagery (VI) paradigms are
investigated in several brain-computer interface (BCI) studies. VP is defined
as a changing of brain signals when perceiving visual information and VI is
defined as a changing of brain signals when memorizing visual information.
These paradigms could be alternatives to the previous visual-based paradigms
which have limitations such as fatigue and low information transfer rates
(ITR). In this study, we analyzed VP and VI to investigate the possibility to
control BCI. First, we conducted a time-frequency analysis with event-related
spectral perturbation to represent the reliability of the brain signal while
performing VP and VI. In addition, two types of decoding accuracies were
obtained with the convolutional neural network to verify whether the brain
signals can be distinguished from each class in the VP and whether they can be
differentiated with VP and VI paradigms. As a result, we obtained a high
performance of 43.00% (chance level is 16.67%) in the 6-class classification
(VP) of subject 1. The average performance was 32.56%. Also, the binary
classification performance which classifies two paradigms was 90.16%. These
results indicate that the use of the proposed method is beneficial for the
classification and prediction of the brain states from visual tasks (i.e. VP
and VI) when developing comfortable BCI systems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we present a brain-inspired cognitive architecture that
incorporates sensory processing, classification, contextual prediction, and
emotional tagging. The cognitive architecture is implemented as three modular
web-servers, meaning that it can be deployed centrally or across a network for
servers. The experiments reveal two distinct operations of behaviour, namely
high- and low-salience modes of operations, which closely model attention in
the brain. In addition to modelling the cortex, we have demonstrated that a
bio-inspired architecture introduced processing efficiencies. The software has
been published as an open source platform, and can be easily extended by future
research teams. This research lays the foundations for bio-realistic attention
direction and sensory selection, and we believe that it is a key step towards
achieving a bio-realistic artificial intelligent system.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08411</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural synchrony in the brain at rest is usually variable and intermittent,
thus intervals of predominantly synchronized activity are interrupted by
intervals of desynchronized activity. Prior studies suggested that this
temporal structure of the weakly synchronous activity might be functionally
significant: many short desynchronizations may be functionally different from
few long desynchronizations even if the average synchrony level is the same. In
this study, we used computational neuroscience methods to investigate the
effects of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) on the temporal patterns of
synchronization in a simple model. We employed a small network of
conductance-based model neurons that were connected via excitatory plastic
synapses. The dynamics of this network was subjected to the time-series
analysis methods used in prior experimental studies. We found that STDP could
alter the synchronized dynamics in the network in several ways, depending on
the time scale that plasticity acts on. However, in general, the action of STDP
in the simple network considered here is to promote dynamics with short
desynchronizations (i.e. dynamics reminiscent of that observed in experimental
studies). Complex interplay of the cellular and synaptic dynamics may lead to
the activity-dependent adjustment of synaptic strength in such a way as to
facilitate experimentally observed short desynchronizations in the
intermittently synchronized neural activity.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces a new system to design constructive level generators by
searching the space of constructive level generators defined by Marahel
language. We use NSGA-II, a multi-objective optimization algorithm, to search
for generators for three different problems (Binary, Zelda, and Sokoban). We
restrict the representation to a subset of Marahel language to push the
evolution to find more efficient generators. The results show that the
generated generators were able to achieve a good performance on most of the
fitness functions over these three problems but on Zelda and Sokoban they tend
to depend on the initial state than modifying the map.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Myelinated neurons are characterized by the presence of myelin, a
multilaminated wrapping around the axons formed by specialized neuroglial
cells. Myelin acts as an electrical insulator and therefore, in myelinated
neurons, the action potentials do not propagate within the axons but happen
only at the nodes of Ranvier which are gaps in the axonal myelination. Recent
advancements in brain science have shown that the shapes, timings, and
propagation speeds of these so-called saltatory action potentials are
controlled by various biochemical interactions among neurons, glial cells and
the extracellular space. Given the complexity of brain's structure and
processes, the work hypothesis made in this paper is that non-local effects are
involved in the optimal propagation of action potentials. A non-local model of
the action potentials propagation in myelinated neurons is proposed that
involves spatial derivatives of fractional order. The effects of non-locality
on the distribution of the membrane potential are investigated using numerical
simulations.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Solar activity It is vital to accurately predict solar activity, in order to
decrease the plausible damage of electronic equipment in the event of a large
high-intensity solar eruption. Recently, we have proposed BELFIS (Brain
Emotional Learning-based Fuzzy Inference System) as a tool for the forecasting
of chaotic systems. The structure of BELFIS is designed based on the neural
structure of fear conditioning. The function of BELFIS is implemented by
assigning adaptive networks to the components of the BELFIS structure. This
paper especially focuses on performance evaluation of BELFIS as a predictor by
forecasting solar cycles 16 to 24. The performance of BELFIS is compared with
other computational models used for this purpose, and in particular with
adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and their variants are capable of
encapsulating long-range dependencies, which is evident from their performance
on a variety of linguistic tasks. On the other hand, simple recurrent networks
(SRNs), which appear more biologically grounded in terms of synaptic
connections, have generally been less successful at capturing long-range
dependencies as well as the loci of grammatical errors in an unsupervised
setting. In this paper, we seek to develop models that bridge the gap between
biological plausibility and linguistic competence. We propose a new
architecture, the Decay RNN, which incorporates the decaying nature of neuronal
activations and models the excitatory and inhibitory connections in a
population of neurons. Besides its biological inspiration, our model also shows
competitive performance relative to LSTMs on subject-verb agreement, sentence
grammaticality, and language modeling tasks. These results provide some
pointers towards probing the nature of the inductive biases required for RNN
architectures to model linguistic phenomena successfully.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has emerged to deal with the selection
and configuration of algorithms for a given learning task. With the progression
of AutoML, several effective methods were introduced, especially for
traditional classification and regression problems. Apart from the AutoML
success, several issues remain open. One issue, in particular, is the lack of
ability of AutoML methods to deal with different types of data. Based on this
scenario, this paper approaches AutoML for multi-label classification (MLC)
problems. In MLC, each example can be simultaneously associated to several
class labels, unlike the standard classification task, where an example is
associated to just one class label. In this work, we provide a general
comparison of five automated multi-label classification methods -- two
evolutionary methods, one Bayesian optimization method, one random search and
one greedy search -- on 14 datasets and three designed search spaces. Overall,
we observe that the most prominent method is the one based on a canonical
grammar-based genetic programming (GGP) search method, namely
Auto-MEKA$_{GGP}$. Auto-MEKA$_{GGP}$ presented the best average results in our
comparison and was statistically better than all the other methods in different
search spaces and evaluated measures, except when compared to the greedy search
method.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: The (Un)Conscious Mouse as a Model for Human Brain Functions: Key Principles of Anesthesia and Their Impact on Translational Neuroimaging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00008</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00008</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, technical and procedural advances have brought functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to the field of murine neuroscience. Due to its unique capacity to measure functional activity non-invasively, across the entire brain, fMRI allows for the direct comparison of large-scale murine and human brain functions. This opens an avenue for bidirectional translational strategies to address fundamental questions ranging from neurological disorders to the nature of consciousness. The key challenges of murine fMRI are: (1) to generate and maintain functional brain states that approximate those of calm and relaxed human volunteers, while (2) preserving neurovascular coupling and physiological baseline conditions. Low-dose anesthetic protocols are commonly applied in murine functional brain studies to prevent stress and facilitate a calm and relaxed condition among animals. Yet, current mono-anesthesia has been shown to impair neural transmission and hemodynamic integrity. By linking the current state of murine electrophysiology, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging and fMRI of anesthetic effects to findings from human studies, this systematic review proposes general principles to design, apply and monitor anesthetic protocols in a more sophisticated way. The further development of balanced multimodal anesthesia, combining two or more drugs with complementary modes of action helps to shape and maintain specific brain states and relevant aspects of murine physiology. Functional connectivity and its dynamic repertoire as assessed by fMRI can be used to make inferences about cortical states and provide additional information about whole-brain functional dynamics. Based on this, a simple and comprehensive functional neurosignature pattern can be determined for use in defining brain states and anesthetic depth in rest and in response to stimuli. Such a signature can be evaluated and shared between labs to indicate the brain state of a mouse during experiments, an important step toward translating findings across species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Electrophysiological Determinants of Corticospinal Motor Neuron Vulnerability in ALS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00073</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain is complex and heterogeneous. Even though numerous independent studies indicate cortical hyperexcitability as a potential contributor to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathology, the mechanisms that are responsible for upper motor neuron (UMN) vulnerability remain elusive. To reveal the electrophysiological determinants of corticospinal motor neuron (CSMN, a.k.a UMN in mice) vulnerability, we investigated the motor cortex of hSOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice at P30 (postnatal day 30), a presymptomatic time point. Glutamate uncaging by laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) revealed altered dynamics especially within the inhibitory circuitry and more specifically in L2/3 of the motor cortex, whereas the excitatory microcircuits were unchanged. Observed microcircuitry changes were specific to CSMN in the motor column. Electrophysiological evaluation of the intrinsic properties in response to the microcircuit changes, as well as the exon microarray expression profiles of CSMN isolated from hSOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; and healthy mice at P30, revealed the presence of a very dynamic set of events, ultimately directed to establish, maintain and retain the balance at this early stage. Also, the expression profile of key voltage-gated potassium and sodium channel subunits as well as of the inhibitory GABA receptor subunits and modulatory proteins began to suggest the challenges CSMN face at this early age. Since neurodegeneration is initiated when neurons can no longer maintain balance, the complex cellular events that occur at this critical time point help reveal how CSMN try to cope with the challenges of disease manifestation. This information is critically important for the proper modulation of UMNs and for developing effective treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Substrate–Enzyme Interactions in Intramembrane Proteolysis: γ-Secretase as the Prototype</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00065</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00065</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs) catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds within the transmembrane regions of membrane protein substrates, releasing bioactive fragments that play roles in many physiological and pathological processes. Based on their catalytic mechanism and nucleophile, I-CLiPs are classified into metallo, serine, aspartyl, and glutamyl proteases. Presenilin is the most prominent among I-CLiPs, as the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase (GS) complex responsible for cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch, as well as many other membrane substrates. Recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of GS provide new details on how presenilin recognizes and cleaves APP and Notch. First, presenilin transmembrane helix (TM) 2 and 6 are dynamic. Second, upon binding to GS, the substrate TM helix is unwound from the C-terminus, resulting in an intermolecular β-sheet between the substrate and presenilin. The transition of the substrate C-terminus from α-helix to β-sheet is proposed to expose the scissile peptide bond in an extended conformation, leaving it susceptible to protease cleavage. Despite the astounding new insights in recent years, many crucial questions remain unanswered regarding the inner workings of γ-secretase, however. Key unanswered questions include how the enzyme recognizes and recruits substrates, how substrates are translocated from an initial docking site to the active site, how active site aspartates recruit and coordinate catalytic water, and the nature of the mechanisms of processive trimming of the substrate and product release. Answering these questions will have important implications for drug discovery aimed at selectively reducing the amyloid load in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with minimal side effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Elevated Plasma Melatonin Levels Are Correlated With the Non-motor Symptoms in Parkinson’s Disease: A Cross-Sectional Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00505</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00505</link>
	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Melatonin is the major hormone produced and secreted at night by the pineal gland into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and circulation. The relationship between plasma melatonin levels and Parkinson’s disease is not clear. The aim of the current study was to assess plasma melatonin levels in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients and to analysis the relationship between plasma melatonin levels and non-motor symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;Participants and Methods&lt;p&gt;In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated 61 patients with idiopathic PD [males n = 30 (49.2%), average age 62.4 years (range: 46–73 years)] and a total of 58 healthy volunteers [males n = 30 (51.7%), average age 64.3 years (range: 45–70 years)] who participated in the study. Plasma melatonin levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The severity of disease in PD patients was scored by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale and the Hoehn and Yahr Staging scale. The quality of life in PD patients was assessed by the 39-item Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire. The non-motor symptoms were assessed by the 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale for PD.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with the healthy controls, the plasma melatonin levels were significantly higher in PD patients (12.82 ± 4.85 vs. 19.40 ± 4.23, P &amp;lt; 0.001). Plasma melatonin levels were significantly associated with the levodopa equivalent daily dose (r = −0.262, P &amp;lt; 0.05, n = 61). Higher plasma melatonin concentrations were detected in the negative cardiovascular symptom group than in the cardiovascular symptom group (20.13 ± 3.74 vs. 16.93 ± 3.74, P &amp;lt; 0.05). Higher plasma melatonin concentrations were detected in the non-sleep-disorders group than in the sleep disorders group (22.12 ± 5.93 vs. 18.86 ± 3.66, P &amp;lt; 0.05). In addition, the plasma melatonin concentration was higher in the group without gastrointestinal dysfunction than in the gastrointestinal dysfunction group (21.71 ± 4.44 vs. 18.35 ± 3.74, P &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study revealed that the plasma melatonin levels in PD patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. Non-motor symptoms that were significantly negatively correlated with plasma melatonin levels were cardiovascular symptoms, sleep disorders, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Plasma melatonin levels have the closest relationship with sleep disorders. There was a correlation between plasma melatonin levels and sleep quality in patients with PD. The remaining non-motor symptoms were not related to plasma melatonin levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Tapping Into the Language of Touch: Using Non-invasive Stimulation to Specify Tactile Afferent Firing Patterns</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00500</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The temporal pattern of action potentials can convey rich information in a variety of sensory systems. We describe a new non-invasive technique that enables precise, reliable generation of action potential patterns in tactile peripheral afferent neurons by brief taps on the skin. Using this technique, we demonstrate sophisticated coding of temporal information in the somatosensory system, that shows that perceived vibration frequency is not encoded in peripheral afferents as was expected by either their firing rate or the underlying periodicity of the stimulus. Instead, a burst gap or silent gap between trains of action potentials conveys frequency information. This opens the possibility of new encoding strategies that could be deployed to convey sensory information using mechanical or electrical stimulation in neural prostheses and brain-machine interfaces, and may extend to senses beyond artificial encoding of aspects of touch. We argue that a focus on appropriate use of effective temporal coding offers more prospects for rapid improvement in the function of these interfaces than attempts to scale-up existing devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A Framework for Adapting Deep Brain Stimulation Using Parkinsonian State Estimates</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) remain poorly understood and are still under debate. This has hindered the development of adaptive DBS (aDBS). For further progress in aDBS, more insight into the dynamics of PD is needed, which can be obtained using machine learning models. This study presents an approach that uses generative and discriminative machine learning models to more accurately estimate the symptom severity of patients and adjust therapy accordingly. A support vector machine is used as the representative algorithm for discriminative machine learning models, and the Gaussian mixture model is used for the generative models. Therapy is effected using the state estimates obtained from the machine learning models together with a fuzzy controller in a critic-actor control approach. Both machine learning model configurations achieve PD suppression to desired state in 7 out of 9 cases; most of which settle in under 2 s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Transcranial Static Magnetic Field Stimulation of the Motor Cortex in Children</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive neuromodulation is an emerging therapy for children with early brain injury but is difficult to apply to preschoolers when windows of developmental plasticity are optimal. Transcranial static magnetic field stimulation (tSMS) decreases primary motor cortex (M1) excitability in adults but effects on the developing brain are unstudied.&lt;/p&gt;Objective/Hypothesis&lt;p&gt;We aimed to determine the effects of tSMS on cortical excitability and motor learning in healthy children. We hypothesized that tSMS over right M1 would reduce cortical excitability and inhibit contralateral motor learning.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded, three-arm, cross-over trial enrolled 24 healthy children aged 10–18 years. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) assessed cortical excitability via motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and paired pulse measures. Motor learning was assessed via the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT). A tSMS magnet (677 Newtons) or sham was held over left or right M1 for 30 min while participants trained the non-dominant hand. A linear mixed effect model was used to examine intervention effects.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;All 72 tSMS sessions were well tolerated without serious adverse effects. Neither cortical excitability as measured by MEPs nor paired-pulse intracortical neurophysiology was altered by tSMS. Possible behavioral effects included contralateral tSMS inhibiting early motor learning (p &amp;lt; 0.01) and ipsilateral tSMS facilitating later stages of motor learning (p &amp;lt; 0.01) in the trained non-dominant hand.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;tSMS is feasible in pediatric populations. Unlike adults, tSMS did not produce measurable changes in MEP amplitude. Possible effects of M1 tSMS on motor learning require further study. Our findings support further exploration of tSMS neuromodulation in young children with cerebral palsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The sense of smell has been shown to deteriorate in patients with some neurodegenerative disorders. In Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), decreased ability to smell is associated with early disease stages. Thus, olfactory neurons in the nose and olfactory bulb (OB) may provide a window into brain physiology and pathophysiology to address the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Because nasal olfactory receptor neurons regenerate throughout life, the olfactory system offers a broad variety of cellular mechanisms that could be altered in AD, including odorant receptor expression, neurogenesis and neurodegeneration in the olfactory epithelium, axonal targeting to the OB, and synaptogenesis and neurogenesis in the OB. This review focuses on pathophysiological changes in the periphery of the olfactory system during the progression of AD in mice, highlighting how the olfactory epithelium and the OB are particularly sensitive to changes in proteins and enzymes involved in AD pathogenesis. Evidence reviewed here in the context of the emergence of other typical pathological changes in AD suggests that olfactory impairments could be used to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the early phases of the pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Systems Biology: Effects of Moderate Static Magnetic Field on Neural Systems Is a Non-invasive Mechanical Stimulation of the Brain Possible Theoretically?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Static magnetic fields have been shown to induce effects on the human brain. Different experiments seem to support the idea that moderate static magnetic field can exert some influence on the gating processes of the membrane channels. In this article we visit the order of magnitude of the energy magnetic terms associated with moderate applied field (between 10 and 200 milliteslas). It is shown that gradients of the Zeeman energy associated with the inhomogeneous applied fields can induce pressures of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;–2&lt;/sup&gt;Pa. The surface tension generated by the magnetic pressure, on the surface delimiting the brain region subject to relevant field and gradients, is found to range between 10&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1 mN⋅m&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;. These pressures seem to be strong enough to interfere with the elastic and electrostatic energies involved in the channel activation-inactivation-deactivation mechanisms of biological membranes. It has been described that small mechanical force can activate voltage gated potassium channels. Moreover, stretch-activated ion channels are widely described in different biological tissues. Virtually, all these channels can modify their activity if stressed by a sufficient pressure delivered for enough time. We propose mechanical stimulation – possibly not exclusively – as a candidate mechanism how static magnetic field can produce effects in biological systems. It must be emphasized, that such field gradients were not previously proposed as a possible source of neural activity modification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The technology for producing microelectrode arrays (MEAs) has been developing since the 1970s and extracellular electrophysiological recordings have become well established in neuroscience, drug screening and cardiology. MEAs allow monitoring of long-term spiking activity of large ensembles of excitable cells noninvasively with high temporal resolution and mapping its spatial features. However, their inability to register subthreshold potentials, such as intrinsic membrane oscillations and synaptic potentials, has inspired a number of laboratories to search for alternatives to bypass the restrictions and/or increase the sensitivity of microelectrodes. In this study, we present the fabrication and in vitro experimental validation of arrays of PEDOT:PSS-coated 3D ultramicroelectrodes, with the best-reported combination of small size and low electrochemical impedance. We observed that this type of microelectrode does not alter neuronal network biological properties, improves the signal quality of extracellular recordings and exhibits higher selectivity toward single unit recordings. With fabrication processes simpler than those reported in the literature for similar electrodes, our technology is a promising tool for study of neuronal networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are involved not only in hemostasis but also in the development of ischemic brain injury. In the present work, we examined in vivo effects of a new peptide (AP9) composing Asn&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;-Phen&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt; of PAR1 “tethered ligand” generated by activated protein C. We chose a mouse model of photothrombosis (PT)-induced ischemia to assess AP9 effects in vivo. To reveal the molecular mechanism of AP9 action, mice lacking β-arrestin-2 were used. AP9 was injected intravenously once 10 min before PT at doses of 0.2, 2, or 20 mg/kg, or twice, that is, 10 min before and 1 h after PT at a dose of 20 mg/kg. Lesion volume was measured by magnetic resonance imaging and staining of brain sections with tetrazolium salt. Neurologic deficit was estimated using the cylinder and the grid-walk tests. Blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption was assessed by Evans blue dye extraction. Eosin-hematoxylin staining and immunohistochemical staining were applied to evaluate the number of undamaged neurons and activated glial cells in the penumbra. A single administration of AP9 (20 mg/kg), as well as its two injections (20 mg/kg), decreased brain lesion volume. A double administration of AP9 also reduced BBB disruption and neurological deficit in mice. We did not observe the protective effect of AP9 in mice lacking β-arrestin-2 after PT. Thus, we demonstrated for the first time protective properties of a PAR1 agonist peptide, AP9, in vivo. β-Arrestin-2 was required for the protective action of AP9 in PT-induced brain ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Similarly to human population imaging, there are several well-founded motivations for animal population imaging, the most notable being the improvement of the validity of statistical results by pooling a sufficient number of animal data provided by different imaging centers. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of such a multicenter animal study, sharing raw data from forty rats and processing pipelines between four imaging centers. As specific use case, we focused on T1 and T2 mapping of the healthy rat brain at 7T. We quantitatively report about the variability observed across two MR data providers and evaluate the influence of image processing steps on the final maps, using three fitting algorithms from three centers. Finally, to derive relaxation times from different brain areas, two multi-atlas segmentation pipelines from different centers were performed on two different platforms. Differences between the two data providers were 2.21% for T1 and 9.52% for T2. Differences between processing pipelines were 1.04% for T1 and 3.33% for T2. These maps, obtained in healthy conditions, may be used in the future as reference when exploring alterations in animal models of pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Small Animal Shanoir (SAS) A Cloud-Based Solution for Managing Preclinical MR Brain Imaging Studies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00020</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Clinical multicenter imaging studies are frequent and rely on a wide range of existing tools for sharing data and processing pipelines. This is not the case for preclinical (small animal) studies. Animal population imaging is still in infancy, especially because a complete standardization and control of initial conditions in animal models across labs is still difficult and few studies aim at standardization of acquisition and post-processing techniques. Clearly, there is a need of appropriate tools for the management and sharing of data, post-processing and analysis methods dedicated to small animal imaging. Solutions developed for Human imaging studies cannot be directly applied to this specific domain. In this paper, we present the Small Animal Shanoir (SAS) solution for supporting animal population imaging using tools compatible with open data. The integration of automated workflow tools ensures accessibility and reproducibility of research outputs. By sharing data and imaging processing tools, hosted by SAS, we promote data preparation and tools for reproducibility and reuse, and participation in multicenter or replication “open science” studies contributing to the improvement of quality science in preclinical domain. SAS is a first step for promoting open science for small animal imaging and a contribution to the valorization of data and pipelines of reference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Central and Peripheral Shoulder Fatigue Pre-screening Using the Sigma–Lognormal Model: A Proof of Concept</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00171</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Clinical tests for detecting central and peripheral shoulder fatigue are limited. The discrimination of these two types of fatigue is necessary to better adapt recovery intervention. The Kinematic Theory of Rapid Human Movements describes the neuromotor impulse response using lognormal functions and has many applications in pathology detection. The ideal motor control is modeled and a change in the neuromuscular system is reflected in parameters extracted according to this theory.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to assess whether a shoulder neuromuscular fatigue could be detected through parameters describing the theory, if there is the possibility to discriminate central from peripheral fatigue, and which handwriting test gives the most relevant information on fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty healthy participants performed two sessions of fast stroke handwriting on a tablet, before and after a shoulder fatigue. The fatigue was in internal rotation for one session and in external rotation during the other session. The drawings consisted of simple strokes, triangles, horizontal, and vertical oscillations. Parameters of these strokes were extracted according to the Sigma–Lognormal model of the Kinematic Theory. The evolution of each participant was analyzed through a U-Mann–Whitney test for individual comparisons. A Hotelling’s T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-test and a U-Mann–Whitney test were also performed on all participants to assess the group evolution after fatigue. Moreover, a correlation among parameters was calculated through Spearman coefficients to assess intrinsic parameters properties of each handwriting test.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Central and peripheral parameters were statistically different before and after fatigue with a possibility to discriminate them. Participants had various responses to fatigue. However, when considering the group, parameters related to the motor program execution showed significant increase in the handwriting tests after shoulder fatigue. The test of simple strokes permits to know more specifically where the fatigue comes from, whereas the oscillations tests were the most sensitive to fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The results of this study suggest that the Sigma–Lognormal model of the Kinematic Theory is an innovative approach for fatigue detection with discrimination between the central and peripheral systems. Overall, there is a possibility to implement the setting for clinics and sports personalized follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Dynamic Changes in EEG Power Spectral Densities During NIH-Toolbox Flanker, Dimensional Change Card Sort Test and Episodic Memory Tests in Young Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Much is known about electroencephalograph (EEG) patterns during sleep, but until recently, it was difficult to study EEG patterns during conscious, awake behavior. Technological advances such as powerful wireless EEG systems have led to a renewed interest in EEG as a clinical and research tool for studying real-time changes in the brain. We report here the first normative study of EEG activity while healthy young adults completed a series of cognitive tests recently published by the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognitive Battery (NIH-TCB), a commonly-used standardized measure of cognition primarily used in clinical populations. In this preliminary study using a wireless EEG system, we examined power spectral density (PSD) in four EEG frequency bands. During baseline and cognitive testing, PSD activity for the lower frequency bands (theta and alpha) was greater, relative to the higher frequency bands (beta and gamma), suggesting participants were relaxed and mentally alert. Alpha, beta and gamma activity was increased during a memory test compared to two other, less demanding executive function tests. Gamma activity was also inversely correlated with performance on the memory test, consistent with the neural efficiency hypothesis which proposes that better cognitive performance may link with lower cortical energy consumption. In summary, our study suggests that cognitive performance is related to the dynamics of EEG activity in a normative young adult population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: An Active Inference Approach to Modeling Structure Learning: Concept Learning as an Example Case</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00041</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Within computational neuroscience, the algorithmic and neural basis of structure learning remains poorly understood. Concept learning is one primary example, which requires both a type of internal model expansion process (adding novel hidden states that explain new observations), and a model reduction process (merging different states into one underlying cause and thus reducing model complexity via meta-learning). Although various algorithmic models of concept learning have been proposed within machine learning and cognitive science, many are limited to various degrees by an inability to generalize, the need for very large amounts of training data, and/or insufficiently established biological plausibility. Using concept learning as an example case, we introduce a novel approach for modeling structure learning—and specifically state-space expansion and reduction—within the active inference framework and its accompanying neural process theory. Our aim is to demonstrate its potential to facilitate a novel line of active inference research in this area. The approach we lay out is based on the idea that a generative model can be equipped with extra (hidden state or cause) “slots” that can be engaged when an agent learns about novel concepts. This can be combined with a Bayesian model reduction process, in which any concept learning—associated with these slots—can be reset in favor of a simpler model with higher model evidence. We use simulations to illustrate this model's ability to add new concepts to its state space (with relatively few observations) and increase the granularity of the concepts it currently possesses. We also simulate the predicted neural basis of these processes. We further show that it can accomplish a simple form of “one-shot” generalization to new stimuli. Although deliberately simple, these simulation results highlight ways in which active inference could offer useful resources in developing neurocomputational models of structure learning. They provide a template for how future active inference research could apply this approach to real-world structure learning problems and assess the added utility it may offer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Conscious Multisensory Integration: Introducing a Universal Contextual Field in Biological and Deep Artificial Neural Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00015</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Conscious awareness plays a major role in human cognition and adaptive behavior, though its function in multisensory integration is not yet fully understood, hence, questions remain: How does the brain integrate the incoming multisensory signals with respect to different external environments? How are the roles of these multisensory signals defined to adhere to the anticipated behavioral-constraint of the environment? This work seeks to articulate a novel theory on conscious multisensory integration (CMI) that addresses the aforementioned research challenges. Specifically, the well-established contextual field (CF) in pyramidal cells and coherent infomax theory (Kay et al., 1998; Kay and Phillips, 2011) is split into two functionally distinctive integrated input fields: local contextual field (LCF) and universal contextual field (UCF). LCF defines the modulatory sensory signal coming from some other parts of the brain (in principle from anywhere in space-time) and UCF defines the outside environment and anticipated behavior (based on past learning and reasoning). Both LCF and UCF are integrated with the receptive field (RF) to develop a new class of contextually-adaptive neuron (CAN), which adapts to changing environments. The proposed theory is evaluated using human contextual audio-visual (AV) speech modeling. Simulation results provide new insights into contextual modulation and selective multisensory information amplification/suppression. The central hypothesis reviewed here suggests that the pyramidal cell, in addition to the classical excitatory and inhibitory signals, receives LCF and UCF inputs. The UCF (as a steering force or tuner) plays a decisive role in precisely selecting whether to amplify/suppress the transmission of relevant/irrelevant feedforward signals, without changing the content e.g., which information is worth paying more attention to? This, as opposed to, unconditional excitatory and inhibitory activity in existing deep neural networks (DNNs), is called conditional amplification/suppression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Modeling a Nociceptive Neuro-Immune Synapse Activated by ATP and 5-HT in Meninges: Novel Clues on Transduction of Chemical Signals Into Persistent or Rhythmic Neuronal Firing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00135</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Extracellular ATP and serotonin (5-HT) are powerful triggers of nociceptive firing in the meninges, a process supporting headache and whose cellular mechanisms are incompletely understood. The current study aimed to develop, with the neurosimulator NEURON, a novel approach to explore in silico the molecular determinants of the long-lasting, pulsatile nature of migraine attacks. The present model included ATP and 5-HT release, ATP diffusion and hydrolysis, 5-HT uptake, differential activation of ATP P2X or 5-HT3 receptors, and receptor subtype-specific desensitization. The model also tested the role of branched meningeal fibers with multiple release sites. Spike generation and propagation were simulated using variable contribution by potassium and sodium channels in a multi-compartment fiber environment. Multiple factors appeared important to ensure prolonged nociceptive firing potentially relevant to long-lasting pain. Crucial roles were observed in: (i) co-expression of ATP P2X2 and P2X3 receptor subunits; (ii) intrinsic activation/inactivation properties of sodium Nav1.8 channels; and (iii) temporal and spatial distribution of ATP/5-HT release sites along the branches of trigeminal nerve fibers. Based on these factors we could obtain either persistent activation of nociceptive firing or its periodic bursting mimicking the pulsating nature of pain. In summary, our model proposes a novel tool for the exploration of peripheral nociception to test the contribution of clinically relevant factors to headache including migraine pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Senescence as an Amyloid Cascade: The Amyloid Senescence Hypothesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00129</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00129</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Due to their postmitotic status, the potential for neurons to undergo senescence has historically received little attention. This lack of attention has extended to some non-postmitotic cells as well. Recently, the study of senescence within the central nervous system (CNS) has begun to emerge as a new etiological framework for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). The presence of senescent cells is known to be deleterious to non-senescent neighboring cells via development of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) which includes the release of inflammatory, oxidative, mitogenic, and matrix-degrading factors. Senescence and the SASP have recently been hailed as an alternative to the amyloid cascade hypothesis and the selective killing of senescence cells by senolytic drugs as a substitute for amyloid beta (Aß) targeting antibodies. Here we call for caution in rejecting the amyloid cascade hypothesis and to the dismissal of Aß antibody intervention at least in early disease stages, as Aß oligomers (AßO), and cellular senescence may be inextricably linked. We will review literature that portrays AßO as a stressor capable of inducing senescence. We will discuss research on the potential role of secondary senescence, a process by which senescent cells induce senescence in neighboring cells, in disease progression. Once this seed of senescent cells is present, the elimination of senescence-inducing stressors like Aß would likely be ineffective in abrogating the spread of senescence. This has potential implications for when and why AßO clearance may or may not be effective as a therapeutic for AD. The selective killing of senescent cells by the immune system via immune surveillance naturally curtails the SASP and secondary senescence outside the CNS. Immune privilege restricts the access of peripheral immune cells to the brain parenchyma, making the brain a safe harbor for the spread of senescence and the SASP. However, an increasingly leaky blood brain barrier (BBB) compromises immune privilege in aging AD patients, potentially enabling immune infiltration that could have detrimental consequences in later AD stages. Rather than an alternative etiology, senescence itself may constitute an essential component of the cascade in the amyloid cascade hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Differential Expression of Acid – Sensing Ion Channels in Mouse Primary Afferents in Naïve and Injured Conditions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Injury and inflammation cause tissue acidosis, which is a common feature of various painful conditions. Acid-Sensing Ion channels (ASICs) are amongst the main excitatory channels activated by extracellular protons and expressed in the nervous system. Six transcripts of ASIC subunits including ASIC1a, ASIC1b, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, ASIC3, and ASIC4 are encoded by four genes (Asic1–4) and have been identified in rodents. Most ASIC subunits are present at substantial levels in primary sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) except for ASIC4. However, their expression pattern in DRG neurons remains largely unclear, mainly due to the lack of antibodies with appropriate specificity. In this study, we examined in detail the expression pattern of ASIC1-3 subunits, including splice variants, in different populations of DRG neurons in adult mice using an in situ hybridization technique (RNAscope) with high sensitivity and specificity. We found that in naïve condition, all five subunits examined were expressed in the majority of myelinated, NF200-immunoreactive, DRG neurons (NF200&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). However, ASIC subunits showed a very different expression pattern among non-myelinated DRG neuronal subpopulations: ASIC1 and ASIC3 were only expressed in CGRP-immunoreactive neurons (CGRP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), ASIC2a was mostly expressed in the majority of IB4-binding neurons (IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), while ASIC2b was expressed in almost all non-myelinated DRG neurons. We also found that at least half of sensory neurons expressed multiple types of ASIC subunits, indicating prevalence of heteromeric channels. In mice with peripheral nerve injury, the expression level of ASIC1a and ASIC1b in L4 DRG and ASIC3 in L5 DRG were altered in CGRP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, but not in IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Furthermore, the pattern of change varied among DRGs depending on their segmental level, which pointed to differential regulatory mechanisms between afferent types and anatomical location. The distinct expression pattern of ASIC transcripts in naïve condition, and the differential regulation of ASIC subunits after peripheral nerve injury, suggest that ASIC subunits are involved in separate sensory modalities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Structural Covariance Changes of Anterior and Posterior Hippocampus During Musical Training in Young Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Musical training can induce the functional and structural changes of the hippocampus. The hippocampus is not a homogeneous structure which can be divided into anterior and posterior parts along its longitudinal axis, and the whole-brain structural covariances of anterior (aHC) and posterior hippocampus (pHC) show distinct patterns in young adults. However, little is known about whether the anterior and posterior hippocampal structural covariances change after long-term musical training. Here, we investigated the musical training-induced changes of the whole-brain structural covariances of bilateral aHC and pHC in a longitudinal designed experiment with two groups (training group and control group) across three time points [the beginning (TP1) and the end (TP2) of 24 weeks of training, and 12 weeks after training (TP3)]. Using seed partial least square, we identified two significant patterns of structural covariance of the aHC and pHC. The first showed common structural covariance of the aHC and pHC. The second pattern revealed distinct structural covariance of the two regions and reflected the changes of structural covariance of the left pHC in the training group across three time points: the left pHC showed significant structural covariance with bilateral hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, left calcarine sulcus only at TP1 and TP3. Furthermore, the integrity of distinct structural networks of aHC and pHC in the second pattern significantly increased in the training group. Our findings suggest that musical training could change the organization of structural whole-brain covariance for left pHC and enhance the degree of the structural covariance network differentiation of the aHC and pHC in young adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Older Age Increases the Amplitude of Muscle Stretch-Induced Cortical Beta-Band Suppression But Does not Affect Rebound Strength</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Healthy aging is associated with deterioration of the sensorimotor system, which impairs balance and somatosensation. However, the exact age-related changes in the cortical processing of sensorimotor integration are unclear. This study investigated primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) oscillations in the 15–30 Hz beta band at rest and following (involuntary) rapid stretches to the triceps surae muscles (i.e., proprioceptive stimulation) of young and older adults. A custom-built, magnetoencephalography (MEG)-compatible device was used to deliver rapid (190°·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) ankle rotations as subjects sat passively in a magnetically-shielded room while MEG recorded their cortical signals. Eleven young (age 25 ± 3 years) and 12 older (age 70 ± 3 years) adults matched for physical activity level demonstrated clear 15–30 Hz beta band suppression and rebound in response to the stretches. A sub-sample (10 young and nine older) were tested for dynamic balance control on a sliding platform. Older adults had greater cortical beta power pre-stretch (e.g., right leg: 4.0 ± 1.6 fT vs. 5.6 ± 1.7 fT, P = 0.044) and, subsequently, greater normalized movement-related cortical beta suppression post-proprioceptive stimulation (e.g., right leg: −5.8 ± 1.3 vs. −7.6 ± 1.7, P = 0.01) than young adults. Furthermore, poorer balance was associated with stronger cortical beta suppression following proprioceptive stimulation (r = −0.478, P = 0.038, n = 19). These results provide further support that cortical processing of proprioception is hindered in older adults, potentially (adversely) influencing sensorimotor integration. This was demonstrated by the impairment of prompt motor action control, i.e., regaining perturbed balance. Finally, SM1 cortex beta suppression to a proprioceptive stimulus seems to indicate poorer sensorimotor functioning in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Gain of channel function and modified gating properties in TRPM3 mutants causing intellectual disability and epilepsy</title>

	<description>Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by epilepsy with comorbid intellectual disability. Recently, two &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding TRPM3, a calcium permeable ion channel, were identified as the cause of DEE in eight probands, but the functional consequences of the mutations remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that both mutations (V990M and P1090Q) have distinct effects on TRPM3 gating, including increased basal activity, higher sensitivity to stimulation by the endogenous neurosteroid pregnenolone sulphate (PS) and heat, and altered response to ligand modulation. Most strikingly, the V990M mutation affected the gating of the non-canonical pore of TRPM3, resulting in large inward cation currents via the voltage sensor domain in response to PS stimulation. Taken together, these data indicate that the two DEE mutations in TRPM3 result in a profound gain of channel function, which may lie at the basis of epileptic activity and neurodevelopmental symptoms in the patients.</description>

	<title>eLife: β spectrin-dependent and domain specific mechanisms for Na+ channel clustering</title>

	<description>Previously, we showed that a hierarchy of spectrin cytoskeletal proteins maintains nodal Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (Liu et al., 2020). Here, using mice lacking β1, β4, or β1/β4 spectrins, we show this hierarchy does not function at axon initial segments (AIS). Although β1 spectrin, together with AnkyrinR (AnkR), compensates for loss of nodal β4 spectrin, it cannot compensate at AIS. We show AnkR lacks the domain necessary for AIS localization. Whereas loss of β4 spectrin causes motor impairment and disrupts AIS, loss of β1 spectrin has no discernable effect on central nervous system structure or function. However, mice lacking both neuronal β1 and β4 spectrin show exacerbated nervous system dysfunction compared to mice lacking β1 or β4 spectrin alone, including profound disruption of AIS Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel clustering, progressive loss of nodal Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, and seizures. These results further define the important role of AIS and nodal spectrins for nervous system function.</description>

	<title>eLife: mRNA stem-loops can pause the ribosome by hindering A-site tRNA binding</title>

	<description>Although the elongating ribosome is an efficient helicase, certain mRNA stem-loop structures are known to impede ribosome movement along mRNA and stimulate programmed ribosome frameshifting via mechanisms that are not well understood. Using biochemical and single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments, we studied how frameshift-inducing stem-loops from &lt;i&gt;E. coli dnaX&lt;/i&gt; mRNA and the &lt;i&gt;gag-pol&lt;/i&gt; transcript of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) perturb translation elongation. We find that upon encountering the ribosome, the stem-loops strongly inhibit A-site tRNA binding and ribosome intersubunit rotation that accompanies translation elongation. Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) reveals that the HIV stem-loop docks into the A site of the ribosome. Our results suggest that mRNA stem-loops can transiently escape the ribosome helicase by binding to the A site. Thus, the stem-loops can modulate gene expression by sterically hindering tRNA binding and inhibiting translation elongation.</description>

	<description>Spike sorting is a crucial step in electrophysiological studies of neuronal activity. While many spike sorting packages are available, there is little consensus about which are most accurate under different experimental conditions. SpikeForest is an open-source and reproducible software suite that benchmarks the performance of automated spike sorting algorithms across an extensive, curated database of ground-truth electrophysiological recordings, displaying results interactively on a continuously-updating website. With contributions from eleven laboratories, our database currently comprises 650 recordings (1.3 TB total size) with around 35,000 ground-truth units. These data include paired intracellular/extracellular recordings and state-of-the-art simulated recordings. Ten of the most popular spike sorting codes are wrapped in a Python package and evaluated on a compute cluster using an automated pipeline. SpikeForest documents community progress in automated spike sorting, and guides neuroscientists to an optimal choice of sorter and parameters for a wide range of probes and brain regions.</description>

	<title>eLife: Predictable properties of fitness landscapes induced by adaptational                    tradeoffs</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55155</guid>

	<description>Fitness effects of mutations depend on environmental parameters. For example,                    mutations that increase fitness of bacteria at high antibiotic concentration                    often decrease fitness in the absence of antibiotic, exemplifying a tradeoff                    between adaptation to environmental extremes. We develop a mathematical model                    for fitness landscapes generated by such tradeoffs, based on experiments that                    determine the antibiotic dose-response curves of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia                        coli&lt;/i&gt; strains, and previous observations on antibiotic resistance                    mutations. Our model generates a succession of landscapes with predictable                    properties as antibiotic concentration is varied. The landscape is nearly smooth                    at low and high concentrations, but the tradeoff induces a high ruggedness at                    intermediate antibiotic concentrations. Despite this high ruggedness, however,                    all the fitness maxima in the landscapes are evolutionarily accessible from the                    wild type. This implies that selection for antibiotic resistance in multiple                    mutational steps is relatively facile despite the complexity of the underlying                    landscape.</description>

	<title>eLife: Opposing p53 and mTOR/AKT promote an in vivo switch from apoptosis to senescence upon telomere shortening in zebrafish</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54935</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54935</link>
	<description>Progressive telomere shortening during lifespan is associated with restriction of cell proliferation, genome instability and aging. Apoptosis and senescence are the two major outcomes upon irreversible cellular damage. Here, we show a transition of these two cell fates during aging of telomerase deficient zebrafish. In young telomerase mutants, proliferative tissues exhibit DNA damage and p53-dependent apoptosis, but no senescence. However, these tissues in older animals display loss of cellularity and senescence becomes predominant. Tissue alterations are accompanied by a pro-proliferative stimulus mediated by AKT signaling. Upon AKT activation, FoxO transcription factors are phosphorylated and translocated out of the nucleus. This results in reduced SOD2 expression causing an increase of ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction. These alterations induce p15/16 growth arrest and senescence. We propose that, upon telomere shortening, early apoptosis leads to cell depletion and insufficient compensatory proliferation. Following tissue damage, the mTOR/AKT is activated causing mitochondrial dysfunction and p15/16-dependent senescence.</description>

	<description>Electrophysiological methods, i.e., M/EEG provide unique views into brain health.                    Yet, when building predictive models from brain data, it is often unclear how                    electrophysiology should be combined with other neuroimaging methods.                    Information can be redundant, useful common representations of multimodal data                    may not be obvious and multimodal data collection can be medically                    contraindicated, which reduces applicability. Here, we propose a multimodal                    model to robustly combine MEG, MRI and fMRI for prediction. We focus on age                    prediction as a surrogate biomarker in 674 subjects from the Cam-CAN dataset.                    Strikingly, MEG, fMRI and MRI showed additive effects supporting distinct                    brain-behavior associations. Moreover, the contribution of MEG was best                    explained by cortical power spectra between 8 and 30 Hz. Finally, we demonstrate                    that the model preserves benefits of stacking when some data is missing. The                    proposed framework, hence, enables multimodal learning for a wide range of                    biomarkers from diverse types of brain signals.</description>

	<title>eLife: Heterogeneous T cell motility behaviors emerge from a coupling between speed and turning in vivo</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53933</link>
	<description>T cells in vivo migrate primarily via undirected random walks, but it remains unresolved how these random walks generate an efficient search. Here, we use light sheet microscopy of T cells in the larval zebrafish as a model system to study motility across large populations of cells over hours in their native context. We show that cells do not perform Levy flight; rather, there is substantial cell-to-cell variability in speed, which persists over timespans of a few hours. This variability is amplified by a correlation between speed and directional persistence, generating a characteristic cell behavioral manifold that is preserved under a perturbation to cell speeds, and seen in Mouse T cells and &lt;i&gt;Dictyostelium&lt;/i&gt;. Together, these effects generate a broad range of length scales over which cells explore in vivo.</description>

	<description>Open data allows researchers to explore pre-existing datasets in new ways. However, if many researchers reuse the same dataset, multiple statistical testing may increase false positives. Here we demonstrate that sequential hypothesis testing on the same dataset by multiple researchers can inflate error rates. We go on to discuss a number of correction procedures that can reduce the number of false positives, and the challenges associated with these correction procedures.</description>

	<description>During prolonged nutrient restriction, developing animals redistribute vital nutrients to favor brain growth at the expense of other organs. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, such brain sparing relies on a glia-derived growth factor to sustain proliferation of neural stem cells. However, whether other aspects of neural development are also spared under nutrient restriction is unknown. Here we show that dynamically growing somatosensory neurons in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; peripheral nervous system exhibit organ sparing at the level of arbor growth: Under nutrient stress, sensory dendrites preferentially grow as compared to neighboring non-neural tissues, resulting in dendrite overgrowth. These neurons express lower levels of the stress sensor FoxO than neighboring epidermal cells, and hence exhibit no marked induction of autophagy and a milder suppression of Tor signaling under nutrient stress. Preferential dendrite growth allows for heightened animal responses to sensory stimuli, indicative of a potential survival advantage under environmental challenges.</description>

	<title>eLife: Acetylcholine acts on songbird premotor circuitry to invigorate vocal output</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53288</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53288</link>
	<description>Acetylcholine is well-understood to enhance cortical sensory responses and perceptual sensitivity in aroused or attentive states. Yet little is known about cholinergic influences on motor cortical regions. Here we use the quantifiable nature of birdsong to investigate how acetylcholine modulates the cortical (pallial) premotor nucleus HVC and shapes vocal output. We found that dialyzing the cholinergic agonist carbachol into HVC increased the pitch, amplitude, tempo and stereotypy of song, similar to the natural invigoration of song that occurs when males direct their songs to females. These carbachol-induced effects were associated with increased neural activity in HVC and occurred independently of basal ganglia circuitry. Moreover, we discovered that the normal invigoration of female-directed song was also accompanied by increased HVC activity and was attenuated by blocking muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. These results indicate that, analogous to its influence on sensory systems, acetylcholine can act directly on cortical premotor circuitry to adaptively shape behavior.</description>

	<title>eLife: Rarity is a more reliable indicator of land-use impacts on soil invertebrate communities than other diversity metrics</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52787</link>
	<description>The effects of land use on soil invertebrates – an important ecosystem component – are poorly understood. We investigated land-use impacts on a comprehensive range of soil invertebrates across New Zealand, measured using DNA metabarcoding and six biodiversity metrics. Rarity and phylogenetic rarity – direct measures of the number of species or the portion of a phylogeny unique to a site – showed stronger, more consistent responses across taxa to land use than widely used metrics of species richness, effective species numbers, and phylogenetic diversity. Overall, phylogenetic rarity explained the highest proportion of land use-related variance. Rarity declined from natural forest to planted forest, grassland, and perennial cropland for most soil invertebrate taxa, demonstrating pervasive impacts of agricultural land use on soil invertebrate communities. Commonly used diversity metrics may underestimate the impacts of land use on soil invertebrates, whereas rarity provides clearer and more consistent evidence of these impacts.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51185</link>
	<description>Recently evolved alleles of Apolipoprotein L-1 (&lt;i&gt;APOL1&lt;/i&gt;) provide increased protection against African trypanosome parasites while also significantly increasing the risk of developing kidney disease in humans. APOL1 protects against trypanosome infections by forming ion channels within the parasite, causing lysis. While the correlation to kidney disease is robust, there is little consensus concerning the underlying disease mechanism. We show in human cells that the APOL1 renal risk variants have a population of active channels at the plasma membrane, which results in an influx of both Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. We propose a model wherein APOL1 channel activity is the upstream event causing cell death, and that the activate-state, plasma membrane-localized channel represents the ideal drug target to combat APOL1-mediated kidney disease.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51085</link>
	<description>A major challenge in cell and developmental biology is the automated identification and quantitation of cells in complex multilayered tissues. We developed CytoCensus: an easily deployed implementation of supervised machine learning that extends convenient 2D ‘point-and-click’ user training to 3D detection of cells in challenging datasets with ill-defined cell boundaries. In tests on such datasets, CytoCensus outperforms other freely available image analysis software in accuracy and speed of cell detection. We used CytoCensus to count stem cells and their progeny, and to quantify individual cell divisions from time-lapse movies of explanted &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larval brains, comparing wild-type and mutant phenotypes. We further illustrate the general utility and future potential of CytoCensus by analysing the 3D organisation of multiple cell classes in Zebrafish retinal organoids and cell distributions in mouse embryos. CytoCensus opens the possibility of straightforward and robust automated analysis of developmental phenotypes in complex tissues.</description>

	<title>eLife: Alterations in the amplitude and burst rate of beta oscillations impair reward-dependent motor learning in anxiety</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.50654</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50654</link>
	<description>Anxiety results in sub-optimal motor learning, but the precise mechanisms through which this effect occurs remain unknown. Using a motor sequence learning paradigm with separate phases for initial exploration and reward-based learning, we show that anxiety states in humans impair learning by attenuating the update of reward estimates. Further, when such estimates are perceived as unstable over time (volatility), anxiety constrains adaptive behavioral changes. Neurally, anxiety during initial exploration increased the amplitude and the rate of long bursts of sensorimotor and prefrontal beta oscillations (13–30 Hz). These changes extended to the subsequent learning phase, where phasic increases in beta power and burst rate following reward feedback were linked to smaller updates in reward estimates, with a higher anxiety-related increase explaining the attenuated belief updating. These data suggest that state anxiety alters the dynamics of beta oscillations during reward processing, thereby impairing proper updating of motor predictions when learning in unstable environments.</description>

	<description>Ménégaut et al. show that liver X receptor (LXR) agonists selectively increase IL1β mRNA levels independently of TLR activation. This effect, restricted to human macrophages, is mediated by an activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 1α through LXR. Accordingly, LXR agonists also potentiate other HIF-1α-dependent pathways, such as glycolysis.</description>

Dendrite degeneration in AWC results in decreased longevity that may be due, in part, to hyperactivation of the FOXO family transcription factor DAF-16.</description>

	<description>Sorge et al. show that reduced expression of a single, small subunit of the mitochondrial electron transport chain induces a transcriptional stress response through ATF4. This adaptation re-programs metabolism in Drosophila epithelial progenitors toward a glycolytic metabolism.

	<description>Ventral tegmental area (VTA) glutamate neurons signal and participate in reward and aversion-based behaviors. However, the neurochemical mechanisms that underlie how these neurons participate in diverse motivated behaviors is unknown. We used a combination of optical sensors to identify how distinct neurochemical inputs to VTA glutamate neurons participate in motivated behavior. Glutamate inputs to VTA glutamate neurons increased for both reward- and aversion-predicting cues and aversive outcomes, but subpopulations of glutamate inputs were increased or decreased by reward. For all cues and outcomes, GABA inputs to VTA glutamate neurons decreased and GCaMP-measured neuronal activity increased. GCaMP recordings also showed that VTA glutamate neuronal activity discriminated between the omission and receipt of an expected reward, but glutamate and GABA inputs to these neurons did not. Electro-physiological recordings in coordination with our sensor data suggest that glutamate inputs, but not GABA inputs, principally regulate VTA glutamate neuron participation in diverse motivated behaviors.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Cell type-specific effects of isoflurane on two distinct afferent inputs to cortical layer 1.</title>

	<description>While their behavioral effects are well-characterized, the mechanisms by which anesthetics induce loss of consciousness are largely unknown. Anesthetics may disrupt integration and propagation of information in corticothalamic networks. Recent studies have shown that isoflurane diminishes synaptic responses of thalamocortical (TC) and corticocortical (CC) afferents in a pathway-specific manner. However, whether the synaptic effects of isoflurane observed in extracellular recordings persist at the cellular level has yet to be explored. Here, we activate TC and CC layer 1 inputs in non-primary mouse neocortex in ex vivo brain slices and explore the degree to which isoflurane modulates synaptic responses in pyramidal cells and in two inhibitory cell populations, somatostatin-positive (SOM+) and parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons. We show that the effects of isoflurane on synaptic responses and intrinsic properties of these cells varies among cell type and by cortical layer. Layer 1 inputs to L4 pyramidal cells were suppressed by isoflurane at both TC and CC synapses, while those to L2/3 pyramidal cells and PV+ interneurons were not. TC inputs to SOM+ cells were rarely observed at all, while CC inputs to SOM+ interneurons were robustly suppressed by isoflurane. These results suggest a mechanism by which isoflurane disrupts integration and propagation of incoming cortical signals.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The role of intolerance of uncertainty in the acquisition and extinction of reward</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.18.101212v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Individuals, who score high in self-reported intolerance of uncertainty (IU), tend to find uncertainty anxiety-provoking. IU has been reliably associated with disrupted threat extinction. However, it remains unclear whether IU would be related to disrupted extinction to other arousing stimuli that are not threatening (i.e. rewarding). We addressed this question by conducting a reward associative learning task with acquisition and extinction training phases (n = 58). Throughout the associative learning task, we recorded valence ratings (i.e. liking), skin conductance response (SCR) (i.e. sweating), and corrugator supercilii activity (i.e. brow muscle indicative or negative and positive affect) to learned reward and neutral cues. During acquisition training with partial reward reinforcement, higher IU was associated with greater corrugator supercilii activity to neutral compared to reward cues. IU was not related to valence ratings or SCRs during the acquisition or extinction training phases. These preliminary results suggest that IU-related deficits during extinction may be limited to situations with threat. The findings further our conceptual understanding of IUs role in the associative learning and extinction of reward, and in relation to the processing of threat and reward more generally.</description>

	<description>Current intravital microscopy techniques visualize tauopathy with high-resolution, but have a small field-of-view and depth-of-focus. Herein, we report a transcranial detection of tauopathy over the entire cortex of P301L tauopathy mice using large-field multifocal illumination (LMI) fluorescence microscopy technique and luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes. In vitro assays revealed that fluorescent ligand h-FTAA is optimal for in vivo tau imaging, which was confirmed by observing elevated probe retention in the cortex of P301L mice compared to non-transgenic littermates. Immunohistochemical staining further verified the specificity of h-FTAA to detect tauopathy in P301L mice. The new imaging platform can be leveraged in pre-clinical mechanistic studies of tau spreading and clearance as well as longitudinal monitoring of tau targeting therapeutics.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Gut microbial metabolite p-Cresol promotes autistic-like behaviors in mice through remodeling of the microbiota</title>

	<description>BackgroundPerturbations of the microbiota-gut-brain axis have been identified in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), suggesting that the microbiota could be involved in the development or maintenance of abnormal social and stereotyped behaviors in ASD patients. Yet, the underlying mediators and mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that microbial metabolites produced by the gut microbiota contribute to behavioral deficits in ASD. We focused on p-Cresol, a microbial metabolite previously described as abnormally elevated in ASD patients.

MethodsWild-type mice were chronically treated with p-Cresol in drinking water to mimic intestinal exposure. We combined behavioral phenotyping, electrophysiology, microbiota 16S sequencing and fecal microbiota transplantations to decipher the consequences of p-Cresol exposure.

ResultsWe showed that p-Cresol selectively induced behavioral alterations reminiscent of ASD core symptoms: social behavior deficits, stereotypies and perseverative behaviors, but no changes in anxiety, locomotion or cognition. We further showed that p-Cresol decreases the activity of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key brain region for social reward processing. In addition, we reveal that p-Cresol remodels the intestinal microbiome, impacting specific bacterial taxa associated with social behavior deficits and stereotypies. We further demonstrated that social behavior deficits are transferred to control mice after transplantation of microbiota from p-Cresol-treated mice. Finally, both social interactions and VTA dopamine neurons activity were normalized in p-Cresol treated mice after transplant of microbiota from control mice.

ConclusionsOur study suggests that the microbial metabolite p-Cresol could be involved in the development of autistic behaviors through remodeling of the gut microbiota.</description>

	<description>The entopeduncular nucleus is one of the basal ganglias output nuclei, thereby controlling basal ganglia information processing. Entopeduncular nucleus neurons integrate GABAergic inputs from the striatum and the globus pallidus and glutamatergic inputs from the subthalamic nucleus. We show that endocannabinoids and dopamine interact to modulate the long-term plasticity of all the primary afferents to the entopeduncular nucleus. Our results suggest that dopamine-endocannabinoids interplay determines the balance of the direct or indirect dominance of entopeduncular nucleus output. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, despite the lack of axon collaterals, information is transferred between neighboring neurons in the entopeduncular nucleus via endocannabinoids diffusion. These results transform the prevailing view of the entopeduncular nucleus as a feedforward &quot;relay&quot; nucleus to an intricate control unit, which may play a vital role in the process of action selection.</description>

	<description>Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, with about 30% of cases being drug-resistant and requiring surgical intervention. To localize the epileptogenic zone (EZ), the pathological area that has to be surgically removed, brain regions are inspected for the presence of spikes during the interictal periods. This procedure maps irritative zones where spikes are present, but it is still challenging to determine which of the irritative zones generate seizures. To localize the source of seizures more precisely, a large-scale approach could be applied where the causal relationship is assessed between the signals recorded in a finite number of irritative zones. This method, however, does not reveal the fine-grained spatiotemporal patterns of spikes, which could provide valuable information regarding EZ location and increase the likelihood of surgery success. Here we present a framework to noninvasively investigate the fine patterns of interictal spikes present in magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data. We use a traveling wave model, previously employed in the analysis of cortical alpha oscillations, to regularize the MEG inverse problem and to determine the cortical paths of spike traveling waves. Our algorithm represents spike propagation patterns as a superposition of local waves traveling along radial paths stemming from a single origin. With the help of the positively constrained LASSO technique, we scan over wave onset moment and propagation velocity parameters to determine their combination that yields the best fit to the MEG sensor data of each spike. We first used realistically simulated MEG data to validate the algorithm's ability to successfully track the interictal activity on a millimeter-millisecond scale. Next, we examined MEG data from three patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Wave-like spike patterns with clear propagation dynamics were found in a fraction of spikes, whereas the other fraction could not be explained by the wave propagation model with a small number of propagation directions. Moreover, in agreement with the previous work, the spike waves with clear propagation dynamics exhibited spatial segregation and matched the clinical records on seizure onset zones (SOZs) available for two patients out of three.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Rod signals are routed through specific Off cone bipolar cells in primate retina</title>

	<description>Adapting between scotopic and photopic illumination involves switching the routing of retinal signals between rod and cone-dominated circuits. In the daytime, cone signals pass through parallel On and Off cone bipolar cells, that are sensitive to increments and decrements in luminance, respectively. At night, rod signals are routed into these cone-pathways via a key glycinergic interneuron, the AII amacrine cell (AII-AC). In primates, it is not known whether AII-ACs contact all Off-bipolar cell types indiscriminately, or whether their outputs are biased towards specific Off-bipolar cell types. Here, we show that the rod-driven glycinergic output of AII-ACs is strongly biased towards a subset of macaque Off-cone bipolar cells. The Off-bipolar types that receive this glycinergic input have sustained physiological properties and include the Off-midget bipolar cells, which provide excitatory input to the Off-midget ganglion cells (parvocellular pathway). The kinetics of the glycinergic events are consistent with the involvement of the 1 glycine receptor subunit. Taken together with results in mouse retina, our findings point towards a conserved motif whereby rod signals are preferentially routed into sustained Off signaling pathways.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Integrated information structure collapses with anesthetic loss of conscious arousal in Drosophila melanogaster</title>

	<description>The physical basis of consciousness remains one of the most elusive concepts in current science. One influential conjecture is that consciousness is to do with some form of causality, measurable through information. The integrated information theory of consciousness (IIT) proposes that conscious experience, filled with rich and specific content, corresponds directly to a hierarchically organised, irreducible pattern of causal interactions; i.e. an integrated informational structure among elements of a system. Here, we tested this conjecture in a simple biological system (fruit flies), estimating the information structure of the system during wakefulness and general anesthesia. We found that causal interactions among populations of neurons during wakefulness collapsed to isolated clusters of interactions during anesthesia. We used classification analysis to quantify the accuracy of discrimination between wakeful and anesthetised states, and found that informational structures inferred conscious states with greater accuracy than a scalar summary of the structure, a measure which is generally championed as the main measure of IIT. Spatially, we found that the information structures collapsed rather uniformly across the fly brain. Our results speak to the potential utility of the novel concept of an 'informational structure' as a measure for level of consciousness, above and beyond simple scalar values.</description>

Accumulating evidence indicates that the human brain copes with sensory uncertainty in accordance with Bayes’ rule. However, it is unknown how humans make predictions when the generative model of the task at hand is described by uncertain parameters. Here, we tested whether and how humans take parameter uncertainty into account in a regression task. Participants extrapolated a parabola from a limited number of noisy points, shown on a computer screen. The quadratic parameter was drawn from a bimodal prior distribution. We tested whether human observers take full advantage of the given information, including the likelihood of the quadratic parameter value given the observed points and the quadratic parameter’s prior distribution. We compared human performance with Bayesian regression, which is the (Bayes) optimal solution to this problem, and three sub-optimal models, which are simpler to compute. Our results show that, under our specific experimental conditions, humans behave in a way that is consistent with Bayesian regression. Moreover, our results support the hypothesis that humans generate responses in a manner consistent with probability matching rather than Bayesian decision theory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gszthWlCb3w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV) is one of the most economically important vector-borne banana diseases throughout the Asia-Pacific Basin and presents a significant challenge to the agricultural sector. Current models of BBTV are largely deterministic, limited by an incomplete understanding of interactions in complex natural systems, and the appropriate identification of parameters. A stochastic network-based Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model has been created which simulates the spread of BBTV across the subsections of a banana plantation, parameterising nodal recovery, neighbouring and distant infectivity across summer and winter. Findings from posterior results achieved through Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to approximate Bayesian computation suggest seasonality in all parameters, which are influenced by correlated changes in inspection accuracy, temperatures and aphid activity. This paper demonstrates how the model may be used for monitoring and forecasting of various disease management strategies to support policy-level decision making.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/msPvB3YIBRs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Found in recent research, tumor cell invasion, proliferation, or other biological processes are controlled by circular RNA. Understanding the association between circRNAs and diseases is an important way to explore the pathogenesis of complex diseases and promote disease-targeted therapy. Most methods, such as &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mer and &lt;i&gt;PSSM&lt;/i&gt;, based on the analysis of high-throughput expression data have the tendency to think functionally similar nucleic acid lack direct linear homology regardless of positional information and only quantify nonlinear sequence relationships. However, in many complex diseases, the sequence nonlinear relationship between the pathogenic nucleic acid and ordinary nucleic acid is not much different. Therefore, the analysis of positional information expression can help to predict the complex associations between circRNA and disease. To fill up this gap, we propose a new method, named iCDA-CGR, to predict the circRNA-disease associations. In particular, we introduce circRNA sequence information and quantifies the sequence nonlinear relationship of circRNA by Chaos Game Representation (CGR) technology based on the biological sequence position information for the first time in the circRNA-disease prediction model. In the cross-validation experiment, our method achieved 0.8533 AUC, which was significantly higher than other existing methods. In the validation of independent data sets including circ2Disease, circRNADisease and CRDD, the prediction accuracy of iCDA-CGR reached 95.18%, 90.64% and 95.89%. Moreover, in the case studies, 19 of the top 30 circRNA-disease associations predicted by iCDA-CGR on circRDisease dataset were confirmed by newly published literature. These results demonstrated that iCDA-CGR has outstanding robustness and stability, and can provide highly credible candidates for biological experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uwMfW5XHIO0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Large scale analyses of genotype-phenotype relationships of glycine decarboxylase mutations and neurological disease severity</title>

Monogenetic diseases provide unique opportunity for studying complex, clinical states that underlie neurological severity. Loss of glycine decarboxylase (&lt;i&gt;GLDC&lt;/i&gt;) can severely impact neurological development as seen in non-ketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH). NKH is a neuro-metabolic disorder lacking quantitative predictors of disease states. It is characterized by elevation of glycine, seizures and failure to thrive, but glycine reduction often fails to confer neurological benefit, suggesting need for alternate tools to distinguish severe from attenuated disease. A major challenge has been that there are 255 unique disease-causing missense mutations in &lt;i&gt;GLDC&lt;/i&gt;, of which 206 remain entirely uncharacterized. Here we report a Multiparametric Mutation Score (MMS) developed by combining &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions of stability, evolutionary conservation and protein interaction models and suitable to assess 251 of 255 mutations. In addition, we created a quantitative scale of clinical disease severity comprising of four major disease domains (seizure, cognitive failure, muscular and motor control and brain-malformation) to comprehensively score patient symptoms identified in 131 clinical reports published over the last 15 years. The resulting patient Clinical Outcomes Scores (COS) were used to optimize the MMS for biological and clinical relevance and yield a patient Weighted Multiparametric Mutation Score (WMMS) that separates severe from attenuated neurological disease (p = 1.2 e-5). Our study provides understanding for developing quantitative tools to predict clinical severity of neurological disease and a clinical scale that advances monitoring disease progression needed to evaluate new treatments for NKH.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WR12eOYB0U8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The precise diagnostics of complex diseases require to integrate a large amount of information from heterogeneous clinical and biomedical data, whose direct and indirect interdependences are notoriously difficult to assess. To this end, we propose an efficient computational approach to simultaneously compute and assess the significance of multivariate information between any combination of mixed-type (continuous/categorical) variables. The method is then used to uncover direct, indirect and possibly causal relationships between mixed-type data from medical records, by extending a recent machine learning method to reconstruct graphical models beyond simple categorical datasets. The method is shown to outperform existing tools on benchmark mixed-type datasets, before being applied to analyze the medical records of eldery patients with cognitive disorders from La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris. The resulting clinical network visually captures the global interdependences in these medical records and some facets of clinical diagnosis practice, without specific hypothesis nor prior knowledge on any clinically relevant information. In particular, it provides some physiological insights linking the consequence of cerebrovascular accidents to the atrophy of important brain structures associated to cognitive impairment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pHhrrFVoAqM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

For stimuli near perceptual threshold, the trial-by-trial activity of single neurons in many sensory areas is correlated with the animal’s perceptual report. This phenomenon has often been attributed to feedforward readout of the neural activity by the downstream decision-making circuits. The interpretation of choice-correlated activity is quite ambiguous, but its meaning can be better understood in the light of population-wide correlations among sensory neurons. Using a statistical nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique on single-trial ensemble recordings from the middle temporal (MT) area during perceptual-decision-making, we extracted low-dimensional latent factors that captured the population-wide fluctuations. We dissected the particular contributions of sensory-driven versus choice-correlated activity in the low-dimensional population code. We found that the latent factors strongly encoded the direction of the stimulus in single dimension with a temporal signature similar to that of single MT neurons. If the downstream circuit were optimally utilizing this information, choice-correlated signals should be aligned with this stimulus encoding dimension. Surprisingly, we found that a large component of the choice information resides in the subspace orthogonal to the stimulus representation inconsistent with the optimal readout view. This misaligned choice information allows the feedforward sensory information to coexist with the decision-making process. The time course of these signals suggest that this misaligned contribution likely is feedback from the downstream areas. We hypothesize that this non-corrupting choice-correlated feedback might be related to learning or reinforcing sensory-motor relations in the sensory population.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i2p-pPqQmFM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Discovery of genes required for body axis and limb formation by global identification of retinoic acid–regulated epigenetic marks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Marie Berenguer, Karolin F. Meyer, Jun Yin, Gregg Duester&lt;/p&gt;

Identification of target genes that mediate required functions downstream of transcription factors is hampered by the large number of genes whose expression changes when the factor is removed from a specific tissue and the numerous binding sites for the factor in the genome. Retinoic acid (RA) regulates transcription via RA receptors bound to RA response elements (RAREs) of which there are thousands in vertebrate genomes. Here, we combined chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for epigenetic marks and RNA-seq on trunk tissue from wild-type and &lt;i&gt;Aldh1a2&lt;/i&gt;-/- embryos lacking RA synthesis that exhibit body axis and forelimb defects. We identified a relatively small number of genes with altered expression when RA is missing that also have nearby RA-regulated deposition of histone H3 K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) (gene activation mark) or histone H3 K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) (gene repression mark) associated with conserved RAREs, suggesting these genes function downstream of RA. RA-regulated epigenetic marks were identified near RA target genes already known to be required for body axis and limb formation, thus validating our approach; plus, many other candidate RA target genes were found. Nuclear receptor 2f1 (&lt;i&gt;Nr2f1&lt;/i&gt;) and nuclear receptor 2f2 (&lt;i&gt;Nr2f2&lt;/i&gt;) in addition to Meis homeobox 1 (&lt;i&gt;Meis1&lt;/i&gt;) and Meis homeobox &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Meis2)&lt;/i&gt; gene family members were identified by our approach, and double knockouts of each family demonstrated previously unknown requirements for body axis and/or limb formation. A similar epigenetic approach can be used to determine the target genes for any transcriptional regulator for which a knockout is available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/IguCTmU-Yjs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Humanization of yeast genes with multiple human orthologs reveals functional divergence between paralogs</title>

Despite over a billion years of evolutionary divergence, several thousand human genes possess clearly identifiable orthologs in yeast, and many have undergone lineage-specific duplications in one or both lineages. These duplicated genes may have been free to diverge in function since their expansion, and it is unclear how or at what rate ancestral functions are retained or partitioned among co-orthologs between species and within gene families. Thus, in order to investigate how ancestral functions are retained or lost post-duplication, we systematically replaced hundreds of essential yeast genes with their human orthologs from gene families that have undergone lineage-specific duplications, including those with single duplications (1 yeast gene to 2 human genes, 1:2) or higher-order expansions (1:&amp;gt;2) in the human lineage. We observe a variable pattern of replaceability across different ortholog classes, with an obvious trend toward differential replaceability inside gene families, and rarely observe replaceability by all members of a family. We quantify the ability of various properties of the orthologs to predict replaceability, showing that in the case of 1:2 orthologs, replaceability is predicted largely by the divergence and tissue-specific expression of the human co-orthologs, i.e., the human proteins that are less diverged from their yeast counterpart and more ubiquitously expressed across human tissues more often replace their single yeast ortholog. These trends were consistent with in silico simulations demonstrating that when only one ortholog can replace its corresponding yeast equivalent, it tends to be the least diverged of the pair. Replaceability of yeast genes having more than 2 human co-orthologs was marked by retention of orthologous interactions in functional or protein networks as well as by more ancestral subcellular localization. Overall, we performed &amp;gt;400 human gene replaceability assays, revealing 50 new human–yeast complementation pairs, thus opening up avenues to further functionally characterize these human genes in a simplified organismal context.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/r8aUy1SRxQo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Adaptation to life in nutrient poor caves without predation increased exploratory foraging behaviors and decreased aversion to potential predatory cues in the cavefishes. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry revealed larger catecholaminergic neurons in regions of the cave &lt;i&gt;Astyanax &lt;/i&gt; brain that may mediate these changes in behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Astyanax mexicanus &lt;/i&gt; is a teleost fish that is in the process of allopatric speciation. Ancestral &lt;i&gt;Astyanax &lt;/i&gt; are found in surface rivers and derived blind forms are found in cave systems. Adaptation to life in nutrient poor caves without predation includes the evolution of enhanced food seeking behaviors and loss of defensive responses. These behavioral adaptations may be mediated by changes in catecholaminergic control systems in the brain. We examined the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase, a conserved precursor for the synthesis of the catecholamines dopamine and noradrenaline, in the brains of surface and cave &lt;i&gt;Astyanax &lt;/i&gt; using immunohistochemistry. We found differences in tyrosine hydroxylase staining in regions that are associated with nonvisual sensory perception, motor control, endocrine release, and attention. These differences included significant increases in the diameters of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive soma in cave &lt;i&gt;Astyanax &lt;/i&gt; in the olfactory bulb, basal telencephalon, preoptic nuclei, ventral thalamus, posterior tuberculum, and locus coeruleus. These increases in modulation by dopamine and noradrenaline likely indicate changes in behavioral control that underlie adaptations to the cave environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Behavioral Characterization of dmrt3a Mutant Zebrafish Reveals Crucial Aspects of Vertebrate Locomotion through Phenotypes Related to Acceleration</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Vertebrate locomotion is orchestrated by spinal interneurons making up a central pattern generator. Proper coordination of activity, both within and between segments, is required to generate the desired locomotor output. This coordination is altered during acceleration to ensure the correct recruitment of muscles for the chosen speed. The transcription factor &lt;i&gt;Dmrt3&lt;/i&gt; has been proposed to shape the patterned output at different gaits in horses and mice. Here, we characterized &lt;i&gt;dmrt3a&lt;/i&gt; mutant zebrafish, which showed a strong, transient, locomotor phenotype in developing larvae. During beat-and-glide swimming, mutant larvae showed fewer and shorter movements with decreased velocity and acceleration. Developmental compensation likely occurs as the analyzed behaviors did not differ from wild-type at older larval stages. However, analysis of maximum swim speed in juveniles suggests that some defects persist within the mature locomotor network of &lt;i&gt;dmrt3a&lt;/i&gt; mutants. Our results reveal the pivotal role Dmrt3 neurons play in shaping the patterned output during acceleration in vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Epileptic activity intrinsically generated in the human cerebellum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25779?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neoplastic or dysplastic neuronal tissue in the brain stem and cerebellum can become epileptogenic in pediatric patients. However, it is unknown whether such tissue may transform intrinsic properties of the human cerebellum, making it capable of generating epileptic population activity. We noninvasively detected epileptiform signals unaveraged in a pediatric patient with epilepsy due to a tumor in the middle cerebellar peduncle. Analysis of generators of the signals revealed that the cerebellum ipsi‐ and contra‐lateral to the tumor was the dominant interictal spike generator and could initiate ictal activity, suggesting that human cerebellum may become capable of intrinsically generating epileptic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mini‐review presents the view that contemporary approaches to stem the tide of opioid overdose deaths are insufficient to make a significant impact. Instead, a focus on the opioid receptor as the ultimate molecular target to directly abolish opioid overdose death is explored. After identifying the key brainstem neurons that control respiration which are inhibited by opioid drugs, genetic techniques targeting the &lt;i&gt;mu &lt;/i&gt; opioid receptor are detailed which prevent opioid overdose. This receptor‐centric solution for the opioid overdose epidemic can be realized with existing technology and, with sufficient effort, could enter clinical trials within 5 to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present here a thorough and complete analysis of mouse P0‐P140 prethalamic histogenetic subdivisions and corresponding nuclear derivatives, in the context of local tract landmarks. The study used as fundamental material brains from a transgenic mouse line that expresses &lt;i&gt;LacZ &lt;/i&gt; under the control of an intragenic enhancer of &lt;i&gt;Dlx5 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dlx6 &lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Dlx5/6‐LacZ &lt;/i&gt;). Subtle shadings of LacZ signal, jointly with pan‐DLX immunoreaction, and several other ancillary protein or RNA markers, including &lt;i&gt;Calb2 &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nkx2.2 &lt;/i&gt; ISH (for the prethalamic eminence, and derivatives of the rostral zona limitans shell domain, respectively) were mapped across the prethalamus. The resulting model of the prethalamic region postulates tetrapartite rostrocaudal and dorsoventral subdivisions, as well as a tripartite radial stratification, each cell population showing a characteristic molecular profile. Some novel nuclei are proposed, and some instances of potential tangential cell migration were noted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Altered spontaneous activity and effective connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex in obsessive–compulsive disorder&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2692e588-97b2-4132-a658-7ca74082129c/cne24948-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling neuropsychiatric disorder whose neurobiological basis remains unclear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have reported functional and structural alterations of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in OCD. In this study, we explored the functional activity of subregions of the ACC and effective connectivity (EC) between ACC subregions and the whole brain in OCD. We used a Granger causality analysis (GCA) to identify the direction of information flow and whether the impact of that flow was excitatory or inhibitory. We performed resting‐state functional MRI in 31 patients with OCD and 36 healthy controls, and analyzed the amplitude of low‐frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and coefficient‐based GCA. The left pregenual ACC (pACC) in patients with OCD showed decreased ALFF relative to controls. There was significantly decreased excitatory output from the left pACC to both right dorsal superior frontal gyrus (dSFG) and left precuneus in patients compared with controls. Patients also had decreased inhibitory input to left pACC from left ventral SFG and left thalamus and caudate relative to controls. Results were similar in drug naive patients and those with prior but not current psychopharmacological treatment. In patients, path coefficients of GCA from left pACC to right dSFG showed significant negative correlations with obsession and anxiety ratings. Decreased spontaneous neural activity and altered EC of pACC with widely distributed cortical circuitry, and associations with clinical ratings highlight the importance of pACC functional alteration in OCD.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Functional Role of Spinal Interneurons Following Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00127</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00127</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) impedes signal transmission by disrupting both the local neurons and their surrounding synaptic connections. Although the majority of SCI patients retain spared neural tissue at the injury site, they predominantly suffer from complete autonomic and sensorimotor dysfunction. While there have been significant advances in the characterization of the spared neural tissue following SCI, the functional role of injury-induced interneuronal plasticity remains elusive. In healthy individuals, spinal interneurons are responsible for relaying signals to coordinate both sympathetic and parasympathetic functions. However, the spontaneous synaptic loss following injury alters these intricate interneuronal networks in the spinal cord. Here, we propose the synaptopathy hypothesis of SCI based on recent findings regarding the maladaptive role of synaptic changes amongst the interneurons. These maladaptive consequences include circuit inactivation, neuropathic pain, spasticity, and autonomic dysreflexia. Recent preclinical advances have uncovered the therapeutic potential of spinal interneurons in activating the dormant relay circuits to restore sensorimotor function. This review will survey the diverse role of spinal interneurons in SCI pathogenesis as well as treatment strategies to target spinal interneurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Pupil diameter encodes the idiosyncratic, cognitive complexity of belief updating</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57872</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57872</link>
	<description>Pupils tend to dilate in response to surprising events, but it is not known whether these responses are primarily stimulus driven or instead reflect a more nuanced relationship between pupil-linked arousal systems and cognitive expectations. Using an auditory adaptive decision-making task, we show that evoked pupil diameter is more parsimoniously described as signaling violations of learned, top-down expectations than changes in low-level stimulus properties. We further show that both baseline and evoked pupil diameter is modulated by the degree to which individual subjects use these violations to update their subsequent expectations, as reflected in the complexity of their updating strategy. Together these results demonstrate a central role for idiosyncratic cognitive processing in how arousal systems respond to new inputs and, via our complexity-based analyses, offer a potential framework for understanding these effects in terms of both inference processes aimed to reduce belief uncertainty and more traditional notions of mental effort.</description>

	<title>eLife: Retrieval practice facilitates memory updating by enhancing and differentiating medial prefrontal cortex representations</title>

	<description>Updating old memories with new, more current information is critical for human survival, yet the neural mechanisms for memory updating in general and the effect of retrieval practice in particular are poorly understood. Using a three-day A-B/A-C memory updating paradigm, we found that compared to restudy, retrieval practice could strengthen new A-C memories and reduce old A-B memory intrusion, but did not suppress A-B memories. Neural activation pattern analysis revealed that compared to restudy, retrieval practice led to stronger target representation in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) during the final test. Critically, only under the retrieval practice condition that the MPFC showed strong and comparable competitor evidence for both correct and incorrect trials during final test, and the MPFC target representation during updating was predictive of subsequent memory. These results suggest that retrieval practice could facilitate memory updating by strongly engaging MPFC mechanisms in memory integration, differentiation and consolidation.</description>

	<title>eLife: Noradrenergic projections from the locus coeruleus to the amygdala constrain fear memory reconsolidation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57010</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57010</link>
	<description>Memory reconsolidation is a fundamental plasticity process in the brain that allows established memories to be changed or erased. However, certain boundary conditions limit the parameters under which memories can be made plastic. Strong memories do not destabilize, for instance, although why they are resilient is mostly unknown. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that specific modulatory signals shape memory formation into a state that is reconsolidation-resistant. We find that the activation of the noradrenaline-locus coeruleus system (NOR-LC) during strong fear memory encoding increases molecular mechanisms of stability at the expense of lability in the amygdala of rats. Preventing the NOR-LC from modulating strong fear encoding results in the formation of memories that can undergo reconsolidation within the amygdala and thus are vulnerable to post-reactivation interference. Thus, the memory strength boundary condition on reconsolidation is set at the time of encoding by the action of the NOR-LC.</description>

	<title>eLife: Stochastic bond dynamics facilitates alignment of malaria parasite at erythrocyte membrane upon invasion</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56500</link>
	<description>Malaria parasites invade healthy red blood cells (RBCs) during the blood stage of the disease. Even though parasites initially adhere to RBCs with a random orientation, they need to align their apex toward the membrane in order to start the invasion process. Using hydrodynamic simulations of a RBC and parasite, where both interact through discrete stochastic bonds, we show that parasite alignment is governed by the combination of RBC membrane deformability and dynamics of adhesion bonds. The stochastic nature of bond-based interactions facilitates a diffusive-like re-orientation of the parasite at the RBC membrane, while RBC deformation aids in the establishment of apex-membrane contact through partial parasite wrapping by the membrane. This bond-based model for parasite adhesion quantitatively captures alignment times measured experimentally and demonstrates that alignment times increase drastically with increasing rigidity of the RBC membrane. Our results suggest that the alignment process is mediated simply by passive parasite adhesion.</description>

	<title>eLife: Long-term implicit memory for sequential auditory patterns in humans</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56073</link>
	<description>Memory, on multiple timescales, is critical to our ability to discover the structure of our surroundings, and efficiently interact with the environment. We combined behavioural manipulation and modelling to investigate the dynamics of memory formation for rarely reoccurring acoustic patterns. In a series of experiments, participants detected the emergence of regularly repeating patterns within rapid tone-pip sequences. Unbeknownst to them, a few patterns reoccurred every ~3 minutes. All sequences consisted of the same 20 frequencies and were distinguishable only by the order of tone-pips. Despite this, reoccurring patterns were associated with a rapidly growing detection-time advantage over novel patterns. This effect was implicit, robust to interference, and persisted up to 7 weeks. The results implicate an interplay between short (a few seconds) and long-term (over many minutes) integration in memory formation and demonstrate the remarkable sensitivity of the human auditory system to sporadically reoccurring structure within the acoustic environment.</description>

	<description>Chang et al. demonstrate that, at eye opening, three distinct representations of orientation exist in the ferret visual cortex: one each for monocular stimulation and a third for binocular stimulation. Through experience-dependent processes, a unified binocularly aligned orientation representation develops, driven by concerted shifts in monocular orientation preferences.</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrathecal inflammation correlates with the grey matter damage since the early stages of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), but whether the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile can help to identify patients at risk of disease activity is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluated the association between CSF levels of 18 cytokines, previously found to be associated to grey matter damage, and the disease activity, among 99 relapsing‐remitting MS patients, who underwent blinded clinical and 3T‐MRI evaluations for 4 years. Groups with (EDA) or without (NEDA) evidence of disease activity (occurrence of relapses, new white matter lesions, EDSS change) were identified. Cortical lesions and the annualized cortical thinning were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortyone patients experienced EDA and, compared to the NEDA group, had at diagnosis higher CSF levels of CXCL13, CXCL12, IFNγ, TNF, sCD163, LIGHT and APRIL (p&amp;lt;0.001). In the multivariate analysis, CXCL13 (HR=1.35, p=0.0002), LIGHT (HR=1.22, p=0.005) and APRIL (HR=1.78, p=0.0001) were the CSF molecules more strongly associated with the risk of EDA. The model including CSF variables predicted more accurately the occurrence of disease activity than the model with only clinical/MRI parameters (C‐index at 4 years= 71% vs 44%). Finally, higher CSF levels of CXCL13 (β=4.7*10&lt;sup&gt;‐4&lt;/sup&gt;,p&amp;lt;0.001), TNF (β=3.1*10&lt;sup&gt;‐3&lt;/sup&gt;,p=0.004), LIGHT (β=2.6*10&lt;sup&gt;‐4&lt;/sup&gt;,p=0.003), sCD163 (β=4.3*10&lt;sup&gt;‐3&lt;/sup&gt;,p=0.009) and TWEAK (β=3.4*10&lt;sup&gt;‐3&lt;/sup&gt;,p=0.024) were associated with more severe cortical thinning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A specific CSF profile, mainly characterized by elevated levels of B‐cell related cytokines, distinguishes patients at high risk of disease activity and severe cortical damage. The CSF analysis may allow stratifications of patients at diagnosis for optimizing therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Permeability measures predict haemorrhagic transformation after ischemic stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25785?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25785?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sought to examine the diagnostic utility of existing predictors of any haemorrhagic transformation (HT) and compare them to novel perfusion imaging permeability measures in ischemic stroke patients receiving alteplase only.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pixel‐based analysis of pre‐treatment CT perfusion (CTP) was undertaken to define the optimum CTP permeability thresholds to predict the likelihood of HT. We then compared previously proposed predictors of HT using regression analyses and receiver operator characteristic curve analysis to produce an Area Under the Cure (AUC), and compared AUCs using Chi Square analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 5 centres, 1407 patients were included in this study, 282 had HT. The cohort was split into a derivation (1025, 70% patients) and validation cohort (382 patients or 30%). The E permeability map at a threshold of 30% relative to contralateral had the highest AUC at predicting any HT (derivation AUC 0.85, 95% CI, 0.79‐0.91, validation AUC 0.84, 95% CI, 0.77‐0.91). The AUC improved when permeability was assessed within the acute perfusion lesion for the E maps at a threshold of 30% (derivation AUC 0.91, 95% CI, 0.86‐0.95, validation AUC 0.89, 95% CI, 0.86‐0.95). Previously proposed associations with HT and PH showed lower AUC values than the permeability measure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this large multi‐centre study, we have validated a highly accurate measure of HT prediction. This measure may be useful in clinical practice to predict haemorrhagic transformation in ischemic stroke patients before receiving alteplase alone.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Steroid‐responsive encephalitis in Covid‐19 disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Covid‐19 infection has the potential for targeting the central nervous system and several neurological symptoms have been described in patients with severe respiratory distress. Here we described the case of a 60‐year old subject with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection but only mild respiratory abnormalities who developed an akinetic mutism due to encephalitis. MRI was negative whereas EEG showed generalized theta slowing. CSF analyses during the acute stage were negative for SARS‐CoV‐2, positive for pleocytosis and hyperproteinorrachia, and showed increased IL‐8 and TNF‐α concentrations while other infectious or autoimmune disorders were excluded. A progressive clinical improvement along with a reduction of CSF parameters was observed after high‐dose steroid treatment, thus arguing for an inflammatory‐mediated brain involvement related to Covid‐19.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: TRPV4 antagonism prevents mechanically‐induced myotonia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25780?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25780?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myotonia is caused by involuntary firing of skeletal muscle action potentials and causes debilitating stiffness. Current treatments are insufficiently efficacious and associated with side effects. Myotonia can be triggered by voluntary movement (electrically‐induced myotonia) or percussion (mechanically‐induced myotonia). Whether distinct molecular mechanisms underlie these triggers is unknown. Our goal was to identify ion channels involved in mechanically‐induced myotonia and to evaluate block of the channels involved as a novel approach to therapy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a novel system to enable study of mechanically‐induced myotonia using both genetic and pharmacologic mouse models of myotonia congenita. We extended &lt;i&gt;ex vivo &lt;/i&gt; studies of excitability to &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; studies of muscle stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previous work suggests activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels by mechanical stimuli in muscle, we examined the role of this cation channel. Mechanically‐induced myotonia was markedly suppressed in TRPV4‐null muscles and in muscles treated with TRPV4 small molecule antagonists. The suppression of mechanically‐induced myotonia occurred without altering intrinsic muscle excitability such that myotonia triggered by firing of action potentials (electrically‐induced myotonia) was unaffected. When injected intraperitoneally, TRPV4 antagonists lessened the severity of myotonia &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt; by approximately 80%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data demonstrate for the first time that there are distinct molecular mechanisms triggering electrically‐ and mechanically‐induced myotonia. Our data indicates that activation of TRPV4 during muscle contraction plays an important role in triggering myotonia &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;. Elimination of mechanically‐induced myotonia by TRPV4 inhibition offers a new approach to treating myotonia.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Quantitative Separation of Tremor and Ataxia in Essential Tremor</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25781?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25781?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study addresses a very important problem in Neurology, distinguishing tremor and ataxia using quantitative methods. Specifically, we aimed to quantitatively separate dysmetria, a cardinal sign of ataxia, from tremor in Essential Tremor (ET).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In experiment 1, we compared nineteen participants diagnosed with ET undergoing thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS; ET&lt;sub&gt;DBS&lt;/sub&gt;) to 19 healthy controls (HC). We quantified tremor during postural tasks using accelerometry and dysmetria with fast, reverse‐at‐target goal‐directed movements. To ensure that endpoint accuracy was unaffected by tremor, we quantified dysmetria in selected trials manifesting a smooth trajectory to the endpoint. Finally, we manipulated tremor amplitude by switching DBS ON and OFF to examine its effect on dysmetria. In experiment 2, we compared 10 ET participants (ET) with 10 HC to determine if we could identify and distinguish dysmetria from tremor in non‐DBS ET.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three findings suggest that we can quantify dysmetria independent of tremor in ET. First, ET&lt;sub&gt;DBS&lt;/sub&gt; and ET exhibited greater dysmetria than HC and dysmetria did not correlate with tremor (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). Second, even for trials with tremor‐free trajectories to the target, ET exhibited greater dysmetria than HC (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt; &lt;/i&gt;0.01). Third, activating DBS reduced tremor (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt; &lt;/i&gt;0.01) but had no effect on dysmetria (&lt;i&gt;p&amp;gt; &lt;/i&gt;0.2).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that dysmetria can be quantified independent of tremor using fast, reverse at target goal‐directed movements. These results have important implications for the understanding of ET and other cerebellar and tremor disorders. Future research should examine the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying each symptom and characterize their independent contribution to disability.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Tau, a microtubule-associated protein that modifies the dynamic properties and organization of microtubules in neurons and affects axonal transport, shows remarkable heterogeneity, with multiple isoforms (45–65 kDa) generated by alternative splicing. A high-molecular-weight (HMW) isoform (110 kDa) that contains an additional large exon termed 4a was discovered more than 25 years ago. This isoform, called Big tau, is expressed mainly in the adult peripheral nervous system (PNS), but also in adult neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) that extend processes into the periphery.</description>

	<description>The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, as pandemic. There is currently a lack of knowledge about the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question concerns antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by analyzing plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that, while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses may be rare, indicating the presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike.</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Evidence for independent peripheral and central age‐related hearing impairment&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a59feb7a-ee8b-4165-8707-529b71542457/jnr24639-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain aspects of central presbycusis such as temporal processing can largely exist independent of peripheral presbycusis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deleterious age‐related changes in the central auditory nervous system have been referred to as central age‐related hearing impairment (ARHI) or central presbycusis. Central ARHI is often assumed to be the consequence of peripheral ARHI. However, it is possible that certain aspects of central ARHI are independent from peripheral ARHI. A confirmation of this possibility could lead to significant improvements in current rehabilitation practices. The major difficulty in addressing this issue arises from confounding factors, such as other age‐related changes in both the cochlea and central non‐auditory brain structures. Because gap detection is a common measure of central auditory temporal processing, and gap detection thresholds are less influenced by changes in other brain functions such as learning and memory, we investigated the potential relationship between age‐related peripheral hearing loss (i.e., audiograms) and age‐related changes in gap detection. Consistent with previous studies, a significant difference was found for gap detection thresholds between young and older adults. However, among older adults, no significant associations were observed between gap detection ability and several other independent variables including the pure tone audiogram average, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‐Vocabulary score, gender, and age. Statistical analyses showed little or no contributions from these independent variables to gap detection thresholds. Thus, our data indicate that age‐related decline in central temporal processing is largely independent of peripheral ARHI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The Affective Ising Model: A computational account of human affect dynamics</title>

The human affect system is responsible for producing the positive and negative feelings that color and guide our lives. At the same time, when disrupted, its workings lie at the basis of the occurrence of mood disorder. Understanding the functioning and dynamics of the affect system is therefore crucial to understand the feelings that people experience on a daily basis, their dynamics across time, and how they can become dysregulated in mood disorder. In this paper, a nonlinear stochastic model for the dynamics of positive and negative affect is proposed called the Affective Ising Model (AIM). It incorporates principles of statistical mechanics, is inspired by neurophysiological and behavioral evidence about auto-excitation and mutual inhibition of the positive and negative affect dimensions, and is intended to better explain empirical phenomena such as skewness, multimodality, and non-linear relations of positive and negative affect. The AIM is applied to two large experience sampling studies on the occurrence of positive and negative affect in daily life in both normality and mood disorder. It is examined to what extent the model is able to reproduce the aforementioned non-Gaussian features observed in the data, using two sightly different continuous-time vector autoregressive (VAR) models as benchmarks. The predictive performance of the models is also compared by means of leave-one-out cross-validation. The results indicate that the AIM is better at reproducing non-Gaussian features while their performance is comparable for strictly Gaussian features. The predictive performance of the AIM is also shown to be better for the majority of the affect time series. The potential and limitations of the AIM as a computational model approximating the workings of the human affect system are discussed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9AUmWLqrtr0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Complex interactions can create persistent fluctuations in high-diversity ecosystems</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Felix Roy, Matthieu Barbier, Giulio Biroli, Guy Bunin&lt;/p&gt;

When can ecological interactions drive an entire ecosystem into a persistent non-equilibrium state, where many species populations fluctuate without going to extinction? We show that high-diversity spatially heterogeneous systems can exhibit chaotic dynamics which persist for extremely long times. We develop a theoretical framework, based on dynamical mean-field theory, to quantify the conditions under which these fluctuating states exist, and predict their properties. We uncover parallels with the persistence of externally-perturbed ecosystems, such as the role of perturbation strength, synchrony and correlation time. But uniquely to endogenous fluctuations, these properties arise from the species dynamics themselves, creating feedback loops between perturbation and response. A key result is that fluctuation amplitude and species diversity are tightly linked: in particular, fluctuations enable dramatically more species to coexist than at equilibrium in the very same system. Our findings highlight crucial differences between well-mixed and spatially-extended systems, with implications for experiments and their ability to reproduce natural dynamics. They shed light on the maintenance of biodiversity, and the strength and synchrony of fluctuations observed in natural systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SeW8ir14OPs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The human genome harbors a variety of genetic variations. Single-nucleotide changes that alter amino acids in protein-coding regions are one of the major causes of human phenotypic variation and diseases. These single-amino acid variations (SAVs) are routinely found in whole genome and exome sequencing. Evaluating the functional impact of such genomic alterations is crucial for diagnosis of genetic disorders. We developed DeepSAV, a deep-learning convolutional neural network to differentiate disease-causing and benign SAVs based on a variety of protein sequence, structural and functional properties. Our method outperforms most stand-alone programs, and the version incorporating population and gene-level information (DeepSAV+PG) has similar predictive power as some of the best available. We transformed DeepSAV scores of rare SAVs in the human population into a quantity termed “mutation severity measure” for each human protein-coding gene. It reflects a gene's tolerance to deleterious missense mutations and serves as a useful tool to study gene-disease associations. Genes implicated in cancer, autism, and viral interaction are found by this measure as intolerant to mutations, while genes associated with a number of other diseases are scored as tolerant. Among known disease-associated genes, those that are mutation-intolerant are likely to function in development and signal transduction pathways, while those that are mutation-tolerant tend to encode metabolic and mitochondrial proteins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WiZE8G7kv4s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Antibiotics can be used to contain drug-resistant bacteria by maintaining sufficiently large sensitive populations</title>

Standard infectious disease practice calls for aggressive drug treatment that rapidly eliminates the pathogen population before resistance can emerge. When resistance is absent, this elimination strategy can lead to complete cure. However, when resistance is already present, removing drug-sensitive cells as quickly as possible removes competitive barriers that may slow the growth of resistant cells. In contrast to the elimination strategy, a containment strategy aims to maintain the maximum tolerable number of pathogens, exploiting competitive suppression to achieve chronic control. Here, we combine in vitro experiments in computer-controlled bioreactors with mathematical modeling to investigate whether containment strategies can delay failure of antibiotic treatment regimens. To do so, we measured the “escape time” required for drug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; populations to eclipse a threshold density maintained by adaptive antibiotic dosing. Populations containing only resistant cells rapidly escape the threshold density, but we found that matched resistant populations that also contain the maximum possible number of sensitive cells could be contained for significantly longer. The increase in escape time occurs only when the threshold density—the acceptable bacterial burden—is sufficiently high, an effect that mathematical models attribute to increased competition. The findings provide decisive experimental confirmation that maintaining the maximum number of sensitive cells can be used to contain resistance when the size of the population is sufficiently large.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qYb_asQrd9M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Effect of Circuit Structure on Odor Representation in the Insect Olfactory System</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In neuroscience, the structure of a circuit has often been used to intuit function—an inversion of Louis Kahn’s famous dictum, &quot;Form follows function&quot; (Kristan and Katz, 2006). However, different brain networks may use different network architectures to solve the same problem. The olfactory circuits of two insects, the locust, &lt;i&gt;Schistocerca americana,&lt;/i&gt; and the fruit fly, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, serve the same function—to identify and discriminate odors. The neural circuitry that achieves this shows marked structural differences. Projection neurons (PNs) in the antennal lobe innervate Kenyon cells (KCs) of the mushroom body. In locust, each KC receives inputs from ~50% of PNs, a scheme that maximizes the difference between inputs to any two of ~50,000 KCs. In contrast, in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, this number is only 5% and appears suboptimal. Using a computational model of the olfactory system, we show that the activity of KCs is sufficiently high-dimensional that it can separate similar odors regardless of the divergence of PN–KC connections. However, when temporal patterning encodes odor attributes, dense connectivity outperforms sparse connections. Increased separability comes at the cost of reliability. The disadvantage of sparse connectivity can be mitigated by incorporating other aspects of circuit architecture seen in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Our simulations predict that &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and locust circuits lie at different ends of a continuum where the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; gives up on the ability to resolve similar odors to generalize across varying environments, while the locust separates odor representations but risks misclassifying noisy variants of the same odor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the function of broadly projecting neurons depends on comprehensive knowledge of the distribution and targets of their axon collaterals. While retrograde tracers and, more recently, retrograde viral vectors have been used to identify efferent projections, they have limited ability to reveal the full pattern of axon collaterals from complex, heterogeneous neuronal populations. Here we describe TrAC (tracing axon collaterals), an intersectional recombinase-based viral-genetic strategy that allows simultaneous visualization of axons from a genetically defined neuronal population and a projection-based subpopulation. To test this new method, we have applied TrAC to analysis of locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE)-containing neurons projecting to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and primary motor cortex (M1) in laboratory mice. TrAC allowed us to label each projection-based LC-NE subpopulation, together with all remaining LC-NE neurons, in isolation from other noradrenergic populations. This analysis revealed mPFC-projecting and M1-projecting LC-NE subpopulations differ from each other and from the LC as a whole in their patterns of axon collateralization. Thus, TrAC complements and extends existing axon tracing methods by permitting analyses that have not previously been possible with complex genetically defined neuronal populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular structures in the developing brain are thought to form via angiogenesis from preformed blood vessels in the cephalic mesenchyme. Immunohistochemical studies of developing mouse brain from E10.5–E13.5 revealed the presence of avascular blood islands of primitive erythroid cells expressing the hemangioblast markers (Flk1, Tal1/Scl1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 [PECAM1], vascular endothelial‐cadherin [VE‐cadherin] and CD34) and an endothelial marker recognized by &lt;i&gt;Griffonia simplicifolia &lt;/i&gt; isolectin B4 (IB4) in the cephalic mesenchyme. These cells formed a perineural vascular plexus from which angiogenic sprouts originated and penetrated the neuroepithelium. In addition, avascular isolated cells expressing primitive erythroid, hemangioblast and endothelial makers were visible in the neuroepithelium where they generated vasculogenic and hemogenic foci. From E10.5–E13.5, these vasculogenic foci were a source of new blood vessel formation in the developing brain. &lt;i&gt;In vitro &lt;/i&gt;, cultured E13.5 brain endothelial cells contained hemogenic endothelial cells capable of generating erythroid cells. Similar cells were present in primary cultures of dissociated cells from E10.5 embryonic head. Our results provide new evidence that the brain vasculature, like that of the yolk sac and the eye choriocapillaris and hyaloid vascular systems, develops at least in part via hemovasculogenesis, a process in which vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis occur simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A major part of the circuit that coordinates bladder voiding is found in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Here we use c‐Fos and EGR‐1 (Zif268) activity mapping of lumbosacral spinal cord to investigate cystometry‐induced micturition in awake female and male rats. In both sexes, most c‐Fos neurons were identified as excitatory by their absence of Pax2 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this approach, we have identified sex differences that were not detected by previous studies in anesthetized rats.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage and voiding of urine from the lower urinary tract (LUT) must be timed precisely to occur in appropriate behavioral contexts. A major part of the CNS circuit that coordinates this activity is found in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Immediate early gene (IEG) activity mapping has been widely used to investigate the lumbosacral LUT‐related circuit, but most reports focus on the effects of noxious stimulation in anesthetized female rats. Here we use c‐Fos and EGR‐1 (Zif268) activity mapping of lumbosacral spinal cord to investigate cystometry‐induced micturition in awake female and male rats. In females, after cystometry c‐Fos neurons in spinal cord segments L5‐S2 were concentrated in the sacral parasympathetic nucleus (SPN), dorsal horn laminae II‐IV, and dorsal commissural nucleus (SDCom). Comparisons of cystometry and control groups in male and female revealed sex differences. Activity mapping suggested dorsal horn laminae II‐IV was activated in females but showed net inhibition in males. However, inhibition in male rats was not detected by EGR‐1 activity mapping, which showed low coexpression with c‐Fos. A class of catecholamine neurons in SPN and SDCom neurons were also more strongly activated by micturition in females. In both sexes, most c‐Fos neurons were identified as excitatory by their absence of Pax2 expression. In conclusion, IEG mapping in awake male and female rats has extended our understanding of the functional molecular anatomy of the LUT‐related circuit in spinal cord. Using this approach, we have identified sex differences that were not detected by previous studies in anesthetized rats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Synchronicity of excitatory inputs drives hippocampal networks to distinct oscillatory patterns</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rodent hippocampus expresses a variety of neuronal network oscillations depending on the behavioral state of the animal. Locomotion and active exploration are accompanied by theta‐nested gamma oscillations while resting states and slow‐wave sleep are dominated by intermittent sharp wave‐ripple complexes. It is believed that gamma rhythms create a framework for efficient acquisition of information whereas sharp wave‐ripples are thought to be involved in consolidation and retrieval of memory. While not strictly mutually exclusive, one of the two patterns usually dominates in a given behavioral state. Here we explore how different input patterns induce either of the two network states, using an optogenetic stimulation approach in hippocampal brain slices of mice. We report that the pattern of the evoked oscillation depends strongly on the initial synchrony of activation of excitatory cells within CA3. Short, synchronous activation favors the emergence of sharp wave‐ripple complexes while persistent but less synchronous activity—as typical for sensory input during exploratory behavior—supports the generation of gamma oscillations. This dichotomy is reflected by different degrees of synchrony of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents within these two states. Importantly, the induction of these two fundamental network patterns does not depend on the presence of any neuromodulatory transmitter like acetylcholine, but is merely based on a different synchrony in the initial activation pattern.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study reports an analysis of 20 T1‐weighted MRI scans from tufted capuchin monkeys (5 male, 15 female). We carried out a data‐driven, whole‐brain volumetric analysis on regional gray matter anatomy using voxel‐based morphometry. This revealed that males showed statistically significant expansion of a region of the hypothalamus, while females showed significant expansion in a distributed set of regions, including the cerebellum, early visual cortex, and higher‐order visual regions spanning occipital and temporal cortex. In order to elucidate the network connectivity of these regions, we employed probabilistic tractography on diffusion tensor imaging data. This showed that the female‐enlarged regions connect with distributed association networks across the brain. Notably, this contrasts with rodent studies, where sex differences are focused in deep, ancestral limbic regions involved in the control of reproductive behavior. Additionally, in our dataset, for several regions, male and female volumetric measures were completely non‐overlapping. This contrasts with human studies, where sex differences in cortical regions have been reported, but are characterized by overlapping rather than divergent male and female values. We suggest that these results can be understood in the context of the different lifetime experiences of males and females, which may produce increased experience‐dependent cortical plasticity in capuchins compared to rodents, and in humans compared to capuchins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Downregulation of lncRNA-11496 in the Brain Contributes to Microglia Apoptosis via Regulation of Mef2c in Chronic T. gondii Infection Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Though it is well known that chronic infections of Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) can induce mental and behavioral disorders in the host, little is known about the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in this pathological process. In this study, we employed an advanced lncRNAs and mRNAs integration chip (Affymetrix HTA 2.0) to detect the expression of both lncRNAs and mRNAs in T. gondii Chinese 1 strain infected mouse brain. As a result, for the first time, the downregulation of lncRNA-11496 (NONMMUGO11496) was identified as the responsible factor for this pathological process. We showed that dysregulation of lncRNA-11496 affected proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of mouse microglia. Furthermore, we proved that Mef2c (Myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C), a member of the MEF2 subfamily, is the target gene of lncRNA-11496. In a more detailed study, we confirmed that lncRNA-11496 positively regulated the expression of Mef2c by binding to histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2). Importantly, Mef2c itself could coordinate neuronal differentiation, survival, as well as synapse formation. Thus, our current study provides the first evidence in terms of the modulatory action of lncRNAs in chronic toxoplasmosis in T. gondii infected mouse brain, providing a solid scientific basis for using lncRNA-11496 as a therapeutic target to treat T. gondii induced neurological disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Targeted Transgene Expression in Cholinergic Interneurons in the Monkey Striatum Using Canine Adenovirus Serotype 2 Vectors</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The striatum, the main input structure of the basal ganglia, is critical for action selection and adaptive motor control. To understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying these functions, an analysis of microcircuits that compose the striatum is necessary. Among these, cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) provide intrinsic striatal innervation whose dysfunction is implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease and Tourette syndrome. The ability to experimentally manipulate the activity of ChIs is critical to gain insights into their contribution to the normal function of the striatum and the emergence of behavioral abnormalities in pathological states. In this study, we generated and tested CAV-pChAT-GFP, a replication-defective canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector carrying the green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence under the control of the human choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) promoter. We first tested the potential specificity of CAV-pChAT-GFP to label striatal ChIs in a rat before performing experiments on two macaque monkeys. In the vector-injected rat and monkey striatum, we found that GFP expression preferentially colocalized with ChAT-immunoreactivity throughout the striatum, including those from local circuit interneurons. CAV-2 vectors containing transgene driven by the ChAT promoter provide a powerful tool for investigating ChI contributions to circuit function and behavior in nonhuman primates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine, alongside other neuromodulators, defines brain and neuronal states, inter alia through regulation of global and local mRNA translation. Yet, the signaling pathways underlying the effects of dopamine on mRNA translation and psychiatric disorders are not clear. In order to examine the molecular pathways downstream of dopamine receptors, we used genetic, pharmacologic, biochemical, and imaging methods, and found that activation of dopamine receptor D1 but not D2 leads to rapid dephosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt; but not eIF2α in cortical primary neuronal culture in a time-dependent manner. NMDA receptor, mTOR, and ERK pathways are upstream of the D1 receptor-dependent eEF2 dephosphorylation and essential for it. Furthermore, D1 receptor activation resulted in a major reduction in dendritic eEF2 phosphorylation levels. D1-dependent eEF2 dephosphorylation results in an increase of BDNF and synapsin2b expression which was followed by a small yet significant increase in general protein synthesis. These results reveal the role of dopamine D1 receptor in the regulation of eEF2 pathway translation in neurons and present eEF2 as a promising therapeutic target for addiction and depression as well as other psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: LRRK2 Kinase Inhibition Rescues Deficits in Lysosome Function Due to Heterozygous GBA1 Expression in Human iPSC-Derived Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A growing number of genes associated with Parkinson’s disease are implicated in the regulation of lysosome function, including LRRK2, whose missense mutations are perhaps the most common monogenic cause of this neurodegenerative disease. These mutations are collectively thought to introduce a pathologic increase in LRRK2 kinase activity, which is currently a major target for therapeutic intervention. Heterozygous carriers of many missense mutations in the GBA1 gene have dramatically increased risk of Parkinson’s disease. A critical question has recently emerged regarding the potential interplay between the proteins encoded by these two disease-linked genes. Our group has recently demonstrated that knockin mutation of a Parkinson’s-linked GBA1 variant induces severe lysosomal and cytokine abnormalities in murine astrocytes and that these deficits were normalized via inhibition of wild-type LRRK2 kinase activity in these cells. Another group independently found that LRRK2 inhibition increases glucocerebrosidase activity in wild-type human iPSC-derived neurons, as well as those whose activity is disrupted by GBA1 or LRRK2 mutation. Fundamental questions remain in terms of the lysosomal abnormalities and the effects of LRRK2 kinase inhibition in human neurons deficient in glucocerebrosidase activity. Here, we further elucidate the physiological crosstalk between LRRK2 signaling and glucocerebrosidase activity in human iPSC-derived neurons. Our studies show that the allelic loss of GBA1 manifests broad defects in lysosomal morphology and function. Furthermore, our data show an increase in both the accumulation and secretion of oligomeric α-synuclein protein in these GBA1-heterozygous-null neurons, compared to isogenic controls. Consistent with recent findings in murine astrocytes, we observed that multiple indices of lysosomal dysfunction in GBA1-deficient human neurons were normalized by LRRK2 kinase inhibition, while some defects were preserved. Our findings demonstrate a selective but functional intersection between glucocerebrosidase dysfunction and LRRK2 signaling in the cell and may have implications in the pathogenesis and treatment of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroergonomics is an emerging field that investigates the human brain about behavioral performance in natural environments and everyday settings. This study investigated the body and brain activity correlates of a typical daily activity, hot beverage preparation, and consumption in a realistic office environment where participants performed natural daily tasks. Using wearable, battery operated and wireless Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors, neural and physiological responses were measured in untethered, freely moving participants who prepared hot beverages using two different machines (a market leader and follower as determined by annual US sales). They later consumed the drinks they had prepared in three blocks. Emotional valence was estimated using frontal asymmetry in EEG alpha band power and emotional arousal was estimated from EDA tonic and phasic activity. Results from 26 participants showed that the market-leading coffee machine was more efficient to use based on self-reports, behavioral performance measures, and there were significant within-subject differences in valence between the two machine use. Moreover, the market leader user interface led to greater self-reported product preference, which was further supported by significant differences in measured arousal and valence (EDA and EEG, respectively) during coffee production and consumption. This is the first study that uses a multimodal and comprehensive assessment of coffee machine use and beverage consumption in a naturalistic work environment. Approaches described in this study can be adapted in the future to other task-specific machine usability and consumer neuroscience studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Disinhibition of Human Primary Somatosensory Cortex After Median Nerve Transection and Reinnervation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite state-of-the-art surgical and postoperative treatment, median nerve transection causes lasting impaired hand function due to limitations in the nerve’s reinnervation ability. The defective innervation and thus controllability of the affected hand can shape the brain’s control of manual behaviors. Earlier studies of changes in the processing of tactile stimuli have focused mainly on stimulation of the reinnervated hand and lack sufficient control over the brain’s use of the tactile input in perceptual terms. Here we used fMRI to measure brain activity (BOLD-signal) in 11 people with median nerve injury and healthy controls (N = 11) when performing demanding tactile tasks using the tip of either the index or little finger of either hand. For the nerve-injured group, the left median nerve had been traumatically transected in the distal forearm and surgically repaired on average 8 years before the study. The hand representation of their contralesional (right) primary somatosensory cortex (S1) showed greater activity compared to controls when the left reinnervated index finger was used, but also when the left-hand little finger and the fingers of the right hand innervated by uninjured nerves were used. We argue that the overall increase in activity reflects a general disinhibition of contralesional S1 consistent with an augmented functional reorganizational plasticity being an ongoing feature of chronic recovery from nerve injury. Also, the nerve-injured showed increased activity within three prefrontal cortical areas implicated in higher-level behavioral processing (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, left ventrolateral prefrontal and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), suggesting that processes supporting decision-making and response-selection were computationally more demanding due to the compromised tactile sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Electrophysiology and Structural Connectivity of the Posterior Hypothalamic Region: Much to Learn From a Rare Indication of Deep Brain Stimulation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cluster headache (CH) is among the most common and debilitating autonomic cephalalgias. We characterize clinical outcomes of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the posterior hypothalamic region through a novel analysis of the electrophysiological topography and tractography-based structural connectivity. The left posterior hypothalamus was targeted ipsilateral to the refractory CH symptoms. Intraoperatively, field potentials were captured in 1 mm depth increments. Whole-brain probabilistic tractography was conducted to assess the structural connectivity of the estimated volume of activated tissue (VAT) associated with therapeutic response. Stimulation of the posterior hypothalamic region led to the resolution of CH symptoms, and this benefit has persisted for 1.5-years post-surgically. Active contacts were within the posterior hypothalamus and dorsoposterior border of the ventral anterior thalamus (VAp). Delta- (3 Hz) and alpha-band (8 Hz) powers increased and peaked with proximity to the posterior hypothalamus. In the posterior hypothalamus, the delta-band phase was coupled to beta-band amplitude, the latter of which has been shown to increase during CH attacks. Finally, we identified that the VAT encompassing these regions had a high proportion of streamlines of pain processing regions, including the insula, anterior cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal lobe, precentral gyrus, and the brainstem. Our unique case study of posterior hypothalamic region DBS supports durable efficacy and provides a platform using electrophysiological topography and structural connectivity, to improve mechanistic understanding of CH and this promising therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Peripheral Electrical Stimulation Paired With Movement-Related Cortical Potentials Improves Isometric Muscle Strength and Voluntary Activation Following Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00156</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Endogenous paired associative stimulation (ePAS) is a neuromodulatory intervention that has potential to aid stroke recovery. ePAS involves pairing endogenous electroencephalography (EEG) signals known as movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs), with peripheral electrical stimulation. Previous studies have used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to demonstrate changes in corticomotor excitability following ePAS. However, the use of TMS as a measure in stroke research is limited by safety precautions, intolerance, and difficulty generating a measurable response in more severely affected individuals. We were interested in evaluating the effect of ePAS using more feasible measures in people with stroke. This study asks whether ePAS produces immediate improvements in the primary outcomes of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and total neuromuscular fatigue of the dorsiflexor muscles, and in the secondary outcomes of muscle power, voluntary activation (VA), central fatigue, peripheral fatigue, and electromyography activity.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;In this repeated-measures cross-over study, 15 participants with chronic stroke completed two interventions, ePAS and sham, in a randomized order. During ePAS, 50 repetitions of visually cued dorsiflexion were completed, while single pulses of electrical stimulation were delivered to the deep branch of the common peroneal nerve. Each somatosensory volley was timed to arrive in the primary motor cortex at the peak negativity of the MRCP. Univariate and multivariate linear mixed models were used to analyze the primary and secondary data, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There was a statistically significant increase in dorsiflexor MVIC immediately following the ePAS intervention (mean increase 7 N), compared to the sham intervention (mean change 0 N) (univariate between-condition analysis p = 0.047). The multivariate analysis revealed a statistically significant effect of ePAS on VA of the tibialis anterior muscle, such that ePAS increased VA by 7 percentage units (95% confidence interval 1.3–12.7%). There was no statistically significant effect on total neuromuscular fatigue, muscle power, or other secondary measures.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;A single session of ePAS can significantly increase isometric muscle strength and VA in people with chronic stroke. The findings confirm that ePAS has a central neuromodulatory mechanism and support further exploration of its potential as an adjunct to stroke rehabilitation. In addition, the findings offer alternative, feasible outcome measures for future research.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical trial registration&lt;p&gt;Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12617000838314 (www.anzctr.org.au), Universal Trial Number U111111953714.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Optimizing Magnetoencephalographic Imaging Estimation of Language Lateralization for Simpler Language Tasks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00105</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEGI) offers a non-invasive alternative for defining preoperative language lateralization in neurosurgery patients. MEGI indeed can be used for accurate estimation of language lateralization with a complex language task – auditory verb generation. However, since language function may vary considerably in patients with focal lesions, it is important to optimize MEGI for estimation of language function with other simpler language tasks. The goal of this study was to optimize MEGI laterality analyses for two such simpler language tasks that can have compliance from those with impaired language function: a non-word repetition (NWR) task and a picture naming (PN) task. Language lateralization results for these two tasks were compared to the verb-generation (VG) task. MEGI reconstruction parameters (regions and time windows) for NWR and PN were first defined in a presurgical training cohort by benchmarking these against laterality indices for VG. Optimized time windows and regions of interest (ROIs) for NWR and PN were determined by examining oscillations in the beta band (12–30 Hz) a marker of neural activity known to be concordant with the VG laterality index (LI). For NWR, additional ROIs include areas MTG/ITG and for both NWR and PN, the postcentral gyrus was included in analyses. Optimal time windows for NWR were defined as 650–850 ms (stimulus-locked) and −350 to −150 ms (response-locked) and for PN −450 to −250 ms (response-locked). To verify the optimal parameters defined in our training cohort for NWR and PN, we examined an independent validation cohort (n = 30 for NWR, n = 28 for PN) and found high concordance between VG laterality and PN laterality (82%) and between VG laterality and NWR laterality (87%). Finally, in a test cohort (n = 8) that underwent both the intracarotid amobarbital procedure (IAP) test and MEG for VG, NWR, and PN, we identified excellent concordance (100%) with IAP for VG + NWR + PN composite LI, high concordance for PN alone (87.5%), and moderate concordance for NWR alone (66.7%). These findings provide task options for non-invasive language mapping with MEGI that can be calibrated for language abilities of individual patients. Results also demonstrate that more accurate estimates can be obtained by combining laterality estimates obtained from multiple tasks. MEGI&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Optimality Principles in Human Point-to-Manifold Reaching Accounting for Muscle Dynamics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human arm movements are highly stereotypical under a large variety of experimental conditions. This is striking due to the high redundancy of the human musculoskeletal system, which in principle allows many possible trajectories toward a goal. Many researchers hypothesize that through evolution, learning, and adaption, the human system has developed optimal control strategies to select between these possibilities. Various optimality principles were proposed in the literature that reproduce human-like trajectories in certain conditions. However, these studies often focus on a single cost function and use simple torque-driven models of motion generation, which are not consistent with human muscle-actuated motion. The underlying structure of our human system, with the use of muscle dynamics in interaction with the control principles, might have a significant influence on what optimality principles best model human motion. To investigate this hypothesis, we consider a point-to-manifold reaching task that leaves the target underdetermined. Given hypothesized motion objectives, the control input is generated using Bayesian optimization, which is a machine learning based method that trades-off exploitation and exploration. Using numerical simulations with Hill-type muscles, we show that a combination of optimality principles best predicts human point-to-manifold reaching when accounting for the muscle dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Stochastic Resonance Based Visual Perception Using Spiking Neural Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our aim is to propose an efficient algorithm for enhancing the contrast of dark images based on the principle of stochastic resonance in a global feedback spiking network of integrate-and-fire neurons. By linear approximation and direct simulation, we disclose the dependence of the peak signal-to-noise ratio on the spiking threshold and the feedback coupling strength. Based on this theoretical analysis, we then develop a dynamical system algorithm for enhancing dark images. In the new algorithm, an explicit formula is given on how to choose a suitable spiking threshold for the images to be enhanced, and a more effective quantifying index, the variance of image, is used to replace the commonly used measure. Numerical tests verify the efficiency of the new algorithm. The investigation provides a good example for the application of stochastic resonance, and it might be useful for explaining the biophysical mechanism behind visual perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: EZcalcium: Open-Source Toolbox for Analysis of Calcium Imaging Data</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fluorescence calcium imaging using a range of microscopy approaches, such as two-photon excitation or head-mounted “miniscopes,” is one of the preferred methods to record neuronal activity and glial signals in various experimental settings, including acute brain slices, brain organoids, and behaving animals. Because changes in the fluorescence intensity of genetically encoded or chemical calcium indicators correlate with action potential firing in neurons, data analysis is based on inferring such spiking from changes in pixel intensity values across time within different regions of interest. However, the algorithms necessary to extract biologically relevant information from these fluorescent signals are complex and require significant expertise in programming to develop robust analysis pipelines. For decades, the only way to perform these analyses was for individual laboratories to write their custom code. These routines were typically not well annotated and lacked intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which made it difficult for scientists in other laboratories to adopt them. Although the panorama is changing with recent tools like CaImAn, Suite2P, and others, there is still a barrier for many laboratories to adopt these packages, especially for potential users without sophisticated programming skills. As two-photon microscopes are becoming increasingly affordable, the bottleneck is no longer the hardware, but the software used to analyze the calcium data optimally and consistently across different groups. We addressed this unmet need by incorporating recent software solutions, namely NoRMCorre and CaImAn, for motion correction, segmentation, signal extraction, and deconvolution of calcium imaging data into an open-source, easy to use, GUI-based, intuitive and automated data analysis software package, which we named EZcalcium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: A Probabilistic Framework for Decoding Behavior From in vivo Calcium Imaging Data</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the role of neuronal activity in cognition and behavior is a key question in neuroscience. Previously, in vivo studies have typically inferred behavior from electrophysiological data using probabilistic approaches including Bayesian decoding. While providing useful information on the role of neuronal subcircuits, electrophysiological approaches are often limited in the maximum number of recorded neurons as well as their ability to reliably identify neurons over time. This can be particularly problematic when trying to decode behaviors that rely on large neuronal assemblies or rely on temporal mechanisms, such as a learning task over the course of several days. Calcium imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicators has overcome these two issues. Unfortunately, because calcium transients only indirectly reflect spiking activity and calcium imaging is often performed at lower sampling frequencies, this approach suffers from uncertainty in exact spike timing and thus activity frequency, making rate-based decoding approaches used in electrophysiological recordings difficult to apply to calcium imaging data. Here we describe a probabilistic framework that can be used to robustly infer behavior from calcium imaging recordings and relies on a simplified implementation of a naive Baysian classifier. Our method discriminates between periods of activity and periods of inactivity to compute probability density functions (likelihood and posterior), significance and confidence interval, as well as mutual information. We next devise a simple method to decode behavior using these probability density functions and propose metrics to quantify decoding accuracy. Finally, we show that neuronal activity can be predicted from behavior, and that the accuracy of such reconstructions can guide the understanding of relationships that may exist between behavioral states and neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Electroacupuncture Inhibits Neuronal Autophagy and Apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT Pathway Following Ischemic Stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electroacupuncture (EA) is a safe and effective therapy for ischemic stroke in both clinical and laboratory settings. However, the underlying mechanism behind EA treatment for stroke remains unclear. Here, we aimed to evaluate whether EA treatment at the acupoints of Zusanli (ST36) and Quchi (LI11) exerted a neuroprotective effect on ischemic stroke rats by modulating autophagy and apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. EA was performed at 24 h following brain ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) for 30 min per day for 3 days. Our results indicated that EA treatment significantly decreased neurological deficits and cerebral infarct volume in ischemic stroke rats. Also, EA intervention markedly reduced neuronal apoptosis by suppressing the activation of cleaved caspase-3 (CCAS3) at 72 h following I/R, as shown by a Western blot analysis. Furthermore, EA treatment after ischemic stroke suppressed the ischemia activated expression level of LC3II/I and Atg7 and increased the ischemia inhibited expression level of PI3K, phosphorylation of mTOR, phosphorylation of AKT, P62 and LAMP1, hence mediating the autophagy level of the neurocyte, which was reversed by the PI3K inhibitor Dactolisib. In summary, our results indicate that the protective effects of EA treatment at points of Quchi (LI11) and Zusanli (ST36) in rats following cerebral I/R injury was associated with the inhibition of neuronal apoptosis and autophagy via activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human brain organoids cultured from human pluripotent stem cells provide a promising platform to recapitulate histological features of the human brain and model neural disorders. However, unlike animal models, brain organoids lack a reproducible topographic organization, which limits their application in modeling intricate biology, such as the interaction between different brain regions. To overcome these drawbacks, brain organoids have been pre-patterned into specific brain regions and fused to form an assembloid that represents reproducible models recapitulating more complex biological processes of human brain development and neurological diseases. This approach has been applied to model interneuron migration, neuronal projections, tumor invasion, oligodendrogenesis, forebrain axis establishment, and brain vascularization. In this review article, we will summarize the usage of this technology to understand the fundamental biology underpinning human brain development and disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Trauma or neurodegenerative diseases trigger the retrograde death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), causing an irreversible functional loss. AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A), a subunit of the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex, has been shown to play crucial roles in cell homeostasis and tissue regeneration. However, its function in adult RGC regeneration remains elusive. Here, we show that optic nerve injury induces dynamic changes of Arid1a expression. Importantly, deleting Arid1a in mice dramatically promotes RGC survival, but insignificantly impacts axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. Next, joint profiling of transcripts and accessible chromatin in mature RGCs reveals that Arid1a regulates several genes involved in apoptosis and JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Thus, our findings suggest modulation of Arid1a as a potential therapeutic strategy to promote RGC neuroprotection after damage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cell-Specific Transcriptional Responses to Heat Shock in the Mouse Utricle Epithelium</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory epithelia of the inner ear contain mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) and glia-like supporting cells (SCs), both of which are required for hearing and balance functions. Each of these cell types has unique responses to ototoxic and cytoprotective stimuli. Non-lethal heat stress in the mammalian utricle induces heat shock proteins (HSPs) and protects against ototoxic drug-induced hair cell death. Induction of HSPs in the utricle demonstrates cell-type specificity at the protein level, with HSP70 induction occurring primarily in SCs, while HSP32 (also known as heme oxygenase 1, HMOX1) is induced primarily in resident macrophages. Neither of these HSPs are robustly induced in HCs, suggesting that HCs may have little capacity for induction of stress-induced protective responses. To determine the transcriptional responses to heat shock of these different cell types, we performed cell-type-specific transcriptional profiling using the RiboTag method, which allows for immunoprecipitation (IP) of actively translating mRNAs from specific cell types. RNA-Seq differential gene expression analyses demonstrated that the RiboTag method identified known cell type-specific markers as well as new markers for HCs and SCs. Gene expression differences suggest that HCs and SCs exhibit differential transcriptional heat shock responses. The chaperonin family member Cct8 was significantly enriched only in heat-shocked HCs, while Hspa1l (HSP70 family), and Hspb1 and Cryab (HSP27 and HSP20 families, respectively) were enriched only in SCs. Together our data indicate that HCs exhibit a limited but unique heat shock response, and SCs exhibit a broader and more robust transcriptional response to protective heat stress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Neuroimmunomodulatory and Neuroprotective Effects of the Flavonoid Apigenin in in vitro Models of Neuroinflammation Associated With Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00119</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative disorders (ND) are characterized by the progressive and irreversible loss of neurons. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most incident age-related ND, in which the presence of a chronic inflammatory compound seems to be related to its pathogenesis. Different stimuli in the central nervous system (CNS) can induce activation, proliferation, and changes in phenotype and glial function, which can be modulated by anti-inflammatory agents. Apigenin (4,5,7–trihydroxyflavone) is a flavonoid found in abundance in many fruits and vegetables, that has shown important effects upon controlling the inflammatory response. This study evaluated the neuroprotective and neuroimmunomodulatory potential of apigenin using in vitro models of neuroinflammation associated with AD. Co-cultures of neurons and glial cells were obtained from the cortex of newborn and embryonic Wistar rats. After 26 days in vitro, cultures were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 μg/ml), or IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 24 h, or to Aβ oligomers (500 nM) for 4 h, and then treated with apigenin (1 μM) for further 24 h. It was observed that the treatment with apigenin preserved neurons and astrocytes integrity, determined by Rosenfeld’s staining and immunocytochemistry for β-tubulin III and GFAP, respectively. Moreover, it was observed by Fluoro-Jade-B and caspase-3 immunostaining that apigenin was not neurotoxic and has a neuroprotective effect against inflammatory damage. Additionally, apigenin reduced microglial activation, characterized by inhibition of proliferation (BrdU+ cells) and modulation of microglia morphology (Iba-1 + cells), and decreased the expression of the M1 inflammatory marker CD68. Moreover, as determined by RT-qPCR, inflammatory stimuli induced by IL-1β increased the mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-1β, and CCL5, and decreased the mRNA expression of IL-10. Contrary, after treatment with apigenin in inflammatory stimuli (IL-1β or LPS) there was a modulation of the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, and reduced expression of OX42, IL-6 and gp130. Moreover, apigenin alone and after an inflammatory stimulus with IL-1β also induced the increase in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an effect that may be associated with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Together these data demonstrate that apigenin presents neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and might represent an important neuroimmunomodulatory agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Neural tube defects (NTDs) represent a failure of the neural plate to complete the developmental transition to a neural tube. NTDs are the most common birth anomaly of the CNS. Following mandatory folic acid fortification of dietary grains, a dramatic reduction in the incidence of NTDs was observed in areas where the policy was implemented, yet the genetic drivers of NTDs in humans, and the mechanisms by which folic acid prevents disease, remain disputed. Here, we discuss current understanding of human NTD genetics, recent advances regarding potential mechanisms by which folic acid might modify risk through effects on the epigenome and transcriptome, and new approaches to study refined phenotypes for a greater appreciation of the developmental and genetic causes of NTDs.</description>

	<description>The glymphatic concept along with the discovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels have, in recent years, highlighted that fluid is directionally transported within the central nervous system (CNS). Imaging studies, as well as manipulations of fluid transport, point to a key role of the glymphatic–lymphatic system in clearance of amyloid-β and other proteins. As such, the glymphatic–lymphatic system represents a new target in combating neurodegenerative diseases. Not unexpectedly, introduction of a new plumbing system in the brain has stirred controversies.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Shape-preserving elastic solid models of macromolecules</title>

Mass-spring models have been a standard approach in molecular modeling for the last few decades, such as elastic network models (ENMs) that are widely used for normal mode analysis. In this work, we present a vastly different elastic solid model (ESM) of macromolecules that shares the same simplicity and efficiency as ENMs in producing the equilibrium dynamics and moreover, offers some significant new features that may greatly benefit the research community. ESM is different from ENM in that it treats macromolecules as elastic solids. Our particular version of ESM presented in this work, named &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;ESM, captures the shape of a given biomolecule most economically using &lt;i&gt;alpha shape&lt;/i&gt;, a well-established technique from the computational geometry community. Consequently, it can produce most economical coarse-grained models while faithfully preserving the shape and thus makes normal mode computations and visualization of extremely large complexes more manageable. Secondly, as a solid model, ESM’s close link to finite element analysis renders it ideally suited for studying mechanical responses of macromolecules under external force. Lastly, we show that ESM can be applied also to structures without atomic coordinates such as those from cryo-electron microscopy. The complete MATLAB code of &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;ESM is provided.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qWtezuvCimM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Bridging Therapy or IV Thrombolysis in Minor Stroke with Large Vessel Occlusion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25756?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25756?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether bridging therapy (intravenous thrombolysis [IVT] followed by endovascular treatment) is superior to IVT alone in minor stroke with large vessel occlusion (LVO) is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multicentric retrospective observational study including, in intention‐to‐treat, consecutive IVT‐treated minor strokes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≤ 5) with LVO, with or without additional mechanical thrombectomy. Propensity‐score (inverse probability of treatment weighting) was used to reduce baseline between‐groups differences. The primary outcome was excellent outcome, that is, modified Rankin score 0 to 1 at 3 months follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 598 patients were included (214 and 384 in the bridging therapy and IVT groups, respectively). Following propensity‐score weighting, the distribution of baseline clinical and radiological variables was similar across the two patient groups. Compared with IVT alone, bridging therapy was not associated with excellent outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.75–1.24; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.76), but was associated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR = 3.01; 95% CI = 1.77–5.11; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Occlusion site was a strong modifier of the effect of bridging therapy on outcome (&lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;interaction&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), with bridging therapy associated with higher odds of excellent outcome in proximal M1 (OR = 3.26; 95% CI = 1.67–6.35; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.0006) and distal M1 (OR = 1.69; 95% CI = 1.01–2.82; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.04) occlusions, but with lower odds of excellent outcome for M2 (OR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.38–0.75; &lt;i&gt;p = &lt;/i&gt; 0.0003) occlusions. Bridging therapy was associated with higher rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in M2 occlusions only (OR = 4.40; 95% CI = 2.20–8.83; &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although overall outcomes were similar in intended bridging therapy as compared to intended IVT alone in minor strokes with LVO, our results suggest that intended bridging therapy may be beneficial in M1 occlusions, whereas the benefit–risk profile may favor IVT alone in M2 occlusions.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Real‐World Effectiveness of Initial Disease‐Modifying Therapies in Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25737?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25737?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess real‐world effectiveness of initial treatment with newer compared to injectable disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) on disease activity in pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a cohort study of children with MS/CIS followed at 12 clinics in the US Network of Pediatric MS Centers, who received initial therapy with newer (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, natalizumab, rituximab, ocrelizumab) or injectable (interferon‐β, glatiramer acetate) DMTs. Propensity scores (PSs) were computed, including preidentified confounders. Relapse rate while on initial DMT was modeled with negative binomial regression, adjusted for PS‐quintile. Time to new/enlarging T2‐hyperintense and gadolinium‐enhancing lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging were modeled with midpoint survival analyses, adjusted for PS‐quintile.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 741 children began therapy before 18 years, 197 with newer and 544 with injectable DMTs. Those started on newer DMTs were older (15.2 vs injectable 14.4 years, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) and less likely to have a monofocal presentation. In PS‐quintile–adjusted analysis, those on newer DMTs had a lower relapse rate than those on injectables (rate ratio = 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.29–0.70, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; rate difference = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.14–0.40, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; = 0.004). One would need to treat with newer rather than injectable DMTs for 3.7 person‐years to prevent 1 relapse. Those started on newer DMTs had a lower rate of new/enlarging T2 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.36–0.72, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and gadolinium‐enhancing lesions (HR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.23–0.63, &lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) than those on injectables.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial treatment of pediatric MS/CIS with newer DMTs led to better disease activity control compared to injectables, supporting greater effectiveness of newer therapies. Long‐term safety data for newer DMTs are required. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Categorical face perception in fish: How a fish brain warps reality to dissociate “same” from “different”</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Categorical face perception in fish: How a fish brain warps reality to dissociate “same” from “different”&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fd67fe52-70f4-47e7-b6a9-c68e7d8f49a9/cne24947-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categorical perception (CP) is the phenomenon by which a smoothly varying stimulus property undergoes a non‐linear transformation during processing in the brain. Consequently, the stimuli are perceived as belonging to distinct categories separated by a sharp boundary. Originally thought to be largely innate, the discovery of CP in tasks such as novel image discrimination has piqued the interest of cognitive scientists because it provides compelling evidence that learning can shape a category’s perceptual boundaries. CP has been particularly closely studied in human face perception. In non‐primates, there is evidence for CP for sound and colour discrimination, but not for image or face discrimination. Here, we investigate the potential for learned CP in a lower vertebrate, the damselfish &lt;i&gt;Pomacentrus amboinensis. &lt;/i&gt; Specifically, we tested whether the ability of these fish to discriminate complex facial patterns tracked categorical rather than metric differences in the stimuli. We first trained the fish to discriminate sets of two facial patterns. Next, we morphed between these patterns and determined the just noticeable difference (JND) between a morph and original image. Finally, we tested for CP by analyzing the discrimination ability of the fish for pairs of JND stimuli along the spectrum of morphs between two original images. Discrimination performance was significant for the image pair straddling the boundary between categories, and chance for equivalent stimulus pairs on either side, thus producing the classic “category boundary” effect. Our results reveal how perception can be influenced in a top‐down manner even in the absence of a visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole brain neuroanatomy using tera‐voxel light‐microscopic data sets is of much current interest. A fundamental problem in this field is the mapping of individual brain datasets to a reference space. Previous work has not rigorously quantified in‐vivo to ex‐vivo distortions in brain geometry from tissue processing. Further, existing approaches focus on registering uni‐modal volumetric data; however, given the increasing interest in the marmoset model for neuroscience research and the importance of addressing individual brain architecture variations, new algorithms are necessary to cross‐register multimodal datasets including MRIs and multiple histological series. Here we present a computational approach for same‐subject multimodal MRI‐guided reconstruction of a series of consecutive histological sections, jointly with diffeomorphic mapping to a reference atlas. We quantify the scale change during different stages of brain histological processing using the Jacobian determinant of the diffeomorphic transformations involved. By mapping the final image stacks to the ex‐vivo post‐fixation MRI, we show that a) tape‐transfer assisted histological sections can be re‐assembled accurately into 3D volumes with a local scale change of 2.0 ± 0.4&lt;i&gt;% &lt;/i&gt; per axis dimension; in contrast, b) tissue perfusion/fixation as assessed by mapping the in‐vivo MRIs to the ex‐vivo post fixation MRIs shows a larger median absolute scale change of 6.9 ± 2.1&lt;i&gt;% &lt;/i&gt; per axis dimension. This is the first systematic quantification of local metric distortions associated with whole‐brain histological processing, and we expect that the results will generalize to other species. These local scale changes will be important for computing local properties to create reference brain maps.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic neuroinflammation has long been hypothesized to be involved in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) progression. Previous research suggests that both anti-inflammatory and inflammatory microglia ameliorate amyloid pathology, but the latter worsen tau pathology. In this study, we sought to determine whether induction of arginase-1 positive microglia with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 modulates pathology in the 3xTg mouse model of AD. Our findings indicate that a single intracranial IL-4 injection positively modulated performance of 3xTg AD mice in a Novel Object Recognition task, and locally increased the levels of arginase-1 positive myeloid cells when assessed one-week post injection. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis revealed decreased tau phosphorylation in IL-4 injected animals; however, we were not able to detect significant changes in tau phosphorylation utilizing Western blot. Lastly, IL-4 injection did not appear to cause significant changes in amyloid β load. In conclusion, acute intracranial IL-4 led to some positive benefits in the 3xTg mouse model of AD. Although more work remains, these results support therapeutic strategies aimed at modifying microglial activation states in neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Individualized Template MRI Is a Valid and Reliable Alternative to Individual MRI for Spatial Tracking in Navigated TMS Studies in Healthy Subjects</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00174</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00174</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) provides significant benefits over classic TMS. Yet, the acquisition of individual structural magnetic resonance images (MRI&lt;sub&gt;individual&lt;/sub&gt;) is a time-consuming, expensive, and not feasible prerequisite in all subjects for spatial tracking and anatomical guidance in nTMS studies. We hypothesize that spatial transformation can be used to adjust MRI templates to individual head shapes (MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped&lt;/sub&gt;) and that TMS parameters do not differ between nTMS using MRI&lt;sub&gt;individual&lt;/sub&gt; or MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: Twenty identical TMS sessions, each including four different navigation conditions, were conducted in 10 healthy subjects (one female, 27.4 ± 3.8 years), i.e., twice per subject by two researchers to additionally assess interrater reliabilities. MRI&lt;sub&gt;individual&lt;/sub&gt; were acquired for all subjects. MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped&lt;/sub&gt; were obtained through the spatial transformation of a template MRI following a 5-, 9-and 36-point head surface registration (MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped_5&lt;/sub&gt;, MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped_9&lt;/sub&gt;, MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped_36&lt;/sub&gt;). Stimulation hotspot locations, resting motor threshold (RMT), 500 μV motor threshold (500 μV-MT), and mean absolute motor evoked potential difference (MAD) of primary motor cortex (M1) examinations were compared between nTMS using either MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped&lt;/sub&gt; variants or MRI&lt;sub&gt;individual&lt;/sub&gt; and non-navigated TMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: M1 hotspots were spatially consistent between MRI&lt;sub&gt;individual&lt;/sub&gt; and MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped_36&lt;/sub&gt; (insignificant deviation by 4.79 ± 2.62 mm). MEP thresholds and variance were also equivalent between MRI&lt;sub&gt;individual&lt;/sub&gt; and MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped_36&lt;/sub&gt; with mean differences of RMT by −0.05 ± 2.28% maximum stimulator output (%MSO; t&lt;sub&gt;(19)&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.09, p = 0.923), 500 μV-MT by −0.15 ± 1.63%MSO (t&lt;sub&gt;(19)&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.41, p = 0.686) and MAD by 70.5 ± 214.38 μV (t&lt;sub&gt;(19)&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.47, p = 0.158). Intraclass correlations (ICC) of motor thresholds were between 0.88 and 0.97.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: NTMS examinations of M1 yield equivalent topographical and functional results using MRI&lt;sub&gt;individual&lt;/sub&gt; and MRI&lt;sub&gt;warped&lt;/sub&gt; if a sufficient number of registration points are used.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effect of Perceived Effort on Reward Valuation: Taking the Reward Positivity (RewP) to Dissonance Theory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00157</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00157</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The present research was designed to test whether the subjective experience of more effort related to more reward valuation as measured by a neural response. This prediction was derived from the theory of cognitive dissonance and its effort justification paradigm. Young adult participants (n = 82) engaged in multiple trails of a low or high effort task that resulted in a loss or reward on each trial. Neural responses to the reward (loss) cue were measured using EEG so that the event-related potential known as the Reward Positivity (RewP) could be assessed. Results revealed no significant differences between low and high effort conditions on the RewP. However, within the high effort condition, a more subjective experience of effort was associated with a larger RewP. This research extends past research on the effort justification paradigm of cognitive dissonance theory by suggesting that effort justification is associated with an implicit measure of reward valuation. It, therefore, challenges recent perspectives on dissonance processes that posit that these evaluative changes should only occur on explicit but not implicit measures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction/Purpose: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, and in the United States alone, CVD causes nearly 840,000 deaths annually. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a tool to assess brain activity, researchers have identified some brain-behavior connections and predicted several self-management behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine the sample characteristics of individuals with CVD who participated in fMRI studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus. No date or language restrictions were applied and research methodology filters were used. In October 2017, 1659 titles and abstracts were identified. Inclusion criteria were: (1) utilized an empirical study design, (2) used fMRI to assess brain activity, and (3) focused on patients with CVD-related chronic illness. Articles were excluded if they: were theory or opinion articles, focused on mental or neuropathic illness, included non-human samples, or were not written in English. After duplicates were removed (230), 1,429 titles and abstracts were reviewed based on inclusion criteria; 1,243 abstracts were then excluded. A total of 186 studies were reviewed in their entirety; after additional review, 142 were further excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. Forty-four articles met criteria and were included in the final review. An evidence table was created to capture the demographics of each study sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Ninety eight percent of the studies did not report the racial or ethnic composition of their sample. Most studies (66%) contained more men than women. Mean age ranged from 38 to 78 years; 77% reported mean age ≥50 years. The most frequently studied CVD was stroke (86%), while hypertension was studied the least (2%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Understanding brain-behavior relationships can help researchers and practitioners tailor interventions to meet specific patient needs. These findings suggest that additional studies are needed that focus on populations historically underrepresented in fMRI research. Researchers should thoughtfully consider diversity and purposefully sample groups by including individuals that are: women, from diverse backgrounds, younger, and diagnosed with a variety of CVD-related illnesses. Identifying and addressing these gaps by studying more representative samples will help healthcare providers reduce disparities and tailor interventions for all CVD populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Strategies to Promote Long-Distance Optic Nerve Regeneration</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mammalian retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the central nervous system (CNS) often die after optic nerve injury and surviving RGCs fail to regenerate their axons, eventually resulting in irreversible vision loss. Manipulation of a diverse group of genes can significantly boost optic nerve regeneration of mature RGCs by reactivating developmental-like growth programs or suppressing growth inhibitory pathways. By injury of the vision pathway near their brain targets, a few studies have shown that regenerated RGC axons could form functional synapses with targeted neurons but exhibited poor neural conduction or partial functional recovery. Therefore, the functional restoration of eye-to-brain pathways remains a greatly challenging issue. Here, we review recent advances in long-distance optic nerve regeneration and the subsequent reconnecting to central targets. By summarizing our current strategies for promoting functional recovery, we hope to provide potential insights into future exploration in vision reformation after neural injuries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Lack of Helios During Neural Development Induces Adult Schizophrenia-Like Behaviors Associated With Aberrant Levels of the TRIF-Recruiter Protein WDFY1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00093</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00093</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The role of the WDFY1 protein has been studied as a TLR3/4 scaffold/recruiting protein in the immune system and in different oncogenic conditions. However, its function in brain remains poorly understood. We have found that in mice devoid of Helios (He&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice), a transcription factor specifically expressed during the development of the immune cells and the central nervous system, there is a permanent and sustained increase of Wdfy1 gene expression in the striatum and hippocampus. Interestingly, we observed that WDFY1 protein levels were also increased in the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic patients, but not in the hippocampus of Alzheimer’s disease patients with an associated psychotic disorder. Accordingly, young He&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice displayed several schizophrenic-like behaviors related to dysfunctions in the striatum and hippocampus. These changes were associated with an increase in spine density in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and with a decrease in the number and size of PSD-95-positive clusters in the stratum radiatum of the CA1. Moreover, these alterations in structural synaptic plasticity were associated with a strong reduction of neuronal NF-κB in the pyramidal layer of the CA1 in He&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Altogether, our data indicate that alterations involving the molecular axis Helios-WDFY1 in neurons during the development of core brain regions could be relevant for the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Prevalence and Atypical Clinical Characteristics of NOTCH3 Mutations Among Patients Admitted for Acute Lacunar Infarctions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00130</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00130</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common hereditary small vessel disease, with reported frequencies of 2-5/100,000 individuals. Recently, it has been reported that some patients with NOTCH3 gene mutations show atypical clinical symptoms of CADASIL. Assuming that CADASIL is underdiagnosed in some cases of lacunar infarction, this study was designed to examine the prevalence of NOTCH3 gene mutations in the patients at highest risk who were admitted for lacunar infarctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: From January 2011 to April 2018, 1,094 patients with lacunar infarctions were admitted to our hospital, of whom 31 patients without hypertension but with white matter disease (Fazekas scale 2 or 3) were selected and genetically analyzed for NOTCH3 gene mutations (Phase 1). Furthermore, 54 patients, who were 60 years or younger, were analyzed for NOTCH3 mutations (Phase 2). NOTCH3 exons 2–24, which encode the epidermal growth factor-like repeat domain of the NOTCH3 receptor, were analyzed for mutations by direct sequencing of genomic DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Three patients presented NOTCH3 p.R75P mutations: two in the Phase 1 and one in the Phase 2 cohort. Among patients aged 60 years or younger and those without hypertension but with moderate-to-severe white matter lesions, the carrier frequency of p.R75P was 3.5% (3/85), which was significantly higher than that in the Japanese general population (4.7KJPN) (odds ratio [95% CI] = 58.2 [11.6–292.5]). All three patients with NOTCH3 mutations had family histories of stroke, and the average patient age was 51.3 years. All three patients also showed white matter lesions in the external capsule but not in the temporal pole. The CADASIL and CADASIL scale-J scores of the three patients were 6, 17, 7 (mean, 10.0) and 13, 20, 10 (mean, 14.3), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Among patients hospitalized for lacunar infarctions, the p.R75P prevalence may be higher than previously estimated. The NOTCH3 p.R75P mutation may be underdiagnosed in patients with early-onset lacunar infarctions due to the atypical clinical and neuroimaging features of CADASIL. Early-onset, presence of family history of stroke, external capsule lesions, and absence of hypertension may help predict underlying NOTCH3 mutations despite no temporal white matter lesions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Increased CSF NFL in Non-demented Parkinson’s Disease Subjects Reflects Early White Matter Damage</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder with various underlying pathological processes. Until now, no fluid biomarkers have been established for PD. Given recent biochemical and neuroimaging evidence for the presence of white matter damage in PD, which may even precede neuronal loss, we investigated whether neurofilament light (NFL) was increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PD patients in comparison to controls. NFL is located mainly in large myelinated axons, and increased CSF levels of this protein reflect axonal injury. CSF levels of NFL in 58 early PD patients and 28 controls were quantified by ELISA (Uman Diagnostics). Measures of PD severity included disease duration, UPDRS-III, and Hoehn-Yahr stage. Statistically significant differences in CSF NFL levels were found between PD patients and controls [median with interquartile range 524.82 (393.28–678.34) vs. 271.84 (198.09–335.24) ng/l; p &amp;lt; 0.05)]. In PD patients, there were no correlations between CSF NFL level and the measures of disease severity. The CSF NFL turned out to have a high discriminatory value (AUC 0.850) for differentiating between PD subjects and healthy controls, with 84% sensitivity and 85.2% specificity. The study indirectly demonstrates that axonal damage is present in early PD in addition to neuronal loss. Interestingly, white matter damage was observed in non-demented PD patients. In the light of the results of recent MRI studies which confirm early white matter damage in PD, our data may turn out to be potentially useful in the diagnosis of early, or even preclinical, stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Microglia and Wnt Pathways: Prospects for Inflammation in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been a major health issue for more than one century since it was first reported in 1906. As one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, AD is characterized by the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the affected brain area. Microglia are the major regulators of neuroinflammation in the brain, and neuroinflammation has become recognized as the core pathophysiological process of various neurodegenerative diseases. In the central nervous system (CNS), microglia play a dual role in AD development. For one thing, they degrade amyloid β (Aβ) to resist its deposition; for another, microglia release pro-inflammatory and inflammatory factors, contributing to neuroinflammation as well as the spreading of Aβ and tau pathology. Wnt pathways are important regulators of cell fate and cell activities. The dysregulation of Wnt pathways is responsible for both abnormal tau phosphorylation and synaptic loss in AD. Recent studies have also confirmed the regulatory effect of Wnt signaling on microglial inflammation. Thus, the study of microglia, Wnt pathways, and their possible interactions may open up a new direction for understanding the mechanisms of neuroinflammation in AD. In this review, we summarize the functions of microglia and Wnt pathways and their roles in AD in order to provide new ideas for understanding the pathogenesis of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Cell culture remains as the golden standard for primary isolation of viruses in clinical specimens. In the current practice, researchers have to recognize the cytopathic effects (CPE) induced by virus infection and subsequently use virus-specific monoclonal antibody to confirm the presence of virus. Considering the broad applications of neural network in various fields, we aimed to utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN) to shorten the timing required for CPE identification and to improve the assay sensitivity. Based on the characteristics of influenza-induced CPE, a CNN model with larger sizes of filters and max-pooling kernels was constructed in the absence of transfer learning. A total of 601 images from mock-infected and influenza-infected MDCK cells were used to train the model. The performance of the model was tested by using extra 400 images and the percentage of correct recognition was 99.75%. To further examine the limit of our model in evaluating the changes of CPE overtime, additional 1190 images from a new experiment were used and the recognition rates at 16 hour (hr), 28 hr, and 40 hr post virus infection were 71.80%, 98.25%, and 87.46%, respectively. The specificity of our model, examined by images of MDCK cells infected by six other non-influenza viruses, was 100%. Hence, a simple CNN model was established to enhance the identification of influenza virus in clinical practice.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cBEhyD75-t8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Towards a data-driven characterization of behavioral changes induced by the seasonal flu</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicolò Gozzi, Daniela Perrotta, Daniela Paolotti, Nicola Perra&lt;/p&gt;

In this work, we aim to determine the main factors driving self-initiated behavioral changes during the seasonal flu. To this end, we designed and deployed a questionnaire via Influweb, a Web platform for participatory surveillance in Italy, during the 2017 − 18 and 2018 − 19 seasons. We collected 599 surveys completed by 434 users. The data provide socio-demographic information, level of concerns about the flu, past experience with illnesses, and the type of behavioral changes voluntarily implemented by each participant. We describe each response with a set of features and divide them in three target categories. These describe those that report i) no (26%), ii) only moderately (36%), iii) significant (38%) changes in behaviors. In these settings, we adopt machine learning algorithms to investigate the extent to which target variables can be predicted by looking only at the set of features. Notably, 66% of the samples in the category describing more significant changes in behaviors are correctly classified through Gradient Boosted Trees. Furthermore, we investigate the importance of each feature in the classification task and uncover complex relationships between individuals’ characteristics and their attitude towards behavioral change. We find that intensity, recency of past illnesses, perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of an infection are the most significant features in the classification task and are associated to significant changes in behaviors. Overall, the research contributes to the small set of empirical studies devoted to the data-driven characterization of behavioral changes induced by infectious diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DtRFIElbWMo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Accelerating prediction of chemical shift of protein structures on GPUs: Using OpenACC</title>

Experimental chemical shifts (CS) from solution and solid state magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra provide atomic level information for each amino acid within a protein or protein complex. However, structure determination of large complexes and assemblies based on NMR data alone remains challenging due to the complexity of the calculations. Here, we present a hardware accelerated strategy for the estimation of NMR chemical-shifts of large macromolecular complexes based on the previously published PPM_One software. The original code was not viable for computing large complexes, with our largest dataset taking approximately 14 hours to complete. Our results show that serial code refactoring and parallel acceleration brought down the time taken of the software running on an NVIDIA Volta 100 (V100) Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) to 46.71 seconds for our largest dataset of 11.3 million atoms. We use OpenACC, a directive-based programming model for porting the application to a heterogeneous system consisting of x86 processors and NVIDIA GPUs. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in systems of increasing complexity ranging from 100K to 11.3M atoms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MIaNd42F8p8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Modeling the processes of neuronal progenitor proliferation and differentiation to produce mature cortical neuron subtypes is essential for the study of human brain development and the search for potential cell therapies. We demonstrated a novel paradigm for the generation of vascularized organoids (vOrganoids) consisting of typical human cortical cell types and a vascular structure for over 200 days as a vascularized and functional brain organoid model. The observation of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs), spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs), and bidirectional electrical transmission indicated the presence of chemical and electrical synapses in vOrganoids. More importantly, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis illustrated that vOrganoids exhibited robust neurogenesis and that cells of vOrganoids differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to blood vessel morphogenesis. The transplantation of vOrganoids into the mouse S1 cortex resulted in the construction of functional human-mouse blood vessels in the grafts that promoted cell survival in the grafts. This vOrganoid culture method could not only serve as a model to study human cortical development and explore brain disease pathology but also provide potential prospects for new cell therapies for nervous system disorders and injury.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/p34CTtfe5as&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Variations on a theme: morphological variation in the secondary eye visual pathway across the order of Araneae&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/58c685be-6a94-4f04-8ea5-b7c83a31adf3/cne24945-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagrams showing the four different groups of secondary eye morphology found by the study. For each group, neuropils of the secondary eye visual pathway and the connections between the secondary eye visual pathway and the protocerebrum are given.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiders possess a wide array of sensory‐driven behaviors and therefore provide rich models for studying evolutionary hypotheses about the relationship between brain morphology, sensory systems and behavior. Despite this, only a handful of studies have examined brain variation across the order of Araneae. In this study, I present descriptions of the gross brain morphology for 19 families of spiders that vary in eye morphology. Spiders showed the most variation in the secondary eye visual pathway. Based on this variation, spiders could be categorized into four groups. Group One spiders had small, underdeveloped laminae, no medullae and no mushroom bodies. Group Two spiders had large laminae, no medullae and large mushroom bodies. Group Three spiders had laminae and some evidence of reduced medullae and mushroom bodies. Group Four spiders had the most complex systems, with large laminae, medullae formed from optical glomeruli, and robust mushroom bodies. Within groups, there was large variation in the shape and size of individual regions, indicating possible variation in neuronal organization. The possible evolutionary implications of the loss of a dedicated olfactory organ in spiders and its effects on the mushroom body are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: GGPS1 Mutations Cause Muscular Dystrophy/Hearing Loss/Ovarian Insufficiency Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25772?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25772?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hitherto undescribed phenotype of early onset muscular dystrophy associated with sensorineural hearing loss and primary ovarian insufficiency was initially identified in two siblings and in subsequent patients with a similar constellation of findings. The goal of this study was to understand the genetic and molecular etiology of this condition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We applied whole exome sequencing (WES) superimposed on shared haplotype regions to identify the initial biallelic variants in &lt;i&gt;GGPS1 &lt;/i&gt; followed by &lt;i&gt;GGPS1 &lt;/i&gt; Sanger sequencing or WES in five additional families with the same phenotype. Molecular modeling, biochemical analysis, laser membrane injury assay and the generation of a Y259C knock‐in mouse were done.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 11 patients in six families carrying five different biallelic mutations in specific domains of &lt;i&gt;GGPS1 &lt;/i&gt; were identified. &lt;i&gt;GGPS1 &lt;/i&gt; encodes geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase in the mevalonate/isoprenoid pathway, which catalyzes the synthesis of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), the lipid precursor of geranylgeranylated proteins including small GTPases. All but one patient presented with congenital sensorineural hearing loss and proximal weakness, and all post‐pubertal females had primary ovarian insufficiency. Muscle histology was dystrophic with ultrastructural evidence of autophagic material and large mitochondria in the most severe cases. There was delayed membrane healing after laser injury in patient derived myogenic cells while a knock‐in mouse of one of the mutations (Y259C) resulted in prenatal lethality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identification of specific &lt;i&gt;GGPS1 &lt;/i&gt; mutations defines the cause of a unique form of muscular dystrophy with hearing loss and ovarian insufficiency and points to a novel pathway for this clinical constellation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Model-Predicted Balance Between Neural Excitation and Inhibition Was Maintained Despite of Age-Related Decline in Sensory Evoked Local Field Potential in Rat Barrel Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00024</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The balance between neural excitation and inhibition has been shown to be crucial for normal brain function. However, it is unclear whether this balance is maintained through healthy aging. This study investigated the effect of aging on the temporal dynamics of the somatosensory evoked local field potential (LFP) in rats and tested the hypothesis that excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic activities remain balanced during the aging process. The LFP signal was obtained from the barrel cortex of three different age groups of anesthetized rats (pre-adolescence: 4–6 weeks, young adult: 2–3 months, middle-aged adult: 10–20 months) under whisker pad stimulation. To confirm our previous finding that the initial segment of the evoked LFP was solely associated with excitatory post-synaptic activity, we micro-injected gabazine into the barrel cortex to block inhibition while LFP was collected continuously under the same stimulus condition. As expected, the initial slope of the evoked LFP in the granular layer was unaffected by gabazine injection. We subsequently estimated the excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic activities through a balanced model of the LFP with delayed inhibition as an explicit constraint, and calculated the amplitude ratio of inhibition to excitation. We found an age-dependent slowing of the temporal dynamics in the somatosensory-evoked post-synaptic activity, as well as a significant age-related decrease in the amplitude of the excitatory component and a decreasing trend in the amplitude of the inhibitory component. Furthermore, the delay of inhibition with respect to excitation was significantly increased with age, but the amplitude ratio was maintained. Our findings suggest that aging reduces the amplitude of neural responses, but the balance between sensory evoked excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic activities is maintained to support normal brain function during healthy aging. Further whole cell patch clamp experiments will be needed to confirm or refute these findings by measuring sensory evoked synaptic excitatory and inhibitory activities in vivo during the normal aging process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Early Detection of Alzheimer’s Disease Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Novel Approach Combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Ensemble Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00259</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00259</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Early detection is critical for effective management of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common practice. Among several deep-learning techniques that have been applied to assessing structural brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained popularity due to its superb efficiency in automated feature learning with the use of a variety of multilayer perceptrons. Meanwhile, ensemble learning (EL) has shown to be beneficial in the robustness of learning-system performance via integrating multiple models. Here, we proposed a classifier ensemble developed by combining CNN and EL, i.e., the CNN-EL approach, to identify subjects with MCI or AD using MRI: i.e., classification between (1) AD and healthy cognition (HC), (2) MCIc (MCI patients who will convert to AD) and HC, and (3) MCIc and MCInc (MCI patients who will not convert to AD). For each binary classification task, a large number of CNN models were trained applying a set of sagittal, coronal, or transverse MRI slices; these CNN models were then integrated into a single ensemble. Performance of the ensemble was evaluated using stratified fivefold cross-validation method for 10 times. The number of the intersection points determined by the most discriminable slices separating two classes in a binary classification task among the sagittal, coronal, and transverse slice sets, transformed into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, acted as an indicator to assess the ability of a brain region in which the points were located to classify AD. Thus, the brain regions with most intersection points were considered as those mostly contributing to the early diagnosis of AD. The result revealed an accuracy rate of 0.84 ± 0.05, 0.79 ± 0.04, and 0.62 ± 0.06, respectively, for classifying AD vs. HC, MCIc vs. HC, and MCIc vs. MCInc, comparable to previous reports and a 3D deep learning approach (3D-SENet) based on a more state-of-the-art and popular Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks model using channel attention mechanism. Notably, the intersection points accurately located the medial temporal lobe and several other structures of the limbic system, i.e., brain regions known to be struck early in AD. More interestingly, the classifiers disclosed multiple patterned MRI changes in the brain in AD and MCIc, involving these key regions. These results suggest that as a data-driven method, the combined CNN and EL approach can locate the most discriminable brain regions indicated by the trained ensemble model while the generalization ability of the ensemble model was maximized to successfully capture AD-related brain variations early in the disease process; it can also provide new insights into understanding the complex heterogeneity of whole-brain MRI changes in AD. Further research is needed to examine the clinical implication of the finding, capability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to help understand and evaluate an individual subject’s disease status, symptom burden and progress, and the generalizability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to locate the most discriminable brain regions in the detection of other brain disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and severe depression, in a data-driven way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Upper Limit on the Thermodynamic Information Content of an Action Potential</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00037</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In computational neuroscience, spiking neurons are often analyzed as computing devices that register bits of information, with each action potential carrying at most one bit of Shannon entropy. Here, I question this interpretation by using Landauer's principle to estimate an upper limit for the quantity of thermodynamic information that can be processed within a single action potential in a typical mammalian neuron. A straightforward calculation shows that an action potential in a typical mammalian cortical pyramidal cell can process up to approximately 3.4 · 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; bits of thermodynamic information, or about 4.9 · 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; bits of Shannon entropy. This result suggests that an action potential can, in principle, carry much more than a single bit of Shannon entropy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Can Improve Spatial Learning and Memory and Attenuate Aβ42 Burden at the Early Stage of Alzheimer’s Disease in APP/PS1 Transgenic Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible progressive neurodegenerative disease. Intervention in the early stage of AD is a new path for AD treatment that is being explored. The behavioral and pathological effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (AtDCS) at the early stage of AD in the mouse model, amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) transgenic mice, were investigated based on our previous studies. Thirty-three 6-month-old male APP/PS1 mice were randomly divided into the model group (AD group), model + sham stimulation group (ADST group) and stimulation group (ADT group). Eleven 6-month-old male C57 wild-type mice were randomly selected as a control group (CTL group). The ADT group received 10 AtDCS sessions. The Morris water maze (MWM) task and novel object recognition (NOR) task were used to test mouse memory. Nissl staining, Western blot (WB), immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining of β-amyloid (Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and NF200 were conducted for pathological analysis. The ADT group and the CTL group had a shorter escape latency and more platform-region crossings than the AD group and ADST group in the MWM. There was no significant difference in the discrimination index among the groups in the NOR task. Pathological analysis showed visible differences between the AD group and ADT group. This study revealed that early-stage APP/PS1 transgenic mice did not show recognition memory impairment. AtDCS effectively improved spatial learning and memory in the early-stage APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD, alleviating Aβ burden and having a protective effect on neurons. AtDCS could improve AD-related symptoms by activating many glial cells to promote the degradation and clearance of Aβ or directly affecting production and degradation of Aβ to reduce glial activation. AtDCS is an effective means of early intervention in the early stage of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Chintan J. Joshi, Song-Min Schinn, Anne Richelle, Isaac Shamie, Eyleen J. O’Rourke, Nathan E. Lewis&lt;/p&gt;

Diverse algorithms can integrate transcriptomics with genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to build context-specific metabolic models. These algorithms require identification of a list of high confidence (core) reactions from transcriptomics, but parameters related to identification of core reactions, such as thresholding of expression profiles, can significantly change model content. Importantly, current thresholding approaches are burdened with setting singular arbitrary thresholds for all genes; thus, resulting in removal of enzymes needed in small amounts and even many housekeeping genes. Here, we describe StanDep, a novel heuristic method for using transcriptomics to identify core reactions prior to building context-specific metabolic models. StanDep clusters gene expression data based on their expression pattern across different contexts and determines thresholds for each cluster using data-dependent statistics, specifically standard deviation and mean. To demonstrate the use of StanDep, we built hundreds of models for the NCI-60 cancer cell lines. These models successfully increased the inclusion of housekeeping reactions, which are often lost in models built using standard thresholding approaches. Further, StanDep also provided a transcriptomic explanation for inclusion of lowly expressed reactions that were otherwise only supported by model extraction methods. Our study also provides novel insights into how cells may deal with context-specific and ubiquitous functions. StanDep, as a MATLAB toolbox, is available at https://github.com/LewisLabUCSD/StanDep&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XBBdyiBWEPg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Animals use auditory cues generated by defensive responses of others to detect impending danger. Here we identify a neural circuit in rats involved in the detection of one such auditory cue, the cessation of movement-evoked sound resulting from freezing. This circuit comprises the dorsal subnucleus of the medial geniculate body (MGD) and downstream areas, the ventral area of the auditory cortex (VA), and the lateral amygdala (LA). This study suggests a role for the auditory offset pathway in processing a natural sound cue of threat.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CecMedAIA0A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced inhibitory GABA function, so‐called neural disinhibition, has been implicated in cognitive disorders, including schizophrenia and age‐related cognitive decline. We previously showed in rats that hippocampal disinhibition by local microinfusion of the GABA‐A receptor antagonist picrotoxin disrupted memory and attention and enhanced hippocampal multi‐unit burst firing recorded around the infusion site under isoflurane anesthesia. Here, we analyzed the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) recorded alongside the multi‐unit data. We predicted frequency‐specific LFP changes, based on previous studies implicating GABA in hippocampal oscillations, with the weight of evidence suggesting that disinhibition would facilitate theta and disrupt gamma oscillations. Using a new semi‐automated method based on the kurtosis of the LFP peak‐amplitude distribution as well as on amplitude envelope thresholding, we separated three distinct hippocampal LFP states under isoflurane anesthesia: “burst” and “suppression” states—high‐amplitude LFP spike bursts and the interspersed low‐amplitudeperiods—and a medium‐amplitude “continuous” state. The burst state showed greater overall power than suppression and continuous states and higher relative delta/theta power, but lower relative beta/gamma power. The burst state also showed reduced functional connectivity across the hippocampal recording area, especially around theta and beta frequencies. Overall neuronal firing was higher in the burst than the other two states, whereas the proportion of burst firing was higher in burst and continuous states than the suppression state. Disinhibition caused state‐ and frequency‐dependent LFP changes, tending to increase power at lower frequencies (&amp;lt;20 Hz), but to decrease power and connectivity at higher frequencies (&amp;gt;20 Hz) in burst and suppression states. The disinhibition‐induced enhancement of multi‐unit bursting was also state‐dependent, tending to be more pronounced in burst and suppression states than the continuous state. Overall, we characterized three distinct hippocampal LFP states in isoflurane‐anesthetized rats. Disinhibition changed hippocampal LFP oscillations in a state‐ and frequency‐dependent way. Moreover, the disinhibition‐induced enhancement of multi‐unit bursting was also LFP state‐dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Faster Cortical Thinning and Surface Area Loss in Presymptomatic and Symptomatic C9orf72 Repeat Expansion Adult Carriers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25748?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C9orf72 &lt;/i&gt; expansion is the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We examined aging trajectories of cortical thickness (CTh) and surface area in &lt;i&gt;C9orf72 &lt;/i&gt; expansion adult carriers compared to healthy controls to characterize preclinical cerebral changes leading to symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data were obtained from the Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative. T1‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans were processed with CIVET 2.1 to extract vertex‐wide CTh and cortical surface area (CSA). Symptomatic and presymptomatic subjects were compared to age‐matched controls using mixed‐effects models, controlling for demographic variables. Aging trajectories were compared between carriers and noncarriers by testing the “age by genetic status” interaction. False discovery rate corrections were applied to all vertex‐wide analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample included 640 scans from 386 subjects, including 54 symptomatic &lt;i&gt;C9orf72 &lt;/i&gt; carriers (72.2% behavioral variant FTD), 83 asymptomatic carriers, and 249 controls (age range = 18–86 years). Symptomatic carriers showed fairly symmetric reduction in CTh/CSA in most of the frontal lobes, in addition to large temporoparietal areas. Presymptomatic subjects had reduced CTh/CSA in more restricted areas of the medial frontoparietal lobes, in addition to scattered lateral frontal, parietal, and temporal areas. These differences were explained by faster cortical thinning linearly throughout adulthood in a similar anatomical distribution, with differences emerging in the early 30s. CSA reduction was also faster in mutation carriers predominantly in the ventrofrontal regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C9orf72 &lt;/i&gt; mutation carriers have faster cortical thinning and surface loss throughout adulthood in regions that show atrophy in symptomatic subjects. This suggests that the pathogenic effects of the mutation lead to structural cerebral changes decades prior to symptoms. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Topological Data Analysis Reveals Robust Alterations in the Whole-Brain and Frontal Lobe Functional Connectomes in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0543-19.2020?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulty to control the own behavior. Neuroimaging studies have related ADHD with the interplay of fronto-parietal attention systems with the default mode network (DMN; Castellanos and Aoki, 2016). However, some results have been inconsistent, potentially due to methodological differences in the analytical strategies when defining the brain functional network, i.e., the functional connectivity threshold and/or the brain parcellation scheme. Here, we make use of topological data analysis (TDA) to explore the brain connectome as a function of the filtration value (i.e., the connectivity threshold), instead of using a static connectivity threshold. Specifically, we characterized the transition from all nodes being isolated to being connected into a single component as a function of the filtration value. We explored the utility of such a method to identify differences between 81 children with ADHD (45 male, age: 7.26–17.61 years old) and 96 typically developing children (TDC; 59 male, age: 7.17–17.96 years old), using a public dataset of resting state (rs)fMRI in human subjects. Results were highly congruent when using four different brain segmentations (atlases), and exhibited significant differences for the brain topology of children with ADHD, both at the whole-brain network and the functional subnetwork levels, particularly involving the frontal lobe and the DMN. Therefore, this is a solid approach that complements connectomics-related methods and may contribute to identify the neurophysio-pathology of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Rodent Arena Tracker (RAT): A Machine Vision Rodent Tracking Camera and Closed Loop Control System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0485-19.2020?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/3/ENEURO.0485-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Video tracking is an essential tool in rodent research. Here, we demonstrate a machine vision rodent tracking camera based on a low-cost, open-source, machine vision camera, the OpenMV Cam M7. We call our device the rodent arena tracker (RAT), and it is a pocket-sized machine vision-based position tracker. The RAT does not require a tethered computer to operate and costs about $120 per device to build. These features make the RAT scalable to large installations and accessible to research institutions and educational settings where budgets may be limited. The RAT processes incoming video in real-time at 15 Hz and saves &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; positional information to an onboard microSD card. The RAT also provides a programmable multi-function input/output pin that can be used for controlling other equipment, transmitting tracking information in real time, or receiving data from other devices. Finally, the RAT includes a real-time clock (RTC) for accurate time stamping of data files. Real-time image processing averts the need to save video, greatly reducing storage, data handling, and communication requirements. To demonstrate the capabilities of the RAT, we performed three validation studies: (1) a 4-d experiment measuring circadian activity patterns; (2) logging of mouse positional information alongside status information from a pellet dispensing device; and (3) control of an optogenetic stimulation system for a real-time place preference (RTPP) brain stimulation reinforcement study. Our design files, build instructions, and code for the RAT implementation are open source and freely available online to facilitate dissemination and further development of the RAT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Subthalamic nucleus stimulation modulates motor epileptic activity in humans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25776?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25776?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmaco‐refractory focal motor epileptic seizures pose a significant challenge. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is recently a recognized therapeutic option for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. To identify the specific target for focal motor seizures, we evaluate the modulatory effects of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation because of the critical role of STN in cortico‐subcortical motor processing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven epilepsy patients with refractory seizures who underwent chronic stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) monitoring were studied in presurgical evaluation. Seizure onset zone was hypothesized to be partially involved in the motor areas in six patients. For each patient, one electrode was temporally implanted into STN that was ipsilateral to the seizure onset zone. The cortical‐subcortical seizure propagation was systemically evaluated. The simultaneously electrophysiological responses over distributed cortical areas to STN stimulation at varied frequencies were quantitatively assessed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed the consistent downstream propagation of seizures from the motor cortex towards the ipsilateral STN and remarkable cortical responses on motor cortex to single‐pulse STN stimulation. Furthermore, we showed frequency‐dependent upstream modulatory effect of STN stimulation on motor cortex specifically. In contrast to the enhanced effects of low frequency stimulation, high‐frequency stimulation of STN can significantly reduce interictal spikes, high‐frequency oscillations over motor cortex disclosing effective connections to the STN.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result showed STN is not only engaged in as a propagation network of focal motor seizures but STN stimulation can profoundly modulate the epileptic activity of motor cortex in humans, suggesting a mechanism‐based alternative for patients suffering from refractory focal motor seizures.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Rapid Dissemination of Protocols for Managing Neurology Inpatients with COVID‐19</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25774?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, the scientific community has accelerated its process for knowledge synthesis and dissemination at multiple levels, from creating pathways for expedited journal peer review to establishing specialty task forces that curate information most relevant to individual fields of expertise. We describe our experience engaging with the latter to fill a gap in knowledge. At our institution, we established a group of fifteen neurologists from six subspecialties that created protocols on managing inpatients with concurrent neurological disorders and COVID‐19, using best available evidence and expert opinion. These protocols were disseminated online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://covidneurology.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;covidneurology.org&lt;/a&gt; on April 3, 2020, and have been updated continuously based on emerging literature and frontline clinical experience. We evaluated utility using data analytics, characterizing the number of unique visitors over a week of “normal” usage and the demographic data of visitors. We discuss here the limitations of this imperfect method of knowledge synthesis and dissemination, and acknowledge our peers nationwide who have provided feedback to greatly enhance the quality of these protocols. We believe that our experience highlights the need for exceptionally high levels of collaboration in these unprecedented times.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Pre-exposure to Lower-Level Noise Mitigates Cochlear Synaptic Loss Induced by High-Level Noise</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00025</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The auditory sensory organs appear to be less damaged by exposure to high-level noise that is presented after exposure to non-traumatizing low-level noise. This phenomenon is known as the toughening or conditioning effect. Functionally, it is manifested by a reduced threshold shift, and morphologically by a reduced hair cell loss. However, it remains unclear whether prior exposure to toughening noise can mitigate the synaptic loss induced by exposure to damaging noise. Since the cochlear afferent synapse between the inner hair cells and primary auditory neurons has been identified as a novel site involved in noise-induced cochlear damage, we were interested in assessing whether this synapse can be toughened. In the present study, the synaptic loss was induced by a damaging noise exposure (106 dB SPL) and compared across Guinea pigs who had and had not been previously exposed to a toughening noise (85 dB SPL). Results revealed that the toughening noise heavily reduced the synaptic loss observed 1 day after exposure to the damaging noise. Although it was significant, the protective effect of the toughening noise on permanent synaptic loss was much smaller. Compared with cases in the control group without noise exposure, coding deficits were seen in both toughened groups, as reflected in the compound action potential (CAP) by signals with amplitude modulation. In general, the pre-exposure to the toughening noise resulted in a significantly reduced synaptic loss by the high-level noise. However, this morphological protection was not accompanied by a robust functional benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Modified in situ Hybridization Chain Reaction Using Short Hairpin DNAs</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00075</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The visualization of multiple gene expressions in well-preserved tissues is crucial for the elucidation of physiological and pathological processes. In situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR) is a method to visualize specific mRNAs in diverse organisms by applying a HCR that is an isothermal enzyme-free nucleotide polymerization method using hairpin DNAs. Although in situ HCR is a versatile method, this method is not widely used by researchers because of their higher cost than conventional in situ hybridization (ISH). Here, we redesigned hairpin DNAs so that their lengths were half the length of commonly used hairpin DNAs. We also optimized the conjugated fluorophores and linkers. Modified in situ HCR showed sufficient fluorescent signals to detect various mRNAs such as Penk, Oxtr, Vglut2, Drd1, Drd2, and Moxd1 in mouse neural tissues with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The sensitivity of modified in situ HCR in detecting the Oxtr mRNA was better than that of fluorescent ISH using tyramide signal amplification. Notably, the modified in situ HCR does not require proteinase K treatment so that it enables the preservation of morphological structures and antigenicity. The modified in situ HCR simultaneously detected the distributions of c-Fos immunoreactivity and Vglut2 mRNA, and detected multiple mRNAs with a high signal-noise ratio at subcellular resolution in mouse brains. These results suggest that the modified in situ HCR using short hairpin DNAs is cost-effective and useful for the visualization of multiple mRNAs and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: α-Synuclein Negatively Regulates Nurr1 Expression Through NF-κB-Related Mechanism</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (Nurr1) is critical for the development and survival of midbrain dopamine neurons that are predominantly affected and progressively degenerated in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The expression level of Nurr1 has been proposed to be modulated by α-synuclein (α-SYN), an important pathological hallmark of PD. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of α-SYN-Nurr1 interaction are still rarely explored. In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of α-SYN on the transcription level of Nurr1. Our results showed that overexpression of α-SYN (WT or A53T) reduced Nurr1 and its downstream gene expressions. α-SYN neither affected the mRNA stability nor bound with the promoter of Nurr1, but modulated the transcription activity of Nurr1 promoter region ranging from −605 bp to −418 bp, which contains the binding site of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). Moreover, overexpression of α-SYN (WT or A53T) down-regulated NF-κB expression level, thereby inhibiting the transcription factor activity of NF-κB and decreasing the binding quantity of NF-κB with Nurr1 promoter. These findings may give us new insights to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the α-SYN-regulated Nurr1 function, which may fascinate the investigation of dopamine neuron degeneration in PD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: How Much Instructional Time Is Necessary? Mid-intervention Results of Fundamental Movement Skills Training Within ABA Early Intervention Centers</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The purpose of this study was to explore the question of the minimal amount of instructional time needed to still be effective by assessing the efficacy at mid-intervention of an early fundamental movement skill (FMS) intervention for preschoolers with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Fourteen preschoolers participated in this randomized controlled trial daily over 10 weeks (10 h total at mid-intervention). A two-factor mixed MANOVA tested the significance of group*time interactions for two dependent variables: object control and locomotor raw scores on the Test of Gross Motor Development—III.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Group*time interactions approached significance with large effect sizes on the vector of both dependent variables and in a univariate fashion on object control scores, but not locomotor scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These findings hold relevance for physical educators working with young children with ASD, indicating that 10 h of FMS instruction, at least in this form, is not adequate to improve FMS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Mechanisms of deep brain stimulation (DBS) remain controversial, and spatiotemporal control of brain-wide circuits remains elusive. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have emerged as vehicles for spatiotemporal expression of exogenous transgenes in several tissues, including specific nuclei in the brain. Coupling DBS with viral vectors to modulate exogenous transgene expression remains unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This study examines whether DBS of the medial septal nucleus (MSN) can regulate gene expression of AAV-transduced neurons in a brain region anatomically remote from the stimulation target: the hippocampal dentate gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Rats underwent unilateral hippocampal injection of an AAV vector with c-Fos promoter-driven expression of TdTomato (TdT), followed by MSN electrode implantation. Rodents received no stimulation, 7.7 Hz (theta), or 130 Hz (gamma) DBS for 1 h one week after surgery. In a repeat stimulation experiment, rodents received either no stimulation, or two 1 h MSN DBS over 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;No significant differences in hippocampal TdT expression between controls and acute MSN DBS were found. With repeat DBS we found c-Fos protein expression was induced and we could detect increased TdT with either gamma or theta stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that viral vector-mediated gene expression can be regulated spatially and temporally using DBS. Control of gene expression by DBS warrants further investigation into stimulation-responsive promoters for clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Closed-Loop Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation for Real-Time Non-invasive Neuromodulation in vivo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00445</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The closed-loop brain stimulation technique plays a key role in neural network information processing and therapies of neurological diseases. Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is an established neuromodulation method for the neural oscillation in animals or human. All available TUS systems provide brain stimulation in an open-loop pattern. In this study, we developed a closed-loop transcranial ultrasound stimulation (CLTUS) system for real-time non-invasive neuromodulation in vivo. We used the CLTUS system to modulate the neural activities of the hippocampus of a wild-type mouse based on the phase of the theta rhythm recorded at the ultrasound-targeted location. In addition, we modulated the hippocampus of a temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) mouse. The ultrasound stimulation increased the absolute power and reduced the relative power of the theta rhythm, which were independent of the specific phase of the theta rhythm. Compared with those of a sham stimulation, the latency of epileptic seizures was significantly increased, while the epileptic seizure duration was significantly decreased under the CLTUS. The above results indicate that the CLTUS can be used to not only modulate the neural oscillation through the theta-phase-specific manipulation of the hippocampus but also effectively inhibit the seizure of a TLE mouse in time.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke (IS) is the leading cause of disability in the western world, assuming a high socio-economic cost. One of the most used strategies in the last decade has been biomaterials, which have been initially used with a structural support function. They have been perfected, different compounds have been combined, and they have been used together with cell therapy or controlled release chemical compounds. This double function has driven them as potential candidates for the chronic treatment of IS. In fact, the most developed are in different phases of clinical trial. In this review, we will show the ischemic scenario and address the most important criteria to achieve a successful neuroreparation from the point of view of biomaterials. The spontaneous processes that are activated and how to enhance them is one of the keys that contribute to the success of the therapeutic approach. In addition, the different routes of administration and how they affect the design of biomaterials are analyzed. Future perspectives show where this broad scientific field is heading, which advances every day with the help of technology and advanced therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Temperature Measurements in the Vicinity of Human Intracranial EEG Electrodes Exposed to Body-Coil RF for MRI at 1.5T</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00429</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The application of intracranial electroencephalography (icEEG) recording during functional magnetic resonance imaging (icEEG-fMRI) has allowed the study of the hemodynamic correlates of epileptic activity and of the neurophysiological basis of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. However, the applicability of this technique is affected by data quality issues such as signal drop out in the vicinity of the implanted electrodes. In our center we have limited the technique to a quadrature head transmit and receive RF coil following the results of a safety evaluation. The purpose of this study is to gather further safety-related evidence for performing icEEG-fMRI using a body RF-transmit coil, to allow the greater flexibility afforded by the use of modern, high-density receive arrays, and therefore parallel imaging with benefits such as reduced signal drop-out and distortion artifact. Specifically, we performed a set of empirical temperature measurements on a 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI scanner with the body RF-transmit coil in a range of electrode and connector cable configurations. The observed RF-induced heating during a high-SAR sequence was maximum in the immediate vicinity of a depth electrode located along the scanner’s central axis (range: 0.2–2.4°C) and below 0.5°C at the other electrodes. Also for the high-SAR sequence, we observed excessive RF-related heating in connection cable configurations that deviate from our recommended setup. For the low-SAR sequence, the maximum observed temperature increase across all configurations was 0.3°C. This provides good evidence to allow simultaneous icEEG-fMRI to be performed utilizing the body transmit coil on the 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI scanner at our center with acceptable additional risk by following a well-defined protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Novel Individual Metabolic Brain Network for 18F-FDG PET Imaging</title>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Metabolic brain network analysis based on graph theory using FDG PET imaging is potentially useful for investigating brain activity alternation due to metabolism changes in different stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Most studies on metabolic network construction have been based on group data. Here a novel approach in building an individual metabolic network was proposed to investigate individual metabolic network abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;First, a weighting matrix was calculated based on the interregional effect size difference of mean uptake between a single subject and average normal controls (NCs). Then the weighting matrix for a single subject was multiplied by a group-based connectivity matrix from an NC cohort. To study the performance of the proposed individual metabolic network, inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity patterns in the groups of NC, sMCI (stable mild cognitive impairment), pMCI (progressive mild cognitive impairment), and AD using the proposed individual metabolic network were constructed and compared with those from the group-based results. The network parameters of global efficiency and clustering coefficient and the network density score (NDS) in the default-mode network (DMN) of generated individual metabolic networks were estimated and compared among the disease groups in AD.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our results show that the intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity patterns estimated from our individual metabolic network are similar to those from the group-based method. In particular, the key patterns of occipital-parietal and occipital-temporal inter-regional connectivity deficits detected in the groupwise network study for differentiating different disease groups in AD were also found in the individual network. A reduction trend was observed for network parameters of global efficiency and clustering coefficient, and also for the NDS from NC, sMCI, pMCI, and AD. There was no significant difference between NC and sMCI for all network parameters.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We proposed a novel method in constructing the individual metabolic network using a single-subject FDG PET image and a group-based NC connectivity matrix. The result has shown the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed individual metabolic network in differentiating disease groups in AD. Future studies should include investigation of inter-individual variability and the correlation of individual network features to disease severities and clinical performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Importance of the Habenula for Avoidance Learning Including Contextual Cues in the Human Brain: A Preliminary fMRI Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00165</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00165</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human habenula studies are gradually advancing, primarily through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis of passive (Pavlovian) conditioning tasks as well as probabilistic reinforcement learning tasks. However, no studies have particularly targeted aversive prediction errors, despite the essential importance for the habenula in the field. Complicated learned strategies including contextual contents are involved in making aversive prediction errors during the learning process. Therefore, we examined habenula activation during a contextual learning task. We performed fMRI on a group of 19 healthy controls. We assessed the manually traced habenula during negative outcomes during the contextual learning task. The Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II), the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) were also administered. The left and right habenula were activated during aversive outcomes and the activation was associated with aversive prediction errors. There was also a positive correlation between TCI reward dependence scores and habenula activation. Furthermore, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analyses demonstrated the left and right habenula to the left and right hippocampus connections during the presentation of contextual stimuli. These findings serve to highlight the neural mechanisms that may be relevant to understanding the broader relationship between the habenula and learning processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Remote, Automated, and MRI-Compatible Administration of Interoceptive Inspiratory Resistive Loading</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Research on how humans perceive sensory inputs from their bodies (“interoception”) has been rapidly gaining momentum, with interest across a host of disciplines from physiology through to psychiatry. However, studying interoceptive processes is not without significant challenges, and many methods utilized to access internal states have been largely devoted to capturing and relating naturally occurring variations in interoceptive signals (such as heartbeats) to measures of how the brain processes these signals. An alternative procedure involves the controlled perturbation of specific interoceptive axes. This is challenging because it requires non-invasive interventions that can be repeated many times within a subject and that are potent but safe. Here we present an effective methodology for instigating these perturbations within the breathing domain. We describe a custom-built circuitry that is capable of delivering inspiratory resistive loads automatically and precisely. Importantly, our approach is compatible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environments, allowing for the administration of complicated experimental designs in neuroimaging as increasingly required within developing fields such as computational psychiatry/psychosomatics. We describe the experimental setup for both the control and monitoring of the inspiratory resistive loads, and demonstrate its possible utilities within different study designs. This methodology represents an important step forward from the previously utilized, manually controlled resistive loading setups, which present significant experimental burdens with prolonged and/or complicated sequences of breathing stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Emergent Spaces for Coupled Oscillators</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Systems of coupled dynamical units (e.g., oscillators or neurons) are known to exhibit complex, emergent behaviors that may be simplified through coarse-graining: a process in which one discovers coarse variables and derives equations for their evolution. Such coarse-graining procedures often require extensive experience and/or a deep understanding of the system dynamics. In this paper we present a systematic, data-driven approach to discovering “bespoke” coarse variables based on manifold learning algorithms. We illustrate this methodology with the classic Kuramoto phase oscillator model, and demonstrate how our manifold learning technique can successfully identify a coarse variable that is one-to-one with the established Kuramoto order parameter. We then introduce an extension of our coarse-graining methodology which enables us to learn evolution equations for the discovered coarse variables via an artificial neural network architecture templated on numerical time integrators (initial value solvers). This approach allows us to learn accurate approximations of time derivatives of state variables from sparse flow data, and hence discover useful approximate differential equation descriptions of their dynamic behavior. We demonstrate this capability by learning ODEs that agree with the known analytical expression for the Kuramoto order parameter dynamics at the continuum limit. We then show how this approach can also be used to learn the dynamics of coarse variables discovered through our manifold learning methodology. In both of these examples, we compare the results of our neural network based method to typical finite differences complemented with geometric harmonics. Finally, we present a series of computational examples illustrating how a variation of our manifold learning methodology can be used to discover sets of “effective” parameters, reduced parameter combinations, for multi-parameter models with complex coupling. We conclude with a discussion of possible extensions of this approach, including the possibility of obtaining data-driven effective partial differential equations for coarse-grained neuronal network behavior, as illustrated by the synchronization dynamics of Hodgkin–Huxley type neurons with a Chung-Lu network. Thus, we build an integrated suite of tools for obtaining data-driven coarse variables, data-driven effective parameters, and data-driven coarse-grained equations from detailed observations of networks of oscillators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network) has been advocated as a general and promising modeling approach for neural object representation in primate inferotemporal cortex. In this work, we show that some inherent non-uniqueness problem exists in the DCNN-based modeling of image object representations. This non-uniqueness phenomenon reveals to some extent the theoretical limitation of this general modeling approach, and invites due attention to be taken in practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dopamine Modulates Excitatory Synaptic Transmission by Activating Presynaptic D1-like Dopamine Receptors in the RA Projection Neurons of Zebra Finches</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Songbirds are useful vertebrate study models for vocal learning and memory. The robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) receives synaptic inputs from both the posterior and anterior pathways of the song control system in songbirds. Hence, RA plays an important role in the control of singing. RA receives dopaminergic (DArgic) inputs that increase the excitability of RA projection neurons (PNs). However, the effects of DA on excitatory synaptic transmission are yet to be deciphered. In this study, the effects of DA on the excitatory synaptic transmission of the PNs in the RA of adult male zebra finches were investigated using a whole-cell patch-clamp recording. We observed that DA decreased the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). The effects of DA were mimicked by the D1-like DA receptor (D1R) agonist, SKF-38393, but not the D2-like DA receptor (D2R) agonist, Quinpirole. Also, the effects of DA were blocked by D1R antagonist, SCH-23390, but not the D2R antagonist, Sulpiride. These results demonstrate that DA modulates excitatory synaptic transmission by acting on D1R in the RA of adult male zebra finches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cytoplasmic TDP43 Binds microRNAs: New Disease Targets in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00117</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, fatal, and incurable neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies suggest that dysregulation of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs) may play an important role in ALS pathogenesis. The reversible nature of this dysregulation makes miRNAs attractive pharmacological targets and a potential therapeutic avenue. Under physiological conditions, miRNA biogenesis, which begins in the nucleus and includes further maturation in the cytoplasm, involves trans-activation response element DNA/RNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP43). However, TDP43 mutations or stress trigger TDP43 mislocalization and inclusion formation, a hallmark of most ALS cases, that may lead to aberrant protein/miRNA interactions in the cytoplasm. Herein, we demonstrated that TDP43 exhibits differential binding affinity for select miRNAs, which prompted us to profile miRNAs that preferentially bind cytoplasmic TDP43. Using cellular models expressing TDP43 variants and miRNA profiling analyses, we identified differential levels of 65 cytoplasmic TDP43-associated miRNAs. Of these, approximately 30% exhibited levels that differed by more than 3-fold in the cytoplasmic TDP43 models relative to our control model. The hits included both novel miRNAs and miRNAs previously associated with ALS that potentially regulate several predicted genes and pathways that may be important for pathogenesis. Accordingly, these findings highlight specific miRNAs that may shed light on relevant disease pathways and could represent potential biomarkers and reversible treatment targets for ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Azadirachta indica A. Juss Ameliorates Mouse Hepatitis Virus-Induced Neuroinflammatory Demyelination by Modulating Cell-to-Cell Fusion in an Experimental Animal Model of Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00116</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-induced murine neuroinflammation serves as a model to study acute meningoencephalomyelitis, hepatitis, and chronic neuroinflammatory demyelination; which mimics certain pathologies of the human neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). MHV-induced acute neuroinflammation occurs due to direct glial cell dystrophy instigated by central nervous system (CNS)-resident microglia and astrocytes, in contrast to peripheral CD4+T cell-mediated myelin damage prevalent in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. Viral envelope Spike glycoprotein-mediated cell-to-cell fusion is an essential mechanistic step for MHV-induced CNS pathogenicity. Although Azadirachta indica (Neem), a traditional phytomedicine, is known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, and spermicidal activities, not much is known about anti-neuroinflammatory properties of its bark (NBE) in MHV-induced acute neuroinflammation and chronic demyelination. Recombinant demyelinating MHV strain (RSA59) was preincubated with NBE to arrest the infection-initiation event, and its effect on viral replication, viral transcription, cytokine expression, and successive pathogenicity were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Virus-free Luciferase assay explained NBE’s anti-virus-to-cell fusion activity in vitro. Intracranial inoculation of RSA59 preincubated with NBE into the mouse brain significantly reduces acute hepatitis, meningoencephalomyelitis, and chronic progressive demyelination. Additionally, NBE effectively restricts viral entry, dissemination in CNS, viral replication, viral transcription, and expression of the viral nucleocapsid and inflammatory cytokines. From mechanistic standpoints, RSA59 preincubated with NBE reduced viral entry, viral replication and cell-to-cell fusion, as a mode of viral dissemination. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection with NBE (25 mg/kg B.W.) into mice revealed a significant reduction in viral Nucleocapsid protein expression in vivo. Conclusively, A. indica bark extract may directly bind to the virus-host attachment Spike glycoprotein and suppresses MHV-induced neuroinflammation and neuropathogenesis by inhibiting cell-to-cell fusion and viral replication. Further studies will focus on combining bioanalytical assays to isolate potential NBE bioactive compound(s) that contribute towards the anti-viral activity of NBE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental interest in circuit analysis is to parse out the synaptic inputs underlying a behavioral experience. Toward this aim, we have devised an unbiased strategy that specifically labels the afferent inputs that are activated by a defined stimulus in an activity-dependent manner. We validated this strategy in four brain circuits receiving known sensory inputs. This strategy, as demonstrated here, accurately identifies these inputs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Juvenile Social Isolation Enhances the Activity of Inhibitory Neuronal Circuits in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;During brain development, the design of primary neural networks is primarily determined by environmental stimuli after their formation. In particular, the juvenile period is critical, during which neuronal circuits that consist of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons are remodeled by experience. Social isolation during the juvenile period profoundly affects brain development and contributes to the development of psychiatric disorders. We previously reported that 2 weeks of social isolation after weaning reduced excitatory synaptic inputs and intrinsic excitability in a subtype of layer 5 pyramidal cells, which we defined as prominent h-current (PH) cells, in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in mice. However, it remains unclear how juvenile social isolation affects inhibitory neuronal circuits that consist of pyramidal cells and interneurons. We found that 2 weeks of social isolation after weaning increased inhibitory synaptic inputs exclusively onto PH cells with a concomitant deterioration of action potential properties. Although social isolation did not alter the inhibitory synaptic release mechanisms or the number of inhibitory functional synapses on PH cells, we found that it increased the intrinsic excitability of fast-spiking (FS) interneurons with less excitatory synaptic inputs and more h-current. Our findings indicate that juvenile social isolation enhances the activity of inhibitory neuronal circuits in the mPFC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Emerging Roles of Activity-Dependent Alternative Splicing in Homeostatic Plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00104</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Homeostatic plasticity refers to the ability of neuronal networks to stabilize their activity in the face of external perturbations. Most forms of homeostatic plasticity ultimately depend on changes in the expression or activity of ion channels and synaptic proteins, which may occur at the gene, transcript, or protein level. The most extensively investigated homeostatic mechanisms entail adaptations in protein function or localization following activity-dependent posttranslational modifications. Numerous studies have also highlighted how homeostatic plasticity can be achieved by adjusting local protein translation at synapses or transcription of specific genes in the nucleus. In comparison, little attention has been devoted to whether and how alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNAs underlies some forms of homeostatic plasticity. AS not only expands proteome diversity but also contributes to the spatiotemporal dynamics of mRNA transcripts. Prominent in the brain where it can be regulated by neuronal activity, it is a flexible process, tightly controlled by a multitude of factors. Given its extensive use and versatility in optimizing the function of ion channels and synaptic proteins, we argue that AS is ideally suited to achieve homeostatic control of neuronal output. We support this thesis by reviewing emerging evidence linking AS to various forms of homeostatic plasticity: homeostatic intrinsic plasticity, synaptic scaling, and presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. Further, we highlight the relevance of this connection for brain pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Blocking the LncRNA MALAT1/miR-224-5p/NLRP3 Axis Inhibits the Hippocampal Inflammatory Response in T2DM With OSA</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that diabetes can cause cognitive dysfunction, and cognitive dysfunction in patients with diabetes combined with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is more severe. LncRNAs are known to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with OSA. This study aimed to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of the lncRNA MALAT1/miR-224-5p/NLRP3 axis in T2DM with OSA. qRT-PCR was used to quantify the expression of MALAT1, miR-224-5p, and NLRP3 in brain tissues. NLRP3 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescent labeling. The interaction involving MALAT1, miR-224-5p, and NLRP3 was evaluated by transfection. Western blotting was utilized to evaluate the expression levels of the pathway-related proteins NLRP3, caspase 1, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) both in vitro and in vivo. qRT-PCR was used to assess the mRNA expression levels of NLRP3, caspase 1, TNF-α and IL-1β both in vitro and in vivo. In brain tissues of T2DM with OSA, MALAT1 and NLRP3 were overexpressed, while miR-224-5p was downregulated, which was consistent with subsequent cell experiments. We screened the miRNAs that could bind to MALAT1 and NLRP3 by the StarBase database and the TargetScanMouse7.2 website. Our research showed that among these miRNAs, the level of miR-224-5p was most significantly negatively correlated with the levels of MALAT1 and NLRP3. Also, a firefly luciferase assay showed that miR-224-5p, which is a target of MALAT1, directly reduced the expression of the downstream protein NLRP3. Overexpression of miR-224-5p significantly inhibited the expression levels of NLRP3, caspase 1, TNF-α and IL-1β in vitro. MALAT1 promoted NLRP3 expression by acting as a competing endogenous RNA and sponging miR-224-5p. MiR-224-5p reduces microglial inflammation activation through the regulation of NLRP3 expression, which ultimately affected the NLRP3/IL-1β pathway in the hippocampus. This suggests that miR-224-5p may serve as a potential target for T2DM and OSA therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: High-Resolution Episcopic Imaging for Visualization of Dermal Arteries and Nerves of the Auricular Cymba Conchae in Humans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic applications of auricular vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) have drawn recent attention. Since the targeted stimulation process and parameters depend on the electrode–tissue interaction, the lack of structural anatomical information on innervation and vascularization of the auricle restrain the current optimization of stimulation paradigms. For the first time, we employed high-resolution episcopic imaging (HREM) to generate histologic volume data from donated human cadaver ears. Optimal parameters for specimen preparation were evaluated. Anatomical 3D vascular and nerve structures were reconstructed in one sample of an auricular cymba conchae (CC). The feasibility of HREM to visualize anatomical structures was assessed in that diameters, occupied areas, volumes, and mutual distances between auricular arteries, nerves, and veins were registered. The selected region of CC (3 × 5.5 mm) showed in its cross-sections 21.7 ± 2.7 (mean ± standard deviation) arteries and 14.66 ± 2.74 nerve fibers. Identified nerve diameters were 33.66 ± 21.71 μm, and arteries had diameters in the range of 71.58 ± 80.70 μm. The respective occupied area showed a share of, on average, 2.71% and 0.3% for arteries and nerves, respectively, and similar volume occupancy for arteries and nerves. Inter-centroid minimum distance between arteries and nerves was 274 ± 222 μm. The density of vessels and nerves around a point within CC on a given grid was assessed, showing that 50% of all vessels and nerves were found in a radial distance of 1.6–1.8 mm from any of these points, which is strategically relevant when using stimulation needles in the auricle for excitation of nerves. HREM seems suitable for anatomical studies of the human ear. A 3D model of CC was established in the micrometer scale, which forms the basis for future optimization of the auricular VNS. Obviously, the presented single cadaver study needs to be validated by additional anatomical data on the innervation and vascularization of the auricle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Exploration of the Molecular Mechanism for Lipoprotein Lipase Expression Variations in SH-SY5Y Cells Exposed to Different Doses of Amyloid-Beta Protein</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00132</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Progressive accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in the brain is a characteristic pathological change in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We previously found the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was increased in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to low-dose Aβ and decreased in cells with high-dose Aβ exposure, but the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Based on previous studies, the opposite regulation of histone deacetylase2 (HDAC2) and HDAC3 on LPL expression probably explain the above molecular mechanism, in which microRNA-29a and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) may be involved. This study further revealed the mechanism of HDAC2 and HDAC3 on conversely regulating LPL expression. The results showed that HDAC2 down-regulated microRNA-29a by decreasing histone acetylation (Ace-H3K9) level in its promoter region, subsequently increasing LPL expression directly or through PPARγ/LPL pathway; HDAC3 decreased LPL expression through inhibiting Ace-H3K9 levels in LPL and PPARγ promoter regions and up-regulating microRNA-29a. This study also found that with increasing concentrations of Aβ in cells, HDAC2 and HDAC3 expression were gradually increased, and Ace-H3K9 levels in LPL and PPARγ promoter region regulated by HDAC3 were decreased correspondingly, while Ace-H3K9 levels in microRNA-29a promoter region modulated by HDAC2 were not decreased gradually but presented a U-shaped trend. These may lead to the results that a U-shaped alteration in microRNA-29a expression, subsequently leading to an inverse U-shaped alteration in PPARγ or LPL expression. In conclusion, HDAC2 and HDAC3 at least partly mediate LPL expression variations in different concentrations of Aβ exposed SH-SY5Y cells, in which microRNA-29a and PPARγ are involved, and the histone acetylation level in microRNA-29a promoter region plays a key role.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Time for a Systems Biological Approach to Cognitive Aging?—A Critical Review</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The underlying premise of current theories of cognitive decline with age tend to be primarily cognitive or biological explanations, with relatively few theories adequately integrating both aspects. Though literature has also emphasized the importance of several factors that contribute to cognitive aging including: (a) decline in sensory abilities; (b) the effect of motor speed on paper-pencil measures of cognitive speed; (c) the impact of level of education and physical activity; and (d) molecular biological changes that occur with age, these factors have seldom been implicated into any single theoretical model of cognitive aging. Indeed, such an integrated bio-cognitive model of aging has the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of attention, perception, learning, and memory across the lifespan. Thus, the aim of this review was to critically evaluate common theories of age-related cognitive decline and highlight the need for a more comprehensive systems neuroscience approach to cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Differences in Cerebral Structure Associated With Depressive Symptoms in the Elderly With Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00107</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00107</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by global deterioration in multiple cognitive domains. In addition to cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms are common issues that trouble AD patients. The neuroanatomical basis of depressive symptoms in AD patients has yet to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Twenty AD patients and 22 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited for the present study. Depressive symptoms in AD patients and HCs were assessed according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Anatomical structural differences were assessed between AD patients and HCs using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM). Correlation analyses were conducted to investigate relationships between depressive symptoms and structural altered regions. Multiple pattern analysis using linear support vector machine (SVM) was performed in another independent cohort, which was collected from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data and contained 20 AD patients and 20 HCs, to distinguish AD patients from HCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with HCs, AD patients exhibited global cerebral atrophy in gray matter volume (GMV) and cortical thickness, including frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, and insular lobes. In addition, insular GMV was negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Moreover, SVM-based classification achieved an accuracy of 77.5%, a sensitivity of 70%, and a specificity of 85% by leave-one-out cross-validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: GMV of the insula displayed atrophy among AD patients, which is associated with depressive symptoms. Our observations provide a potential neural substrate for analysis to examine the co-occurrence of AD with depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Extracellular Sortilin Proteopathy Relative to β-Amyloid and Tau in Aged and Alzheimer’s Disease Human Brains</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00093</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are hallmark lesions of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) related to β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and intraneuronal phosphorylated tau (pTau) accumulation. Sortilin C-terminal fragments (shortened as “sorfra”) can deposit as senile plaque-like lesions within AD brains. The course and pattern of sorfra plaque formation relative to Aβ and pTau pathogenesis remain unknown. In the present study, cerebral and subcortical sections in postmortem human brains (n = 46) from aged and AD subjects were stained using multiple markers (6E10, β-secretase 1, pTau, and sortilin antibodies, as well as Bielschowsky silver stain). The course and pattern of sorfra plaque formation relative to Thal Aβ and Braak NFT pathogenic stages were determined. Sorfra plaques occurred in the temporal, inferior frontal and occipital neocortices in cases with Thal 1 and Braak III stages. They were also found additionally in the hippocampal formation, amygdala, and associative neocortex in cases with Thal 2–4 and Braak IV–V. Lastly, they were also found in the primary motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices in cases with Thal 4–5 and Braak VI. Unlike Aβ and pTau pathologies, sorfra plaques did not occur in subcortical structures in cases with Aβ/pTau lesions in Thal 3–5/Braak IV–VI stages. We establish here that sorfra plaques are essentially a cerebral proteopathy. We believe that the development of sorfra plaques in both cortical and hippocampal regions proceeds in a typical spatiotemporal pattern, and the stages of cerebral sorfra plaque formation partially overlap with that of Aβ and pTau pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The microbiome is a new frontier for building predictors of human phenotypes. However, machine learning in the microbiome is fraught with issues of reproducibility, driven in large part by the wide range of analytic models and metagenomic data types available. We aimed to build robust metagenomic predictors of host phenotype by comparing prediction performances and biological interpretation across 8 machine learning methods and 4 different types of metagenomic data. Using 1,570 samples from 300 infants, we fit 7,865 models for 6 host phenotypes. We demonstrate the dependence of accuracy on algorithm choice and feature definition in microbiome data and propose a framework for building microbiome-derived indicators of host phenotype. We additionally identify biological features predictive of age, sex, breastfeeding status, historical antibiotic usage, country of origin, and delivery type.

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Calibration of individual-based models to epidemiological data: A systematic review</title>

Individual-based models (IBMs) informing public health policy should be calibrated to data and provide estimates of uncertainty. Two main components of model-calibration methods are the parameter-search strategy and the goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure; many options exist for each of these. This review provides an overview of calibration methods used in IBMs modelling infectious disease spread. We identified articles on PubMed employing simulation-based methods to calibrate IBMs informing public health policy in HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria epidemiology published between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2018. Articles were included if models stored individual-specific information, and calibration involved comparing model output to population-level targets. We extracted information on parameter-search strategies, GOF measures, and model validation. The PubMed search identified 653 candidate articles, of which 84 met the review criteria. Of the included articles, 40 (48%) combined a quantitative GOF measure with an algorithmic parameter-search strategy–either an optimisation algorithm (14/40) or a sampling algorithm (26/40). These 40 articles varied widely in their choices of parameter-search strategies and GOF measures. For the remaining 44 (52%) articles, the parameter-search strategy could either not be identified (32/44) or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method (12/44). Of these 44 articles, the majority (25/44) were unclear about the GOF measure used; of the rest, only five quantitatively evaluated GOF. Only a minority of the included articles, 14 (17%) provided a rationale for their choice of model-calibration method. Model validation was reported in 31 (37%) articles. Reporting on calibration methods is far from optimal in epidemiological modelling studies of HIV, malaria and TB transmission dynamics. The adoption of better documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology. There is a need for research comparing the performance of calibration methods to inform decisions about the parameter-search strategies and GOF measures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/M4Jh9Js-NLQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Standard multiscale entropy reflects neural dynamics at mismatched temporal scales: What’s signal irregularity got to do with it?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007885</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Gzt1qa0Qd-8/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Julian Q. Kosciessa, Niels A. Kloosterman, Douglas D. Garrett&lt;/p&gt;

Multiscale Entropy (MSE) is used to characterize the temporal irregularity of neural time series patterns. Due to its’ presumed sensitivity to non-linear signal characteristics, MSE is typically considered a complementary measure of brain dynamics to signal variance and spectral power. However, the divergence between these measures is often unclear in application. Furthermore, it is commonly assumed (yet sparingly verified) that entropy estimated at specific time scales reflects signal irregularity at those precise time scales of brain function. We argue that such assumptions are not tenable. Using simulated and empirical electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 47 younger and 52 older adults, we indicate strong and previously underappreciated associations between MSE and spectral power, and highlight how these links preclude traditional interpretations of MSE time scales. Specifically, we show that the typical definition of temporal patterns via “similarity bounds” biases coarse MSE scales–that are thought to reflect slow dynamics–by high-frequency dynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that entropy at fine time scales–presumed to indicate fast dynamics–is highly sensitive to broadband spectral power, a measure dominated by low-frequency contributions. Jointly, these issues produce counterintuitive reflections of frequency-specific content on MSE time scales. We emphasize the resulting inferential problems in a conceptual replication of cross-sectional age differences at rest, in which scale-specific entropy age effects could be explained by spectral power differences at mismatched temporal scales. Furthermore, we demonstrate how such problems may be alleviated, resulting in the indication of scale-specific age differences in rhythmic irregularity. By controlling for narrowband contributions, we indicate that spontaneous alpha rhythms during eyes open rest transiently reduce broadband signal irregularity. Finally, we recommend best practices that may better permit a valid estimation and interpretation of neural signal irregularity at time scales of interest.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Gzt1qa0Qd-8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The hopes of precision medicine rely on our capacity to measure various high-throughput genomic information of a patient and to integrate them for personalized diagnosis and adapted treatment. Reaching these ambitious objectives will require the development of efficient tools for the detection of molecular defects at the individual level. Here, we propose a novel method, PenDA, to perform Personalized Differential Analysis at the scale of a single sample. PenDA is based on the local ordering of gene expressions within individual cases and infers the deregulation status of genes in a sample of interest compared to a reference dataset. Based on realistic simulations of RNA-seq data of tumors, we showed that PenDA outcompetes existing approaches with very high specificity and sensitivity and is robust to normalization effects. Applying the method to lung cancer cohorts, we observed that deregulated genes in tumors exhibit a cancer-type-specific commitment towards up- or down-regulation. Based on the individual information of deregulation given by PenDA, we were able to define two new molecular histologies for lung adenocarcinoma cancers strongly correlated to survival. In particular, we identified 37 biomarkers whose up-regulation lead to bad prognosis and that we validated on two independent cohorts. PenDA provides a robust, generic tool to extract personalized deregulation patterns that can then be used for the discovery of therapeutic targets and for personalized diagnosis.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexander Rivkind, Hallel Schreier, Naama Brenner, Omri Barak&lt;/p&gt;

Biological networks are often heterogeneous in their connectivity pattern, with degree distributions featuring a heavy tail of highly connected hubs. The implications of this heterogeneity on dynamical properties are a topic of much interest. Here we show that interpreting topology as a feedback circuit can provide novel insights on dynamics. Based on the observation that in finite networks a small number of hubs have a disproportionate effect on the entire system, we construct an approximation by lumping these nodes into a single effective hub, which acts as a feedback loop with the rest of the nodes. We use this approximation to study dynamics of networks with scale-free degree distributions, focusing on their probability of convergence to fixed points. We find that the approximation preserves convergence statistics over a wide range of settings. Our mapping provides a parametrization of scale free topology which is predictive at the ensemble level and also retains properties of individual realizations. Specifically, outgoing hubs have an organizing role that can drive the network to convergence, in analogy to suppression of chaos by an external drive. In contrast, incoming hubs have no such property, resulting in a marked difference between the behavior of networks with outgoing vs. incoming scale free degree distribution. Combining feedback analysis with mean field theory predicts a transition between convergent and divergent dynamics which is corroborated by numerical simulations. Furthermore, they highlight the effect of a handful of outlying hubs, rather than of the connectivity distribution law as a whole, on network dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KxHqjuTd_Lk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1{alpha} (HIF-1{alpha}) Counteracts the Acute Death of Cells Transplanted into the Injured Spinal Cord</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Cellular transplantation is in clinical testing for a number of central nervous system disorders, including spinal cord injury (SCI). One challenge is acute transplanted cell death. To prevent this death, there is a need to both establish when the death occurs and develop approaches to mitigate its effects. Here, using luciferase (luc) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing Schwann cell (SC) transplants in the contused thoracic rat spinal cord 7 d postinjury, we establish via &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; bioluminescent (IVIS) imaging and stereology that cell death occurs prior to 2–3 d postimplantation. We then test an alternative approach to the current paradigm of enhancing transplant survival by including multiple factors along with the cells. To stimulate multiple cellular adaptive pathways concurrently, we activate the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) transcriptional pathway. Retroviral expression of VP16-HIF-1α in SCs increased HIF-α by 5.9-fold and its target genes implicated in oxygen transport and delivery (VEGF, 2.2-fold) and cellular metabolism (enolase, 1.7-fold). In cell death assays &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, HIF-1α protected cells from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced oxidative damage. It also provided some protection against camptothecin-induced DNA damage, but not thapsigargin-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress or tunicamycin-induced unfolded protein response. Following transplantation, VP16-HIF-1α increased SC survival by 34.3%. The increase in cell survival was detectable by stereology, but not by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; luciferase or &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; GFP IVIS imaging. The results support the hypothesis that activating adaptive cellular pathways enhances transplant survival and identifies an alternative pro-survival approach that, with optimization, could be amenable to clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;A software tool for synchronization of video with signals would be of broad general use to behavioral neuroscientists. A new program, called &lt;i&gt;neurotic&lt;/i&gt; (NEUROscience Tool for Interactive Characterization), allows users to review and annotate signal data synchronized with video, performs simple initial analyses including signal filtering and spike detection, is easy to use, and supports a variety of file formats. The program also facilitates collaborations by using a portable specification for loading and processing data and retrieving data files from online sources. Two examples are shown in which the software is used to explore experimental datasets with extracellular nerve or muscle recordings and simultaneous video of behavior. The configuration specification for controlling how data are located, loaded, processed, and plotted is also summarized. Algorithms for spike detection and burst detection are demonstrated. This new program could be used in many applications in which behavior and signals need to be analyzed together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Familiarity Detection and Memory Consolidation in Cortical Assemblies</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Humans have a large capacity of recognition memory (Dudai, 1997), a fundamental property of higher-order brain functions such as abstraction and generalization (Vogt and Magnussen, 2007). Familiarity is the first step towards recognition memory. We have previously demonstrated using unsupervised neural network simulations that familiarity detection of complex patterns emerges in generic cortical microcircuits with bidirectional synaptic plasticity. It is therefore meaningful to conduct similar experiments on biological neuronal networks to validate these results. Studies of learning and memory in dissociated rodent neuronal cultures remain inconclusive to date. Synchronized network bursts (SNBs) that occur spontaneously and periodically have been speculated to be an intervening factor. By optogenetically stimulating cultured cortical networks with random dot movies (RDMs), we were able to reduce the occurrence of SNBs, after which an ability for familiarity detection emerged: previously seen patterns elicited higher firing rates than novel ones. Differences in firing rate were distributed over the entire network, suggesting that familiarity detection is a system level property. We also studied the change in SNB patterns following familiarity encoding. Support vector machine (SVM) classification results indicate that SNBs may be facilitating memory consolidation of the learned pattern. In addition, using a novel network connectivity probing method, we were able to trace the change in synaptic efficacy induced by familiarity encoding, providing insights on the long-term impact of having SNBs in the cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

How this synchrony is achieved remains unclear. A new study by Narikiyo et al. demonstrates how the claustrum may play a key role in the global control of this rhythm.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/vx5R3aMpmgA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>
