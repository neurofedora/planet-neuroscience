	<description>Publication date: August 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Ngang Heok   Tang, Yishi   Jin&lt;br /&gt; Development of a neuron critically depends on the organization of its cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Souparno   Ghosh, Peter   Harvey, Jacob C   Simon, Alan   Jasanoff&lt;br /&gt; One of the greatest challenges of modern neuroscience is to incorporate our growing knowledge of molecular and cellular-scale physiology into integrated, organismic-scale models of brain function in behavior and cognition. Molecular-level functional magnetic resonance imaging (molecular fMRI) is a new technology that can help bridge these scales by mapping defined microscopic phenomena over large, optically inaccessible regions of the living brain. In this review, we explain how MRI-detectable imaging probes can be used to sensitize noninvasive imaging to mechanistically significant components of neural processing. We discuss how a combination of innovative probe design, advanced imaging methods, and strategies for brain delivery can make molecular fMRI an increasingly successful approach for spatiotemporally resolved studies of diverse neural phenomena, perhaps eventually in people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Although clinically different, they share similar molecular features: the accumulation of one or two proteins in abnormal conformations inside or outside neurons. Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment. Inhibition of a protein phosphatase terminating the unfolded protein response will be discussed as a strategy to protect from diseases associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

To be effective, these systems must be able to simultaneously record and stimulate neural activity, a task made difficult by persistent stimulation artifacts that distort and obscure underlying biomarkers. To enable simultaneous stimulation and recording, several techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve artifact-preventing system configurations, resilient recording front-ends, and back-end signal processing for removing recorded artifacts. Co-designing and integrating these artifact cancellation techniques will be key to enabling neuromodulation systems to stimulate and record at the same time. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for these techniques and their role in achieving artifact-free neuromodulation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

With the development of sensitive genetically encoded calcium indicators, this has extended to the whole-brain imaging of neural activity with cellular resolution. This technique has been used to study brain-wide population dynamics accompanying sensory processing and sensorimotor transformations, and has spurred the development of innovative closed-loop behavioral paradigms in which stimulus–response relationships can be studied. More recently, microscopes have been developed that allow whole-brain calcium imaging in freely swimming and behaving larvae. In this review, we highlight the technologies underlying whole-brain functional imaging in zebrafish, provide examples of the sensory and motor processes that have been studied with this technique, and discuss the need to merge data from whole-brain functional imaging studies with neurochemical and anatomical information to develop holistic models of functional neural circuits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Thanks to the development and optimization of various genetically encoded sensors, we are approaching the stage in which a few key neurotransmitters/neuromodulators can be imaged with high cell specificity and good signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we summarize recent progress regarding these sensors, focusing on their design principles, properties, potential applications, and current limitations. We also highlight the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) scaffold as a promising platform that may enable the scalable development of the next generation of sensors, enabling the rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of a large repertoire of neurotransmitters/neuromodulators in vivo at cellular or even subcellular resolution. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;165&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817301915-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide ∼1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

With vast cell number and diversity, mammalian nervous systems present a daunting challenge for achieving specific and comprehensive cell type access—prerequisite to circuit analysis. Genetic approaches in the mouse have relied on germline engineering to access marker-defined cell populations. Combinatorial strategies that engage marker intersection, anatomy and projection pattern (e.g. antero-grade and retro-grade viral vectors), and developmental lineage substantially increase the specificity of cell type targeting. While increasing number of mouse cell types are becoming experimentally accessible, comprehensive coverage requires larger coordinated efforts with strategic infrastructural and fiscal planning. CRISPR-based genome editing may enable cell type access in other species, but issues of time, cost and ethics remain, especially for primates. Novel approaches that bypass the germline, such as somatic cell engineering and cell surface-based gene delivery, may reduce the barrier of genetic access to mammalian cell types. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): I-Wen   Chen, Eirini   Papagiakoumou, Valentina   Emiliani&lt;br /&gt; Optogenetics neuronal targeting combined with single-photon wide-field illumination has already proved its enormous potential in neuroscience, enabling the optical control of entire neuronal networks and disentangling their role in the control of specific behaviors. However, establishing how a single or a sub-set of neurons controls a specific behavior, or how functionally identical neurons are connected in a particular task, or yet how behaviors can be modified in real-time by the complex wiring diagram of neuronal connections requires more sophisticated approaches enabling to drive neuronal circuits activity with single-cell precision and millisecond temporal resolution. This has motivated on one side the development of flexible optical methods for two-photon (2P) optogenetic activation using either, or a hybrid of two approaches: scanning and parallel illumination. On the other side, it has stimulated the engineering of new opsins with modified spectral characteristics, channel kinetics and spatial distribution of expression, offering the necessary flexibility of choosing the appropriate opsin for each application. The need for optical manipulation of multiple targets with millisecond temporal resolution has imposed three-dimension (3D) parallel holographic illumination as the technique of choice for optical control of neuronal circuits organized in 3D. Today 3D parallel illumination exists in several complementary variants, each with a different degree of simplicity, light uniformity, temporal precision and axial resolution. In parallel, the possibility to reach hundreds of targets in 3D volumes has prompted the development of low-repetition rate amplified laser sources enabling high peak power, while keeping low average power for stimulating each cell. All together those progresses open the way for a precise optical manipulation of neuronal circuits with unprecedented precision and flexibility. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;245&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302477-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;249&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

During synchronous neurotransmission release is precisely coupled to action potentials, in contrast, asynchronous release events show only loose temporal coupling to presynaptic activity whereas spontaneous neurotransmission occurs independent of presynaptic activity. The mechanisms that give rise to this diversity in neurotransmitter release modes are poorly understood. Recent studies have described several presynaptic molecular pathways controlling synaptic vesicle pool segregation and recycling, which in turn may dictate distinct modes of neurotransmitter release. In this article, we review this recent work regarding neurotransmitter release modes and their relationship to synaptic vesicle pool dynamics as well as the molecular machinery that establishes synaptic vesicle pool identity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Evidence suggests that humans rely on an earth gravity prior for sensory-motor tasks like catching or reaching. Even under earth-discrepant conditions, this prior biases perception and action towards assuming a gravitational downwards acceleration of 9.81 m/s2. This can be particularly detrimental in interactions with virtual environments employing earth-discrepant gravity conditions for their visual presentation. The present study thus investigates how sensitive humans are to visually presented gravities and which cues are used to extract the gravity values from the visual scene. To this end, we employed a Two-Interval Forced-Choice Design. In Experiment 1, participants had to judge which of two presented parabolas had the higher underlying gravity. We used two initial vertical velocities, two horizontal velocities and a constant target size. Experiment 2 added a manipulation of the reliability of the target size. Experiment 1 shows that participants are generally not very sensitive to visually presented gravities, with weber fractions of 13 to beyond 30 %. We identified the rate of change of the elevation angle () and the rate of change of the visual angle () as major cues. Experiment 2 suggests furthermore that size variability has a small influence on sensitivity, while at the same time larger size variability increases reliance on and decreases reliance on . All in all, even though we use all available information, humans are not adept at extracting the governing gravity from a visual scene, which might further impact our capabilities of adapting to earth-discrepant gravity conditions with visual information alone.</description>

	<description>A{beta} peptides, the major components of amyloid deposits of Alzheimer's disease, are released following sequential cleavages by secretases of its precursor named the amyloid precursor protein (APP). In addition to secretases, degradation pathways, in particular the endosomal/lysosomal and proteasomal systems have also been reported to contribute to APP processing. However, the respective role of each of these pathways towards APP metabolism remains to be established. To address this, we used HEK 293 cells and primary neurons expressing full-length APPWT or the {beta}-secretase-derived C99 fragments ({beta}-CTFs) in which degradation pathways were selectively blocked using pharmacological drugs. APP metabolites, including carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs), soluble APP (sAPP) and A{beta} peptides were studied. In this report, we show that APP-CTFs produced from endogenous or overexpressed full-length APP are mainly processed by {gamma}-secretase and the endosomal/lysosomal pathway, while in sharp contrast, overexpressed C99 alone is mainly degraded by the proteasome and to a lesser extent by {gamma}-secretase.</description>

	<description>Natural scenes sparsely activate neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1). However, whether sparsely active neurons sufficiently represent natural image contents and what proportion of neurons are involved in the natural image processing have not been revealed. We recorded the visual responses of mouse V1 neurons to natural images. Small numbers of neurons highly responded to single natural images, whereas most neurons were activated by at least one image. We reconstructed the natural images from the neuronal activities. Visual contents of single natural images were linearly decodable from surprisingly small numbers (~20) of highly responsive neurons. This was achieved by diverse visual features encoded by the small number of responsive neurons. This representation allows the downstream areas to easily access information contents encoded in sparsely active V1 neurons.</description>

	<description>Aims: Parkinson disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by inclusions mainly composed of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) aggregates. The objective of this study was to investigate if beta-synuclein (beta-syn) overexpression could have beneficial effects by inhibiting the aggregation of alpha-syn. Methods: The M83 transgenic mouse is a model of synucleinopathy, which develops severe motor symptoms associated with aggregation of alpha-syn, heavily phosphorylated at serine 129 residue. M83 neonate or adult mice were injected with adeno-associated virus vectors carrying the human beta-syn gene (AAVbeta-syn) or green fluorescent protein gene (AAVGFP) using different injection sites. One or two months later, M83 disease was accelerated or not using brain M83 extracts from mouse (M83) or human (MSA) origins. beta-syn overexpression and phosphorylated alpha-syn levels were analyzed by ELISA or immunohistochemistry. Results: AAV mediated beta-syn overexpression did not delay the disease onset, regardless of the AAV injection route and of the inoculation of brain extracts. Instead, the first pathological symptoms appeared significantly sooner after injection of AAVbeta-syn in two out of six independent experiments. Accordingly, phosphorylated alpha-syn levels in sick mice were similar after the injection of AAVbeta-syn or AAVGFP. Instead, immunohistochemistry analysis of beta-syn indicated the presence of proteinase-K resistant beta-syn staining specifically in sick M83 mice inoculated with AAVbeta-syn. Conclusions: This study indicated that AAV-mediated beta-syn over-expression did not protect M83 mice from alpha-syn aggregation, highlighting for the first time that beta-synuclein could form aggregates in a model of synucleinopathy when it is expressed by a viral vector.</description>

	<description>Of the many genetic mutations known to increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder, a large proportion cluster upon synaptic proteins. One such family of presynaptic proteins are the neurexins (NRXN), and recent genetic and mouse evidence has suggested a causative role for NRXN2 in generating altered social behaviours. Autism has been conceptualised as a disorder of atypical inter-regional connectivity, yet how single-gene mutations affect such connectivity remains under-explored. For the first time, we have developed a within-subject, quantitative analysis of white matter microstructure and connectivity leveraging diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) with high-resolution 3D imaging in optically cleared (CLARITY) brain tissue in the same mouse, applied here to the Nrxn2 knockout (KO) model. DTI revealed decreases in fractional anisotropy and increases in apparent diffusion coefficient in the amygdala (including the basolateral nuclei), the anterior cingulate cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Radial diffusivity of the anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex was significantly increased in Nrxn2 KO mice, as were tracts between the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex. Using CLARITY, we find significantly altered axonal orientation in the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, which was unrelated to cell density. Our findings demonstrate that deleting a single neurexin gene (Nrxn2) induces atypical connectivity within the social brain, likely underlying autism-related impairments. More generally, our combined within-subject DTI-plus-CLARITY approach presents a new, more sensitive method of revealing hitherto undetectable differences in the autistic brain.</description>

	<description>Almost all attention and learning - in particular, most early learning - takes place in social settings. But little is known of how our brains support dynamic social interactions. We recorded dual-EEG from infants and parents during solo play and joint play. During solo play, fluctuations in infant Theta power significantly forward-predicted their subsequent attentional behaviours. But this forwards-predictiveness was lower during joint play than solo play, suggesting that infant endogenous neural control over attention is greater during solo play. Overall, however, infants were more attentive to the objects during joint play. To understand why, we examined how adult brain activity related to infant attention. We found that parent Theta power closely tracked and responded to changes in infant attention. Further, instances in which parents showed greater neural responsivity were associated with longer sustained attention by infants. Our results offer new insights into how one partner influences another during social interaction.</description>

Sample-induced image-degradation remains an intricate wave-optical problem in light-sheet microscopy. Here we present &lt;i&gt;biobeam&lt;/i&gt;, an open-source software package that enables simulation of operational light-sheet microscopes by combining data from 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; multiplexed and GPU-accelerated point-spread-function calculations. The wave-optical nature of these simulations leads to the faithful reproduction of spatially varying aberrations, diffraction artifacts, geometric image distortions, adaptive optics, and emergent wave-optical phenomena, and renders image-formation in light-sheet microscopy computationally tractable.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r2Zl1-90KGY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Synaptic activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; can potentially alter the integration properties of neurons. Using recordings in awake mice, we targeted somatosensory layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons and compared neuronal properties with those from slices. Pyramidal cells &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; had lower resistance and gain values, as well as broader spikes and increased spike frequency adaptation compared to the same cells in slices. Increasing conductance in neurons using dynamic clamp to levels observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, however, did not lessen the differences between &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and slice conditions. Further, local application of tetrodotoxin (TTX) &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; blocked synaptic-mediated membrane voltage fluctuations but had little impact on pyramidal cell membrane input resistance and time constant values. Differences in electrophysiological properties of layer 2/3 neurons in mouse somatosensory cortex, therefore, stem from intrinsic sources separate from synaptic-mediated membrane voltage fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) Activation Suppresses TRPV1 Sensitization in Mouse, But Not Human, Sensory Neurons</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The use of human tissue to validate putative analgesic targets identified in rodents is a promising strategy for improving the historically poor translational record of preclinical pain research. We recently demonstrated that in mouse and human sensory neurons, agonists for metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3) reduce membrane hyperexcitability produced by the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Previous rodent studies indicate that mGluR2/3 can also reduce peripheral sensitization by suppressing inflammation-induced sensitization of TRPV1. Whether this observation similarly translates to human sensory neurons has not yet been tested. We found that activation of mGluR2/3 with the agonist APDC suppressed PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced sensitization of TRPV1 in mouse, but not human, sensory neurons. We also evaluated sensory neuron expression of the gene transcripts for mGluR2 (&lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt;), mGluR3 (&lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;), and TRPV1 (&lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt;). The majority of &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mouse and human sensory neurons expressed &lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;, and in both mice and humans, &lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt; was expressed in a greater percentage of sensory neurons than &lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;. Although we demonstrated a functional difference in the modulation of TRPV1 sensitization by mGluR2/3 activation between mouse and human, there were no species differences in the gene transcript colocalization of mGluR2 or mGluR3 with TRPV1 that might explain this functional difference. Taken together with our previous work, these results suggest that mGluR2/3 activation suppresses only some aspects of human sensory neuron sensitization caused by PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These differences have implications for potential healthy human voluntary studies or clinical trials evaluating the analgesic efficacy of mGluR2/3 agonists or positive allosteric modulators.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Combined Blockade of Interleukin-1{alpha} and -1{beta} Signaling Protects Mice from Cognitive Dysfunction after Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Diffuse activation of interleukin-1 inflammatory cytokine signaling after traumatic brain injury (TBI) elicits progressive neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric dysfunction, and thus represents a potential opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Although interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-1β both activate the common type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI), they manifest distinct injury-specific roles in some models of neurodegeneration. Despite its potential relevance to treating patients with TBI, however, the individual contributions of IL-1α and IL-1β to TBI-pathology have not been previously investigated. To address this need, we applied genetic and pharmacologic approaches in mice to dissect the individual contributions of IL-1α, IL-β, and IL-1RI signaling to the pathophysiology of fluid percussion–mediated TBI, a model of mixed focal and diffuse TBI. IL-1RI ablation conferred a greater protective effect on brain cytokine expression and cognitive function after TBI than did individual IL-1α or IL-1β ablation. This protective effect was recapitulated by treatment with the drug anakinra, a recombinant naturally occurring IL-1RI antagonist. Our data thus suggest that broad targeting of IL-1RI signaling is more likely to reduce neuroinflammation and preserve cognitive function after TBI than are approaches that individually target IL-1α or IL-1β signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Evidence Integration in Natural Acoustic Textures during Active and Passive Listening</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Many natural sounds can be well described on a statistical level, for example, wind, rain, or applause. Even though the spectro-temporal profile of these acoustic textures is highly dynamic, changes in their statistics are indicative of relevant changes in the environment. Here, we investigated the neural representation of change detection in natural textures in humans, and specifically addressed whether active task engagement is required for the neural representation of this change in statistics. Subjects listened to natural textures whose spectro-temporal statistics were modified at variable times by a variable amount. Subjects were instructed to either report the detection of changes (active) or to passively listen to the stimuli. A subset of passive subjects had performed the active task before (passive-aware vs passive-naive). Psychophysically, longer exposure to pre-change statistics was correlated with faster reaction times and better discrimination performance. EEG recordings revealed that the build-up rate and size of parieto-occipital (PO) potentials reflected change size and change time. Reduced effects were observed in the passive conditions. While P2 responses were comparable across conditions, slope and height of PO potentials scaled with task involvement. Neural source localization identified a parietal source as the main contributor of change-specific potentials, in addition to more limited contributions from auditory and frontal sources. In summary, the detection of statistical changes in natural acoustic textures is predominantly reflected in parietal locations both on the skull and source level. The scaling in magnitude across different levels of task involvement suggests a context-dependent degree of evidence integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Rostrocaudal Areal Patterning of Human PSC-Derived Cortical Neurons by FGF8 Signaling</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortex is subdivided into distinct areas that have particular functions. The rostrocaudal (R-C) gradient of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) signaling defines this areal identity during neural development. In this study, we recapitulated cortical R-C patterning in human pluripotent stem cell (PSC) cultures. Modulation of FGF8 signaling appropriately regulated the R-C markers, and the patterns of global gene expression resembled those of the corresponding areas of human fetal brains. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of this culture system in modeling the area-specific forebrain phenotypes (presumptive upper motor neuron (UMN) phenotypes) of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We anticipate that our culture system will contribute to studies of human neurodevelopment and neurological disease modeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Although the cerebral cortex is organized into functionally unique subdivisions or areas, the areal specification has not been studied extensively in PSC-based neurodevelopmental models. Here, we report a culture system to control the areal identity of PSC-derived cerebral cortical progenitors along the R-C axis by modulating FGF8 signaling. Treatment with FGF8 conferred rostral (the sensorimotor cortex) identity on cerebral cortical progenitors, whereas these progenitors retained caudal (the temporal lobe) identity in the absence of FGF8. By using this culture system, we succeeded in modeling area-specific forebrain phenotypes (presumptive UMN phenotypes) of ALS. This system offers a novel platform in the field of human neurodevelopment and neurologic disease modeling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Joint visual attention is characterized by two or more individuals looking at
a common target at the same time. The ability to identify joint attention in
scenes, the people involved, and their common target, is fundamental to the
understanding of social interactions, including others' intentions and goals.
In this work we deal with the extraction of joint attention events, and the use
of such events for image descriptions. The work makes two novel contributions.
First, our extraction algorithm is the first which identifies joint visual
attention in single static images. It computes 3D gaze direction, identifies
the gaze target by combining gaze direction with a 3D depth map computed for
the image, and identifies the common gaze target. Second, we use a human study
to demonstrate the sensitivity of humans to joint attention, suggesting that
the detection of such a configuration in an image can be useful for
understanding the image, including the goals of the agents and their joint
activity, and therefore can contribute to image captioning and related tasks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain computer interface is the current area of research to provide
assistance to disabled persons. To cope up with the growing needs of BCI
applications, this paper presents an automated classification scheme for
handgrip actions on objects by using Electroencephalography (EEG) data. The
presented approach focuses on investigation of classifying correct and
incorrect handgrip responses for objects by using EEG recorded patterns. The
method starts with preprocessing of data, followed by extraction of relevant
features from the epoch data in the form of discrete wavelet transform (DWT),
and entropy measures. After computing feature vectors, artificial neural
network classifiers used to classify the patterns into correct and incorrect
handgrips on different objects. The proposed method was tested on real dataset,
which contains EEG recordings from 14 persons. The results showed that the
proposed approach is effective and may be useful to develop a variety of BCI
based devices to control hand movements.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Decision making based on behavioral and neural observations of living systems
has been extensively studied in brain science, psychology, and other
disciplines. Decision-making mechanisms have also been experimentally
implemented in physical processes, such as single photons and chaotic lasers.
The findings of these experiments suggest that there is a certain common basis
in describing decision making, regardless of its physical realizations. In this
study, we propose a local reservoir model to account for choice-based learning
(CBL). CBL describes decision consistency as a phenomenon where making a
certain decision increases the possibility of making that same decision again
later, which has been intensively investigated in neuroscience, psychology,
etc. Our proposed model is inspired by the viewpoint that a decision is
affected by its local environment, which is referred to as a local reservoir.
If the size of the local reservoir is large enough, consecutive decision making
will not be affected by previous decisions, thus showing lower degrees of
decision consistency in CBL. In contrast, if the size of the local reservoir
decreases, a biased distribution occurs within it, which leads to higher
degrees of decision consistency in CBL. In this study, an analytical approach
on local reservoirs is presented, as well as several numerical demonstrations.
Furthermore, a physical architecture for CBL based on single photons is
discussed, and the effects of local reservoirs is numerically demonstrated.
Decision consistency in human decision-making tasks and in recruiting empirical
data are evaluated based on local reservoir. In summary, the proposed local
reservoir model paves a path toward establishing a foundation for computational
mechanisms and the systematic analysis of decision making on different levels.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Association Between Brain Activation and Functional Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy077</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy077/4969848?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The origin of the “resting-state” brain activity recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is still uncertain. Here we provide evidence for the neurovascular origins of the amplitude of the low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and the local functional connectivity density (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;FCD) by comparing them with task-induced blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses, which are considered a proxy for neuronal activation. Using fMRI data for 2 different tasks (Relational and Social) collected by the Human Connectome Project in 426 healthy adults, we show that ALFF and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;FCD have linear associations with the BOLD response. This association was significantly attenuated by a novel task signal regression (TSR) procedure, indicating that task performance enhances &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;FCD and ALFF in activated regions. We also show that lFCD predicts BOLD activation patterns, as was recently shown for other functional connectivity metrics, which corroborates that resting functional connectivity architecture impacts brain activation responses. Thus, our findings indicate a common source for BOLD responses, ALFF and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;FCD, which is consistent with the neurovascular origin of local hemodynamic synchrony presumably reflecting coordinated fluctuations in neuronal activity. This study also supports the development of task-evoked functional connectivity density mapping.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: MEG Working Memory N-Back Task Reveals Functional Deficits in Combat-Related Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy075</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Combat-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a leading cause of sustained cognitive impairment in military service members and Veterans. However, the mechanism of persistent cognitive deficits including working memory (WM) dysfunction is not fully understood in mTBI. Few studies of WM deficits in mTBI have taken advantage of the temporal and frequency resolution afforded by electromagnetic measurements. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and an N-back WM task, we investigated functional abnormalities in combat-related mTBI. Study participants included 25 symptomatic active-duty service members or Veterans with combat-related mTBI and 20 healthy controls with similar combat experiences. MEG source–magnitude images were obtained for alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (15–30 Hz), gamma (30–90 Hz), and low-frequency (1–7 Hz) bands. Compared with healthy combat controls, mTBI participants showed increased MEG signals across frequency bands in frontal pole (FP), ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), but decreased MEG signals in anterior cingulate cortex. Hyperactivations in FP, OFC, and anterior dlPFC were associated with slower reaction times. MEG activations in lateral FP also negatively correlated with performance on tests of letter sequencing, verbal fluency, and digit symbol coding. The profound hyperactivations from FP suggest that FP is particularly vulnerable to combat-related mTBI.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Densities and Laminar Distributions of Kv3.1b-, PV-, GABA-, and SMI-32-Immunoreactive Neurons in Macaque Area V1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy072</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The Kv3.1b potassium channel subunit is associated with narrow spike widths and fast-spiking properties. In macaque primary visual cortex (V1), subsets of neurons have previously been found to be Kv3.1b-immunoreactive (ir) but not parvalbumin (PV)-ir or not GABA-ir, suggesting that they may be both fast-spiking and excitatory. This population includes Meynert cells, the large layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons that are also labeled by the neurofilament antibody SMI-32. In the present study, triple immunofluorescence labeling and confocal microscopy were used to measure the distribution of Kv3.1b-ir, non-PV-ir, non-GABA-ir neurons across cortical depth in V1, and to determine whether, like the Meynert cells, other Kv3.1b-ir excitatory neurons were also SMI-32-ir pyramidal neurons. We found that Kv3.1b-ir, non-PV-ir, non-GABA-ir neurons were most prevalent in the M pathway-associated layers 4 Cα and 4B. GABAergic neurons accounted for a smaller fraction (11%) of the total neuronal population across layers 1–6 than has previously been reported. Of Kv3.1b-ir neurons, PV expression reliably indicated GABA expression. Kv3.1b-ir, non-PV-ir neurons varied in SMI-32 coimmunoreactivity. The results suggest the existence of a heterogeneous population of excitatory neurons in macaque V1 with the potential for sustained high firing rates, and these neurons were particularly abundant in layers 4B and 4 Cα.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain regions engaged during social inference, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and tempoparietal junction (TPJ), are also known to spontaneously engage during rest. While this overlap is well known, the social cognitive function of engaging these regions during rest remains unclear. Building on past research suggesting that new information is committed to memory during rest, we explored whether one function of MPFC and TPJ engagement during rest may be to consolidate new social information. MPFC and TPJ regions significantly increased connectivity during rest after encoding new social information (relative to baseline and post nonsocial encoding rest periods). Moreover, greater connectivity between rTPJ and MPFC, as well as other portions of the default network (vMPFC, anterior temporal lobe, and middle temporal gyrus) during post social encoding rest corresponded with superior social recognition and social associative memory. The tendency to engage MPFC and TPJ during rest may tune people towards social learning.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Distinct Interplay Between Atrophy and Hypometabolism in Alzheimer’s Versus Semantic Dementia</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Multimodal neuroimaging analyses offer additional information beyond that provided by each neuroimaging modality. Thus, direct comparisons and correlations between neuroimaging modalities allow revealing disease-specific topographic relationships. Here, we compared the topographic discrepancies between atrophy and hypometabolism in two neurodegenerative diseases characterized by distinct pathological processes, namely Alzheimer’s disease (AD) versus semantic dementia (SD), to unravel their specific influence on local and global brain structure–function relationships. We found that intermodality topographic discrepancies clearly distinguished the two patient groups: AD showed marked discrepancies between both alterations, with greater hypometabolism than atrophy in large posterior associative neocortical regions, while SD showed more topographic consistency between atrophy and hypometabolism across brain regions. These findings likely reflect the multiple pathologies versus the relatively unitary pathological process underlying AD versus SD respectively. Our results evidence that multimodal neuroimaging-derived indexes can provide clinically relevant information to discriminate the two diseases, and potentially reveal distinct neuropathological processes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Adult-Onset Hearing Impairment Induces Layer-Specific Cortical Reorganization: Evidence of Crossmodal Plasticity and Central Gain Enhancement</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Adult-onset hearing impairment can lead to hyperactivity in the auditory pathway (i.e., central gain enhancement) as well as increased cortical responsiveness to nonauditory stimuli (i.e., crossmodal plasticity). However, it remained unclear to what extent hearing loss-induced hyperactivity is relayed beyond the auditory cortex, and thus, whether central gain enhancement competes or coexists with crossmodal plasticity throughout the distinct layers of the audiovisual cortex. To that end, we investigated the effects of partial hearing loss on laminar processing in the auditory, visual and audiovisual cortices of adult rats using extracellular electrophysiological recordings performed 2 weeks after loud noise exposure. Current-source density analyses revealed that central gain enhancement was not relayed to the audiovisual cortex (V2L), and was instead restricted to the granular layer of the higher order auditory area, AuD. In contrast, crossmodal plasticity was evident across multiple cortical layers within V2L, and also manifested in AuD. Surprisingly, despite this coexistence of central gain enhancement and crossmodal plasticity, noise exposure did not disrupt the responsiveness of these neighboring cortical regions to combined audiovisual stimuli. Overall, we have shown for the first time that adult-onset hearing impairment causes a complex assortment of intramodal and crossmodal changes across the layers of higher order sensory cortices.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Microglial Pruning of Synapses in the Prefrontal Cortex During Adolescence</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Exaggerated synaptic elimination in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during adolescence has been suggested to contribute to the neuropathological changes of schizophrenia. Recent data indicate that microglia (MG) sculpt synapses during early postnatal development. However, it is not known if MG contribute to the structural maturation of the PFC, which has a protracted postnatal development. We determined if MG are involved in developmentally specific synapse elimination in the PFC, focusing on adolescence. Layer 5 PFC pyramidal cells (PCs) were intracellularly filled with Lucifer Yellow for dendritic spine measurements in postnatal day (P) 24, P30, P35, P39, and P50 rats. In the contralateral PFC we evaluated if MG engulfed presynaptic (glutamatergic) and postsynaptic (dendritic spines) elements. Dendritic spine density increased from P24 to P35, when spine density peaked. There was a significant increase in MG engulfment of spines at P39 relative to earlier ages; this subsided by P50. MG also phagocytosed presynaptic glutamatergic terminals. These data indicate that MG transiently prune synapses of PFC PCs during adolescence, when the symptoms of schizophrenia typically first appear. An increase in MG-mediated synaptic remodeling of PFC PCs may contribute to the structural changes observed in schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A complex action can be described as the composition of a set of elementary movements. While both kinematic and dynamic elements have been proposed to compose complex actions, the structure of movement decomposition and its neural representation remain unknown. Here, we examined movement decomposition by modeling the temporal dynamics of neural populations in the primary motor cortex of macaque monkeys performing forelimb reaching movements. Using a hidden Markov model, we found that global transitions in the neural population activity are associated with a consistent segmentation of the behavioral output into acceleration and deceleration epochs with directional selectivity. Single cells exhibited modulation of firing rates between the kinematic epochs, with abrupt changes in spiking activity timed with the identified transitions. These results reveal distinct encoding of acceleration and deceleration phases at the level of M1, and point to a specific pattern of movement decomposition that arises from the underlying neural activity. A similar approach can be used to probe the structure of movement decomposition in different brain regions, possibly controlling different temporal scales, to reveal the hierarchical structure of movement composition.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Truncating &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CHD8&lt;/span&gt; mutations are amongst the highest confidence risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) identified to date. Here, we report that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Chd8&lt;/span&gt; heterozygous mice display increased brain size, motor delay, hypertelorism, pronounced hypoactivity, and anomalous responses to social stimuli. Whereas gene expression in the neocortex is only mildly affected at midgestation, over 600 genes are differentially expressed in the early postnatal neocortex. Genes involved in cell adhesion and axon guidance are particularly prominent amongst the downregulated transcripts. Resting-state functional MRI identified increased synchronized activity in cortico-hippocampal and auditory-parietal networks in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Chd8&lt;/span&gt; heterozygous mutant mice, implicating altered connectivity as a potential mechanism underlying the behavioral phenotypes. Together, these data suggest that altered brain growth and diminished expression of important neurodevelopmental genes that regulate long-range brain wiring are followed by distinctive anomalies in functional brain connectivity in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Chd8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;+/&lt;/span&gt;âˆ’&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Human imaging studies have reported altered functional connectivity in ASD patients, with long-range under-connectivity seemingly more frequent. Our data suggest that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CHD8&lt;/span&gt; haploinsufficiency represents a specific subtype of ASD where neuropsychiatric symptoms are underpinned by long-range over-connectivity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Aging is accompanied by impairments in both circadian rhythmicity and long-term memory. Although it is clear that memory performance is affected by circadian cycling, it is unknown whether age-related disruption of the circadian clock causes impaired hippocampal memory. Here, we show that the repressive histone deacetylase HDAC3 restricts long-term memory, synaptic plasticity, and learning-induced expression of the circadian gene Per1 in the aging hippocampus without affecting rhythmic circadian activity patterns. We also demonstrate that hippocampal Per1 is critical for long-term memory formation. Together, our data challenge the traditional idea that alterations in the core circadian clock drive circadian-related changes in memory formation and instead argue for a more autonomous role for circadian clock gene function in hippocampal cells to gate the likelihood of long-term memory formation.</description>

	<description>Reanalyzing a large methylome dataset of 225 schizophrenic and 450 control samples derived from the prefrontal cortex revealed that 6 male patients have predominantly hypomethylated probes mostly on chromosome X, affecting the same genes in all six. Network analysis of the differentially methylated genes revealed a dense network of transcription factors, histone and chromatin remodeling proteins, with 15 of the X-located genes expressed at the synapse, including NLGN4X, SYN1 and MECP2. Mapping a recent experimental dataset of G-quadruplexes (G4s) onto the differentially methylated probes revealed that the probes in the group of six overlapping with G4s on chromosome X are significantly more hypomethylated than non-overlapping and non-X probes whereas in the rest of the patients G4-overlapping probes are more methylated than non-overlapping ones, revealing a distinct pathology, involving chromatin remodeling for the six patients. Unexpectedly, the hypomethylated genes in them significantly overlapped with gene locations where X-inactivation escapism was observed in women.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300251v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been shown to be important for learning from feedback, and biasing and invigorating behavior in response to outcome-predictive cues. NAc encodes outcome-related cue features such as the magnitude and identity of reward. However, not much is known about how features of cues themselves are encoded. We designed a decision making task where rats learned multiple sets of outcome-predictive cues, and recorded single-unit activity in the NAc during performance. We found that coding of various cue features occurred alongside coding of expected outcome. Furthermore, this coding persisted during a delay period, after the rat made a decision and was waiting for an outcome, but not after the outcome was revealed. Encoding of cue features in the NAc may enable contextual modulation of ongoing behavior, and provide an eligibility trace of outcome-predictive stimuli for updating stimulus-outcome associations to inform future behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Delta activity encodes taste information in the human brain</title>

	<description>The categorization of food via sensing nutrients or toxins is crucial to the survival of any organism. On ingestion, rapid responses within the gustatory system are required to identify the oral stimulus to guide immediate behaviour (swallowing or expulsion). The way in which the human brain accomplishes this task has so far remained unclear. Using multivariate analysis of 64-channel scalp EEG recordings obtained from 16 volunteers during tasting salty, sweet, sour, or bitter solutions, we found that activity in the delta-frequency range (1-4 Hz; delta power and phase) has information about taste identity in the human brain, with discriminable response patterns at the single-trial level within 130 ms of tasting. Importantly, the latencies of these response patterns predicted the point in time at which participants indicated detection of a taste by pressing a button. Furthermore, taste pattern discrimination was independent of motor-related activation and other taste features such as intensity and valence. On comparison with our previous findings from a passive (delayed) taste-discrimination task (Crouzet et al., 2015), taste-specific neural representations emerged earlier during this active (speeded) taste-detection task, suggesting a goal-dependent flexibility in gustatory response coding. Together, these findings provide the first evidence of a role of delta activity in taste-information coding in humans. Crucially, these neuronal response patterns can be linked to the speed of simple gustatory perceptual decisions, a vital performance index of nutrient sensing.</description>

Using family and longitudinal data from three independent samples (Ns = 1,303, 897, &amp;amp; 223) spanning childhood/adolescence to middle age (ages 11-37), we identify replicable reductions in gray matter volumes of frontal gyri, which are genetically-conferred, and prospectively predict alcohol consumption and initiation of use. Further, gene expression in the frontal cortex is replicably associated with genetic risk for alcohol consumption. Frontal volume is a promising prognostic biomarker for alcohol consumption liability.</description>

Rho-GTPases are master regulators of polarity establishment and cell morphology. Positive feedback enables concentration of Rho-GTPases into clusters at the cell cortex, from where they regulate the cytoskeleton. Different cell types reproducibly generate either one (e.g. the front of a migrating cell) or several clusters (e.g. the multiple dendrites of a neuron), but the mechanistic basis for unipolar or multipolar outcomes is unclear. The design principles of Rho-GTPase circuits are captured by two-component reaction-diffusion models based on conserved aspects of Rho-GTPase biochemistry. Some such models display rapid winner-takes-all competition between clusters, yielding a unipolar outcome. Other models allow prolonged co-existence of clusters. We investigate the behavior of a simple class of models and show that while the timescale of competition varies enormously depending on model parameters, a single factor explains a large majority of this variation. The dominant factor concerns the degree to which the maximal active GTPase concentration in a cluster approaches a “saturation point” determined by model parameters. We suggest that both saturation and the effect of saturation on competition reflect fundamental properties of the Rho-GTPase polarity machinery, regardless of the specific feedback mechanism, which predict whether the system will generate unipolar or multipolar outcomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HtPVWxk38yc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Assessing the durability and efficiency of landscape-based strategies to deploy plant resistance to pathogens</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Loup Rimbaud, Julien Papaïx, Jean-François Rey, Luke G. Barrett, Peter H. Thrall&lt;/p&gt;

Genetically-controlled plant resistance can reduce the damage caused by pathogens. However, pathogens have the ability to evolve and overcome such resistance. This often occurs quickly after resistance is deployed, resulting in significant crop losses and a continuing need to develop new resistant cultivars. To tackle this issue, several strategies have been proposed to constrain the evolution of pathogen populations and thus increase genetic resistance durability. These strategies mainly rely on varying different combinations of resistance sources across time (crop rotations) and space. The spatial scale of deployment can vary from multiple resistance sources occurring in a single cultivar (pyramiding), in different cultivars within the same field (cultivar mixtures) or in different fields (mosaics). However, experimental comparison of the efficiency (i.e. ability to reduce disease impact) and durability (i.e. ability to limit pathogen evolution and delay resistance breakdown) of landscape-scale deployment strategies presents major logistical challenges. Therefore, we developed a spatially explicit stochastic model able to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes of the four major deployment options described above, including both qualitative resistance (i.e. major genes) and quantitative resistance traits against several components of pathogen aggressiveness: infection rate, latent period duration, propagule production rate, and infectious period duration. This model, implemented in the R package &lt;i&gt;landsepi&lt;/i&gt;, provides a new and useful tool to assess the performance of a wide range of deployment options, and helps investigate the effect of landscape, epidemiological and evolutionary parameters. This article describes the model and its parameterisation for rust diseases of cereal crops, caused by fungi of the genus &lt;i&gt;Puccinia&lt;/i&gt;. To illustrate the model, we use it to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary potential of the combination of a major gene and different traits of quantitative resistance. The comparison of the four major deployment strategies described above will be the objective of future studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7LHbywjCaMk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Physics-based simulations of aerial attacks by peregrine falcons reveal that stooping at high speed maximizes catch success against agile prey</title>

The peregrine falcon &lt;i&gt;Falco peregrinus&lt;/i&gt; is renowned for attacking its prey from high altitude in a fast controlled dive called a stoop. Many other raptors employ a similar mode of attack, but the functional benefits of stooping remain obscure. Here we investigate whether, when, and why stooping promotes catch success, using a three-dimensional, agent-based modeling approach to simulate attacks of falcons on aerial prey. We simulate avian flapping and gliding flight using an analytical quasi-steady model of the aerodynamic forces and moments, parametrized by empirical measurements of flight morphology. The model-birds’ flight control inputs are commanded by their guidance system, comprising a phenomenological model of its vision, guidance, and control. To intercept its prey, model-falcons use the same guidance law as missiles (pure proportional navigation); this assumption is corroborated by empirical data on peregrine falcons hunting lures. We parametrically vary the falcon’s starting position relative to its prey, together with the feedback gain of its guidance loop, under differing assumptions regarding its errors and delay in vision and control, and for three different patterns of prey motion. We find that, when the prey maneuvers erratically, high-altitude stoops increase catch success compared to low-altitude attacks, but only if the falcon’s guidance law is appropriately tuned, and only given a high degree of precision in vision and control. Remarkably, the optimal tuning of the guidance law in our simulations coincides closely with what has been observed empirically in peregrines. High-altitude stoops are shown to be beneficial because their high airspeed enables production of higher aerodynamic forces for maneuvering, and facilitates higher roll agility as the wings are tucked, each of which is essential to catching maneuvering prey at realistic response delays.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ypEvewr7kSA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Characterising information-theoretic storage and transfer in continuous time processes. (arXiv:1804.03269v1 [cs.IT] CROSS LISTED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03269</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03269</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The characterisation of information processing is an important task in
complex systems science. Information dynamics is a quantitative methodology for
modelling the intrinsic information processing conducted by a process
represented as a time series, but to date has only been formulated in discrete
time. Building on previous work which demonstrated how to formulate transfer
entropy in continuous time, we give a total account of information processing
in this setting, incorporating information storage. We find that a convergent
rate of predictive capacity, comprised of the transfer entropy and active
information storage, does not exist, arising through divergent rates of active
information storage. We identify that active information storage can be
decomposed into two separate quantities that characterise predictive capacity
stored in a process: active memory utilisation and instantaneous predictive
capacity. The latter involves prediction related to path regularity and so
solely inherits the divergent properties of the active information storage,
whilst the former permits definitions of pathwise and rate quantities. We
formulate measures of memory utilisation for jump and neural spiking processes
and illustrate measures of information processing in synthetic neural spiking
models and coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. The application to synthetic
neural spiking models demonstrates that active memory utilisation for point
processes consists of discontinuous jump contributions (at spikes) interrupting
a continuously varying contribution (relating to waiting times between spikes),
complementing the behaviour previously demonstrated for transfer entropy in
these processes.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: An Information-Driven 2-Pathway Characterization of Occipitotemporal and Posterior Parietal Visual Object Representations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy080</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy080/4969359?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of rich visual representations in both occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Using fMRI decoding and a bottom-up data-driven approach, we showed that although robust object category representations exist in both OTC and PPC, there is an information-driven 2-pathway separation among these regions in the representational space, with occipitotemporal regions arranging hierarchically along 1 pathway and posterior parietal regions along another pathway. We obtained 10 independent replications of this 2-pathway distinction, accounting for 58–81% of the total variance of the region-wise differences in visual representation. The separation of the PPC regions from higher occipitotemporal regions was not driven by a difference in tolerance to changes in low-level visual features, did not rely on the presence of special object categories, and was present whether or not object category was task relevant. Our information-driven 2-pathway structure differs from the well-known ventral-what and dorsal-where/how characterization of posterior brain regions. Here both pathways contain rich nonspatial visual representations. The separation we see likely reflects a difference in neural coding scheme used by PPC to represent visual information compared with that of OTC.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Visual reconstruction from 2-photon calcium imaging suggests linear readout properties of neurons in mouse primary visual cortex</title>

	<description>Deciphering the neural code, that is interpreting the responses of sensory neurons from the perspective of a downstream population, is an important step towards understanding how the brain processes sensory stimulation. While previous work has focused on classification algorithms to identify the most likely stimulus label in a predefined set of categories, fewer studies have approached a full stimulus reconstruction task. Outstanding questions revolve around the type of algorithm that is most suited to decoding (i.e. full reconstruction, in the context of this study), especially in the presence of strong encoding non-linearities, and the possible role of pairwise correlations. We present, here, the first pixel-by-pixel reconstruction of a complex natural stimulus from 2-photon calcium imaging responses of mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We decoded the activity of approximately 100 neurons from layer 2/3 using an optimal linear estimator and an artificial neural network. We also investigated how much accuracy is lost in this decoding operation when ignoring pairwise neural correlations. We found that a simple linear estimator is sufficient to extract relevant stimulus features from the neural responses, and that it was not significantly outperformed by a non-linear decoding algorithm. The importance of pairwise correlations for reconstruction accuracy was also limited. The results of this study suggest that, conditional on the spatial and temporal limits of the recording technique, V1 neurons display linear readout properties, with low information content in the joint distribution of their activity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Hyper-excitability and hyper-plasticity disrupt cerebellar signal transfer in the IB2 KO mouse model of autism</title>

	<description>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are pervasive neurodevelopmental conditions that often involve mutations affecting synaptic mechanisms. Recently, the involvement of cerebellum in ASD has been suggested but the underlying functional alterations remained obscure. We investigated single-neuron and microcircuit properties in IB2 KO mice, which present a cerebellar phenotype associated with ASD. Granule cells showed a larger NMDA receptor-mediated current and enhanced intrinsic excitability raising the excitatory/inhibitory balance. Furthermore, the spatial organization of granular layer responses to mossy fibers shifted from a Mexican hat to stovepipe hat profile, with stronger excitation in the core and weaker inhibition in the surround. Finally, the size and extension of long-term synaptic plasticity was remarkably increased. These results show for the first time that hyper-excitability and hyper-plasticity disrupt signal transfer in the granular layer of IB2 KO mice supporting cerebellar involvement in the pathogenesis of ASD.</description>

	<description>The fastspiking parvalbumin expressing basketcells (FS BC) and the neurogliaform interneurons (NGF IN) innervate somatic and dendritic compartments of postsynaptic pyramidal neurons, respectively. Here we have used paired recordings of each type of interneuron with a postsynaptic pyramidal neuron in layer II-IV of the adult rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) to characterize the interneuron action potentials (AP), evoked IPSC characteristics and response to the GAT-1 inhibitor NNC 711 and the N-type Ca-channel inhibitor {omega}-conotoxin GVIA. GABA released from FS BCs were insensitive to {omega}-conotoxin GVIA (0.5 M), the postsynaptic response did not desensitize and the IPSC was unchanged in NNC 711 (2 M). Conversely, IPSCs generated by APs from NGF INs were 80 % inhibited by {omega}-conotoxin GVIA, displayed a strong degree of desensitization and the decay-time of the IPSCs doubled in NNC 711. We used these pharmacological differences to identify the source of GABA in paradigms of synaptic overspill induced by extracellular stimulation. The decaytime of the electrically evoked event doubled in NNC 711 and this increase was reversed by subsequent application of {omega}-conotoxin GVIA, suggesting that the source of GABA responding to NNC 711 originate from axons that terminate on pyramidal neuron dendrites and employ N-type Ca-channels for release.</description>

	<description>The transcription factor NeuroD2 is a recent candidate for neuropsychiatric disorders but its impact in cortical networks and associated behaviors remains unknown. Here we show that in the mouse neocortex, NeuroD2 is restricted to pyramidal neurons, from development to adulthood. In NeuroD2 deficient mice, layer 5 pyramidal neurons of motor area displayed reduced dendritic complexity and reduced spine density. In contrast, production, radial migration, laminar organization and axonal target specificity of pyramidal neurons were normal, revealing a synaptopathy phenotype. Electrophysiologically, intrinsic excitability and inhibitory inputs onto pyramidal neurons were increased. Behaviorally, NeuroD2 homozygous and heterozygous mice exhibited normal interest and memory for objects but altered sociability and social memory, stereotypies, spontaneous epilepsy and hyperactivity. RNA sequencing from microdissected neocortex revealed that NeuroD2 target genes are highly associated with in cell intrinsic excitability, synaptic regulation, autism and schizophrenia. These results strongly reinforce the potential implication of NeuroD2 mutations in human neuropsychiatric disorders.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Topology of Functional Connectivity and Hub Dynamics in the Beta Band As Temporal Prior for Natural Vision in the Human Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3858?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3858?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Networks hubs represent points of convergence for the integration of information across many different nodes and systems. Although a great deal is known on the topology of hub regions in the human brain, little is known about their temporal dynamics. Here, we examine the static and dynamic centrality of hub regions when measured in the absence of a task (rest) or during the observation of natural or synthetic visual stimuli. We used Magnetoencephalography (MEG) in humans (both sexes) to measure static and transient regional and network-level interaction in α- and β-band limited power (BLP) in three conditions: visual fixation (rest), viewing of movie clips (natural vision), and time-scrambled versions of the same clips (scrambled vision). Compared with rest, we observed in both movie conditions a robust decrement of α-BLP connectivity. Moreover, both movie conditions caused a significant reorganization of connections in the α band, especially between networks. In contrast, β-BLP connectivity was remarkably similar between rest and natural vision. Not only the topology did not change, but the joint dynamics of hubs in a core network during natural vision was predicted by similar fluctuations in the resting state. We interpret these findings by suggesting that slow-varying fluctuations of integration occurring in higher-order regions in the β band may be a mechanism to anticipate and predict slow-varying temporal patterns of the visual environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A fundamental question in neuroscience concerns the function of spontaneous brain connectivity. Here, we tested the hypothesis that topology of intrinsic brain connectivity and its dynamics might predict those observed during natural vision. Using MEG, we tracked the static and time-varying brain functional connectivity when observers were either fixating or watching different movie clips. The spatial distribution of connections and the dynamics of centrality of a set of regions were similar during rest and movie in the β band, but not in the α band. These results support the hypothesis that the intrinsic β-rhythm integration occurs with a similar temporal structure during natural vision, possibly providing advanced information about incoming stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: BMP-Responsive Protease HtrA1 Is Differentially Expressed in Astrocytes and Regulates Astrocytic Development and Injury Response</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes perform a wide array of physiological functions, including structural support, ion exchange, and neurotransmitter uptake. Despite this diversity, molecular markers that label subpopulations of astrocytes are limited, and mechanisms that generate distinct astrocyte subtypes remain unclear. Here we identified serine protease high temperature requirement A 1 (HtrA1), a bone morphogenetic protein 4 signaling regulated protein, as a novel marker of forebrain astrocytes, but not of neural stem cells, in adult mice of both sexes. Genetic deletion of HtrA1 during gliogenesis accelerates astrocyte differentiation. In addition, ablation of HtrA1 in cultured astrocytes leads to altered chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan expression and inhibition of neurite extension, along with elevated levels of transforming growth factor-β family proteins. Brain injury induces HtrA1 expression in reactive astrocytes, and loss of HtrA1 leads to an impairment in wound closure accompanied by increased proliferation of endothelial and immune cells. Our findings demonstrate that HtrA1 is differentially expressed in adult mouse forebrain astrocytes, and that HtrA1 plays important roles in astrocytic development and injury response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Astrocytes, an abundant cell type in the brain, perform a wide array of physiological functions. Although characterized as morphologically and functionally diverse, molecular markers that label astrocyte subtypes or signaling pathways that lead to their diversity remain limited. Here, after examining the expression profile of astrocytes generated in response to bone morphogenetic protein signaling, we identify high temperature requirement A 1 (HtrA1) as an astrocyte-specific marker that is differentially expressed in distinct adult mouse brain regions. HtrA1 is a serine protease that has been linked to cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, a small blood vessel disease in humans. Understanding the role of HtrA1 during development and after injury will provide insights into how distinct astrocyte populations are generated and their unique roles in injury and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: ACC to Dorsal Medial Striatum Inputs Modulate Histaminergic Itch Sensation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3823?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Itch is an unpleasant sensation that initiates scratching behavior. The itch–scratch reaction is a complex phenomenon that implicates supraspinal structures required for regulation of sensory, emotional, cognitive, and motivational aspects. However, the central mechanisms underlying the processing of itch and the interplay of the supraspinal regions and spinal cord in regulating itch–scratch processes are poorly understood. Here, we have shown that the neural projections from anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to dorsal medial striatum (DMS) constitute a critical circuit element for regulating itch-related behaviors in the brains of male C57BL/6J mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that ACC-DMS projections selectively modulate histaminergic, but not nonhistaminergic, itch-related behavior. Furthermore, photoactivation of ACC-DMS projections has also no significant effects on pain behavior induced by thermal, mechanical, and chemical stimuli except for a relief on inflammatory pain evoked by formalin and complete Freund's adjuvant. We further demonstrate that the dorsal spinal cord exerts an inhibitory effect on itch signal from ACC-DMS projections through B5-I neurons, which represent a population of spinal inhibitory interneurons that mediate the inhibition of itch. Therefore, this study presents the first evidence that the ACC-DMS projections modulate histaminergic itch-related behavior and reveals an interplay between the supraspinal and spinal levels in histaminergic itch regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study reveals that the projections from anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to dorsal medial striatum (DMS) constitute a supraspinal circuit for modulation of histaminergic, but not nonhistaminergic, itch. Manipulation of ACC-DMS projections has no effect on acute pain sensation. Furthermore, the dorsal spinal cord exerts an inhibitory effect on itch signal from ACC-DMS projections through B5-I neurons. Understanding the supraspinal itch circuits is of great significance in the development of new therapies for chronic itch-related intractable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Autophagy Enhances Memory Erasure through Synaptic Destabilization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3809?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is substantial interest in memory reconsolidation as a target for the treatment of anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. However, its applicability is restricted by reconsolidation-resistant boundary conditions that constrain the initial memory destabilization. In this study, we investigated whether the induction of synaptic protein degradation through autophagy modulation, a major protein degradation pathway, can enhance memory destabilization upon retrieval and whether it can be used to overcome these conditions. Here, using male mice in an auditory fear reconsolidation model, we showed that autophagy contributes to memory destabilization and its induction can be used to enhance erasure of a reconsolidation-resistant auditory fear memory that depended on AMPAR endocytosis. Using male mice in a contextual fear reconsolidation model, autophagy induction in the amygdala or in the hippocampus enhanced fear or contextual memory destabilization, respectively. The latter correlated with AMPAR degradation in the spines of the contextual memory-ensemble cells. Using male rats in an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; LTP reconsolidation model, autophagy induction enhanced synaptic destabilization in an NMDAR-dependent manner. These data indicate that induction of synaptic protein degradation can enhance both synaptic and memory destabilization upon reactivation and that autophagy inducers have the potential to be used as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It has been reported that inhibiting synaptic protein degradation prevents memory destabilization. However, whether the reverse relation is true and whether it can be used to enhance memory destabilization are still unknown. Here we addressed this question on the behavioral, molecular, and synaptic levels, and showed that induction of autophagy, a major protein degradation pathway, can enhance memory and synaptic destabilization upon reactivation. We also show that autophagy induction can be used to overcome a reconsolidation-resistant memory, suggesting autophagy inducers as a potential therapeutic tool in the treatment of anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: EEG Correlates of Preparatory Orienting, Contextual Updating, and Inhibition of Sensory Processing in Left Spatial Neglect</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3792?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3792?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Studies with event-related potentials have highlighted deficits in the early phases of orienting to left visual targets in right-brain-damaged patients with left spatial neglect (N+). However, brain responses associated with preparatory orienting of attention, with target novelty and with the detection of a match/mismatch between expected and actual targets (contextual updating), have not been explored in N+. Here in a study in healthy humans and brain-damaged patients of both sexes we demonstrate that frontal activity that reflects supramodal mechanisms of attentional orienting (Anterior Directing Attention Negativity, ADAN) is entirely spared in N+. In contrast, posterior responses that mark the early phases of cued orienting (Early Directing Attention Negativity, EDAN) and the setting up of sensory facilitation over the visual cortex (Late Directing Attention Positivity, LDAP) are suppressed in N+. This uncoupling is associated with damage of parietal-frontal white matter. N+ also exhibit exaggerated novelty reaction to targets in the right side of space and reduced novelty reaction for those in the left side (P3a) together with impaired contextual updating (P3b) in the left space. Finally, we highlight a drop in the amplitude and latency of the P1 that over the left hemisphere signals the early blocking of sensory processing in the right space when targets occur in the left one: this identifies a new electrophysiological marker of the rightward attentional bias in N+. The heterogeneous effects and spatial biases produced by localized brain damage on the different phases of attentional processing indicate relevant functional independence among their underlying neural mechanisms and improve the understanding of the spatial neglect syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our investigation answers important questions: are the different components of preparatory orienting (EDAN, ADAN, LDAP) functionally independent in the healthy brain? Is preparatory orienting of attention spared in left spatial neglect? Does the sparing of preparatory orienting have an impact on deficits in reflexive orienting and in the assignment of behavioral relevance to the left space? We show that supramodal preparatory orienting in frontal areas is entirely spared in neglect patients though this does not counterbalance deficits in preparatory parietal-occipital activity, reflexive orienting, and contextual updating. This points at relevant functional dissociations among different components of attention and suggests that improving voluntary attention in N+ might be behaviorally ineffective unless associated with stimulations boosting the response of posterior parietal-occipital areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Electrophysiological Evidence for the Development of a Self-Sustained Large-Scale Epileptic Network in the Kainate Mouse Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3776?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3776?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most research on focal epilepsy focuses on mechanisms of seizure generation in the primary epileptic focus (EF). However, neurological deficits that are not directly linked to seizure activity and that may persist after focus removal are frequent. The recruitment of remote brain regions of an epileptic network (EN) is recognized as a possible cause, but a profound lack of experimental evidence exists concerning their recruitment and the type of pathological activities they exhibit. We studied the development of epileptic activities at the large-scale in male mice of the kainate model of unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy using high-density surface EEG and multiple-site intracortical recordings. We show that, along with focal spikes and fast ripples that remain localized to the injected hippocampus (i.e., the EF), a subpopulation of spikes that propagate across the brain progressively emerges even before the expression of seizures. The spatiotemporal propagation of these generalized spikes (GSs) is highly stable within and across animals, defining a large-scale EN comprising both hippocampal regions and frontal cortices. Interestingly, GSs are often concomitant with muscular twitches. In addition, while fast ripples are, as expected, highly frequent in the EF, they also emerge in remote cortical regions and in particular in frontal regions where GSs propagate. Finally, we demonstrate that these remote interictal activities are dependent on the focus in the early phase of the disease but continue to be expressed after focus silencing at later stages. Our results provide evidence that neuronal networks outside the initial focus are progressively altered during epileptogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It has long been held that the epileptic focus is responsible for triggering seizures and driving interictal activities. However, focal epilepsies are associated with heterogeneous symptoms, calling into question the concept of a strictly focal disease. Using the mouse model of hippocampal sclerosis, this work demonstrates that focal epilepsy leads to the development of pathological activities specific to the epileptic condition, notably fast ripples, that appear outside of the primary epileptic focus. Whereas these activities are dependent on the focus early in the disease, focus silencing fails to control them in the chronic stage. Thus, dynamical changes specific to the epileptic condition are built up outside of the epileptic focus along with disease progression, which provides supporting evidence for network alterations in focal epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex Is Necessary for Normal Associative Inference and Memory Integration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3767?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to flexibly combine existing knowledge in response to novel circumstances is highly adaptive. However, the neural correlates of flexible associative inference are not well characterized. Laboratory tests of associative inference have measured memory for overlapping pairs of studied items (e.g., AB, BC) and for nonstudied pairs with common associates (i.e., AC). Findings from functional neuroimaging and neuropsychology suggest the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) may be necessary for associative inference. Here, we used a neuropsychological approach to test the necessity of vmPFC for successful memory-guided associative inference in humans using an overlapping pairs associative memory task. We predicted that individuals with focal vmPFC damage (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 5; 3F, 2M) would show impaired inferential memory but intact non-inferential memory. Performance was compared with normal comparison participants (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 10; 6F, 4M). Participants studied pairs of visually presented objects including overlapping pairs (AB, BC) and nonoverlapping pairs (XY). Participants later completed a three-alternative forced-choice recognition task for studied pairs (AB, BC, XY) and inference pairs (AC). As predicted, the vmPFC group had intact memory for studied pairs but significantly impaired memory for inferential pairs. These results are consistent with the perspective that the vmPFC is necessary for memory-guided associative inference, indicating that the vmPFC is critical for adaptive abilities that require application of existing knowledge to novel circumstances. Additionally, vmPFC damage was associated with unexpectedly reduced memory for AB pairs post-inference, which could potentially reflect retroactive interference. Together, these results reinforce an emerging understanding of a role for the vmPFC in brain networks supporting associative memory processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We live in a constantly changing environment, so the ability to adapt our knowledge to support understanding of new circumstances is essential. One important adaptive ability is &lt;i&gt;associative inference&lt;/i&gt; which allows us to extract shared features from distinct experiences and relate them. For example, if we see a woman holding a baby, and later see a man holding the same baby, then we might infer that the two adults are a couple. Despite the importance of associative inference, the brain systems necessary for this ability are not known. Here, we report that damage to human ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) disproportionately impairs associative inference. Our findings show the necessity of the vmPFC for normal associative inference and memory integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Convergence and Divergence of CRH Amacrine Cells in Mouse Retinal Circuitry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3753?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory interneurons sculpt the outputs of excitatory circuits to expand the dynamic range of information processing. In mammalian retina, &amp;gt;30 types of amacrine cells provide lateral inhibition to vertical, excitatory bipolar cell circuits, but functional roles for only a few amacrine cells are well established. Here, we elucidate the function of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-expressing amacrine cells labeled in Cre-transgenic mice of either sex. CRH cells costratify with the ON alpha ganglion cell, a neuron highly sensitive to positive contrast. Electrophysiological and optogenetic analyses demonstrate that two CRH types (CRH-1 and CRH-3) make GABAergic synapses with ON alpha cells. CRH-1 cells signal via graded membrane potential changes, whereas CRH-3 cells fire action potentials. Both types show sustained ON-type responses to positive contrast over a range of stimulus conditions. Optogenetic control of transmission at CRH-1 synapses demonstrates that these synapses are tuned to low temporal frequencies, maintaining GABA release during fast hyperpolarizations during brief periods of negative contrast. CRH amacrine cell output is suppressed by prolonged negative contrast, when ON alpha ganglion cells continue to receive inhibitory input from converging OFF-pathway amacrine cells; the converging ON- and OFF-pathway inhibition balances tonic excitatory drive to ON alpha cells. Previously, it was demonstrated that CRH-1 cells inhibit firing by suppressed-by-contrast (SbC) ganglion cells during positive contrast. Therefore, divergent outputs of CRH-1 cells inhibit two ganglion cell types with opposite responses to positive contrast. The opposing responses of ON alpha and SbC ganglion cells are explained by differing excitation/inhibition balance in the two circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A goal of neuroscience research is to explain the function of neural circuits at the level of specific cell types. Here, we studied the function of specific types of inhibitory interneurons, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) amacrine cells, in the mouse retina. Genetic tools were used to identify and manipulate CRH cells, which make GABAergic synapses with a well studied ganglion cell type, the ON alpha cell. CRH cells converge with other types of amacrine cells to tonically inhibit ON alpha cells and balance their high level of excitation. CRH cells diverge to different types of ganglion cell, the unique properties of which depend on their balance of excitation and inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Role of the Mechanotransduction Ion Channel Candidate Nanchung-Inactive in Auditory Transduction in an Insect Ear</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Insect auditory receivers provide an excellent comparative resource to understand general principles of auditory transduction, but analysis of the electrophysiological properties of the auditory neurons has been hampered by their tiny size and inaccessibility. Here we pioneer patch-clamp recordings from the auditory neurons of Müller's organ of the desert locust &lt;i&gt;Schistocerca gregaria&lt;/i&gt; to characterize dendritic spikes, axonal spikes, and the transduction current. We demonstrate that dendritic spikes, elicited by sound stimuli, trigger axonal spikes, and that both types are sodium and voltage dependent and blocked by TTX. Spontaneous discrete depolarizations summate upon acoustic stimulation to produce a graded transduction potential that in turn elicits the dendritic spikes. The transduction current of Group III neurons of Müller's organ, which are broadly tuned to 3 kHz, is blocked by three ion channel blockers (FM1-43, streptomycin, and 2-APB) that are known to block mechanotransduction channels. We investigated the contribution of the candidate mechanotransduction ion channel Nanchung-Inactive—which is expressed in Müller's organ—to the transduction current. A specific agonist of Nanchung-Inactive, pymetrozine, eliminates the sound-evoked transduction current while inducing a tonic depolarizing current of comparable amplitude. The Nanchung-Inactive ion channels, therefore, have the required conductance to carry the entire transduction current, and sound stimulation appears not to open any additional channels. The application of three mechanotransduction ion channel blockers prevented the pymetrozine-induced depolarizing current. This implies that either Nanchung-Inactive is, or forms part of, the mechanotransduction ion channel or it amplifies a relatively small current (&amp;lt;30 pA) produced by another mechanotransduction ion channel such as NompC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mechanically activated ion channel underpinning hearing is not known. We have pioneered intracellular patch-clamp recordings from locust auditory neurons to unravel the role of the candidate mechanotransduction ion channel Nanchung-Inactive in auditory transduction in insects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Regulation of Nociceptive Glutamatergic Signaling by Presynaptic Kv3.4 Channels in the Rat Spinal Dorsal Horn</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Presynaptic voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (Kv) channels in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons are thought to regulate nociceptive synaptic transmission in the spinal dorsal horn. However, the Kv channel subtypes responsible for this critical role have not been identified. The Kv3.4 channel is particularly important because it is robustly expressed in DRG nociceptors, where it regulates action potential (AP) duration. Furthermore, Kv3.4 dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain in multiple pain models. We hypothesized that, through their ability to modulate AP repolarization, Kv3.4 channels in DRG nociceptors help to regulate nociceptive synaptic transmission. To test this hypothesis, we investigated Kv3.4 immunoreactivity (IR) in the rat cervical superficial dorsal horn (sDH) in both sexes and implemented an intact spinal cord preparation to investigate glutamatergic synaptic currents from second order neurons in the sDH under conditions that selectively inhibit the Kv3.4 current. We found presynaptic Kv3.4 IR in peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptive fibers of the sDH. The Kv3.4 channel is hypersensitive to 4-aminopyridine and tetraethylammonium (TEA). Accordingly, 50 μm 4-aminopyridine and 500 μm TEA significantly prolong the AP, slow the maximum rate of repolarization in small-diameter DRG neurons, and potentiate monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in dorsal horn laminae I and II through a presynaptic mechanism. In contrast, highly specific inhibitors of BK, Kv7, and Kv1 channels are less effective modulators of the AP and have little to no effect on EPSCs. The results strongly suggest that presynaptic Kv3.4 channels are major regulators of nociceptive synaptic transmission in the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Intractable neuropathic pain can result from disease or traumatic injury and many studies have been conducted to determine the underlying pathophysiological changes. Voltage-gated ion channels, including the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel Kv3.4, are dysregulated in multiple pain models. Kv3.4 channels are ubiquitously expressed in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), where they are major regulators of DRG excitability. However, little is known about the ionic mechanisms that regulate nociceptive synaptic transmission at the level of the first synapse in the spinal cord, which is critical to pain transmission in both intact and pathological states. Here, we show that Kv3.4 channels have a significant impact on glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the dorsal horn, further illuminating its potential as a molecular pain therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: JIP1-Mediated JNK Activation Negatively Regulates Synaptic Plasticity and Spatial Memory</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal transduction pathway is implicated in learning and memory. Here, we examined the role of JNK activation mediated by the JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1) scaffold protein. We compared male wild-type mice with a mouse model harboring a point mutation in the &lt;i&gt;Jip1&lt;/i&gt; gene that selectively blocks JIP1-mediated JNK activation. These male mutant mice exhibited increased NMDAR currents, increased NMDAR-mediated gene expression, and a lower threshold for induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation. The JIP1 mutant mice also displayed improved hippocampus-dependent spatial memory and enhanced associative fear conditioning. These results were confirmed using a second JIP1 mutant mouse model that suppresses JNK activity. Together, these observations establish that JIP1-mediated JNK activation contributes to the regulation of hippocampus-dependent, NMDAR-mediated synaptic plasticity and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The results of this study demonstrate that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation induced by the JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1) scaffold protein negatively regulates the threshold for induction of long-term synaptic plasticity through the NMDA-type glutamate receptor. This change in plasticity threshold influences learning. Indeed, mice with defects in JIP1-mediated JNK activation display enhanced memory in hippocampus-dependent tasks, such as contextual fear conditioning and Morris water maze, indicating that JIP1-JNK constrains spatial memory. This study identifies JIP1-mediated JNK activation as a novel molecular pathway that negatively regulates NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Functional MRI Responses to Passive, Active, and Observed Touch in Somatosensory and Insular Cortices of the Macaque Monkey</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3689?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurophysiological data obtained in primates suggests that merely observing others' actions can modulate activity in the observer's motor cortices. In humans, it has been suggested that these multimodal vicarious responses extend well beyond the motor cortices, including somatosensory and insular brain regions, which seem to yield vicarious responses when witnessing others' actions, sensations, or emotions (Gazzola and Keysers, 2009). Despite the wealth of data with respect to shared action responses in the monkey motor system, whether the somatosensory and insular cortices also yield vicarious responses during observation of touch remains largely unknown. Using independent tactile and motor fMRI localizers, we first mapped the hand representations of two male monkeys' primary (SI) and secondary (SII) somatosensory cortices. In two subsequent visual experiments, we examined fMRI brain responses to (1) observing a conspecific's hand being touched or (2) observing a human hand grasping or mere touching an object or another human hand. Whereas functionally defined &quot;tactile SI&quot; and &quot;tactile SII&quot; showed little involvement in representing observed touch, vicarious responses for touch were found in parietal area PFG, consistent with recent observations in humans (Chan and Baker, 2015). Interestingly, a more anterior portion of SII, and posterior insular cortex, both of which responded when monkeys performed active grasping movements, also yielded visual responses during different instances of touch observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Common coding of one's own and others' actions, sensations, and emotions seems to be widespread in the brain. Although it is currently unclear to what extent human somatosensory cortices yield vicarious responses when observing touch, even less is known about the presence of similar vicarious responses in monkey somatosensory cortex. We therefore localized monkey somatosensory hand representations using fMRI and investigated whether these regions yield vicarious responses while observing various instances of touch. Whereas &quot;tactile SI and SII&quot; did not elicit responses during touch observation, a more anterior portion of SII, in addition to area PFG and posterior insular cortex, all of which responded during monkeys' own grasping movements, yielded vicarious responses during observed touch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: SIRT1 Deacetylates Tau and Reduces Pathogenic Tau Spread in a Mouse Model of Tauopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3680?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hyperacetylation of tau has been implicated in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in tauopathy brains. The nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide-dependent class-III protein deacetylase SIRT1 is one of the major enzymes involved in removal of acetyl groups from tau &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. However, whether SIRT1 regulates acetylation of pathogenic tau and ameliorates tau-mediated pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we report deacetylating activity of SIRT1 for acetylated Lys174 (K174) of tau in tauP301S transgenic mice with a brain-specific SIRT1 deletion. We show that SIRT1 deficiency leads to exacerbation of premature mortality, synapse loss, and behavioral disinhibition in tauP301S transgenic mice of both sexes. By contrast, SIRT1 overexpression by stereotaxic delivery of adeno-associated virus that encodes SIRT1 into the hippocampus reduces acetylated K174 tau. Furthermore, SIRT1 overexpression significantly attenuates the spread of tau pathology into anatomically connected brain regions of tauP301S transgenic mice of both sexes. These findings suggest the functional importance of SIRT1 in regulating pathogenic tau acetylation and in suppressing the spread of tau pathology &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In neurodegenerative disorders with inclusions of microtubule-associated protein tau, aberrant lysine acetylation of tau plays critical roles in promoting tau accumulation and toxicity. Identifying strategies to deacetylate tau could interfere with disease progression; however, little is known about how pathogenic tau is deacetylated &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here we show that the protein deacetylase SIRT1 reduces tau acetylation in a mouse model of neurodegeneration. SIRT1 deficiency in the brain aggravates synapse loss and behavioral disinhibition, and SIRT1 overexpression ameliorates propagation of tau pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Bilateral Tactile Input Patterns Decoded at Comparable Levels But Different Time Scales in Neocortical Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3669?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The presence of contralateral tactile input can profoundly affect ipsilateral tactile perception, and unilateral stroke in somatosensory areas can result in bilateral tactile deficits, suggesting that bilateral tactile integration is an important part of brain function. Although previous studies have shown that bilateral tactile inputs exist and that there are neural interactions between inputs from the two sides, no previous study explored to what extent the local neuronal circuitry processing contains detailed information about the nature of the tactile input from the two sides. To address this question, we used a recently introduced approach to deliver a set of electrical, reproducible, tactile afferent, spatiotemporal activation patterns, which permits a high-resolution analysis of the neuronal decoding capacity, to the skin of the second forepaw digits of the anesthetized male rat. Surprisingly, we found that individual neurons of the primary somatosensory can decode contralateral and ipsilateral input patterns to comparable extents. Although the contralateral input was stronger and more rapidly decoded, given sufficient poststimulus processing time, ipsilateral decoding levels essentially caught up to contralateral levels. Moreover, there was a weak but significant correlation for neurons with high decoding performance for contralateral tactile input to also perform well on decoding ipsilateral input. Our findings shed new light on the brain mechanisms underlying bimanual haptic integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we demonstrate that the spiking activity of single neocortical neurons in the somatosensory cortex of the rat can be used to decode patterned tactile stimuli delivered to the distal ventral skin of the second forepaw digits on both sides of the body. Even though comparable levels of decoding of the tactile input were achieved faster for contralateral input, given sufficient integration time each neuron was found to decode ipsilateral input with a comparable level of accuracy. Given that the neocortical neurons could decode ipsilateral inputs with such small differences between the patterns suggests that S1 cortex has access to very precise information about ipsilateral events. The findings shed new light on possible network mechanisms underlying bimanual haptic processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Human V4 Activity Patterns Predict Behavioral Performance in Imagery of Object Color</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Color is special among basic visual features in that it can form a defining part of objects that are engrained in our memory. Whereas most neuroimaging research on human color vision has focused on responses related to external stimulation, the present study investigated how sensory-driven color vision is linked to subjective color perception induced by object imagery. We recorded fMRI activity in male and female volunteers during viewing of abstract color stimuli that were red, green, or yellow in half of the runs. In the other half we asked them to produce mental images of colored, meaningful objects (such as tomato, grapes, banana) corresponding to the same three color categories. Although physically presented color could be decoded from all retinotopically mapped visual areas, only hV4 allowed predicting colors of imagined objects when classifiers were trained on responses to physical colors. Importantly, only neural signal in hV4 was predictive of behavioral performance in the color judgment task on a trial-by-trial basis. The commonality between neural representations of sensory-driven and imagined object color and the behavioral link to neural representations in hV4 identifies area hV4 as a perceptual hub linking externally triggered color vision with color in self-generated object imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans experience color not only when visually exploring the outside world, but also in the absence of visual input, for example when remembering, dreaming, and during imagery. It is not known where neural codes for sensory-driven and internally generated hue converge. In the current study we evoked matching subjective color percepts, one driven by physically presented color stimuli, the other by internally generated color imagery. This allowed us to identify area hV4 as the only site where neural codes of corresponding subjective color perception converged regardless of its origin. Color codes in hV4 also predicted behavioral performance in an imagery task, suggesting it forms a perceptual hub for color perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Deletion of the Cold Thermoreceptor TRPM8 Increases Heat Loss and Food Intake Leading to Reduced Body Temperature and Obesity in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3643?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The coupling of energy homeostasis to thermoregulation is essential to maintain homeothermy in changing external environments. We studied the role of the cold thermoreceptor TRPM8 in this interplay in mice of both sexes. We demonstrate that TRPM8 is required for a precise thermoregulation in response to cold, in fed and fasting. &lt;i&gt;Trpm8&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited a fall of 0.7°C in core body temperature when housed at cold temperatures, and a deep hypothermia (&amp;lt;30°C) during food deprivation. In both situations, TRPM8 deficiency induced an increase in tail heat loss. This, together with the presence of TRPM8-sensory fibers innervating the main tail vessels, unveils a major role of this ion channel in tail vasomotor regulation. Finally, TRPM8 deficiency had a remarkable impact on energy balance. &lt;i&gt;Trpm8&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice raised at mild cold temperatures developed late-onset obesity and metabolic dysfunction, with daytime hyperphagia and reduction of fat oxidation as plausible causal factors. In conclusion, TRPM8 fine-tunes eating behavior and fuel utilization during thermoregulatory adjustments to mild cold. Persistent imbalances in these responses result in obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The thermosensitive ion channel TRPM8 is required for a precise thermoregulatory response to cold and fasting, playing an important role in tail vasoconstriction, and therefore heat conservation, as well as in the regulation of ingestive behavior and metabolic fuel selection upon cooling. Indeed, TRPM8-deficient mice, housed in a mild cold environment, displayed an increase in tail heat loss and lower core body temperature, associated with the development of late-onset obesity with glucose and lipid metabolic dysfunction. A persistent diurnal hyperphagia and reduced fat oxidation constitute plausible underlying mechanisms in the background of a deficient thermoregulatory adjustment to mild cold ambient temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activity-Dependent Myelination of Parvalbumin Interneurons Mediated by Axonal Morphological Plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3631?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3631?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Axonal myelination of neocortical pyramidal neurons is modulated dynamically by neuronal activity. Recent studies have shown that a substantial proportion of neocortical myelin content is contributed by fast-spiking, parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons. However, it remains unknown whether the myelination of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons is also modulated by intrinsic activity. Here, we used cell-type-specific Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) in adult mice to activate a sparse population of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons. Using single-cell axonal reconstructions, we found that DREADD-stimulated PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons exhibited a nearly two-fold increase in total length of myelination, predominantly mediated by a parallel increase of axonal arborization and number of internodes. In contrast, the distribution of axonal interbranch segment distance and myelin internode length were not altered significantly. Topographical analysis revealed that myelination of DREADD-stimulated cells extended to higher axonal branch orders while retaining a similar interbranch distance threshold for myelination. Together, our results demonstrate that chemogenetically induced neuronal activity increases the myelination of neocortical PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons mediated at least in part by an elaboration of their axonal morphology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Myelination is the wrapping of an axon to optimize conduction velocity in an energy-efficient manner. Previous studies have shown that myelination of neocortical pyramidal neurons is experience and activity dependent. We now show that activity-dependent myelin plasticity in the adult neocortex extends to parvalbumin (PV)-expressing fast-spiking interneurons. Chemogenetic stimulation of PV interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) significantly enhanced axonal myelination, which was paralleled by an increase in axonal arborization. This suggests that activity-dependent axonal plasticity may involve changes in both structural morphology and myelination. Such multicomponent plasticity reveals an unexpected repertoire of anatomical parameters available for optimizing and adapting neuronal networks in response to experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Filter Based Phase Shifts Distort Neuronal Timing Information</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Filters are widely used for the modulation, typically attenuation, of amplitudes of different frequencies within neurophysiological signals. Filters, however, also induce changes in the phases of different frequencies whose amplitude is unmodulated. These phase shifts cause time lags in the filtered signals, leading to a disruption of the timing information between different frequencies within the same signal and between different signals. The emerging time lags can be either constant in the case of linear phase (LP) filters, or vary as a function of the frequency in the more common case of non-linear phase (NLP) filters. Since filters are used ubiquitously online in the early stages of data acquisition, the vast majority of neurophysiological signals thus suffer from distortion of the timing information even prior to their sampling. This distortion is often exacerbated by further multiple offline filtering stages of the sampled signal. The distortion of timing information may cause misinterpretation of the results and lead to erroneous conclusions. Here we present a variety of typical examples of filter-induced phase distortions and discuss the evaluation and restoration of the timing information underlying the original signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Filters are a common tool used in the processing of neuronal signals. In addition to their effect on the amplitude of different frequencies, filters also have a significant impact on their phases, which results in the distortion of the underlying timing information. This distortion, which arises by the online filters used in most neurophysiological systems and is exacerbated by further offline filtering, may cause severe misinterpretation of the results and lead to false conclusions. This manuscript presents different cases in which the timing information is disrupted and discusses the evaluation and correction of the underlying phase shifts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Information transmission in the human brain is a fundamentally dynamic
network process. In partial epilepsy, this process is perturbed and highly
synchronous seizures originate in a local network, the so-called epileptogenic
zone (EZ), before recruiting other close or distant brain regions. We studied
patient-specific brain network models of 15 drug-resistant epilepsy patients
with implanted stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes. Each
personalized brain model was derived from structural data of magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor weighted imaging (DTI), comprising 88 nodes
equipped with region specific neural mass models capable of demonstrating a
range of epileptiform discharges. Each patients virtual brain was further
personalized through the integration of the clinically hypothesized EZ.
Subsequent simulations and connectivity modulations were performed and
uncovered a finite repertoire of seizure propagation patterns. Across patients,
we found that (i) patient-specific network connectivity is predictive for the
subsequent seizure propagation pattern; (ii)seizure propagation is
characterized by a systematic sequence of brain states; (iii) propagation can
be controlled by an optimal intervention on the connectivity matrix; (iv) the
degree of invasiveness can be significantly reduced via the here proposed
seizure control as compared to traditional resective surgery. To stop seizures,
neurosurgeons typically resect the EZ completely. We showed that stability
analysis of the network dynamics using graph theoretical metrics estimates
reliably the spatiotemporal properties of seizure propagation. This suggests
novel less invasive paradigms of surgical interventions to treat and manage
partial epilepsy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Efficient brain simulation is a scientific grand challenge, a
parallel/distributed coding challenge and a source of requirements and
suggestions for future computing architectures. Indeed, the human brain
includes about 10^15 synapses and 10^11 neurons activated at a mean rate of
several Hz. Full brain simulation poses Exascale challenges even if simulated
at the highest abstraction level. The WaveScalES experiment in the Human Brain
Project (HBP) has the goal of matching experimental measures and simulations of
slow waves during deep-sleep and anesthesia and the transition to other brain
states. The focus is the development of dedicated large-scale
parallel/distributed simulation technologies. The ExaNeSt project designs an
ARM-based, low-power HPC architecture scalable to million of cores, developing
a dedicated scalable interconnect system, and SWA/AW simulations are included
among the driving benchmarks. At the joint between both projects is the INFN
proprietary Distributed and Plastic Spiking Neural Networks (DPSNN) simulation
engine. DPSNN can be configured to stress either the networking or the
computation features available on the execution platforms. The simulation
stresses the networking component when the neural net - composed by a
relatively low number of neurons, each one projecting thousands of synapses -
is distributed over a large number of hardware cores. When growing the number
of neurons per core, the computation starts to be the dominating component for
short range connections. This paper reports about preliminary performance
results obtained on an ARM-based HPC prototype developed in the framework of
the ExaNeSt project. Furthermore, a comparison is given of instantaneous power,
total energy consumption, execution time and energetic cost per synaptic event
of SWA/AW DPSNN simulations when executed on either ARM- or Intel-based server
platforms.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Studying the Effects of Deep Brain Stimulation and Medication on the Dynamics of STN-LFP Signals for Human Behavior Analysis. (arXiv:1804.03190v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents the results of our recent work on studying the effects of
deep brain stimulation (DBS) and medication on the dynamics of brain local
field potential (LFP) signals used for behavior analysis of patients with
Parkinson s disease (PD). DBS is a technique used to alleviate the severe
symptoms of PD when pharmacotherapy is not very effective. Behavior recognition
from the LFP signals recorded from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has
application in developing closed-loop DBS systems, where the stimulation pulse
is adaptively generated according to subjects performing behavior. Most of the
existing studies on behavior recognition that use STN-LFPs are based on the DBS
being off. This paper discovers how the performance and accuracy of automated
behavior recognition from the LFP signals are affected under different
paradigms of stimulation on/off. We first study the notion of beta power
suppression in LFP signals under different scenarios (stimulation on/off and
medication on/off). Afterward, we explore the accuracy of support vector
machines in predicting human actions (button press and reach) using the
spectrogram of STN-LFP signals. Our experiments on the recorded LFP signals of
three subjects confirm that the beta power is suppressed significantly when the
patients take medication (p-value&amp;lt;0.002) or stimulation (p-value&amp;lt;0.0003). The
results also show that we can classify different behaviors with a reasonable
accuracy of 85% even when the high-amplitude stimulation is applied.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Quantifying behavior is crucial for many applications in neuroscience.
Videography provides easy methods for the observation and recording of animal
behavior in diverse settings, yet extracting particular aspects of a behavior
for further analysis can be highly time consuming. In motor control studies,
humans or other animals are often marked with reflective markers to assist with
computer-based tracking, yet markers are intrusive (especially for smaller
animals), and the number and location of the markers must be determined a
priori. Here, we present a highly efficient method for markerless tracking
based on transfer learning with deep neural networks that achieves excellent
results with minimal training data. We demonstrate the versatility of this
framework by tracking various body parts in a broad collection of experimental
settings: mice odor trail-tracking, egg-laying behavior in drosophila, and
mouse hand articulation in a skilled forelimb task. For example, during the
skilled reaching behavior, individual joints can be automatically tracked (and
a confidence score is reported). Remarkably, even when a small number of frames
are labeled ($\approx 200$), the algorithm achieves excellent tracking
performance on test frames that is comparable to human accuracy.

	<description>The value of an anticipated rewarding event is crucial information in the decision to engage in its pursuit. The networks responsible for encoding and retrieval this value are largely unknown. Using glutamate biosensors and pharmacological manipulations, we found that basolateral amygdala (BLA) glutamatergic activity tracks and mediates both the encoding and retrieval of the hunger-state-dependent value of a palatable food reward. Projection-specific chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations revealed and it wathe orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) supports the BLA in these processes. Critically, the function of the ventrolateral (lOFC) and medial (mOFC) OFC-&amp;gt;BLA projections was found to be doubly dissociable. Whereas activity in lOFC-&amp;gt;BLA projections is necessary for and sufficient to drive encoding of a positive change in the value of a reward, mOFC-&amp;gt;BLA projections are necessary and sufficient for retrieving this value from memory to guide reward pursuit. These data reveal a new circuit for adaptive reward valuation and pursuit and provide mechanistic insight into the dysfunction in these processes that characterizes myriad psychiatric diseases.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Evidence against preserved syntactic comprehension in healthy aging</title>

	<description>We investigated age-related differences in syntactic comprehension in young and older adults. Previous research found no evidence of age-related decline in syntactic processing. We investigated elementary syntactic comprehension of minimal sentences (e.g I cook), minimizing the influence of working memory. We also investigated the contribution of semantic processing by comparing sentences containing real verbs (e.g I cook) versus pseudo-verbs (e.g I spuff). We measured speed and accuracy of detecting syntactic agreement errors (e.g., I cooks, I spuffs). We found that older adults were slower and less accurate than younger adults in detecting syntactic agreement errors for both real and pseudo-verb sentences. We thus found evidence for age-related decline in syntactic comprehension. The age-related decline in accuracy was smaller for the pseudo-verb sentences, and the decline in speed was larger for the pseudo-verb sentences, compared to real verb sentences. We suggest that syntactic comprehension decline is stronger in the absence of semantic information, which causes older adults to produce slower responses in order to make more accurate decisions. In line with these findings, accuracy for older adults was positively related to a measure of processing speed capacity. Taken together, we found evidence that elementary syntactic processing abilities decline in healthy ageing.</description>

	<description>Electrophysiological signals across species and recording scales exhibit both periodic and aperiodic features. Periodic oscillations have been widely studied and linked to numerous physiological, cognitive, behavioral, and disease states, while the aperiodic &quot;background&quot; 1/f component of neural power spectra has received far less attention. Most analyses of oscillations are conducted on a priori, canonically-defined frequency bands without consideration of the underlying aperiodic structure, or verification that a periodic signal even exists in addition to the aperiodic signal. This is problematic, as recent evidence shows that the aperiodic signal is dynamic, changing with age, task demands, and cognitive state. It has also been linked to the relative excitation/inhibition of the underlying neuronal population. This means that standard analytic approaches easily conflate changes in the periodic and aperiodic signals with one another because the aperiodic parameters--along with oscillation center frequency, power, and bandwidth--are all dynamic in physiologically meaningful, but likely different, ways. In order to overcome the limitations of traditional narrowband analyses and to reduce the potentially deleterious effects of conflating these features, we introduce a novel algorithm for automatic parameterization of neural power spectral densities (PSDs) as a combination of the aperiodic signal and putative periodic oscillations. Notably, this algorithm requires no a priori specification of band limits and accounts for potentially-overlapping oscillations while minimizing the degree to which they are confounded with one another. This algorithm is amenable to large-scale data exploration and analysis, providing researchers with a tool to quickly and accurately parameterize neural power spectra.</description>

	<description>The countermanding or stop-signal task is broadly used to evaluate response inhibition: it sporadically requires to inhibit a movement upon an incoming salient stop-signal. To study the neural basis of arm movements inhibition we combined the approach typically employed for the study of perceptual-decision making with the countermanding task, that is broadly used to evaluate response inhibition. To this aim we modified the salience of the stop-signal and we found that this modulation affected the ability to inhibit in macaque monkeys: coherently to what already observed in humans, we found that less salient stimuli deteriorate inhibitory performance. These behavioural results were subtended by neural modulations representing an inhibitory process that started later in time and showed a less steeper dynamic for stimuli difficult to be processed. This study shows that the neural patterns observed when deciding to stop are broadly similar to the neural patterns observed when deciding to act in the literature; thus it is a first step in investigating the perceptual decision making process involved in movement inhibition.</description>

	<description>Calretinin (CR)-expressing periglomerular (PG) cells are the most abundant interneurons in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb. They are predominately generated postnatally from the septal and dorsal sub-ventricular zones that continue producing them well into adulthood. Yet, little is known about their properties and functions. Using transgenic approaches and patch-clamp recording we show that CR(+) PG cells of both septal and dorsal origin have homogenous morphological and electrophysiological properties. They express a surprisingly poor repertoire of voltage-activated channels and fire, at most, one action potential. They also receive little synaptic inputs and NMDA receptors predominate at excitatory synapses. These properties, that resemble those of immature neurons, persist over time and limit the contribution of CR(+) PG cells in network activity. Thus, postnatally-generated CR(+) PG cells continuously supply a pool of latent neurons that unlikely participate in olfactory bulb computation but may provide a so far unsuspected reservoir of plasticity.</description>

Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computing architectures with many interconnections of simple neural-inspired computing elements, and have been applied to biomedical fields such as imaging analysis and diagnosis. We have developed a new ANN framework called Cox-nnet to predict patient prognosis from high throughput transcriptomics data. In 10 TCGA RNA-Seq data sets, Cox-nnet achieves the same or better predictive accuracy compared to other methods, including Cox-proportional hazards regression (with LASSO, ridge, and mimimax concave penalty), Random Forests Survival and CoxBoost. Cox-nnet also reveals richer biological information, at both the pathway and gene levels. The outputs from the hidden layer node provide an alternative approach for survival-sensitive dimension reduction. In summary, we have developed a new method for accurate and efficient prognosis prediction on high throughput data, with functional biological insights.

	<title>RSS PAP: A Transient Dopamine Signal Represents Avoidance Value and Causally Influences the Demand to Avoid</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0058-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;While an extensive literature supports the notion that mesocorticolimbic dopamine plays a role in negative reinforcement, recent evidence suggests that dopamine exclusively encodes the value of positive reinforcement. In the present study, we employed a behavioral economics approach to investigate whether dopamine plays a role in the valuation of negative reinforcement. Using rats as subjects, we first applied fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to determine that dopamine concentration decreases with the number of lever presses required to avoid electrical footshock (i.e. the economic price of avoidance). Analysis of the rate of decay of avoidance demand curves, which depict an inverse relationship between avoidance and increasing price, allows for inference of the worth an animal places on avoidance outcomes. Rapidly decaying demand curves indicate increased price sensitivity, or low worth placed on avoidance outcomes, while slow rates of decay indicate reduced price sensitivity, or greater worth placed on avoidance outcomes. We therefore used optogenetics to assess how inducing dopamine release causally modifies the demand to avoid electrical footshock in an economic setting. Increasing release at an avoidance predictive cue made animals more sensitive to price, consistent with a negative reward prediction error (i.e., the animal perceives they received a worse outcome than expected). Increasing release at avoidance made animals less sensitive to price, consistent with a positive reward prediction error (i.e., the animal perceives they received a better outcome than expected). These data demonstrate that transient dopamine release events represent the value of avoidance outcomes and can predictably modify the demand to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Dopamine is thought to play a crucial role in reward learning and directing actions toward beneficial outcomes. While the avoidance of harmful stimuli is similarly pertinent to an organism’s survival, the role of dopamine in avoidance remains controversial. Using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrochemistry, we observed that dopamine concentration decreased when the effort (lever presses) required to avoid electrical footshock increased. We also found that increasing dopamine at an avoidance predictive cue decreased avoidance, consistent with a negative prediction error. In contrast, increasing release at successful avoidance increased avoidance, consistent with a positive prediction error. These data demonstrate that transient dopamine release events represent the value of avoidance outcomes and capably modify avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The most enigmatic aspect of consciousness is the fact that it is felt, as a
subjective sensation. This particular aspect is explained by the theory
proposed here. The theory encompasses both the computation that is presumably
involved and the way in which that computation may be realized in the brain's
neurobiology. It is assumed that the brain makes an internal estimate of an
individual's own evolutionary fitness, which can be shown to produce an
irreducible, distinct cause. Communicating components of the fitness estimate
(either for external or internal use) requires inverting them. Such inversion
can be performed by the thalamocortical feedback loop in the mammalian brain,
if that loop is operating in a switched, dual-stage mode. A first
(nonconscious) stage produces forward estimates, whereas the second (conscious)
stage inverts those estimates. It is argued that inversion produces
irreducible, distinct, and spatially localized causes, which are plausibly
sensed as the feeling of consciousness.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human visual perception is a complex, dynamic and fluctuating process. In
addition to the incoming visual stimulus, it is affected by many other factors
including temporal context, both external and internal to the observer. In this
study we investigate the dynamic properties of psychophysical responses to a
continuous stream of visual near-threshold detection tasks. We manipulate the
incoming signals to have temporal structures with various characteristic
timescales. Responses of human observers to these signals are analyzed using
tools that highlight their dynamical features as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find that two opposing biases shape perception, and operate over distinct
timescales. Positive recency appears over short times, e.g. consecutive trials.
Adaptation, entailing an increased probability of changed response, reflects
trends over longer times. Analysis of psychometric curves conditioned on
various temporal events reveals that the balance between the two biases can
shift depending on their interplay with the temporal properties of the input
signal. A simple mathematical model reproduces the experimental data in all
stimulus regimes. Taken together, our results support the view that visual
response fluctuations reflect complex internal dynamics, possibly related to
higher cognitive processes.

We present a computational model of spatial navigation comprising different learning mechanisms in mammals, i.e., associative, cognitive mapping and parallel systems. This model is able to reproduce a large number of experimental results in different variants of the Morris water maze task, including standard associative phenomena (spatial generalization gradient and blocking), as well as navigation based on cognitive mapping. Furthermore, we show that competitive and cooperative patterns between different navigation strategies in the model allow to explain previous apparently contradictory results supporting either associative or cognitive mechanisms for spatial learning. The key computational mechanism to reconcile experimental results showing different influences of distal and proximal cues on the behavior, different learning times, and different abilities of individuals to alternatively perform spatial and response strategies, relies in the dynamic coordination of navigation strategies, whose performance is evaluated online with a common currency through a modular approach. We provide a set of concrete experimental predictions to further test the computational model. Overall, this computational work sheds new light on inter-individual differences in navigation learning, and provides a formal and mechanistic approach to test various theories of spatial cognition in mammals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ErL2lgBM7O0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The relationship between the structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) of neural systems is of central importance in brain network science. It is an open question, however, how the SC-FC relationship depends on specific topological features of brain networks or the models used for describing neural dynamics. Using a basic but general model of discrete excitable units that follow a susceptible—excited—refractory activity cycle (SER model), we here analyze how the network activity patterns underlying functional connectivity are shaped by the characteristic topological features of the network. We develop an analytical framework for describing the contribution of essential topological elements, such as common inputs and pacemakers, to the coactivation of nodes, and demonstrate the validity of the approach by comparison of the analytical predictions with numerical simulations of various exemplar networks. The present analytic framework may serve as an initial step for the mechanistic understanding of the contributions of brain network topology to brain dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-BJLyjXZ7qg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The spatial architecture of signaling pathways and the interaction with cell size and morphology are complex, but little understood. With the advances of single cell imaging and single cell biology, it becomes crucial to understand intracellular processes in time and space. Activation of cell surface receptors often triggers a signaling cascade including the activation of membrane-attached and cytosolic signaling components, which eventually transmit the signal to the cell nucleus. Signaling proteins can form steep gradients in the cytosol, which cause strong cell size dependence. We show that the kinetics at the membrane-cytosolic interface and the ratio of cell membrane area to the enclosed cytosolic volume change the behavior of signaling cascades significantly. We suggest an estimate of average concentration for arbitrary cell shapes depending on the cell volume and cell surface area. The normalized variance, known from image analysis, is suggested as an alternative measure to quantify the deviation from the average concentration. A mathematical analysis of signal transduction in time and space is presented, providing analytical solutions for different spatial arrangements of linear signaling cascades. Quantification of signaling time scales reveals that signal propagation is faster at the membrane than at the nucleus, while this time difference decreases with the number of signaling components in the cytosol. Our investigations are complemented by numerical simulations of non-linear cascades with feedback and asymmetric cell shapes. We conclude that intracellular signal propagation is highly dependent on cell geometry and, thereby, conveys information on cell size and shape to the nucleus.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dutkoudOSkg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely applied to discover new cell types by detecting sub-populations in a heterogeneous group of cells. Since scRNA-seq experiments have lower read coverage/tag counts and introduce more technical biases compared to bulk RNA-seq experiments, the limited number of sampled cells combined with the experimental biases and other dataset specific variations presents a challenge to cross-dataset analysis and discovery of relevant biological variations across multiple cell populations. In this paper, we introduce a method of variance-driven multitask clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data (scVDMC) that utilizes multiple single-cell populations from biological replicates or different samples. scVDMC clusters single cells in multiple scRNA-seq experiments of similar cell types and markers but varying expression patterns such that the scRNA-seq data are better integrated than typical pooled analyses which only increase the sample size. By controlling the variance among the cell clusters within each dataset and across all the datasets, scVDMC detects cell sub-populations in each individual experiment with shared cell-type markers but varying cluster centers among all the experiments. Applied to two real scRNA-seq datasets with several replicates and one large-scale Drop-seq dataset on three patient samples, scVDMC more accurately detected cell populations and known cell markers than pooled clustering and other recently proposed scRNA-seq clustering methods. In the case study applied to in-house Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) scRNA-seq data, scVDMC revealed several new cell types and unknown markers validated by flow cytometry.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to sense time and anticipate events is critical for survival. Learned responses that allow anticipation of the availability of food or water have been intensively studied. While anticipatory behaviors also occur prior to availability of regularly available rewards, there has been relatively little work on anticipation of drugs of abuse, specifically methamphetamine (MA). In the present study, we used a protocol that avoided possible CNS effects of stresses of handling or surgery by testing anticipation of MA availability in animals living in their home cages, with daily voluntary access to the drug at a fixed time of day. Anticipation was operationalized as the amount of wheel running prior to MA availability. Mice were divided into four groups given access to either nebulized MA or water, in early or late day. Animals with access to MA, but not water controls, showed anticipatory activity, with more anticipation in early compared to late day and significant interaction effects. Next, we explored the neural basis of the MA anticipation, using c-FOS expression, in animals euthanized at the usual time of nebulization access. In the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the pattern of c-FOS expression paralleled that of anticipatory behavior, with significant main and interaction effects of treatment and time of day. The results for the lateral septum (LS) were significant for main effects and marginally significant for interaction effects. These studies suggest that anticipation of MA is associated with activation of brain regions important in circadian timing, emotional regulation, and decision making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine has been associated with risky decision-making, as well as with pathological gambling, a behavioral addiction characterized by excessive risk-taking behavior. However, the specific mechanisms through which dopamine might act to foster risk-taking and pathological gambling remain elusive. Here we test the hypothesis that this might be achieved, in part, via modulation of subjective probability weighting during decision making. Human healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 21) and pathological gamblers (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) played a decision-making task involving choices between sure monetary options and risky gambles both in the gain and loss domains. Each participant played the task twice, either under placebo or the dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist sulpiride, in a double-blind counterbalanced design. A prospect theory modelling approach was used to estimate subjective probability weighting and sensitivity to monetary outcomes. Consistent with prospect theory, we found that participants presented a distortion in the subjective weighting of probabilities, i.e., they overweighted low probabilities and underweighted moderate to high probabilities, both in the gain and loss domains. Compared with placebo, sulpiride attenuated this distortion in the gain domain. Across drugs, the groups did not differ in their probability weighting, although gamblers consistently underweighted losing probabilities in the placebo condition. Overall, our results reveal that dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonism modulates the subjective weighting of probabilities in the gain domain, in the direction of more objective, economically rational decision making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Excitatory Neuronal Responses of Ca2+ Transients in Interstitial Cells of Cajal in the Small Intestine</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) regulate smooth muscle excitability and motility in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. ICC in the deep muscular plexus (ICC-DMP) of the small intestine are aligned closely with varicosities of enteric motor neurons and thought to transduce neural responses. ICC-DMP generate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients that activate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activated Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; channels and generate electrophysiological responses. We tested the hypothesis that excitatory neurotransmitters regulate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in ICC-DMP as a means of regulating intestinal muscles. High-resolution confocal microscopy was used to image Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in ICC-DMP within murine small intestinal muscles with cell-specific expression of GCaMP3. Intrinsic nerves were stimulated by electrical field stimulation (EFS). ICC-DMP exhibited ongoing Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients before stimuli were applied. EFS caused initial suppression of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, followed by escape during sustained stimulation, and large increases in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients after cessation of stimulation. Basal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity and the excitatory phases of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses to EFS were inhibited by atropine and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1) antagonists, but not by NK2 receptor antagonists. Exogenous ACh and substance P (SP) increased Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, atropine and NK1 antagonists decreased Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients. Neurokinins appear to be released spontaneously (tonic excitation) in small intestinal muscles and are the dominant excitatory neurotransmitters. Subcellular regulation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release events in ICC-DMP may be a means by which excitatory neurotransmission organizes intestinal motility patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: BC RNA mislocalization in the fragile X premutation</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Fragile X premutation disorder is caused by CGG triplet repeat expansions in the 5’ UTR of FMR1 mRNA. The question how expanded CGG repeats cause disease is a subject of continuing debate. Our work indicates that CGG-repeat structures compete with regulatory BC1 RNA for access to RNA transport factor hnRNP A2. As a result, BC1 RNA is mislocalized in vivo as its synapto-dendritic presence is severely diminished in brains of CGG-repeat knock-in animals (a premutation mouse model). Lack of BC1 RNA is known to cause seizure activity and cognitive dysfunction (Zhong et al., 2009; Chung et al., 2017; Iacoangeli et al., 2017). Our working hypothesis thus predicted that absence, or significantly reduced presence, of BC1 RNA in synapto-dendritic domains of premutation animal neurons would engender cognate phenotypic alterations. Testing this prediction, we established epileptogenic susceptibility and cognitive impairments as major phenotypic abnormalities of CGG premutation mice. In CA3 hippocampal neurons of such animals, synaptic release of glutamate elicits neuronal hyperexcitability in the form of mGluR-dependent prolonged epileptiform discharges. CGG-repeat knock-in animals are susceptible to sound-induced seizures and are cognitively impaired as revealed in the Attentional Set Shift Task. These phenotypic disturbances occur in young-adult premutation animals, indicating that a neurodevelopmental deficit is an early-initial manifestation of the disorder. The data are consistent with the notion that RNA mislocalization can contribute to pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The fragile X premutation finds expression in two distinct disease manifestations. Young premutation carriers may present with seizure activity and cognitive disturbances while advanced-age patients may experience intention tremor and gait ataxia, a condition known as FXTAS. In contrast to FXTAS, the early-onset phase of fragile X premutation disorder remains poorly understood. We discovered that in brains of CGG-repeat knock-in animals (a premutation mouse model), regulatory BC1 RNA is mislocalized as its presence at synapto-dendritic domains is severely diminished. Lack of BC1 RNA is known to cause epileptogenesis and cognitive dysfunction, and we report that such phenotypic alterations are hallmarks of young premutation animals. The data are congruous with a potential role of RNA localization impairments in pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Evidence Integration in Natural Acoustic Textures during Active and Passive Listening</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Many natural sounds can be well described on a statistical level, for example wind, rain or applause. Even though the spectro-temporal profile of these acoustic textures is highly dynamic, changes in their statistics are indicative of relevant changes in the environment. Here, we investigated the neural representation of change detection in natural textures in humans, and specifically addressed whether active task engagement is required for the neural representation of this change in statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjects listened to natural textures whose spectro-temporal statistics were modified at variable times by a variable amount. Subjects were instructed to either report the detection of changes (&lt;i&gt;active&lt;/i&gt;) or to passively listen to the stimuli. A subset of passive subjects had performed the active task before (&lt;i&gt;passive-aware&lt;/i&gt; vs. &lt;i&gt;passive-naive&lt;/i&gt;). Psychophysically, longer exposure to pre-change statistics was correlated with faster reaction times and better discrimination performance. EEG recordings revealed that the build-up rate and size of parieto-occipital potentials reflected change size and change time. Reduced effects were observed in the passive conditions. While P2 responses were comparable across conditions, slope and height of parieto-occipital potentials scaled with task involvement. Neural source localization identified a parietal source as the main contributor of change-specific potentials, in addition to more limited contributions from auditory and frontal sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, the detection of statistical changes in natural acoustic textures is predominantly reflected in parietal locations both on the skull and source level. The scaling in magnitude across different levels of task involvement suggests a context-dependent degree of evidence integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The everyday auditory environment is often complex and highly variable. Separating relevant changes from irrelevant variability is important for auditory processing. Previous research has already shown that sensory evidence is integrated to achieve accurate decisions. In the present study, we extend this research in two ways, first by using more realistic and complex stimuli, and second, by modulating the level of engagement of subjects in the task. We demonstrate that dynamic processing of natural stimuli leads to similar neural responses as for synthetic complex stimuli. Further, neural responses continue to reflect properties of the acoustic stimulus even for reduced task engagement, albeit with much lower amplitudes. We conclude that auditory evidence integration may continue even during passive perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Firing of Putative Dopamine Neurons in Ventral Tegmental Area Is Modulated by Probability of Success during Performance of a Stop-Change Task</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Response inhibition, the ability to refrain from unwanted actions, is an essential component of complex behavior and is often impaired across numerous neuropsychiatric disorders such as addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Accordingly, much research has been devoted to characterizing brain regions responsible for the regulation of response inhibition. The stop-signal task, a task in which animals are required to inhibit a prepotent response in the presence of a STOP cue, is one of the most well-studied tasks of response inhibition. While pharmacological evidence suggests that dopamine (DA) contributes to the regulation of response inhibition, what is exactly encoded by DA neurons during performance of response inhibition tasks is unknown. To address this issue, we recorded from single units in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) while rats performed a stop-change task. We found that putative DA neurons fired less and higher to cues and reward on STOP trials relative to GO trials, respectively, and that firing was reduced during errors. These results suggest that DA neurons in VTA encode the uncertainty associated with the probability of obtaining reward on difficult trials instead of the saliency associated with STOP cues or the need to resolve conflict between competing responses during response inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The ability to refrain from unwanted actions, also known as response inhibition, is an essential component of complex behavior, and is impaired across numerous neuropsychiatric disorders including addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. Dopamine (DA) is important for reward learning but its role in response inhibition is less clear. For the first time, we characterized the activity of DA neurons in rats performing a response inhibition task, and found that DA neurons primarily signaled information regarding the uncertainty of obtaining reward during cues and reward delivery when behavioral trials were difficult and there was a low probability of success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in a micro-circuit connected by chemical synapses can have their
connectivity affected by the prior activity of the cells. The number of
synapses available for releasing neurotransmitter can be decreased by
repetitive activation through depletion of readily releasable neurotransmitter
(NT), or increased through facilitation, where the probability of release of NT
is increased by prior activation. These competing effects can create a
complicated and subtle range of time dependent connectivity. Here we
investigate the probabilistic properties of facilitation and depression (FD)
for a presynaptic neuron that is receiving a Poisson spike train of input. We
use a model of FD that is parameterized with experimental data from a
hippocampal basket cell and pyramidal cell connection, for fixed frequency
input spikes at frequencies in the range of theta and gamma oscillations. Hence
our results will apply to micro-circuits in the hippocampus that are
responsible for the interaction of theta and gamma rhythms associated with
learning and memory. A control situation is compared with one in which a
pharmaceutical neuromodulator (muscarine) is employed. We apply standard
information theoretic measures such as entropy and mutual information, and find
a closed form approximate expression for the probability distribution of
release probability. We also use techniques that measure the dependence of the
response on the exact history of stimulation the synapse has received, which
uncovers some unexpected differences between control and muscarine-added cases.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We develop a general analytical and numerical framework for estimating intra-
and extra-neurite water fractions and diffusion coefficients, as well as
neurite orientational dispersion, in each imaging voxel. By employing a set of
rotational invariants and their expansion in the powers of diffusion weighting,
we analytically uncover the nontrivial topology of the parameter estimation
landscape, showing that multiple branches of parameters describe the
measurement almost equally well, with only one of them corresponding to the
biophysical reality. A comprehensive acquisition shows that the branch choice
varies across the brain. Our framework reveals hidden degeneracies in MRI
parameter estimation for neuronal tissue, provides microstructural and
orientational maps in the whole brain without constraints or priors, and
connects modern biophysical modeling with clinical MRI.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Need for speed: An optimized gridding approach for spatially explicit disease simulations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006086</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Sellman, Kimberly Tsao, Michael J. Tildesley, Peter Brommesson, Colleen T. Webb, Uno Wennergren, Matt J. Keeling, Tom Lindström&lt;/p&gt;

Numerical models for simulating outbreaks of infectious diseases are powerful tools for informing surveillance and control strategy decisions. However, large-scale spatially explicit models can be limited by the amount of computational resources they require, which poses a problem when multiple scenarios need to be explored to provide policy recommendations. We introduce an easily implemented method that can reduce computation time in a standard Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model without introducing any further approximations or truncations. It is based on a hierarchical infection process that operates on entire groups of spatially related nodes (cells in a grid) in order to efficiently filter out large volumes of susceptible nodes that would otherwise have required expensive calculations. After the filtering of the cells, only a subset of the nodes that were originally at risk are then evaluated for actual infection. The increase in efficiency is sensitive to the exact configuration of the grid, and we describe a simple method to find an estimate of the optimal configuration of a given landscape as well as a method to partition the landscape into a grid configuration. To investigate its efficiency, we compare the introduced methods to other algorithms and evaluate computation time, focusing on simulated outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) on the farm population of the USA, the UK and Sweden, as well as on three randomly generated populations with varying degree of clustering. The introduced method provided up to 500 times faster calculations than pairwise computation, and consistently performed as well or better than other available methods. This enables large scale, spatially explicit simulations such as for the entire continental USA without sacrificing realism or predictive power.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Oiar5aQKyTU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The cellular environment of the central nervous system is non-permissive for growth and regeneration. In the retina, transplantation of stem cells has been limited by inefficient survival and integration into existing circuits. In November 2016, as part of the National Eye Institute’s Audacious Goals Initiative (AGI), a diverse collection of investigators gathered for a workshop devoted to articulating the gaps in knowledge, barriers to progress, and ideas for new approaches to understanding cellular environments within the retina and how these environments may be manipulated.  In doing so, the group identified the areas of a) retinal and optic nerve glia, b) microglia and inflammation, and the c) extracellular matrix and retinal vasculature as key to advancing our understanding and manipulation of the retinal microenvironments.  We summarize here the findings of the workshop for the broader scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Machine learning of neuroimaging to diagnose cognitive impairment and dementia: a systematic review and comparative analysis. (arXiv:1804.01961v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01961</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01961</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION: Advanced machine learning methods might help to identify
dementia risk from neuroimaging, but their accuracy to date is unclear.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;METHODS: We systematically reviewed the literature, 2006 to late 2016, for
machine learning studies differentiating healthy ageing through to dementia of
various types, assessing study quality, and comparing accuracy at different
disease boundaries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RESULTS: Of 111 relevant studies, most assessed Alzheimer's disease (AD) vs
healthy controls, used ADNI data, support vector machines and only T1-weighted
sequences. Accuracy was highest for differentiating AD from healthy controls,
and poor for differentiating healthy controls vs MCI vs AD, or MCI converters
vs non-converters. Accuracy increased using combined data types, but not by
data source, sample size or machine learning method.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION: Machine learning does not differentiate clinically-relevant
disease categories yet. More diverse datasets, combinations of different types
of data, and close clinical integration of machine learning would help to
advance the field.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01958</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many neurodegenerative diseases are related to the propagation and
accumulation of toxic proteins throughout the brain. The lesions created by
aggregates of these toxic proteins further lead to cell death and accelerated
tissue atrophy. A striking feature of some of these diseases is their
characteristic pattern and evolution, leading to well-codified disease stages
visible to neuropathology and associated with various cognitive deficits and
pathologies. Here, we simulate the anisotropic propagation and accumulation of
toxic proteins in full brain geometry. We show that the same model with
different initial seeding zones reproduces the characteristic evolution of
different prion-like diseases. We also recover the expected evolution of the
total toxic protein load. Finally, we couple our transport model to a
mechanical atrophy model to obtain the typical degeneration patterns found in
neurodegenerative diseases.

neuromorphic hardware. The neuronal array is embedded in the analog network
core of a scaled-down prototype HICANN-DLS chip. Designed as continuous-time
circuits, the neurons are highly tunable and reconfigurable elements with
accelerated dynamics. Each neuron integrates input current from a multitude of
incoming synapses and evokes a digital spike event output. The circuit offers a
wide tuning range for synaptic and membrane time constants, as well as for
refractory periods to cover a number of computational models. We elucidate our
design methodology, underlying circuit design, calibration and measurement
results from individual sub-circuits across multiple dies. The circuit dynamics
match with the behavior of the LIF mathematical model. We further demonstrate a
winner-take-all network on the prototype chip as a typical element of cortical
processing.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Mixed-Signal Structured AdEx Neuron for Accelerated Neuromorphic Cores. (arXiv:1804.01840v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Here we describe a multi-compartment neuron circuit based on the
Adaptive-Exponential I&amp;amp;F (AdEx) model, developed for the second-generation
BrainScaleS hardware. Based on an existing modular Leaky Integrate-and-Fire
(LIF) architecture designed in 65 nm CMOS, the circuit features exponential
spike generation, neuronal adaptation, inter-compartmental connections as well
as a conductance-based reset. The design reproduces a diverse set of firing
patterns observed in cortical pyramidal neurons. Further, it enables the
emulation of sodium and calcium spikes, as well as N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA)
plateau potentials known from apical and thin dendrites. We characterize the
AdEx circuit extensions and exemplify how the interplay between passive and
non-linear active signal processing enhances the computational capabilities of
single (but structured) on-chip neurons.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the last century, it has been known that neural stem cells
(NSCs) play a key role in regenerative medicine to cure the neurodegenerative
disease. This review article covers about the introduction to neural stem cell
biology and the isolation, differentiation and transplantation
methods/techniques of neural stem cells. The neural stem cells can be
transplanted into the human brain in the future to replace the damaged and dead
neurons. The highly limited access to embryonic stem cells and ethical issues
have escalated the search for other NSC sources. The developing technologies
are indicating that it can be achieved before the end of this century. In
addition, the differentiation and the maturation of NSCs can artificially
accelerate by modern methods.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial neural networks (ANNs), while exceptionally useful for
classification, are vulnerable to misdirection. Small amounts of noise can
significantly affect their ability to correctly complete a task. Instead of
generalizing concepts, ANNs seem to focus on surface statistical regularities
in a given task. Here we compare how recurrent artificial neural networks, long
short-term memory units, and Markov Brains sense and remember their
environments. We show that information in Markov Brains is localized and
sparsely distributed, while the other neural network substrates &quot;smear&quot;
information about the environment across all nodes, which makes them vulnerable
to noise.

Current rates of species loss triggered numerous attempts to protect and conserve biodiversity. Species conservation, however, requires species identification skills, a competence obtained through intensive training and experience. Field researchers, land managers, educators, civil servants, and the interested public would greatly benefit from accessible, up-to-date tools automating the process of species identification. Currently, relevant technologies, such as digital cameras, mobile devices, and remote access to databases, are ubiquitously available, accompanied by significant advances in image processing and pattern recognition. The idea of automated species identification is approaching reality. We review the technical status quo on computer vision approaches for plant species identification, highlight the main research challenges to overcome in providing applicable tools, and conclude with a discussion of open and future research thrusts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bfmDpVYKmqI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Although neural progenitor proliferation along the ventricular zone is regulated by β-catenin through Wnt signaling, the cytoskeletal mechanisms that regulate expression and localization of these proteins are not well understood. Our prior studies have shown that loss of the actin-binding Filamin A (FlnA) and actin-nucleating protein Formin 2 (Fmn2) impairs endocytosis of low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-related protein 6 (Lrp6), thereby disrupting β-catenin activation, resulting in decreased brain size. Here, we report that activated RhoA-GTPase disengages Fmn2 N- to C-terminal binding to promote Fmn2 activation and redistribution into lysosomal vesicles. Fmn2 colocalizes with β-catenin in lysosomes and promotes its degradation. Further, Fmn2 binds the E3 ligase Smurf2, enhances Smurf2-dependent ubiquitination, and degradation of Dishevelled-2 (Dvl2), thereby initiates β-catenin degradation. Finally, Fmn2 overexpression disrupts neuroepithelial integrity, neuronal migration, and proliferation-phenotypes in E13 mouse embryos, as seen with loss of Fmn2+FlnA function. Conversely, co-expression of Dvl2 with Fmn2 rescues the proliferation defect due to Fmn2 overexpression in mouse embryos. These findings suggest that there is a homeostatic feedback mechanism in the cytoskeletal-dependent regulation of neural proliferation within the cerebral cortex. Upstream, Fmn2 promotes proliferation by stabilizing the Lrp6 receptor, leading to β-catenin activation. Downstream, RhoA-activated Fmn2 promotes lysosomal degradation of Dvl2, leading to β-catenin degradation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Slow-wave activity (SWA), and its coupling with other sleep features, reorganizes cortical circuitry, supporting cognition. This raises the question: can cognition be improved through SWA enhancement? SWA enhancement techniques range from behavioral interventions (such as exercise), which have high feasibility but low specificity, to laboratory-based techniques (such as transcranial stimulation), which have high specificity but are less feasible for widespread use. In this review we describe the pathways through which SWA is enhanced.</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Common Sense in Choice: The Effect of Sensory Modality on Neural Value Representations</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Although it is well established that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) represents value using a common currency across categories of rewards, it is unknown whether the vmPFC represents value irrespective of the sensory modality in which alternatives are presented. In the current study, male and female human subjects completed a decision-making task while their neural activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging. On each trial, subjects chose between a safe alternative and a lottery, which was presented visually or aurally. A univariate conjunction analysis revealed that the anterior portion of the vmPFC tracks subjective value (SV) irrespective of the sensory modality. Using a novel cross-modality multivariate classifier, we were able to decode auditory value based on visual trials and vice versa. In addition, we found that the visual and auditory sensory cortices, which were identified using functional localizers, are also sensitive to the value of stimuli, albeit in a modality-specific manner. Whereas both primary and higher-order auditory cortices represented auditory SV (aSV), only a higher-order visual area represented visual SV (vSV). These findings expand our understanding of the common currency network of the brain and shed a new light on the interplay between sensory and value information processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Effect of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; on the promiscuous target-protein binding of calmodulin</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006072</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/nnr4XNya7Zs/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Annie M. Westerlund, Lucie Delemotte&lt;/p&gt;

Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium sensing protein that regulates the function of a large number of proteins, thus playing a crucial part in many cell signaling pathways. CaM has the ability to bind more than 300 different target peptides in a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner, mainly through the exposure of hydrophobic residues. How CaM can bind a large number of targets while retaining some selectivity is a fascinating open question. Here, we explore the mechanism of CaM selective promiscuity for selected target proteins. Analyzing enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bound and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free CaM via spectral clustering has allowed us to identify distinct conformational states, characterized by interhelical angles, secondary structure determinants and the solvent exposure of specific residues. We searched for indicators of conformational selection by mapping solvent exposure of residues in these conformational states to contacts in structures of CaM/target peptide complexes. We thereby identified CaM states involved in various binding classes arranged along a depth binding gradient. Binding Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; modifies the accessible hydrophobic surface of the two lobes and allows for deeper binding. Apo CaM indeed shows shallow binding involving predominantly polar and charged residues. Furthermore, binding to the C-terminal lobe of CaM appears selective and involves specific conformational states that can facilitate deep binding to target proteins, while binding to the N-terminal lobe appears to happen through a more flexible mechanism. Thus the long-ranged electrostatic interactions of the charged residues of the N-terminal lobe of CaM may initiate binding, while the short-ranged interactions of hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal lobe of CaM may account for selectivity. This work furthers our understanding of the mechanism of CaM binding and selectivity to different target proteins and paves the way towards a comprehensive model of CaM selectivity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nnr4XNya7Zs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Spatial regularity control of phyllotaxis pattern generated by the mutual interaction between auxin and PIN1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006065</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/1PcJThDi81k/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Hironori Fujita, Masayoshi Kawaguchi&lt;/p&gt;

Phyllotaxis, the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem, is well known because of its beautiful geometric configuration, which is derived from the constant spacing between leaf primordia. This phyllotaxis is established by mutual interaction between a diffusible plant hormone auxin and its efflux carrier PIN1, which cooperatively generate a regular pattern of auxin maxima, small regions with high auxin concentrations, leading to leaf primordia. However, the molecular mechanism of the regular pattern of auxin maxima is still largely unknown. To better understand how the phyllotaxis pattern is controlled, we investigated mathematical models based on the auxin–PIN1 interaction through linear stability analysis and numerical simulations, focusing on the spatial regularity control of auxin maxima. As in previous reports, we first confirmed that this spatial regularity can be reproduced by a highly simplified and abstract model. However, this model lacks the extracellular region and is not appropriate for considering the molecular mechanism. Thus, we investigated how auxin maxima patterns are affected under more realistic conditions. We found that the spatial regularity is eliminated by introducing the extracellular region, even in the presence of direct diffusion between cells or between extracellular spaces, and this strongly suggests the existence of an unknown molecular mechanism. To unravel this mechanism, we assumed a diffusible molecule to verify various feedback interactions with auxin–PIN1 dynamics. We revealed that regular patterns can be restored by a diffusible molecule that mediates the signaling from auxin to PIN1 polarization. Furthermore, as in the one-dimensional case, similar results are observed in the two-dimensional space. These results provide a great insight into the theoretical and molecular basis for understanding the phyllotaxis pattern. Our theoretical analysis strongly predicts a diffusible molecule that is pivotal for the phyllotaxis pattern but is yet to be determined experimentally.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1PcJThDi81k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Recent studies have demonstrated how the competition for the finite pool of available gene expression factors has important effect on fundamental gene expression aspects. In this study, based on a whole-cell model simulation of translation in &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, we evaluate for the first time the expected effect of mRNA levels fluctuations on translation due to the finite pool of ribosomes. We show that fluctuations of a single gene or a group of genes mRNA levels induce periodic behavior in all &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; translation factors and aspects: the ribosomal densities and the translation rates of all &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs oscillate. We numerically measure the oscillation amplitudes demonstrating that fluctuations of endogenous and heterologous genes can cause a significant fluctuation of up to 50% in the steady-state translation rates of the rest of the genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate by synonymous mutations that oscillating the levels of mRNAs that experience high ribosomal occupancy (e.g. ribosomal “traffic jam”) induces the largest impact on the translation of the &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; genome.
The results reported here should provide novel insights and principles related to the design of synthetic gene expression circuits and related to the evolutionary constraints shaping gene expression of endogenous genes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EeyF-2L0x-k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A probabilistic, distributed, recursive mechanism for decision-making in the brain</title>

Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/47MpyGKP0b0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Frontal Eye Field Inactivation Reduces Saccade Preparation in the Superior Colliculus, but Does Not Alter How Preparatory Activity Relates to Saccades of a Given Latency</title>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0024-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A neural correlate for saccadic reaction times (SRTs) in the gap saccade task is the level of low-frequency activity in the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (iSC) just before visual target onset: greater levels of such &lt;i&gt;preparatory&lt;/i&gt; iSC low-frequency activity precede shorter SRTs. The frontal eye fields (FEF) are one likely source of iSC preparatory activity, since FEF preparatory activity is also inversely related to SRT. To better understand the FEF’s role in saccade preparation, and the way in which such preparation relates to SRT, in two male rhesus monkeys we compared iSC preparatory activity across unilateral reversible cryogenic inactivation of the FEF. FEF inactivation increased contralesional SRTs, and lowered ipsilesional iSC preparatory activity. FEF inactivation also reduced rostral iSC activity during the gap period. Importantly, the distributions of SRTs generated with or without FEF inactivation overlapped, enabling us to conduct a novel population-level analyses examining iSC preparatory activity just before generation of SRT-matched saccades. When matched for SRTs, we observed no change during FEF inactivation in the relationship between iSC preparatory activity and SRT-matched saccades across a range of SRTs, even for the occasional express saccade. Thus, while our results emphasize that the FEF has an overall excitatory influence on preparatory activity in the iSC, the communication between the iSC and downstream oculomotor brainstem is unaltered for SRT-matched saccades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; How does the brain decide when to move? Here, we investigate the role of two oculomotor structures, the superior colliculus (SC) and frontal eye fields (FEF), in dictating visually-guided saccadic reaction times (SRTs). In both structures, higher levels of pretarget preparatory activity precede shorter SRTs. Here, we show that FEF inactivation increases SRTs and decreases SC preparatory activity. Surprisingly, providing one examines SRT-matched saccades, a population-level analysis of SC preparatory activity showed a negligible impact of FEF inactivation. Thus, while the FEF is one important source of preparatory input to the SC, it does not alter the dynamics of how iSC preparatory activity relates to a given SRT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Cell transplantation is an ambitious, but arguably realistic, therapy for repair of the nervous system. Cell delivery is a major challenge for clinical translation, especially given the apparently inhibitory astrogliotic environment in degenerated tissue. However, astrogliotic tissue also contains endogenous structural and biochemical cues that can be harnessed for functional repair. Minimizing damage to these cues during cell delivery could enhance cell integration. This theory is supported by studies with an auditory astrocyte scar model, in which cells delivered onto the surface of the damaged nerve were more successfully integrated in the host than those injected into the tissue.</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Sensorimotor Representation of Speech Perception. Cross-Decoding of Place of Articulation Features during Selective Attention to Syllables in 7T fMRI</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Sensorimotor integration, the translation between acoustic signals and motoric programs, may constitute a crucial mechanism for speech. During speech perception, the acoustic-motoric translations include the recruitment of cortical areas for the representation of speech articulatory features, such as place of articulation. Selective attention can shape the processing and performance of speech perception tasks. Whether and where sensorimotor integration takes place during attentive speech perception remains to be explored. Here, we investigate articulatory feature representations of spoken consonant-vowel (CV) syllables during two distinct tasks. Fourteen healthy humans attended to either the vowel or the consonant within a syllable in separate delayed-match-to-sample tasks. Single-trial fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses from perception periods were analyzed using multivariate pattern classification and a searchlight approach to reveal neural activation patterns sensitive to the processing of place of articulation (i.e., bilabial/labiodental vs. alveolar). To isolate place of articulation representation from acoustic covariation, we applied a cross-decoding (generalization) procedure across distinct features of manner of articulation (i.e., stop, fricative, and nasal). We found evidence for the representation of place of articulation across tasks and in both tasks separately: for attention to vowels, generalization maps included bilateral clusters of superior and posterior temporal, insular, and frontal regions; for attention to consonants, generalization maps encompassed clusters in temporoparietal, insular, and frontal regions within the right hemisphere only. Our results specify the cortical representation of place of articulation features generalized across manner of articulation during attentive syllable perception, thus supporting sensorimotor integration during attentive speech perception and demonstrating the value of generalization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Synaptic connections between neurons in the brain are dynamic because of continuously ongoing spine dynamics, axonal sprouting, and other processes. In fact, it was recently shown that the spontaneous synapse-autonomous component of spine dynamics is at least as large as the component that depends on the history of pre- and postsynaptic neural activity. These data are inconsistent with common models for network plasticity, and raise the questions how neural circuits can maintain a stable computational function in spite of these continuously ongoing processes, and what functional uses these ongoing processes might have. Here, we present a rigorous theoretical framework for these seemingly stochastic spine dynamics and rewiring processes in the context of reward-based learning tasks. We show that spontaneous synapse-autonomous processes, in combination with reward signals such as dopamine, can explain the capability of networks of neurons in the brain to configure themselves for specific computational tasks, and to compensate automatically for later changes in the network or task. Furthermore we show theoretically and through computer simulations that stable computational performance is compatible with continuously ongoing synapse-autonomous changes. After reaching good computational performance it causes primarily a slow drift of network architecture and dynamics in task-irrelevant dimensions, as observed for neural activity in motor cortex and other areas. On the more abstract level of reinforcement learning the resulting model gives rise to an understanding of reward-driven network plasticity as continuous sampling of network configurations. (240 words)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Networks of neurons in the brain do not have a fixed connectivity. We address the question how stable computational performance can be achieved by continuously changing neural circuits, and how these networks could even benefit from these changes. We show that the stationary distribution of network configurations provides a level of analysis where these issues can be addressed in a perspicuous manner. In particular, this theoretical framework allows us to address analytically the questions which rules for reward-gated synaptic rewiring and plasticity would work best in this context, and what impact different levels of activity-independent synaptic processes are likely to have. We demonstrate the viability of this approach through computer simulations and links to experimental data. (116 words)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Deafness causes speech to deteriorate, but whether this deterioration reflects an active or passive process is unclear. Birdsong – a learned vocal behavior that resembles speech in its dependence on auditory feedback – also deteriorates following deafening. In their 2000 paper, Brainard and Doupe showed that, following deafening, birdsong deteriorates through an active process mediated by a cortex–basal ganglia (BG) circuit.</description>

	<description>In the late 1970s, key discoveries in neurophysiology, psychophysics, computer vision, and image processing had reached a tipping point that would shape visual science for decades to come. David Marr and Ellen Hildreth’s ‘Theory of edge detection’, published in 1980, set out to integrate the newly available wealth of data from behavioral, physiological, and computational approaches in a unifying theory. Although their work had wide and enduring ramifications, their most important contribution may have been to consolidate the foundations of the ongoing dialogue between theoretical and empirical vision science.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: An open source tool for automatic spatiotemporal assessment of calcium transients and local ‘signal-close-to-noise’ activity in calcium imaging data</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Prada, Manju Sasi, Corinna Martin, Sibylle Jablonka, Thomas Dandekar, Robert Blum&lt;/p&gt;

Local and spontaneous calcium signals play important roles in neurons and neuronal networks. Spontaneous or cell-autonomous calcium signals may be difficult to assess because they appear in an unpredictable spatiotemporal pattern and in very small neuronal loci of axons or dendrites. We developed an open source bioinformatics tool for an unbiased assessment of calcium signals in x,y-t imaging series. The tool bases its algorithm on a continuous wavelet transform-guided peak detection to identify calcium signal candidates. The highly sensitive calcium event definition is based on identification of peaks in 1D data through analysis of a 2D wavelet transform surface. For spatial analysis, the tool uses a grid to separate the x,y-image field in independently analyzed grid windows. A document containing a graphical summary of the data is automatically created and displays the loci of activity for a wide range of signal intensities. Furthermore, the number of activity events is summed up to create an estimated total activity value, which can be used to compare different experimental situations, such as calcium activity before or after an experimental treatment. All traces and data of active loci become documented. The tool can also compute the signal variance in a sliding window to visualize activity-dependent signal fluctuations. We applied the calcium signal detector to monitor activity states of cultured mouse neurons. Our data show that both the total activity value and the variance area created by a sliding window can distinguish experimental manipulations of neuronal activity states. Notably, the tool is powerful enough to compute local calcium events and ‘signal-close-to-noise’ activity in small loci of distal neurites of neurons, which remain during pharmacological blockade of neuronal activity with inhibitors such as tetrodotoxin, to block action potential firing, or inhibitors of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The tool can also offer information about local homeostatic calcium activity events in neurites.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8fH_ykpqpmQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Differences in the Electrophysiological Properties of Mouse Somatosensory Layer 2/3 Neurons in Vivo and Slice Stem from Intrinsic Sources Rather than a Network-Generated High Conductance State</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Synaptic activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; can potentially alter the integration properties of neurons. Using recordings in awake mice, we targeted somatosensory layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons and compared neuronal properties with those from slices. Pyramidal cells &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; had lower resistance and gain values, as well as broader spikes and increased spike frequency adaptation compared to the same cells in slices. Increasing conductance in neurons using dynamic clamp to levels observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, however, did not lessen the differences between &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and slice conditions. Further, local application of tetrodotoxin &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; blocked synaptic-mediated membrane voltage fluctuations, but had little impact on pyramidal cell membrane input resistance and time constant values. Differences in electrophysiological properties of layer 2/3 neurons in mouse somatosensory cortex, therefore, stem from intrinsic sources separate from synaptic-mediated membrane voltage fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are often modeled as being in a high conductance state arising from intense synaptic activity in awake conditions. Outside of the expected reduction in membrane time constant, it remains unclear if other features are altered &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here we show that cellular properties between mouse somatosensory neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and slices differ substantially in terms of spike shape, input-output responses, and subthreshold membrane resistance. Increasing the membrane conductance of neurons in slices to match values observed at rest &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, however, does not generate properties consistent with those observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Differences in the properties of mouse somatosensory layer 2/3 pyramidal cells &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and slices, therefore, are not the product of a network-generated high conductance state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Reduced Orexin System Function Contributes to Resilience to Repeated Social Stress</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Exposure to stress increases the risk of developing affective disorders such as depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). However, these disorders only occur in a subset of individuals, those that are more vulnerable to the effects of stress, whereas others remain resilient. The coping style adopted to deal with the stressor, either passive or active coping, is related to vulnerability or resilience, respectively. Important neural substrates that mediate responses to a stressor are the orexins. These neuropeptides are altered in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with stress-related illnesses such as depression and PTSD. The present experiments used a rodent social defeat model that generates actively coping rats and passively coping rats, which we have previously shown exhibit resilient and vulnerable profiles, respectively, to examine if orexins play a role in these stress-induced phenotypes. &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; radiolabeling and qPCR revealed that actively coping rats expressed significantly lower prepro-orexin mRNA compared with passively coping rats. This led to the hypothesis that lower levels of orexins contribute to resilience to repeated social stress. To test this hypothesis, rats first underwent five days of social defeat to establish active and passive coping phenotypes. Then, orexin neurons were inhibited prior to each social defeat for three additional days using Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). Inhibition of orexins increased social interaction behavior and decreased depressive-like behavior in the vulnerable population of rats. Indeed, this suggests that lowering orexins promoted resilience to social defeat, and may be an important target for treatment of stress-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Stress-related mental illnesses only occur in a subset of individuals, whereas others are resilient to the effects of stress. Our work used an animal model of social stress to identify a substrate of resilience, the neuropeptides orexins, which are known to be altered in patients with MDD and PTSD. We found that orexins are decreased in rats resilient to social stress. To test whether low orexins contribute to resilience, orexins were inhibited during three days of a social defeat stress paradigm, which increased subsequent social interaction behavior and decreased depressive-like behaviors in a previously vulnerable population of rats. This suggests that lowering orexins is important in promoting resilience to stress, and are an important target for treatments of stress-related illness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Complement activation products have long been associated with roles in the innate immune system, linking the humoral and cellular responses. However, among their recently described non-inflammatory roles, complement proteins also have multiple emerging novel functions in brain development. Within this context, separate proteins and pathways of complement have carved out physiological niches in the formation, development, and refinement of neurons. They demonstrate actions that are both reminiscent of peripheral immune actions and removed from them.</description>

New results indicate that regions of the prefrontal cortex play distinct roles in evaluating new evidence in light of a previous choice and translating the result of this evaluation process into an explicit report of one’s subjective confidence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/LJSLWZfxH7M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prefrontal Oxytocin is Involved in Impairments in Prefrontal Plasticity and Social Memory Following Acute Exposure to High Fat Diet in Juvenile Animals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy070</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy070/4955783?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Juvenility represents a critical developmental phase during which exposure to a high fat diet (HFD) can severely modify cognitive and emotional functioning. The purpose of this study was to address how short and acute exposure to a HFD during juvenility affects social memory recognition and prefrontal long-term potentiation (LTP). As LTP and social memory depend on the neuromodulator oxytocin (OXY) and due to its role in metabolism, we also examined the effects of OXY in mediating HFD-induced alterations in social memory and LTP. Our results show that short exposure to a HFD during juvenility impairs social preference memory and prefrontal LTP. Interestingly, whereas systemic injections of OXY reversed the impairments in HFD-fed animals and impaired LTP and memory in control animals; prefrontal injections of the OXY agonist TGOT reversed the effects in HFD animals without affecting control animals. Exposure to HFD was associated with a reduction in the levels of OXY in the prefrontal compared to control animals. Interestingly, the restoration of social memory by TGOT in HFD animals was also associated with normalization of OXY in the prefrontal. These results point to a role that prefrontal OXY has in mediating the effects of HFD on memory and plasticity.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Working Memory Load Modulates Neuronal Coupling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy065</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy065/4955775?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;There is a severe limitation in the number of items that can be held in working memory. However, the neurophysiological limits remain unknown. We asked whether the capacity limit might be explained by differences in neuronal coupling. We developed a theoretical model based on Predictive Coding and used it to analyze Cross Spectral Density data from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), frontal eye fields (FEF), and lateral intraparietal area (LIP). Monkeys performed a change detection task. The number of objects that had to be remembered (memory load) was varied (1–3 objects in the same visual hemifield). Changes in memory load changed the connectivity in the PFC–FEF–LIP network. Feedback (top-down) coupling broke down when the number of objects exceeded cognitive capacity. Thus, impaired behavioral performance coincided with a break-down of Prediction signals. This provides new insights into the neuronal underpinnings of cognitive capacity and how coupling in a distributed working memory network is affected by memory load.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Regional GABA Concentrations Modulate Inter-network Resting-state Functional Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy059</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy059/4955774?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Coordinated activity within and differential activity between large-scale neuronal networks such as the default mode network (DMN) and the control network (CN) is a critical feature of brain organization. The CN usually exhibits activations in response to cognitive tasks while the DMN shows deactivations; in addition, activity between the two networks is anti-correlated at rest. To address this issue, we used functional MRI to measure whole-brain BOLD signal during resting-state and task-evoked conditions, and MR spectroscopy (MRS) to quantify GABA and glutamate concentrations, in nodes within the DMN and CN (MPFC and DLPFC, respectively) in 19 healthy individuals at 3 Tesla. We found that GABA concentrations in the MPFC were significantly associated with DMN deactivation during a working memory task and with anti-correlation between DMN and CN at rest and during task performance, while GABA concentrations in the DLPFC weakly modulated DMN–CN anti-correlation in the opposite direction. Highlighting specificity, glutamate played a less significant role related to brain activity. These findings indicate that GABA in the MPFC is potentially involved in orchestrating between-network brain activity at rest and during task performance.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>The physiology of the central nervous system (CNS) is built on a foundation of connection, integration, and the exchange of complex information among brain cells. Emerging evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key players in the intercellular communication that underlies physiological processes such as synaptic plasticity and the maintenance of myelination. Furthermore, upon injury to the CNS, EVs may propagate inflammation across the blood–brain barrier and beyond, and also appear to mediate neuroprotection and modulate regenerative processes.</description>

	<description>A growing body of work is investigating the safety and efficacy of light in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here we discuss the potential of this emerging therapy to improve both motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. We also highlight directions for future basic, translational, and clinical research that are critical for the development of mechanism-based protocols of light therapy in PD.</description>

	<description>The brain is an organ of immense complexity. Next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is becoming increasingly popular in the deconstruction of this complexity into distinct classes of ‘cell types’. Notably, in addition to revealing the organization of this distinct cell-type landscape, the technology has also begun to illustrate that continuous variation can be found within narrowly defined cell types. Here we summarize the evidence for graded transcriptomic heterogeneity being present, widespread, and functionally relevant in the nervous system.</description>
