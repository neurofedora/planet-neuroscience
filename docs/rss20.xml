	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Evaluating the impact of different types of crossover and selection methods on the convergence of 0/1 Knapsack using Genetic Algorithm. (arXiv:2010.03483v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genetic Algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm and a metaheuristic that was
introduced to overcome the failure of gradient based method in solving the
optimization and search problems. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the
impact on the convergence of Genetic Algorithm vis-a-vis 0/1 knapsack. By
keeping the number of generations and the initial population fixed, different
crossover methods like one point crossover and two-point crossover were
evaluated and juxtaposed with each other. In addition to this, the impact of
different selection methods like rank-selection, roulette wheel and tournament
selection were evaluated and compared. Our results indicate that convergence
rate of combination of one point crossover with tournament selection, with
respect to 0/1 knapsack problem that we considered, is the highest and thereby
most efficient in solving 0/1 knapsack.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have incorporated more biologically-plausible
structures and learning principles, hence are playing critical roles in
bridging the gap between artificial and natural neural networks. The spikes are
the sparse signals describing the above-threshold event-based firing and
under-threshold dynamic computation of membrane potentials, which give us an
alternative uniformed and efficient way on both information representation and
computation. Inspired from the biological network, where a finite number of
meta neurons integrated together for various of cognitive functions, we
proposed and constructed Meta-Dynamic Neurons (MDN) to improve SNNs for a
better network generalization during spatio-temporal learning. The MDNs are
designed with basic neuronal dynamics containing 1st-order and 2nd-order
dynamics of membrane potentials, including the spatial and temporal meta types
supported by some hyper-parameters. The MDNs generated from a spatial (MNIST)
and a temporal (TIDigits) datasets first, and then extended to various other
different spatio-temporal tasks (including Fashion-MNIST, NETtalk, Cifar-10,
TIMIT and N-MNIST). The comparable accuracy was reached compared to other SOTA
SNN algorithms, and a better generalization was also achieved by SNNs using
MDNs than that without using MDNs.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: The principle of stationary action in neural systems. (arXiv:2010.02993v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The principle of stationary action is a cornerstone of modern physics,
providing a powerful framework for investigating dynamical systems found in
classical mechanics through to quantum field theory. However, computational
neuroscience, despite its heavy reliance on concepts in physics, is anomalous
in this regard as its main equations of motion are not compatible with a
Lagrangian formulation and hence with the principle of stationary action.
Taking the Dynamic Causal Modelling neuronal state equation, Hodgkin-Huxley
model, and the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire model as examples, we show that it is
possible to write complex oscillatory forms of these equations in terms of a
single Lagrangian. We therefore bring mathematical descriptions in
computational neuroscience under the remit of the principle of stationary
action and use this reformulation to express symmetries and associated
conservation laws arising in neural systems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A recent line of work in the machine learning community addresses the problem
of predicting high-dimensional spatiotemporal phenomena by leveraging specific
tools from the differential equations theory. Following this direction, we
propose in this article a novel and general paradigm for this task based on a
resolution method for partial differential equations: the separation of
variables. This inspiration allows us to introduce a dynamical interpretation
of spatiotemporal disentanglement. It induces a principled model based on
learning disentangled spatial and temporal representations of a phenomenon to
accurately predict future observations. We experimentally demonstrate the
performance and broad applicability of our method against prior
state-of-the-art models on physical and synthetic video datasets.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent research on compressing deep neural networks has focused on reducing
the number of parameters. Smaller networks are easier to export and deploy on
edge-devices. We introduce \textit{Adjoined networks} as a training approach
that can regularize and compress any CNN-based neural architecture. Our
one-shot learning paradigm trains both the original and the smaller networks
together. The parameters of the smaller network are shared across both the
architectures. We prove strong theoretical guarantees on the regularization
behavior of the adjoint training paradigm. We complement our theoretical
analysis by an extensive empirical evaluation of both the compression and
regularization behavior of adjoint networks. For resnet-50 trained adjointly on
Imagenet, we are able to achieve a $13.7x$ reduction in the number of
parameters (For size comparison, we ignore the parameters in the last linear
layer as it varies by dataset and are typically dropped during fine-tuning.
Else, the reductions are $11.5x$ and $95x$ for imagenet and cifar-100
respectively.) and a $3x$ improvement in inference time without any significant
drop in accuracy. For the same architecture on CIFAR-100, we are able to
achieve a $99.7x$ reduction in the number of parameters and a $5x$ improvement
in inference time. On both these datasets, the original network trained in the
adjoint fashion gains about $3\%$ in top-1 accuracy as compared to the same
network trained in the standard fashion.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Learning temporal structure of the input with a network of integrate-and-fire neurons. (arXiv:1912.10262v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The task of the brain is to look for structure in the external input. We
study a network of integrate-and-fire neurons with several types of recurrent
connections that learns the structure of its time-varying feedforward input by
attempting to efficiently represent this input with spikes. The efficiency of
the representation arises from incorporating the structure of the input into
the decoder, which is implicit in the learned synaptic connectivity of the
network. While in the original work of [Boerlin, Machens, Den\`eve 2013] and
[Brendel et al., 2017] the structure learned by the network to make the
representation efficient was the low-dimensionality of the feedforward input,
in the present work it is its temporal dynamics. The network achieves the
efficiency by adjusting its synaptic weights in such a way, that for any neuron
in the network, the recurrent input cancels the feedforward for most of the
time. We show that if the only temporal structure that the input possesses is
that it changes slowly on the time scale of neuronal integration, the
dimensionality of the network dynamics is equal to the dimensionality of the
input. However, if the input follows a linear differential equation of the
first order, the efficiency of the representation can be increased by
increasing the dimensionality of the network dynamics in comparison to the
dimensionality of the input. If there is only one type of slow synaptic current
in the network, the increase is two-fold, while if there are two types of slow
synaptic currents that decay with different rates and whose amplitudes can be
adjusted separately, it is advantageous to make the increase three-fold. We
numerically simulate the network with synaptic weights that imply the most
efficient input representation in the above cases. We also propose a learning
rule by means of which the corresponding synaptic weights can be learned.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Firing statistics in the bistable regime of neurons with homoclinic spike generation. (arXiv:1902.00951v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00951</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00951</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal voltage dynamics of regularly firing neurons typically has one
stable attractor: either a fixed point (like in the subthreshold regime) or a
limit cycle that defines the tonic firing of action potentials (in the
suprathreshold regime). In two of the three spike onset bifurcation sequences
that are known to give rise to all-or-none type action potentials, however, the
resting-state fixpoint and limit cycle spiking can coexist in an intermediate
regime, resulting in bistable dynamics. Here, noise can induce switches between
the attractors, i.e., between rest and spiking, and thus increase the
variability of the spike train compared to neurons with only one stable
attractor. Qualitative features of the resulting spike statistics depend on the
spike onset bifurcations. This study focuses on the creation of the spiking
limit cycle via the saddle-homoclinic orbit (HOM) bifurcation and derives
interspike interval (ISI) densities for a conductance-based neuron model in the
bistable regime. The ISI densities of bistable homoclinic neurons are found to
be unimodal yet distinct from the inverse Gaussian distribution associated with
the saddle-node-on-invariant-cycle (SNIC) bifurcation. It is demonstrated that
for the HOM bifurcation the transition between rest and spiking is mainly
determined along the downstroke of the action potential -- a dynamical feature
that is not captured by the commonly used reset neuron models. The deduced
spike statistics can help to identify HOM dynamics in experimental data.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Chronic Sodium Selenate Treatment Restores Deficits in Cognition and Synaptic Plasticity in a Murine Model of Tauopathy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A major goal in diseases is identifying a potential therapeutic agent that is cost-effective and can remedy some, if not all, disease symptoms. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein is one of the neuropathological hallmarks, and Tau pathology correlates better with cognitive impairments in AD patients than amyloid-β load, supporting a key role of tau-related mechanisms. Selenium is a non-metallic trace element that is incorporated in the brain into selenoproteins. Chronic treatment with sodium selenate, a non-toxic selenium compound, was recently reported to rescue behavioral phenotypes in tau mouse models. Here, we focused on the effects of chronic selenate application on synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in THY-Tau22 mice, a transgenic animal model of tauopathies. Three months with a supplement of sodium selenate in the drinking water (12 μg/ml) restored not only impaired neurocognitive functions but also rescued long-term depression (LTD), a major form of synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, selenate reduced the inactive demethylated catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in THY-Tau22 without affecting total PP2A.Our study provides evidence that chronic dietary selenate rescues functional synaptic deficits of tauopathy and identifies activation of PP2A as the putative mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Altered EEG Signal Complexity Induced by Hand Proximity: A Multiscale Entropy Approach</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual short-term memory (VSTM) is an important cognitive function that acts as a temporary storage for visual information. Previous studies have shown that VSTM capacity can be modulated by the location of one’s hands, where hand proximity enhances neural processing and memory of nearby visual stimuli. The present study used traditional event-related potentials (ERP) along with multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis to shed light on the neural mechanism(s) behind such near-hand effect. Participants’ electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded as they performed a VSTM task with their hands either proximal or distal to the display. ERP analysis showed altered memory processing in the 400–700 ms time window during memory retrieval period. Importantly, MSE analysis also showed significant EEG difference between hand proximal and distal conditions between scales 10 to 20, and such difference is clustered around the right parietal cortex – a region that is involved in VSTM processing and bimodal hand-eye integration. The implications of higher MSE time scale in the parietal cortex are discussed in the context of signal complexity and its possible relation to cognitive processing. To our knowledge, this study provides the first investigation using MSE to characterize the temporal characteristics and signal complexity behind the effect of hand proximity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has recently been used for the analysis of neuroimages, such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, and positron emission tomography (PET), and it has achieved significant performance improvements over traditional machine learning in computer-aided diagnosis of brain disorders. This paper reviews the applications of deep learning methods for neuroimaging-based brain disorder analysis. We first provide a comprehensive overview of deep learning techniques and popular network architectures by introducing various types of deep neural networks and recent developments. We then review deep learning methods for computer-aided analysis of four typical brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Autism spectrum disorder, and Schizophrenia, where the first two diseases are neurodegenerative disorders and the last two are neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, respectively. More importantly, we discuss the limitations of existing studies and present possible future directions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Early Auditory Experience Modifies Neuronal Firing Properties in the Zebra Finch Auditory Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Songbirds learn to sing much as humans learn to speak. In zebra finches, one of the premier songbird models, males learn to sing for later courtship through a multistep learning process during the developmental period. They first listen to and memorize the song of a tutor (normally their father) during the sensory learning period. Then, in the subsequent sensory-motor learning phase (with large overlap), they match their vocalizations to the memorized tutor song via auditory feedback and develop their own unique songs, which they maintain throughout their lives. Previous studies have suggested that memories of tutor songs are shaped in the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) of the brain, which is analogous to the mammalian higher auditory cortex. Isolation during development, which extends the sensory learning period in males, alters song preference in adult females, and NCM inactivation decreases song preference. However, the development of neurophysiological properties of neurons in this area and the effect of isolation on these neurons have not yet been explained. Here, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recording on NCM neurons from juvenile zebra finches during the sensory learning period, 20, 40, or 60 days post-hatching (DPH) and examined their neurophysiological properties. In contrast to previous reports in adult NCM neurons, the majority of NCM neurons of juvenile zebra finches showed spontaneous firing with or without burst firing patterns, and the percentage of neurons that fired increased in the middle of the sensory learning period (40 DPH) and then decreased at the end (60 DPH) in both males and females. We further found that auditory isolation from tutor songs alters developmental changes in the proportions of firing neurons both in males and females, and also changes those of burst neurons differently between males that sing and females that do not. Taken together, these findings suggest that NCM neurons develop their neurophysiological properties depending on auditory experiences during the sensory song learning period, which underlies memory formation for song learning in males and song discrimination in females.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ongoing biomarker development programs have been designed to identify serologic or imaging signatures of clinico-pathologic entities, assuming distinct biological boundaries between them. Identified putative biomarkers have exhibited large variability and inconsistency between cohorts, and remain inadequate for selecting suitable recipients for potential disease-modifying interventions. We launched the Cincinnati Cohort Biomarker Program (CCBP) as a population-based, phenotype-agnostic longitudinal study. While patients affected by a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders will be deeply phenotyped using clinical, imaging, and mobile health technologies, analyses will not be anchored on phenotypic clusters but on bioassays of to-be-repurposed medications as well as on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, microbiomics, and pharmacogenomics analyses blinded to phenotypic data. Unique features of this cohort study include (1) a reverse biology-to-phenotype direction of biomarker development in which clinical, imaging, and mobile health technologies are subordinate to biological signals of interest; (2) hypothesis free, causally- and data driven-based analyses; (3) inclusive recruitment of patients with neurodegenerative disorders beyond clinical criteria-meeting patients with Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and (4) a large number of longitudinally followed participants. The parallel development of serum bioassays will be aimed at linking biologically suitable subjects to already available drugs with repurposing potential in future proof-of-concept adaptive clinical trials. Although many challenges are anticipated, including the unclear pathogenic relevance of identifiable biological signals and the possibility that some signals of importance may not yet be measurable with current technologies, this cohort study abandons the anchoring role of clinico-pathologic criteria in favor of biomarker-driven disease subtyping to facilitate future biosubtype-specific disease-modifying therapeutic efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We propose four novel mathematical models, describing the microscopic mechanisms of force generation in the cardiac muscle tissue, which are suitable for multiscale numerical simulations of cardiac electromechanics. Such models are based on a biophysically accurate representation of the regulatory and contractile proteins in the sarcomeres. Our models, unlike most of the sarcomere dynamics models that are available in the literature and that feature a comparable richness of detail, do not require the time-consuming Monte Carlo method for their numerical approximation. Conversely, the models that we propose only require the solution of a system of PDEs and/or ODEs (the most reduced of the four only involving 20 ODEs), thus entailing a significant computational efficiency. By focusing on the two models that feature the best trade-off between detail of description and identifiability of parameters, we propose a pipeline to calibrate such parameters starting from experimental measurements available in literature. Thanks to this pipeline, we calibrate these models for room-temperature rat and for body-temperature human cells. We show, by means of numerical simulations, that the proposed models correctly predict the main features of force generation, including the steady-state force-calcium and force-length relationships, the length-dependent prolongation of twitches and increase of peak force, the force-velocity relationship. Moreover, they correctly reproduce the Frank-Starling effect, when employed in multiscale 3D numerical simulation of cardiac electromechanics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KRa2qWDDbfI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Inconsistent therapeutic efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in regenerative medicine has been documented in many clinical trials. Precise prediction on the therapeutic outcome of a MSC therapy based on the patient’s conditions would provide valuable references for clinicians to decide the treatment strategies. In this article, we performed a meta-analysis on MSC therapies for cartilage repair using machine learning. A small database was generated from published &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and clinical studies. The unique features of our neural network model in handling missing data and calculating prediction uncertainty enabled precise prediction of post-treatment cartilage repair scores with coefficient of determination of 0.637 ± 0.005. From this model, we identified defect area percentage, defect depth percentage, implantation cell number, body weight, tissue source, and the type of cartilage damage as critical properties that significant impact cartilage repair. A dosage of 17 − 25 million MSCs was found to achieve optimal cartilage repair. Further, critical thresholds at 6% and 64% of cartilage damage in area, and 22% and 56% in depth were predicted to significantly compromise on the efficacy of MSC therapy. This study, for the first time, demonstrated machine learning of patient-specific cartilage repair post MSC therapy. This approach can be applied to identify and investigate more critical properties involved in MSC-induced cartilage repair, and adapted for other clinical indications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3Y1ySVN8soQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The current quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assay recommended for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing in the United States requires analysis of 3 genomic targets per sample: 2 viral and 1 host. To simplify testing and reduce the volume of required reagents, we devised a multiplex RT-qPCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a single reaction. We used existing N1, N2, and RP primer and probe sets by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but substituted fluorophores to allow multiplexing of the assay. The cycle threshold (Ct) values of our multiplex RT-qPCR were comparable to those obtained by the single assay adapted for research purposes. Low copy numbers (≥500 copies/reaction) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were consistently detected by the multiplex RT-qPCR. Our novel multiplex RT-qPCR improves upon current single diagnostics by saving reagents, costs, time, and labor.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/FyibY_G3i4g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the machine learning community has seen a continuous growing
interest in research aimed at investigating dynamical aspects of both training
procedures and perfected models. Of particular interest among recurrent neural
networks, we have the Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm for its conceptual
simplicity and fast training scheme. Yet, the guiding principles under which RC
operates are only partially understood. In this work, we study the properties
behind learning dynamical systems with RC and propose a new guiding principle
based on Generalized Synchronization (GS) granting its feasibility. We show
that the well-known Echo State Property (ESP) implies and is implied by GS, so
that theoretical results derived from the ESP still hold when GS does. However,
by using GS one can profitably study the RC learning procedure by linking the
reservoir dynamics with the readout training. Notably, this allows us to shed
light on the interplay between the input encoding performed by the reservoir
and the output produced by the readout optimized for the task at hand. In
addition, we show that - as opposed to the ESP - satisfaction of the GS can be
measured by means of the Mutual False Nearest Neighbors index, which makes
effective to practitioners theoretical derivations.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We attempt to automate various artistic processes by inventing a set of
drawing games, analogous to the approach taken by emergent language research in
inventing communication games. A critical difference is that drawing games
demand much less effort from the receiver than do language games. Artists must
work with pre-trained viewers who spend little time learning artist specific
representational conventions, but who instead have a pre-trained visual system
optimized for behaviour in the world by understanding to varying extents the
environment's visual affordances. After considering various kinds of drawing
game we present some preliminary experiments which have generated images by
closing the generative-critical loop.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper demonstrates a fatal vulnerability in natural language inference
(NLI) and text classification systems. More concretely, we present a 'backdoor
poisoning' attack on NLP models. Our poisoning attack utilizes conditional
adversarially regularized autoencoder (CARA) to generate poisoned training
samples by poison injection in latent space. Just by adding 1% poisoned data,
our experiments show that a victim BERT finetuned classifier's predictions can
be steered to the poison target class with success rates of &amp;gt;80% when the input
hypothesis is injected with the poison signature, demonstrating that NLI and
text classification systems face a huge security risk.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: How Convolutional Neural Network Architecture Biases Learned Opponency and Colour Tuning. (arXiv:2010.02634v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02634</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02634</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent work suggests that changing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architecture by introducing a bottleneck in the second layer can yield changes
in learned function. To understand this relationship fully requires a way of
quantitatively comparing trained networks. The fields of electrophysiology and
psychophysics have developed a wealth of methods for characterising visual
systems which permit such comparisons. Inspired by these methods, we propose an
approach to obtaining spatial and colour tuning curves for convolutional
neurons, which can be used to classify cells in terms of their spatial and
colour opponency. We perform these classifications for a range of CNNs with
different depths and bottleneck widths. Our key finding is that networks with a
bottleneck show a strong functional organisation: almost all cells in the
bottleneck layer become both spatially and colour opponent, cells in the layer
following the bottleneck become non-opponent. The colour tuning data can
further be used to form a rich understanding of how colour is encoded by a
network. As a concrete demonstration, we show that shallower networks without a
bottleneck learn a complex non-linear colour system, whereas deeper networks
with tight bottlenecks learn a simple channel opponent code in the bottleneck
layer. We further develop a method of obtaining a hue sensitivity curve for a
trained CNN which enables high level insights that complement the low level
findings from the colour tuning data. We go on to train a series of networks
under different conditions to ascertain the robustness of the discussed
results. Ultimately, our methods and findings coalesce with prior art,
strengthening our ability to interpret trained CNNs and furthering our
understanding of the connection between architecture and learned
representation. Code for all experiments is available at

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Rebalancing Electric Vehicle Sharing Systems. (arXiv:2010.02369v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02369</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02369</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for nightly offline
rebalancing operations in free-floating electric vehicle sharing systems
(FFEVSS). Due to sparse demand in a network, FFEVSS require relocation of
electrical vehicles (EVs) to charging stations and demander nodes, which is
typically done by a group of drivers. A shuttle is used to pick up and drop off
drivers throughout the network. The objective of this study is to solve the
shuttle routing problem to finish the rebalancing work in the minimal time. We
consider a reinforcement learning framework for the problem, in which a central
controller determines the routing policies of a fleet of multiple shuttles. We
deploy a policy gradient method for training recurrent neural networks and
compare the obtained policy results with heuristic solutions. Our numerical
studies show that unlike the existing solutions in the literature, the proposed
methods allow to solve the general version of the problem with no restrictions
on the urban EV network structure and charging requirements of EVs. Moreover,
the learned policies offer a wide range of flexibility resulting in a
significant reduction in the time needed to rebalance the network.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: The Traveling Observer Model: Multi-task Learning Through Spatial Variable Embeddings. (arXiv:2010.02354v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02354</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02354</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper frames a general prediction system as an observer traveling around
a continuous space, measuring values at some locations, and predicting them at
others. The observer is completely agnostic about any particular task being
solved; it cares only about measurement locations and their values. This
perspective leads to a machine learning framework in which seemingly unrelated
tasks can be solved by a single model, by embedding their input and output
variables into a shared space. An implementation of the framework is developed
in which these variable embeddings are learned jointly with internal model
parameters. In experiments, the approach is shown to (1) recover intuitive
locations of variables in space and time, (2) exploit regularities across
related datasets with completely disjoint input and output spaces, and (3)
exploit regularities across seemingly unrelated tasks, outperforming
task-specific single-task models and multi-task learning alternatives. The
results suggest that even seemingly unrelated tasks may originate from similar
underlying processes, a fact that the traveling observer model can use to make
better predictions.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks to Model Urban Outdoor Air Pollution. (arXiv:2010.02244v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02244</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02244</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a relevant problem because the design of most cities prioritizes the
use of motorized vehicles, which has degraded air quality in recent years,
having a negative effect on urban health. Modeling, predicting, and forecasting
ambient air pollution is an important way to deal with this issue because it
would be helpful for decision-makers and urban city planners to understand the
phenomena and to take solutions. In general, data-driven methods for modeling,
predicting, and forecasting outdoor pollution requires an important amount of
data, which may limit their accuracy. In order to deal with such a lack of
data, we propose to train models able to generate synthetic nitrogen dioxide
daily time series according to a given classification that will allow an
unlimited generation of realistic data. The main experimental results indicate
that the proposed approach is able to generate accurate and diverse pollution
daily time series, while requiring reduced computational time.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02066</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural networks (NNs) whose subnetworks implement reusable functions are
expected to offer numerous advantages, including compositionality through
efficient recombination of functional building blocks, interpretability,
preventing catastrophic interference, etc. Understanding if and how NNs are
modular could provide insights into how to improve them. Current inspection
methods, however, fail to link modules to their functionality. In this paper,
we present a novel method based on learning binary weight masks to identify
individual weights and subnets responsible for specific functions. Using this
powerful tool, we contribute an extensive study of emerging modularity in NNs
that covers several standard architectures and datasets. We demonstrate how
common NNs fail to reuse submodules and offer new insights into the related
issue of systematic generalization on language tasks.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: On the Universality of the Double Descent Peak in Ridgeless Regression. (arXiv:2010.01851v2 [stat.ML] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01851</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01851</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We prove a non-asymptotic distribution-independent lower bound for the
expected mean squared generalization error caused by label noise in ridgeless
linear regression. In contrast to previous works, our analysis applies to a
broad class of input distributions with almost surely full-rank feature
matrices, which allows us to cover various types of deterministic or random
feature maps. Our lower bound implies that in the presence of label noise,
ridgeless linear regression does not perform well around the interpolation
threshold for any of these feature maps. We analyze the imposed assumptions in
detail and provide a theory for analytic (random) feature maps. Using this
theory, we can show that our assumptions are satisfied for input distributions
with a (Lebesgue) density and feature maps given by random deep neural networks
with analytic activation functions like sigmoid, tanh, softplus or GELU. As
further examples, we show that feature maps from random Fourier features and
polynomial kernels also satisfy our assumptions. We complement our theory with
further experimental and analytic results.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: DLGNet-Task: An End-to-end Neural Network Framework for Modeling Multi-turn Multi-domain Task-Oriented Dialogue. (arXiv:2010.01693v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01693</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01693</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Task oriented dialogue (TOD) requires the complex interleaving of a number of
individually controllable components with strong guarantees for explainability
and verifiability. This has made it difficult to adopt the multi-turn
multi-domain dialogue generation capabilities of streamlined end-to-end
open-domain dialogue systems. In this paper, we present a new framework,
DLGNet-Task, a unified task-oriented dialogue system which employs
autoregressive transformer networks such as DLGNet and GPT-2/3 to complete user
tasks in multi-turn multi-domain conversations. Our framework enjoys the
controllable, verifiable, and explainable outputs of modular approaches, and
the low development, deployment and maintenance cost of end-to-end systems.
Treating open-domain system components as additional TOD system modules allows
DLGNet-Task to learn the joint distribution of the inputs and outputs of all
the functional blocks of existing modular approaches such as, natural language
understanding (NLU), state tracking, action policy, as well as natural language
generation (NLG). Rather than training the modules individually, as is common
in real-world systems, we trained them jointly with appropriate module
separations. When evaluated on the MultiWOZ2.1 dataset, DLGNet-Task shows
comparable performance to the existing state-of-the-art approaches.
Furthermore, using DLGNet-Task in conversational AI systems reduces the level
of effort required for developing, deploying, and maintaining intelligent
assistants at scale.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Predicting the outputs of finite networks trained with noisy gradients. (arXiv:2004.01190v2 [stat.ML] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01190</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01190</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A recent line of works studied wide deep neural networks (DNNs) by
approximating them as Gaussian Processes (GPs). A DNN trained with gradient
flow was shown to map to a GP governed by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK),
whereas earlier works showed that a DNN with an i.i.d. prior over its weights
maps to the so-called Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). Here we consider
a DNN training protocol, involving noise, weight decay and finite width, whose
outcome corresponds to a certain non-Gaussian stochastic process. An analytical
framework is then introduced to analyze this non-Gaussian process, whose
deviation from a GP is controlled by the finite width. Our contribution is
three-fold: (i) In the infinite width limit, we establish a correspondence
between DNNs trained with noisy gradients and the NNGP, not the NTK. (ii) We
provide a general analytical form for the finite width correction (FWC) for
DNNs with arbitrary activation functions and depth and use it to predict the
outputs of empirical finite networks with high accuracy. Analyzing the FWC
behavior as a function of $n$, the training set size, we find that it is
negligible for both the very small $n$ regime, and, surprisingly, for the large
$n$ regime (where the GP error scales as $O(1/n)$). (iii) We flesh-out
algebraically how these FWCs can improve the performance of finite
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) relative to their GP counterparts on image
classification tasks.

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Implantation of a nerve guidance conduit (NGC) carrying neuroprotective factors is promising for repairing peripheral nerve injury. Here, we developed a novel strategy for repairing peripheral nerve injury by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)–encapsulated chitosan in laminin-coated nanofiber of Poly(l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) conduit and transplantation of rat adipose–derived stem cells (r-ADSCs) suspended in alginate. Then, the beneficial effect of AuNPs, BDNF, and r-ADSCs on nerve regeneration was evaluated in rat sciatic nerve transection model. In vivo experiments showed that the combination of AuNPs- and BDNF-encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles in laminin-coated nanofiber of PLGA conduit with r-ADSCs could synergistically facilitate nerve regeneration. Furthermore, the in vivo histology, immunohistochemistry, and behavioral results demonstrated that the AuNPs- and BDNF-encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles in NGC could significantly reinforce the repair performance of r-ADSCs, which may also contribute to the therapeutic outcome of the AuNPs, BDNF, and r-ADSCs strategies. In this study, we found that the combination of AuNPs and BDNF releases in NGC with r-ADSCs may represent a new potential strategy for peripheral nerve regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Evidences from either small series or spontaneous reporting are accumulating that SARS-CoV-2 involves the Nervous Systems. The aim of this study is to provide an extensive overview on the major neurological complications in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Retrospective, observational analysis on all COVID-19 patients admitted from February 23rd to April 30th, 2020 to ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy for whom a neurological consultation/neurophysiological assessment/neuroradiologic investigation was requested. Each identified neurologic complication was then classified into main neurologic categories.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Of 1760 COVID-19 patients, 137 presented neurologic manifestations that manifested after COVID-19 symptoms in 98 pts and was the presenting symptom in 39. Neurological manifestations were classified as: (a) cerebrovascular disease [53 pts (38.7%)] including 37 ischemic and 11 haemorrhagic strokes, 4 transient ischemic attacks, 1 cerebral venous thrombosis; (b) peripheral nervous system diseases [31 (22.6%)] including 17 Guillain–Barrè syndromes; (c) altered mental status [49 (35.8%)] including one necrotizing encephalitis and 2 cases with RT-PCR detection of SARS-Cov-2 RNA in CSF; (d) miscellaneous disorders, among whom 2 patients with myelopathy associated with Ab anti-SARS-CoV-2 in CSF. Patients with peripheral nervous system involvement had more frequently severe ARDS compared to patients with cerebrovascular disease (87.1% vs 42%; difference = 45.1% 95% CI 42.0–48.2; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;χ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;= 14.306; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p &lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt; 0.0002) and with altered mental status (87.1% vs 55.6%; difference = 31.5% 95% CI 27.5–37.5%; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;χ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;= 7.055; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p &lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study confirms that involvement of nervous system is common in SARS-CoV-2 infection and offers clinicians useful information for prevention and prompt identification in order to set the adequate therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neurology: An observational cohort study on impact, dimensions and outcome of perceived fatigue in adult 5q-spinal muscular atrophy patients receiving nusinersen treatment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10227-5</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Efficacy of nusinersen in adult 5q-spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients regarding motor function has recently been demonstrated. However, additional outcome measures are needed to capture non-motor improvements. Fatigue is a common and disabling symptom in neurologic diseases, but little is known about its frequency, characteristics and associated factors in SMA.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To characterize fatigue in SMA patients receiving nusinersen, identify associated factors and evaluate fatigue as potential patient-reported outcome measure (PRO).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We assessed fatigue in adults with genetically confirmed 5q-SMA in a prospective longitudinal monocentric study using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI). Factors associated with fatigue including health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;75% of participants were abnormally fatigued with highest scores in the dimensions&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt; physical&lt;/em&gt;, followed by &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;general fatigue&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;reduced activity&lt;/em&gt;. 53% agreed that fatigue was among their three most disabling symptoms. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Reduced activity&lt;/em&gt; was reported more extensively by participants with ≥ 4 copies of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;survival of motor neuron 2&lt;/em&gt; gene and better motor function. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;General&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;mental fatigue&lt;/em&gt; correlated positively with age and disease duration. HRQOL was inversely correlated with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;physical fatigue&lt;/em&gt;, which was not associated with disease or participant characteristics. During 14 months of nusinersen treatment, fatigue measures remained mostly stable with a trend towards improvement in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;reduced activity&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;general&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;physical fatigue&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Fatigue is a frequent and relevant complaint in adult SMA patients. Fatigue should be taken into consideration as additional outcome measure, but needs further evaluation in a larger patient cohort over a longer observation period.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Altered Expression of Glial Gap Junction Proteins Cx43, Cx30, and Cx47 in the 5XFAD Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.582934</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.582934</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glial gap junction proteins, called connexins (Cxs), form gap junctions in the central nervous system (CNS) to allow the bidirectional cytosolic exchange of molecules between adjacent cells. Their involvement in inheritable diseases and the use of experimental animal models that closely mimic such diseases revealed the critical role of glial GJs in myelination and homeostasis. Cxs are also implicated in acquired demyelinating disorders, such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Animal and human studies have revealed a role of the astrocytic Cx43 in the progression of AD but the role of Cx47, which is the main partner of Cx43 in the astrocyte-oligodendrocyte GJs is still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the astrocytic connexins, Cx43 and Cx30 in relation to oligodendrocytic Cx47 in the cortex and thalamus of the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. The model was characterized by increased Aβ deposition, gliosis, neuronal loss, and memory impairment. Compared to wild-type mice, Cx43 and Cx30 showed increased immunoreactivity in older 5XFAD mice, reflecting astrogliosis, while Cx47 immunoreactivity was reduced. Moreover, Cx47 GJ plaques showed reduced colocalization with Cx43 plaques. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and mature oligodendrocyte populations were also depleted, and myelin deficits were observed. Our findings indicate reduced astrocyte-oligodendrocyte gap junction connectivity and possibly a shift in Cx43 expression toward astrocyte-astrocyte gap junctions and/or hemichannels, that could impair oligodendrocyte homeostasis and myelination. However, other factors, such as Aβ toxicity, could directly affect oligodendrocyte survival in AD. Our study provides evidence that Cxs might have implications in the progression of AD, although the role of oligodendrocyte Cxs in AD requires further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Automatic Skull Stripping of Rat and Mouse Brain MRI Data Using U-Net</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accurate removal of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal outside the brain, a.k.a., skull stripping, is a key step in the brain image pre-processing pipelines. In rodents, this is mostly achieved by manually editing a brain mask, which is time-consuming and operator dependent. Automating this step is particularly challenging in rodents as compared to humans, because of differences in brain/scalp tissue geometry, image resolution with respect to brain-scalp distance, and tissue contrast around the skull. In this study, we proposed a deep-learning-based framework, U-Net, to automatically identify the rodent brain boundaries in MR images. The U-Net method is robust against inter-subject variability and eliminates operator dependence. To benchmark the efficiency of this method, we trained and validated our model using both in-house collected and publicly available datasets. In comparison to current state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieved superior averaged Dice similarity coefficient to ground truth T2-weighted rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement and T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;-weighted echo planar imaging data in both rats and mice (all p &amp;lt; 0.05), demonstrating robust performance of our approach across various MRI protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been widely employed in the objective diagnosis of patients with schizophrenia during a verbal fluency task (VFT). Most of the available methods depended on the time-domain features extracted from the data of single or multiple channels. The present study proposed an alternative method based on the functional connectivity strength (FCS) derived from an individual channel. The data measured 100 patients with schizophrenia and 100 healthy controls, who were used to train the classifiers and to evaluate their performance. Different classifiers were evaluated, and support machine vector achieved the best performance. In order to reduce the dimensional complexity of the feature domain, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied. The classification results by using an individual channel, a combination of several channels, and 52 ensemble channels with and without the dimensional reduced technique were compared. It provided a new approach to identify schizophrenia, improving the objective diagnosis of this mental disorder. FCS from three channels on the medial prefrontal and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortices rendered accuracy as high as 84.67%, sensitivity at 92.00%, and specificity at 70%. The neurophysiological significance of the change at these regions was consistence with the major syndromes of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: β-Amyloid Plaque Reduction in the Hippocampus After Focused Ultrasound-Induced Blood–Brain Barrier Opening in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The blood–brain barrier (BBB) limits therapeutic delivery in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurological disorders. Animal models have demonstrated safe BBB opening and reduction in β-amyloid plaque with focused ultrasound (FUS). We recently demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and reversibility of FUS-induced BBB opening in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in six participants with early AD. We now report the effect of BBB opening with FUS treatment on β-amyloid plaque. Six participants underwent &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-Florbetaben PET scan at baseline and 1 week after the completion of the third FUS treatment (60 days interval). PET analysis comparing the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in the treated and untreated hemispheres revealed a decrease in the ratio of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-Florbetaben ligand binding. The standard uptake value ratios (SUVr) reduction ranged from 2.7% to 10% with an average of 5.05% (±2.76) suggesting a decrease in β-amyloid plaque.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Auditory Processing Differences Correlate With Autistic Traits in Males</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.584704</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has high prevalence among males compared to females but mechanisms underlying the differences between sexes are poorly investigated. Moreover, autistic symptoms show a continuity in the general population and are referred to as autistic traits in people without an ASD diagnosis. One of the symptoms of ASD is sensory processing differences both in sensitivity and perception. To investigate sensory processing differences in autistic traits, we examined auditory and visual processing in a healthy population. We recruited 75 individuals (39 females and 36 males, mean age = 23.01 years, SD = 3.23 years) and assessed autistic traits using the Autism Spectrum Quotient, and sensory sensitivity using the Sensory Sensitivity Scales. Sensory processing in the visual domain was examined with the radial motion stimulus and the auditory domain was assessed with the 1,000 Hz pure tone stimulus with electroencephalography-evoked potentials. The results showed that the auditory sensitivity scores of the males (r&lt;sub&gt;aud&lt;/sub&gt; (34) = 0.396, p&lt;sub&gt;aud&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.017) and the visual sensitivity scores of females were correlated with autistic traits (r&lt;sub&gt;vis&lt;/sub&gt; (37) = 0.420, p&lt;sub&gt;vis&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.008). Moreover, the P2 latency for the auditory stimulus was prolonged in the participants with a higher level of autistic traits (r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (61) = 0.411, p = 0.008), and this correlation was only observed in males (r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (31) = 0.542, p = 0.001). We propose that auditory processing differences are related to autistic traits in neurotypicals, particularly in males. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering sex differences in autistic traits and ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Electrophysiological and Behavioral Correlates of Valence, Arousal and Subjective Significance in the Lexical Decision Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.567220</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The emotional properties of words, such as valence and arousal, influence the way we perceive and process verbal stimuli. Recently, subjective significance was found to be an additional factor describing the activational aspect of emotional reactions, which is vital for the cognitive consequences of emotional stimuli processing. Subjective significance represents the form of mental activation specific to reflective mind processing. The Lexical Decision Task (LDT) is a paradigm allowing the investigation of the involuntary processing of meaning and differentiating this processing from the formal processing of the perceptual features of words. In this study, we wanted to search for the consequences of valence, arousal, and subjective significance for the involuntary processing of verbal stimuli meaning indexed by both behavioral measures (reaction latencies) and electrophysiological measures (Event-Related Potentials: ERPs). We expected subjective significance, as the reflective form of activation, to shorten response latencies in LDT. We also expected subjective significance to modulate the amplitude of the ERP FN400 component, reducing the negative-going deflection of the potential. We expected valence to shape the LPC component amplitude, differentiating between negative and positive valences, since the LPC indexes the meaning processing. Indeed, the results confirmed our expectations and showed that subjective significance is a factor independent from the arousal and valence that shapes the involuntary processing of verbal stimuli, especially the detection of a link between stimulus and meaning indexed by the FN400. Moreover, we found that the LPC amplitude was differentiated by valence level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Correlates of Smartphone Dependence in Adolescents</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.564629</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increases in depressive and suicide-related symptoms among United States adolescents have been recently linked to increased use of smartphones. Understanding of the brain mechanisms that underlie the potential smartphone dependence may help develop interventions to address this important problem. In this exploratory study, we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying potential smartphone dependence in a sample of 19 adolescent volunteers who completed self-assessments of their smartphone dependence, depressive symptoms, and sleep problems. All 19 adolescents underwent diffusion MRI that allowed for assessment of white matter structural connectivity within the framework of connectomics. Based on previous literature on the neurobiology of addiction, we hypothesized a disruption of network centrality of three nodes in the mesolimbic network: Nucleus Accumbens, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala. Our results showed positive correlations between the node centrality of the right amygdala and self-reported smartphone dependence, between smartphone dependence and sleep problems, and between sleep problems and depressive symptoms. A higher phone dependence was observed in females compared to males. Supported by these results, we propose a model of how smartphone dependence can be linked to aberrations in brain networks, sex, sleep disturbances, and depression in adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Robust EEG-Based Decoding of Auditory Attention With High-RMS-Level Speech Segments in Noisy Conditions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.557534</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The attended speech stream can be detected robustly, even in adverse auditory scenarios with auditory attentional modulation, and can be decoded using electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Speech segmentation based on the relative root-mean-square (RMS) intensity can be used to estimate segmental contributions to perception in noisy conditions. High-RMS-level segments contain crucial information for speech perception. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effect of high-RMS-level speech segments on auditory attention decoding performance under various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Scalp EEG signals were recorded when subjects listened to the attended speech stream in the mixed speech narrated concurrently by two Mandarin speakers. The temporal response function was used to identify the attended speech from EEG responses of tracking to the temporal envelopes of intact speech and high-RMS-level speech segments alone, respectively. Auditory decoding performance was then analyzed under various SNR conditions by comparing EEG correlations to the attended and ignored speech streams. The accuracy of auditory attention decoding based on the temporal envelope with high-RMS-level speech segments was not inferior to that based on the temporal envelope of intact speech. Cortical activity correlated more strongly with attended than with ignored speech under different SNR conditions. These results suggest that EEG recordings corresponding to high-RMS-level speech segments carry crucial information for the identification and tracking of attended speech in the presence of background noise. This study also showed that with the modulation of auditory attention, attended speech can be decoded more robustly from neural activity than from behavioral measures under a wide range of SNR.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sensory Prediction of Limb Movement Is Critical for Automatic Online Control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.549537</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.549537</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fast, online control of movement is an essential component of human motor skills, as it allows automatic correction of inaccurate planning. The present study explores the role of two types of concurrent signals in error correction: predicted visual reafferences coming from an internal representation of the hand, and actual visual feedback from the hand. While the role of sensory feedback in these corrections is well-established, much less is known about sensory prediction. The relative contributions of these two types of signals remain a subject of debate, as they are naturally interconnected. We address the issue in a study that compares online correction of an artificially induced, undetected planning error. Two conditions are tested, which only differ with respect to the accuracy of predicted visual reafferences. In the first, “Prism” experiment, a planning error is introduced by prisms that laterally displace the seen hand prior to hand movement onset. The prism-induced conflict between visual and proprioceptive inputs of the hand also generates an erroneous prediction of visual reafferences of the moving hand. In the second, “Jump” experiment, a planning error is introduced by a jump in the target position, during the orienting saccade, prior to hand movement onset. In the latter condition, predicted reafferences of the hand remained intact. In both experiments, after hand movement onset, the hand was either visible or hidden, which enabled us to manipulate the presence (or absence) of visual feedback during movement execution. The Prism experiment highlighted late and reduced correction of the planning error, even when natural visual feedback of the moving hand was available. In the Jump experiment, early and automatic corrections of the planning error were observed, even in the absence of visual feedback from the moving hand. Therefore, when predicted reafferences were accurate (the Jump experiment), visual feedback was processed rapidly and automatically. When they were erroneous (the Prism experiment), the same visual feedback was less efficient, and required voluntary, and late, control. Our study clearly demonstrates that in natural environments, reliable prediction is critical in the preprocessing of visual feedback, for fast and accurate movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: The Interplay of Synaptic Plasticity and Scaling Enables Self-Organized Formation and Allocation of Multiple Memory Representations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.541728</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.541728</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is commonly assumed that memories about experienced stimuli are represented by groups of highly interconnected neurons called cell assemblies. This requires allocating and storing information in the neural circuitry, which happens through synaptic weight adaptations at different types of synapses. In general, memory allocation is associated with synaptic changes at feed-forward synapses while memory storage is linked with adaptation of recurrent connections. It remains, however, largely unknown how memory allocation and storage can be achieved and the adaption of the different synapses involved be coordinated to allow for a faithful representation of multiple memories without disruptive interference between them. In this theoretical study, by using network simulations and phase space analyses, we show that the interplay between long-term synaptic plasticity and homeostatic synaptic scaling organizes simultaneously the adaptations of feed-forward and recurrent synapses such that a new stimulus forms a new memory and where different stimuli are assigned to distinct cell assemblies. The resulting dynamics can reproduce experimental in-vivo data, focusing on how diverse factors, such as neuronal excitability and network connectivity, influence memory formation. Thus, the here presented model suggests that a few fundamental synaptic mechanisms may suffice to implement memory allocation and storage in neural circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Prior Hypoxia Exposure Enhances Murine Microglial Inflammatory Gene Expression in vitro Without Concomitant H3K4me3 Enrichment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hypoxia (Hx) is a component of multiple disorders, including stroke and sleep-disordered breathing, which often precede or are comorbid with neurodegenerative diseases. However, little is known about how hypoxia affects the ability of microglia, resident CNS macrophages, to respond to subsequent inflammatory challenges that are often present during neurodegenerative processes. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that hypoxia would enhance or “prime” microglial pro-inflammatory gene expression in response to a later inflammatory challenge without programmatically increasing basal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. To test this, we pre-exposed immortalized N9 and primary microglia to hypoxia (1% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 16 h and then challenged them with pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) either immediately or 3–6 days following hypoxic exposure. We used RNA sequencing coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing to analyze primed microglial inflammatory gene expression and modifications to histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at the promoters of primed genes. We found that microglia exhibited enhanced responses to LPS 3 days and 6 days post-hypoxia. Surprisingly, however, the majority of primed genes were not enriched for H3K4me3 acutely following hypoxia exposure. Using the bioinformatics tool MAGICTRICKS and reversible pharmacological inhibition, we found that primed genes required the transcriptional activities of NF-κB. These findings provide evidence that hypoxia pre-exposure could lead to persistent and aberrant inflammatory responses in the context of CNS disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Glycyrrhizic Acid Improves Cognitive Levels of Aging Mice by Regulating T/B Cell Proliferation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is the substance with the highest content of triterpenoid saponins that can be extracted from licorice, and has anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and anticancer functions, among others. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of GA on cognitive decline in middle-aged mice and explore its mechanisms. We injected GA by the tail vein of C57BL/6 mice and measured their cognitive levels using the Morris water maze. The Morris water maze results demonstrated that GA improved learning and memory abilities in middle-aged mice. Furthermore, the RNA-sequencing and flow cytometric analyses revealed that GA could increase T and B cells. We then confirmed the relationship between cognition and the immune system in the immune-deficient B-NDG mouse model. Our results suggest that GA improves cognition in aging mice by regulating T/B cell proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Quantitative Digitography Measures Fine Motor Disturbances in Chronically Treated HIV Similar to Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.539598</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.539598</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Motor and cognitive deficits were compared in aging, chronically treated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) people, people with mild-to-moderate stage Parkinson’s disease (PD), and healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Groups consisted of 36 people with PD, 28 with HIV infection, and 28 healthy controls. Motor function was assessed with the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS-III) and a rapid alternating finger tapping (RAFT) task on an engineered keyboard known as Quantitative Digitography (QDG). Executive function, verbal memory, and visuospatial processing were assessed using standard neuropsychological tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: HIV demonstrated RAFT deficits similar to PD such as reduced amplitude (P = 0.023) and greater amplitude variability (P = 0.019) in the index finger when compared to controls. This fine motor disturbance correlated with HIV’s immune health, measured by their CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell count (P &amp;lt; 0.01). The UPDRS did not yield motor differences between HIV and controls. Executive function and verbal memory were impaired in HIV (P = 0.006, P = 0.016, respectively), but not in PD; visuospatial processing was similarly impaired in HIV and PD (P &amp;lt; 0.05) although motor deficits predominated in PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Fine motor bradykinesia measured quantitatively by QDG RAFT holds promise as a marker of motor decline related to current immune health in aging HIV patients and may be useful in longitudinal studies regarding mechanisms of immunosenescence vs. potential toxicity of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in this population. Additionally, motor and cognitive networks in HIV may be affected differently as the disease progresses as observed in the differential patterns of impairment between HIV and PD, providing insight into the mechanisms of brain deterioration in HIV.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Cell-cell interactions influence all aspects of development, homeostasis, and disease. In cancer, interactions between cancer cells and stromal cells play a major role in nearly every step of carcinogenesis. Thus, the ability to record cell-cell interactions would facilitate mechanistic delineation of the role of cancer microenvironment. Here, we describe GFP-based Touching Nexus (G-baToN) which relies upon nanobody-directed fluorescent protein transfer to enable sensitive and specific labeling of cells after cell-cell interactions. G-baToN is a generalizable system that enables physical contact-based labeling between various human and mouse cell types, including endothelial cell-pericyte, neuron-astrocyte, and diverse cancer-stromal cell pairs. A suite of orthogonal baToN tools enables reciprocal cell-cell labeling, interaction-dependent cargo transfer, and the identification of higher-order cell-cell interactions across a wide range of cell types. The ability to track physically interacting cells with these simple and sensitive systems will greatly accelerate our understanding of the outputs of cell-cell interactions in cancer as well as across many biological processes.</description>

	<description>The characterization of prostate epithelial hierarchy and lineage heterogeneity is critical to understand its regenerative properties and malignancies. Here, we report that the transcription factor RUNX1 marks a specific subpopulation of proximal luminal cells (PLCs), enriched in the periurethral region of the developing and adult mouse prostate, and distinct from the previously identified NKX3.1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; luminal castration resistant cells. Using scRNA-seq profiling and genetic lineage tracing, we show that RUNX1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; PLCs are unaffected by androgen deprivation, and do not contribute to the regeneration of the distal luminal compartments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a transcriptionally similar RUNX1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; population emerges at the onset of embryonic prostate specification to populate the proximal region of the ducts. Collectively, our results reveal that RUNX1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; PLCs is an intrinsic castration-resistant and self-sustained lineage that emerges early during prostate development and provide new insights into the lineage relationships of the prostate epithelium.</description>

	<title>eLife: Feedback control of Wnt signaling based on ultrastable histidine cluster co-aggregation between Naked/NKD and Axin</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59879</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59879</link>
	<description>Feedback control is a universal feature of cell signaling pathways. Naked/NKD is a widely conserved feedback regulator of Wnt signaling which controls animal development and tissue homeostasis. Naked/NKD destabilizes Dishevelled, which assembles Wnt signalosomes to inhibit the b-catenin destruction complex via recruitment of Axin. Here, we discover that the molecular mechanism underlying Naked/NKD function relies on its assembly into ultrastable decameric core aggregates via its conserved C-terminal histidine cluster (HisC). HisC aggregation is facilitated by Dishevelled and depends on accumulation of Naked/NKD during prolonged Wnt stimulation. Naked/NKD HisC cores co-aggregate with a conserved histidine cluster within Axin, to destabilize it along with Dishevelled, possibly via the autophagy receptor p62 which binds to HisC aggregates. Consistent with this, attenuated Wnt responses are observed in CRISPR-engineered flies and human epithelial cells whose Naked/NKD HisC has been deleted. Thus, HisC aggregation by Naked/NKD provides context-dependent feedback control of prolonged Wnt responses.</description>

	<title>eLife: Lack of airway submucosal glands impairs respiratory host defenses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59653</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59653</link>
	<description>Submucosal glands (SMGs) are a prominent structure that lines human cartilaginous airways. Although it has been assumed that SMGs contribute to respiratory defense, that hypothesis has gone without a direct test. Therefore, we studied pigs, which have lungs like humans, and disrupted the gene for ectodysplasin (&lt;i&gt;EDA-KO&lt;/i&gt;), which initiates SMG development. &lt;i&gt;EDA-KO&lt;/i&gt; pigs lacked SMGs throughout the airways. Their airway surface liquid had a reduced ability to kill bacteria, consistent with SMG production of antimicrobials. In wild-type pigs, SMGs secrete mucus that emerges onto the airway surface as strands. Lack of SMGs and mucus strands disrupted mucociliary transport in &lt;i&gt;EDA-KO&lt;/i&gt; pigs. Consequently, &lt;i&gt;EDA-KO&lt;/i&gt; pigs failed to eradicate a bacterial challenge in lung regions normally populated by SMGs. These in vivo and ex vivo results indicate that SMGs are required for normal antimicrobial activity and mucociliary transport, two key host defenses that protect the lung.</description>

	<description>The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays critical roles in tumor progression and metastasis. However, the contribution of ECM proteins to early metastatic onset in the peritoneal cavity remains unexplored. Here, we suggest a new route of metastasis through the interaction of integrin alpha 2 (ITGA2) with collagens enriched in the tumor coinciding with poor outcome in patients with ovarian cancer. Using multiple gene-edited cell lines and patient-derived samples, we demonstrate that ITGA2 triggers cancer cell adhesion to collagen, promotes cell migration, anoikis resistance, mesothelial clearance, and peritoneal metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, phosphoproteomics identify an ITGA2-dependent phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway leading to enhanced oncogenic properties. Consequently, specific inhibition of ITGA2-mediated cancer cell-collagen interaction or targeting focal adhesion signaling may present an opportunity for therapeutic intervention of metastatic spread in ovarian cancer.</description>

	<description>Blood development in multicellular organisms relies on specific tissue microenvironments that nurture hematopoietic precursors and promote their self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. The mechanisms driving blood cell homing and their interactions with hematopoietic microenvironments remain poorly understood. Here, we use the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; model to reveal a pivotal role for basement membrane composition in the formation of hematopoietic compartments. We demonstrate that by modulating extracellular matrix components, the fly blood cells known as hemocytes can be relocated to tissue surfaces where they function similarly to their natural hematopoietic environment. We establish that the Collagen XV/XVIII ortholog Multiplexin in the tissue-basement membranes and the phagocytosis receptor Eater on the hemocytes physically interact and are necessary and sufficient to induce immune cell-tissue association. These results highlight the cooperation of Multiplexin and Eater as an integral part of a homing mechanism that specifies and maintains hematopoietic sites in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

	<title>eLife: Biofilms deform soft surfaces and disrupt epithelia</title>

	<description>During chronic infections and in microbiota, bacteria predominantly colonize their hosts as multicellular structures called biofilms. A common assumption is that biofilms exclusively interact with their hosts biochemically. However, the contributions of mechanics, while being central to the process of biofilm formation, have been overlooked as a factor influencing host physiology. Specifically, how biofilms form on soft, tissue-like materials remains unknown. Here we show that biofilms of the pathogens &lt;i&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; can induce large deformations of soft synthetic hydrogels. Biofilms buildup internal mechanical stress as single cells grow within the elastic matrix. By combining mechanical measurements and mutations in matrix components, we found that biofilms deform by buckling, and that adhesion transmits these forces to their substrates. Finally, we demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/i&gt; biofilms can generate sufficient mechanical stress to deform and even disrupt soft epithelial cell monolayers, suggesting a mechanical mode of infection.</description>

	<title>eLife: Cerebellar patients have intact feedback control that can be leveraged to improve reaching</title>

	<description>It is thought that the brain does not simply react to sensory feedback, but rather uses an internal model of the body to predict the consequences of motor commands before sensory feedback arrives. Time-delayed sensory feedback can then be used to correct for the unexpected—perturbations, motor noise, or a moving target. The cerebellum has been implicated in this predictive control process. Here we show that the feedback gain in patients with cerebellar ataxia matches that of healthy subjects, but that patients exhibit substantially more phase lag. This difference is captured by a computational model incorporating a Smith predictor in healthy subjects that is missing in patients, supporting the predictive role of the cerebellum in feedback control. Lastly, we improve cerebellar patients’ movement control by altering (phase advancing) the visual feedback they receive from their own self movement in a simplified virtual reality setup.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Umbilical cord blood derived microglia-like cells to model COVID-19 exposure</title>

	<description>Microglia, the resident brain immune cells, play a critical role in normal brain development, and are impacted by the intrauterine environment, including maternal immune activation and inflammatory exposures. The COVID-19 pandemic presents a potential developmental immune challenge to the fetal brain, in the setting of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection with its attendant potential for cytokine production and, in severe cases, cytokine storming. There is currently no biomarker or model for in utero microglial priming and function that might aid in identifying the neonates and children most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental morbidity, as microglia remain inaccessible in fetal life and after birth. This study aimed to generate patient-derived microglial-like cell models unique to each neonate from reprogrammed umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells, adapting and extending a novel methodology previously validated for adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrate that umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells can be used to create microglial-like cell models morphologically and functionally similar to microglia observed in vivo. We illustrate the application of this approach by generating microglia from cells exposed and unexposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our ability to create personalized neonatal models of fetal brain immune programming enables non-invasive insights into fetal brain development and potential childhood neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities for a range of maternal exposures, including COVID-19.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Temporal transitions in post-mitotic neurons throughout the C. elegans nervous system</title>

	<description>In most animals, the majority of the nervous system is generated and assembled into neuronal circuits during embryonic development. However, during juvenile stages, nervous systems still undergo extensive anatomical and functional changes to eventually form a fully mature nervous system by the adult stage. The molecular changes in post-mitotic neurons across post-embryonic development and the genetic programs that control these temporal transitions are not well understood. Using the model organism C. elegans, we comprehensively characterized the distinct functional states (locomotor behavior) and corresponding distinct molecular states (transcriptome) of the post-mitotic nervous system across temporal transitions from early post-embryonic periods to adulthood. We observed pervasive changes in gene expression, many of which are controlled by the developmental upregulation of the conserved heterochronic miRNA lin-4/mir-125 and the subsequent promotion of a mature neuronal transcriptional program through the repression of its target, the transcription factor lin-14. The functional relevance of these molecular transitions are exemplified by a temporally regulated target gene of the lin-14 transcription factor, nlp-45, a neuropeptide-encoding gene. We found that nlp-45 is required for temporal transitions in exploratory activity across larval stages, across sexual maturation, and into a diapause arrest stage. Our studies provide new insights into regulatory strategies that control neuron-type specific gene batteries to modulate distinct behaviors states across temporal, sex and environmental dimensions of post-embryonic development, and also provides a rich atlas of post-embryonic molecular changes to uncover additional regulatory mechanisms.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Altered Dynamics of Cortical Beta-Oscillations during Motor Learning in Cerebellar Ataxia</title>

	<description>Cerebellar ataxia is associated with an implicit motor learning dysfunction, specifically, a miscalibration of internal models relating motor commands to state changes of the body. Explicit cognitive strategies could compensate for deficits in implicit calibration. Surprisingly, however, patients with cerebellar ataxia use insufficient strategies compared to healthy controls. We report a candidate physiological phenomenon of disrupted strategy use in cerebellar ataxia, reflected in an interaction of implicit and explicit learning effects on cortical beta oscillations. We recorded electroencephalography in patients with cerebellar ataxia (n=18), age-matched healthy controls (n=19), and young, healthy individuals (n=34) during a visuomotor rotation paradigm in which an aiming strategy was either explicitly instructed, or had to be discovered through learning. In young, healthy individuals, learning a strategy, but not implicit learning from sensory prediction error alone, decreased the post-movement beta rebound. Disrupted learning from sensory prediction error in patients, on the other hand, unmasked effects of explicit and implicit control that are normally balanced. Specifically, the post-movement beta rebound increased during strategy use when implicit learning was disrupted, i.e., in patients, but not controls. We conclude that a network disturbance due to cerebellar degeneration surfaces in imbalanced cortical beta oscillations normally involved in strategy learning.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Miro1-dependent Mitochondrial Dynamics in Parvalbumin Interneurons</title>

	<description>The spatiotemporal distribution of mitochondria is crucial for precise ATP provision and calcium buffering required to support neuronal signaling. Fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV) have a high mitochondrial content reflecting their large energy utilization. The importance for correct trafficking and precise mitochondrial positioning remains poorly elucidated in inhibitory neurons. Miro1 is a Ca2+-sensing adaptor protein that links mitochondria to the trafficking apparatus, for their microtubule-dependent transport along axons and dendrites, in order to meet the metabolic and Ca2+-buffering requirements of the cell. Here, we explore the role of Miro1 in PV+ interneurons and how changes in mitochondrial trafficking could alter brain network activity. By employing live and fixed imaging, we found that the impairments in Miro1-directed trafficking in PV+ interneurons altered their mitochondrial distribution and axonal arborization. These changes were accompanied by an increase in the ex vivo hippocampal {gamma}-oscillation (30 - 80 Hz) frequency and promoted anxiolysis. Our findings show that precise regulation of mitochondrial dynamics in PV+ interneurons is crucial for proper neuronal signaling and network synchronization.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Phase-locking of resting-state brain networks with the gastric basal electrical rhythm</title>

	<description>A network of myenteric interstitial cells of Cajal in the corpus of the stomach serves as its &quot;pacemaker&quot;, continuously generating a ca. 0.05 Hz electrical slow wave, which is transmitted to the brain chiefly by vagal afferents. A recent study combining resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) with concurrent surface electrogastrography (EGG), with cutaneous electrodes placed on the epigastrium, found 12 brain regions with activity that was significantly phase-locked with this gastric basal electrical rhythm. Therefore, we asked whether fluctuations in brain resting state networks (RSNs), estimated using a spatial independent component analysis (ICA) approach, might be synchronized with the stomach. In the present study, in order to determine whether any RSNs are phase-locked with the gastric rhythm, an individual participant underwent 22 scanning sessions; in each, two 15-minute runs of concurrent EGG and rsfMRI data were acquired. EGG data from three sessions had weak gastric signals and were excluded; the other 19 sessions yielded a total of 9.5 hours of data. The rsfMRI data were analyzed using group ICA; RSN time courses were estimated using dual regression; for each run, the phase-locking value (PLV) was computed between each RSN and the gastric signal. To assess statistical significance, PLVs from all pairs of &quot;mismatched&quot; data (EGG and rsfMRI data acquired on different days) were used as surrogate data to generate a null distribution for each RSN. Of a total of 18 RSNs, three were found to be significantly phase-locked with the basal gastric rhythm, namely, a cerebellar network, a dorsal somatosensory-motor network, and a default mode network. Disruptions to the gut-brain axis, which sustains interoceptive feedback between the central nervous system and the viscera, are thought to be involved in various disorders; manifestation of the infra-slow rhythm of the stomach in brain rsfMRI data could be useful for studies in clinical populations.</description>

	<description>Retinal ganglion cell axons provide the only link between the light sensitive and photon transducing neural retina and visual centers of the brain. Retinal ganglion cell axon degeneration occurs in a number of blinding diseases and the ability to stimulate axon regeneration from surviving ganglion cells could provide the anatomic substrate for restoration of vision. OTX2 is a homeoprotein transcription factor expressed in the retina and previous studies showed that, in response to stress, exogenous OTX2 increases the in vitro and in vivo survival of retinal ganglion cells. The present results show that, in addition to promoting adult retinal ganglion cell survival, OTX2 also stimulates the regeneration of their axons in vitro and in vivo. This dual activity of OTX2 on retinal ganglion cell survival and regeneration is of potential interest for degenerative diseases affecting this cell type.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Distinctive alteration of presynaptic proteins in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in Alzheimer's disease</title>

	<description>Synaptic degeneration has been reported as one of the best pathological correlate of cognitive deficit in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, the location of these synaptic alterations within hippocampal sub-regions, the vulnerability of the presynaptic versus postsynaptic compartments, and the biological mechanisms for these impairments remain unknown. Here, we performed immunofluorescence labeling of different synaptic proteins in fixed and paraffin embedded human hippocampal sections and report reduced levels of several presynaptic proteins of the neurotransmitter release machinery (complexin-1, syntaxin-1A, synaptotagmin-1 and synaptogyrin-1) in AD cases. The deficit was restricted to the outer molecular layer (OML) of the dentate gyrus whereas other hippocampal sub-fields were preserved. Interestingly, standard markers of postsynaptic densities (SHANK2) and dendrites (MAP2) were unaltered, as well as the relative number of granule cells in the dentate gyrus, indicating that the deficit is preferentially presynaptic. Notably, staining for the axonal components, myelin basic protein, SMI-312 and Tau, was unaffected, suggesting that the local presynaptic impairment does not result from axonal loss or alterations of structural proteins of axons. There was no correlation between the reduction in presynaptic proteins in OML and the extent of the amyloid load or of the dystrophic neurites expressing phosphorylated forms of Tau. Altogether, this study highlights the distinctive vulnerability of the OML of dentate gyrus and supports the notion of presynaptic failure in AD.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Stimulus-independent neural coding of event semantics: Evidence from cross-sentence fMRI decoding</title>

	<description>Multivariate neuroimaging studies indicate that the brain represents word and object concepts in a format that readily generalises across stimuli. Here we investigated whether this was true for neural representations of events described using sentences. Participants viewed sentences describing four events in different ways. Multivariate classifiers were trained to discriminate the four events using a subset of sentences, allowing us to test generalisation to novel sentences. We found that neural patterns in a left-lateralised network of frontal, temporal and parietal regions discriminated events in a way that generalised successfully over changes in the syntactic and lexical properties of the sentences used to describe them. In contrast, decoding in visual areas was sentence-specific and failed to generalise to novel sentences. In the reverse analysis, we tested for decoding of syntactic and lexical form, independent of the event being described. Regions displaying this coding were limited and largely fell outside the canonical semantic network. Our results indicate that a distributed neural network represents the meaning of event sentences in a way that is robust to changes in their structure and form. They suggest that the semantic system disregards the surface properties of stimuli in order to represent their underlying conceptual significance.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Impulsivity as Bayesian inference under dopaminergic control</title>

	<description>Bayesian models successfully account for several of dopamine (DA)'s effects on contextual calibration in interval timing and reward estimation. In these models, DA controls the precision of stimulus encoding, which is weighed against contextual information when making decisions. When DA levels are high, the animal relies more heavily on the (highly precise) stimulus encoding, whereas when DA levels are low, the context affects decisions more strongly. Here, we extend this idea to intertemporal choice tasks, in which agents must choose between small rewards delivered soon and large rewards delivered later. Beginning with the principle that animals will seek to maximize their reward rates, we show that the Bayesian model predicts a number of curious empirical findings. First, the model predicts that higher DA levels should normally promote selection of the larger/later option, which is often taken to imply that DA decreases 'impulsivity.' However, if the temporal precision is sufficiently decreased, higher DA levels should have the opposite effect -- promoting selection of the smaller/sooner option (more impulsivity). Second, in both cases, high enough levels of DA can result in preference reversals. Third, selectively decreasing the temporal precision, without manipulating DA, should promote selection of the larger/later option. Fourth, when a different post-reward delay is associated with each option, animals will not learn the option-delay contingencies, but this learning can be salvaged when the post-reward delays are made more salient. Finally, the Bayesian model predicts a correlation between behavioral phenotypes: Animals that are better timers will also appear less impulsive.</description>

	<description>We present a whole-brain in vivo diffusion MRI (dMRI) dataset acquired at 760 m isotropic resolution and sampled at 1260 q-space points across 9 two-hour sessions on a single healthy subject. The creation of this benchmark dataset is possible through the synergistic use of advanced acquisition hardware and software including the high-gradient-strength Connectom scanner, a custom-built 64-channel phased-array coil, a personalized motion-robust head stabilizer, a recently developed SNR-efficient dMRI acquisition method, and parallel imaging reconstruction with advanced ghost reduction algorithm. With its unprecedented resolution, SNR and image quality, we envision that this dataset will have a broad range of investigational, educational, and clinical applications that will advance the understanding of human brain structures and connectivity. This comprehensive dataset can also be used as a test bed for new modeling, sub-sampling strategies, denoising and processing algorithms, potentially providing a common testing platform for further development of in vivo high resolution dMRI techniques. Whole brain anatomical T1-weighted and T2-weighted images at submillimeter scale along with field maps are also made available.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Diffusion MRI Changes in the Healthy Aging Canine Brain</title>

	<description>White matter dysfunction and degeneration have been a topic of great interest in healthy and pathological aging. While ex vivo studies have investigated age-related changes in canines, little in vivo canine aging research exists. Quantitative diffusion MRI such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has demonstrated aging and neurodegenerative white matter changes in humans. However, this method has not been applied and adapted in vivo to canine populations. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that white matter diffusion changes frequently reported in human aging are also found in aged canines. The study used Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and a region of interest (ROI) approach to investigate age related changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AxD) and radial diffusivity (RD). The results show that, compared to younger animals, aged canines have significant decreases in FA in parietal and temporal regions as well as the corpus callosum and fornix. Additionally, AxD decreases were observed in parietal, frontal and midbrain regions. Similarly, an age-related increase in RD was observed in the right parietal lobe while MD decreases were found in the midbrain. These findings suggest that canine samples offer a model for healthy human aging as they exhibit similar white matter diffusion tensor changes with age.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Auditory Steady-State Responses During And After A Stimulus: Cortical Sources, and the Influence of Attention and Musicality</title>

	<description>The auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is an oscillatory brain response generated by periodic auditory stimuli and originates mainly from the temporal auditory cortices. Recent data show that while the auditory cortices are indeed strongly activated by the stimulus when it is present (ON ASSR), the anatomical distribution of ASSR sources involves also parietal and frontal cortices, indicating that the ASSR is a more complex phenomenon than previously believed. Furthermore, while the ASSR typically continues to oscillate even after the stimulus has stopped (OFF ASSR), very little is known about the characteristics of the OFF ASSR and how it compares to the ON ASSR. Here, we assessed whether the OFF and ON ASSR powers are modulated by the stimulus properties (i.e. volume and pitch), selective attention, as well as individual musical sophistication. We also investigated the cortical source distribution of the OFF ASSR using a melody tracking task, in which attention was directed between uniquely amplitude-modulated melody streams that differed in pitch. The ON and OFF ASSRs were recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) on a group of participants varying from low to high degree of musical sophistication. Our results show that the OFF ASSR is distinctly different from the ON ASSR in nearly every aspect. While the ON ASSR was modulated by the stimulus properties and selective attention, the OFF ASSR was not influenced by any of these factors. Furthermore, while the ON ASSR was generated primarily from temporal sources, the OFF ASSR originated mainly from the frontal cortex. These findings challenge the notion that the OFF ASSR is merely a continuation of the ON ASSR. Rather, they suggest that the OFF ASSR is an internally-driven signal that develops from an initial sensory processing state (ON ASSR), with both types of ASSRs clearly differing in cortical representation and character. Furthermore, our results show that the ON ASSR power was enhanced by selective attention at cortical sources within each of the bilateral frontal, temporal, parietal and insular lobes. Finally, the ON ASSR proved sensitive to musicality, demonstrating positive correlations between musical sophistication and ASSR power, as well as with the degree of attentional ASSR modulation at the left and right parietal cortices. Taken together, these results show new aspects of the ASSR response, and demonstrate its usefulness as an effective tool for analysing how selective attention interacts with individual abilities in music perception.</description>

	<description>During navigation, animals estimate their position using path integration and landmarks, engaging many brain areas. Whether these areas follow specialized or universal cue integration principles remains unknown. Here, we combined electrophysiology with virtual reality to quantify cue integration across thousands of neurons in three areas that support navigation: primary visual (V1), retrosplenial (RSC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Path integration influenced position estimates in MEC more than in V1 and RSC. V1 coded position retrospectively, likely reflecting delays in sensory processing, whereas MEC coded position prospectively, and RSC was intermediate between the two. In combining path integration with landmarks, MEC showed signatures of Kalman filtering, and we report a distance-tuned neural population that could implement such filtering through attractor dynamics. Our results show that during navigation, MEC serves as a specialized cortical hub for reconciling path integration and landmarks to estimate position and suggest an algorithm for calculating these estimates.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Unpredictability vs. volatility and the control of learning</title>

	<description>Influential research has stressed the importance of uncertainty for controlling the speed of learning, and of volatility (the inferred rate of change) in this process. This framework recasts biological learning as a problem of statistical inference, to produce prominent computational models that have extensive correlates in brain and behavior and burgeoning applications to psychopathology. Here, we investigate a neglected feature of these models, which is that learning rates are jointly determined by the comparison between volatility and a second factor, unpredictability (reflecting moment-to-moment stochasticity rather than systematic change). For the organism, volatility and unpredictability both manifest as noisy experiences, but for learning, they should have opposite effects: learning should speed up as volatility increases but slow down as unpredictability increases. Like volatility, unpredictability can vary and must be estimated by the learner. Previous work has focused on half this picture, studying how organisms estimate volatility while unpredictability is assumed fixed and known. The question how the brain estimates unpredictability (and ultimately, a full account of volatility, uncertainty and learning rates, which all depend on it) remains unaddressed. We introduce a new learning model, in which both unpredictability and volatility are learned from experience. We show evidence from the behavioral and decision neuroscience literatures that the brain distinguishes these two similar types of noise, so as to produce seemingly contradictory behavior in different situations. Further, the model highlights the extent to which inferences about volatility and unpredictability are interdependent, such that disruptions of computations related to volatility can impact computations related to unpredictability, and vice versa. We argue that this interdependence is apparent in learning following amygdala damage, and may have important implications for ongoing attempts to connect volatility and uncertainty to psychopathology.</description>

	<description>In response to environmental changes, the medial entorhinal cortex alters its single-cell firing properties. This flexibility in neural coding is hypothesized to support navigation and memory by dividing sensory experience into unique contextual episodes. However, it is unknown how the entorhinal circuit transitions between different representations, particularly when sensory information is not delineated into discrete contexts. Here, we describe spontaneous and abrupt transitions between multiple spatial maps of an unchanging task and environment. These remapping events were synchronized across hundreds of medial entorhinal neurons and correlated with changes in running speed. While remapping altered spatial coding in individual neurons, we show that features of the environment were statistically preserved at the population-level, enabling simple decoding strategies. These findings provoke a reconsideration of how medial entorhinal cortex dynamically represents space and broadly suggest a remarkable capacity for higher-order cortical circuits to rapidly and substantially reorganize their neural representations.</description>

	<description>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) tightly regulates the entry of molecules into the brain by tight junctions that seals the paracellular space and receptor-mediated transcytosis. It remains elusive to selectively modulate these mechanisms and to overcome BBB without significant neurotoxicity. Here we report that light stimulation of tight junction-targeted plasmonic nanoparticles selectively opens up the paracellular route to allow diffusion through the compromised tight junction and into the brain parenchyma. The BBB modulation does not impair vascular dynamics and associated neurovascular coupling, or cause significant neural injury. It further allows antibody and adeno-associated virus delivery into local brain regions. This novel method offers the first evidence of selectively modulating BBB tight junctions and opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions in the central nervous system.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A statistical 3D model of the human cortical vasculature to compute the hemodynamic fingerprint of the BOLD fMRI signal</title>

	<description>BOLD fMRI is a commonly used technique to map brain activity; nevertheless, BOLD fMRI is an indirect measurement of brain function triggered by neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling. Hence, the origin of the BOLD fMRI signal is quite complex, and the signal formation depends, among others, on the geometry of the cortical vasculature and the associated hemodynamic behavior. To characterize and quantify the hemodynamic contributions to the BOLD signal response in humans, it is necessary to adopt a computational model that resembles the human cortical vascular architecture and mimics realistic hemodynamic changes. To this end, we have developed a statistically defined 3D vascular model that resembles the human cortical vasculature. Using this model, we simulated hemodynamic changes triggered by a neuronal activation and local magnetic field disturbances created by the vascular topology and the blood oxygenation changes. The proposed model considers also the biophysical interactions and the intrinsic magnetic properties of the nearby tissue in order to compute a dynamic BOLD fMRI signal response. This computational pipeline results in an integrated biophysical model that can provide a better insight on the understanding and quantification of the hemodynamic fingerprint of the BOLD fMRI signal evolution.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Glutamatergic Control Of A Pattern-Generating Central Nucleus In A Gymnotiform Fish</title>

	<description>The activity of pattern-generating networks (CPG) may change under the control exerted by various neurotransmitters and modulators to adapt its behavioral outputs to different environmental demands. Although the mechanisms underlying this control have been well established in invertebrates, most of their synaptic and cellular bases are not yet well understood in vertebrates. Gymnotus omarorum, a pulse-type gymnotiform electric fish, provides a well-suited vertebrate model to investigate these mechanisms. G. omarorum emits rhythmic and stereotyped electric organ discharges (EODs), which function in both perception and communication. The EOD is considered the behavioral output of an electromotor CPG which, modulated by descending influences, organizes adaptive electromotor behaviors in response to environmental and social challenges. The CPG is composed of electrotonically coupled intrinsic pacemaker cells, which pace the rhythm, and bulbospinal projecting relay cells that contribute to organize the pattern of the muscle-derived effector activation that produce the EOD. We used electrophysiological and pharmacological techniques in brainstem slices of G. omarorum to investigate the underpinnings of the fast transmitter control of its electromotor CPG. We demonstrate that pacemaker, but not relay cells, are endowed with ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors subtypes. We also show, for the first time in gymnotiformes, that glutamatergic control of the CPG likely involves both AMPA-NMDA receptors transmitting and only-NMDA segregated synapses contacting pacemaker cells. Our data shed light on the fast neurotransmitter control of a vertebrate CPG that seems to exploit the kinetics of the involved postsynaptic receptors to command different behavioral outputs.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Lexical parafoveal previewing predicts reading speed</title>

	<description>While reading is an essential human skill, many of the neuronal mechanisms supporting reading are not well understood. In spite of the reduced visual acuity, parafoveal information plays a critical role in natural reading; however, it is strongly debated whether words are previewed parafoveally at the lexical level. This is a key dispute for competing models on reading and of great significance since lexical retrieval is important for guiding eye movements. We found evidence for parafoveal previewing at the lexical level by combining a novel rapid invisible frequency tagging (RIFT)10,11 approach with magnetoencephalography (MEG) and eye-tracking. In a silent reading task, target words of either low or high lexical frequency were tagged (flickered) subliminally at 60 Hz. The tagging response measured when fixating on the pre-target word reflected parafoveal previewing of the target word. We observed a stronger tagging response as early as 100 ms following fixations on pre-target words that were followed by target words of low compared with high lexical frequency. Moreover, the difference in tagging response with respect to target lexicality predicted individual reading speed. Our findings demonstrate that reading unfolds in the fovea and parafovea simultaneously to support fluent reading.</description>

	<description>Deep neural networks (DNN) have set new standards at predicting responses of neural populations to visual input. Most such DNNs consist of a convolutional network (core) shared across all neurons which learns a representation of neural computation in visual cortex and a neuron-specific readout that linearly combines the relevant features in this representation. The goal of this paper is to test whether such a representation is indeed generally characteristic for visual cortex, i.e. generalizes between animals of a species, and what factors contribute to obtaining such a generalizing core. To push all non-linear computations into the core where the generalizing cortical features should be learned, we devise a novel readout that reduces the number of parameters per neuron in the readout by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the previous state-of-the-art. It does so by taking advantage of retinotopy and learns a Gaussian distribution over the neuron's receptive field position. With this new readout we train our network on neural responses from mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and obtain a gain in performance of 7% compared to the previous state-of-the-art network. We then investigate whether the convolutional core indeed captures general cortical features by using the core in transfer learning to a different animal. When transferring a core trained on thousands of neurons from various animals and scans we exceed the performance of training directly on that animal by 12%, and outperform a commonly used VGG16 core pre-trained on imagenet by 33%. In addition, transfer learning with our data-driven core is more data-efficient than direct training, achieving the same performance with only 40% of the data. Our model with its novel readout thus sets a new state-of-the-art for neural response prediction in mouse visual cortex from natural images, generalizes between animals, and captures better characteristic cortical features than current task-driven pre-training approaches such as VGG16.</description>

	<description>Synchronization is a fundamental property of biological neural networks, playing a mechanistic role in both healthy and disease brain states. The medullary pacemaker nucleus of the weakly electric fish is a synchronized network of high-frequency neurons, weakly coupled via gap junctions. Synchrony in the pacemaker is behaviourally modulated on millisecond timescales, but how gap junctional connectivity enables such rapid resynchronization speeds is poorly understood. Here, we use a computational model of the pacemaker, along with graph theory and predictive analyses, to investigate how network properties, such as randomness and the directionality of coupling (bidirectional/non-rectifying versus directional/rectifying gap junctions) characterize the fast synchronization of the pacemaker network. Our results provide predictions about connectivity in the pacemaker and insight into the relationship between structural network properties and synchronization dynamics in neural systems more generally.</description>

	<description>Diffuse brain injury is better described as multi-focal, where pathology can be found adjacent to seemingly uninjured neural tissue. In experimental diffuse brain injury, pathology and pathophysiology have been reported far more lateral than predicted by the impact site. Finite element biomechanical models of diffuse brain injury predict regions of maximum stress and strain. However, the application of a skull with uniform thickness may mask the pathophysiology due to varying thickness of human and animal skulls. Force applied to the intact skull would diffuse the forces, whereas forces applied through an open skull are distributed along paths of least resistance within and then exiting the skull. We hypothesized that the local thickening of the rodent skull at the temporal ridges serves to focus the intracranial mechanical forces experienced during brain injury and generate predictable pathology in underlying cortical tissue. We demonstrated local thickening of the skull at the temporal ridges using contour analysis of coronal skull sections and oblique sectioning on MRI. After diffuse brain injury induced by midline fluid percussion injury (mFPI), pathological foci along the anterior-posterior length of cortex under the temporal ridges were evident acutely (1, 2, 7 days) and chronically (28 days) post-injury by deposition of argyophilic reaction product. Area CA3 of the hippocampus and lateral nuclei of the thalamus showed pathological change, suggesting that mechanical forces to or from the temporal ridges shear subcortical regions. A proposed model of mFPI biomechanics suggests that injury force vectors reflect off the skull base and radiate toward the temporal ridge due to the material properties of the skull based on thickness, thereby injuring ventral thalamus, dorsolateral hippocampus, and sensorimotor cortex. Surgically thinning the temporal ridge prior to injury reduced the injury-induced inflammation in sensorimotor cortex. These data build evidence for the temporal ridges of the rodent skull to contribute to the observed pathology, whether by focusing extracranial forces to enter the cranium or intracranial forces to escape the cranium. Pre-clinical investigations can take advantage of the predicted pathology to explore injury mechanisms and treatment efficacy.</description>

For infectious disease prevention, policy-makers are typically required to base policy decisions in light of operational and monetary restrictions, prohibiting implementation of all candidate interventions. To inform the evidence-base underpinning policy decision making, mathematical and health economic modelling can be a valuable constituent.
Applied to England, this study aims to identify the optimal target age groups when extending a seasonal influenza vaccination programme of at-risk individuals to those individuals at low risk of developing complications following infection. To perform this analysis, we utilise an age- and strain-structured transmission model that includes immunity propagation mechanisms which link prior season epidemiological outcomes to immunity at the beginning of the following season. Making use of surveillance data from the past decade in conjunction with our dynamic model, we simulate transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza in England from 2012 to 2018. We infer that modified susceptibility due to natural infection in the previous influenza season is the only immunity propagation mechanism to deliver a non-negligible impact on the transmission dynamics. Further, we discerned case ascertainment to be higher for young infants compared to adults under 65 years old, and uncovered a decrease in case ascertainment as age increased from 65 to 85 years of age.
Our health economic appraisal sweeps vaccination age space to determine threshold vaccine dose prices achieving cost-effectiveness under differing paired strategies. In particular, we model offering vaccination to all those low-risk individuals younger than a given age (but no younger than two years old) and all low-risk individuals older than a given age, while maintaining vaccination of at-risk individuals of any age. All posited strategies were deemed cost-effective. In general, the addition of low-risk vaccination programmes whose coverage encompassed children and young adults (aged 20 and below) were highly cost-effective. The inclusion of elder age-groups to the low-risk programme typically lessened the cost-effectiveness. Notably, elderly-centric programmes vaccinating from 65-75 years and above had the least permitted expense per vaccine.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YXYrHOVQBO8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Social behaviors are ubiquitous and crucial to an animal’s survival and success. The behaviors an animal performs in a social setting are affected by internal factors, inputs from the environment, and interactions with others. To quantify social behaviors, we need to measure both the stochastic nature of the behavior of isolated individuals and how this behavioral repertoire changes as a function of the environment and interactions between individuals. We probed the behavior of male and female fruit flies in a circular arena as individuals and within all possible pairings. By combining measurements of the animals’ position in the arena with an unsupervised analysis of their behaviors, we define the effects of position in the environment and the presence of a partner on locomotion, grooming, singing, and other behaviors that make up an animal’s repertoire. We find that geometric context tunes behavioral preference, pairs of animals synchronize their behavioral preferences across shared trials, and paired individuals display signatures of behavioral mimicry.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J7-bscTtJHs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Cholesterol binding to the sterol-sensing region of Niemann Pick C1 protein confines dynamics of its N-terminal domain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Vikas Dubey, Behruz Bozorg, Daniel Wüstner, Himanshu Khandelia&lt;/p&gt;

Lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol is a hallmark of Niemann Pick type C (NPC) disease caused by mutations primarily in the lysosomal membrane protein NPC1. NPC1 contains a transmembrane sterol-sensing domain (SSD), which is supposed to regulate protein activity upon cholesterol binding, but the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Using atomistic simulations, we show that in the absence of cholesterol in the SSD, the luminal domains of NPC1 are highly dynamic, resulting in the disengagement of the NTD from the rest of the protein. The disengaged NPC1 adopts a flexed conformation that approaches the lipid bilayer, and could represent a conformational state primed to receive a sterol molecule from the soluble lysosomal cholesterol carrier NPC2. The binding of cholesterol to the SSD of NPC1 allosterically suppresses the conformational dynamics of the luminal domains resulting in an upright NTD conformation. The presence of an additional 20% cholesterol in the membrane has negligible impact on this process. The additional presence of an NTD-bound cholesterol suppresses the flexing of the NTD. We propose that cholesterol acts as an allosteric effector, and the modulation of NTD dynamics by the SSD-bound cholesterol constitutes an allosteric feedback mechanism in NPC1 that controls cholesterol abundance in the lysosomal membrane.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FqaJ-_IesIk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) is a type of cortical plasticity operating in visual cortex of mammals that are endowed with binocular vision based on the competition‐driven disparity. Earlier, a molecular mechanism was proposed that catecholamines play an important role in the maintenance of ODP in kittens. Having survived the initial test, the hypothesis was further advanced to identify noradrenaline (NA) as a key factor that regulates ODP in the immature cortex. Later, the ODP‐promoting effect of NA is extended to the adult with age‐related limitations. Following the enhanced NA availability, the chain events downstream lead to the β‐adrenoreceptor‐induced cAMP accumulation, which in turn activates the protein kinase A. Eventually, the protein kinase translocates to the cell nucleus to activate cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). CREB is a cellular transcription factor that controls the transcription of various genes, underpinning neuronal plasticity and long‐term memory. In the advent of molecular genetics in that various types of new tools have become available with relative ease, ODP research has lightly adopted in the rodent model the original concepts and methodologies. Here, after briefly tracing the strategic maturation of our quest, the review moves to the later development of the field, with the emphasis placed around the following issues: (a) Are we testing ODP per se? (b) What does monocular deprivation deprive of the immature cortex? (c) The critical importance of binocular competition, (d) What is the adult plasticity? (e) Excitation–Inhibition balance in local circuits, and (f) Species differences in the animal models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Microchiropterans have a diminutive cerebral cortex, not an enlarged cerebellum, compared to megachiropterans and other mammals&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bcde8eb5-ad90-476f-ba1d-4c31d52c4336/cne24985-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herculano‐Houzel et al. examine numbers of neurons in the brain of 13 bat species and find that the apparently “enlarged” cerebellum of small echolocating bats has the same proportion of brain neurons as other mammals, and is more likely simply the result of a diminutive cerebral cortex.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small echolocating bats are set apart from most other mammals by their relatively large cerebellum, a feature that has been associated to echolocation, as it is presumed to indicate a relatively enlarged number of neurons in the cerebellum in comparison to other brain structures. Here we quantify the neuronal composition of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and remaining brain structures of seven species of large Pteropodid bats (formerly classified as megachiropterans), one of which echolocates, and six species of small bats (formerly classified as microchiropterans), all of which echolocate. This chiropteran data is compared to 60 mammalian species in our dataset to determine whether the relatively large cerebellum of the small echolocating bats, and possibly that of the echolocating Pteropodid, contains a relatively enlarged number of neurons. We find no evidence that the distribution of neurons differs between microchiropterans and megachiropterans, but our data indicate that microchiropterans, like the smallest shrew in our dataset, have diminutive cerebral cortices, which makes the cerebellum appear relatively large. We propose that, in agreement with the diminutive brain size of the earliest fossil mammals, this is a plesiomorphic, not a derived, feature of microchiropteran brains. The results of this study also reveal important neural characteristics related to the phylogenetic affinities and relationships of the chiropterans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The effect of optic nerve section on form deprivation myopia in the guinea pig</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The effect of optic nerve section on form deprivation myopia in the guinea pig&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2a0b0582-4e0b-412c-abf4-3b37e72c7705/cne24961-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myopic eyes grow too long so images are focused short of the retina. What controls this excessive growth? We know that across species, deprivation of detailed vision (form deprivation, FD) increases the rate of eye elongation and induces myopia. When the FD ceases, these myopic eyes then slow their growth and recover from their myopia. We show here that in young mammalian eyes, this bidirectional response still occurs after the optic nerve is cut, implicating local retinal control of eye growth. However, the FD eye grows excessively after optic nerve section showing that the fine‐tuning of eye growth requires an intact optic nerve.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myopia is induced when a growing eye wears a diffuser that deprives it of detailed spatial vision (form deprivation, FD). In chickens with optic nerve section (ONS), FD myopia still occurs, suggesting that the signals underlying myopia reside within the eye. As avian eyes differ from mammals, we asked whether local mechanisms also underlie FD myopia in a mammalian model. Young guinea pigs underwent either sham surgery followed by FD (SHAM + FD, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 7); or ONS followed by FD (ONS + FD, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 7); or ONS without FD (ONS, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 9). FD was initiated 3 days after surgery with a diffuser that was worn on the surgically treated eye for 14 days. Animals with ONS + FD developed −8.9 D of relative myopia and elongated by 135 μm more than in their untreated eyes after 2 weeks of FD. These changes were significantly greater than those in SHAM + FD animals (−5.5 D and 40 μm of elongation after 14 days of FD), and reflected exaggerated elongation of the posterior vitreous chamber. The myopia reversed when FD was discontinued, despite ONS, but eyes did not recover back to normal (30 days after surgery, ONS + FD eyes still retained −3 D of relative myopia when SHAM+FD animals had returned to normal). No long‐term residual myopia was present after ONS alone, ruling out a surgical artifact. Although the gross mechanism signaling myopic ocular growth and its recovery in the young mammalian eye does not require an intact optic nerve, its fine‐tuning is disrupted by ONS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;

We previously reported in young chicks bidirectional gene expression regulation of the &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt; in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) after visual manipulation, tied to the direction of induced eye growth changes. Here we report local (regional) differences in expression patterns that were also treatment specific. Both &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BMP4&lt;/i&gt; genes showed the expected increased expression with imposed myopic defocus (+10 D lens) after 2 and 48 hr, albeit limited to central and mid‐peripheral RPE zones. In contrast, the expected decrease in &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression with imposed hyperopic defocus (−10 D lens) was evident across all three zones after both 2 and 48 hr, with similar patterns observed after 48 hr with FD. Similar but smaller changes were recorded for &lt;i&gt;BMP4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BMP7&lt;/i&gt; gene expression with the latter myopia‐inducing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We previously reported bidirectional gene expression regulation of the Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (&lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt;) in chick retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in response to imposed optical defocus and form‐deprivation (FD). This study investigated whether there are local (regional) differences in these effects. 19‐day old White‐Leghorn chicks wore monocular +10 or − 10 D lenses, or diffusers (FD) for 2 or 48 hr, after which RPE samples were collected from both eyes, from a central circular zone (3 mm radius), and 3 mm wide annular mid‐peripheral and peripheral zones in all cases. &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt; gene expression levels in RPE from treated and fellow control eyes were compared as well as differences across zones. With the +10 D lens, increased expression of both &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BMP4&lt;/i&gt; genes was observed in central and mid‐peripheral zones but not the peripheral zone after 2 and 48 hr. In contrast, with the −10 D lens &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression was significantly decreased in all three zones after 2 and 48 hr. Similar patterns of &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression were observed in all three zones after 48 hr of FD. Smaller changes were recorded for &lt;i&gt;BMP4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BMP7&lt;/i&gt; gene expression for both myopia‐inducing treatments. That optical defocus‐ and FD‐induced changes in &lt;i&gt;BMP&lt;/i&gt; gene expression in chick RPE show treatment‐dependent local (regional) differences suggest important differences in the nature and contributions of local retinal and underlying RPE regions to eye growth regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Categorical face perception in fish: How a fish brain warps reality to dissociate “same” from “different”&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c79c4bdd-439d-4304-92b6-8196f47758f1/cne24947-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many animals, just like humans, are able to categorize objects based on physical appearance. In humans, training improves performance in such tasks by distorting perceived similarity at the category boundary, a nonlinear effect termed categorical perception (CP). Here we sought evidence for a comparable effect in a lower vertebrate. Based on stimuli generated using a novel image morphing technique, we describe a series of visual discrimination experiments demonstrating CP of facial patterns in a reef fish, providing insight into the evolutionary origins and neural bases of this ability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categorical perception (CP) is the phenomenon by which a smoothly varying stimulus property undergoes a nonlinear transformation during processing in the brain. Consequently, the stimuli are perceived as belonging to distinct categories separated by a sharp boundary. Originally thought to be largely innate, the discovery of CP in tasks such as novel image discrimination has piqued the interest of cognitive scientists because it provides compelling evidence that learning can shape a category's perceptual boundaries. CP has been particularly closely studied in human face perception. In nonprimates, there is evidence for CP for sound and color discrimination, but not for image or face discrimination. Here, we investigate the potential for learned CP in a lower vertebrate, the damselfish &lt;i&gt;Pomacentrus amboinensis.&lt;/i&gt; Specifically, we tested whether the ability of these fish to discriminate complex facial patterns tracked categorical rather than metric differences in the stimuli. We first trained the fish to discriminate sets of two facial patterns. Next, we morphed between these patterns and determined the just noticeable difference (JND) between a morph and original image. Finally, we tested for CP by analyzing the discrimination ability of the fish for pairs of JND stimuli along the spectrum of morphs between two original images. Discrimination performance was significant for the image pair straddling the boundary between categories, and chance for equivalent stimulus pairs on either side, thus producing the classic “category boundary” effect. Our results reveal how perception can be influenced in a top‐down manner even in the absence of a visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Two decades ago Jack Pettigrew and I proposed the interhemispheric switch model of binocular rivalry and the sticky switch model of bipolar disorder. Here I describe the genesis, development, supporting data, and current status of these models. I also reflect on doing science with Pettigrew, his remarkable life in science, and how perspectives in science and medicine can fluctuate like the very phenomena on which we worked.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and medicine aim to identify verifiable and replicable truths. However, the paths to such truths are frequently characterized by swinging pendulums of opposing perspectives. This is especially so in human neuroscience and the brain‐based clinical sciences, where the target of investigation is the most complex of all biological systems. This article overviews a set of interrelated neuroscientific and clinical hypotheses, models, experiments, and predictions with which I have been involved for the last two decades. Traversing visual neuroscience, consciousness science, genetics, chronobiology, and biological and clinical psychiatry, the work illustrates how developments in science and medicine can occur through a combination of synthesis, serendipity, and experimentation. The article also reflects on doing science with the inimitable John “Jack” Pettigrew, and outlines how Pettigrew and I conceived, proposed, tested, and developed two new scientific models—one on neural mechanisms of binocular rivalry, the other on the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. I also provide an update on various aspects of our models and data, and describe lessons learned from Pettigrew on how perspectives in science exhibit their own fluctuations, ironically like the very phenomena on which we worked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This review in memoriam of Jack Pettigrew provides an overview of research into the phenomenon of perceptual rivalry, across a wide variety of species including insects, fish, reptiles, and primates. Perceptual rivalry is characterized by spontaneous alternations in perceptual state in response to ambiguous or conflicting sensory input. We highlight several interesting commonalities across species and use a comparative approach to better understand how the brain suppresses opposing sensory signals and generates alternations in perceptual dominance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review in memoriam of Jack Pettigrew provides an overview of past and current research into the phenomenon of multistable perception across multiple animal species. Multistable perception is characterized by two or more perceptual interpretations spontaneously alternating, or rivaling, when animals are exposed to stimuli with inherent sensory ambiguity. There is a wide array of ambiguous stimuli across sensory modalities, ranging from the configural changes observed in simple line drawings, such as the famous Necker cube, to the alternating perception of entire visual scenes that can be instigated by interocular conflict. The latter phenomenon, called binocular rivalry, in particular caught the attention of the late Jack Pettigrew, who combined his interest in the neuronal basis of perception with a unique comparative biological approach that considered ambiguous sensation as a fundamental problem of sensory systems that has shaped the brain throughout evolution. Here, we examine the research findings on visual perceptual alternation and suppression in a wide variety of species including insects, fish, reptiles, and primates. We highlight several interesting commonalities across species and behavioral indicators of perceptual alternation. In addition, we show how the comparative approach provides new avenues for understanding how the brain suppresses opposing sensory signals and generates alternations in perceptual dominance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Conditional and biased regeneration of cone photoreceptor types in the zebrafish retina&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/44e0864e-f0ac-47a9-a210-2502536e8bb7/cne24933-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regenerative capacity of the zebrafish, and the stereotypic organization of its retinal cell populations, enable examination of the specificity by which retinal Müller glial cells replace neurons that are lost. Zebrafish have four cone types, with peak sensitivities to red, green, blue, and ultraviolet wavelengths. Using a targeted cell ablation approach, we found that Müller glia produced cones of all types when all cones, red cones and UV cones were ablated. In contrast, blue cone ablation largely failed to generate cones. The relative proportions of regenerated cells of each type depended on the cone types that were ablated, and was biased toward the major cone type that was lost.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in regenerative medicine is replacing cells lost through injury or disease. While significant progress has been made, much remains unknown about the accuracy of native regenerative programs in cell replacement. Here, we capitalized on the regenerative capacity and stereotypic retinal organization of zebrafish to determine the specificity with which retinal Müller glial cells replace lost neuronal cell types. By utilizing a targeted genetic ablation technique, we restricted death to all or to distinct cone photoreceptor types (red, blue, or UV‐sensitive cones), enabling us to compare the composition of cones that are regenerated. We found that Müller glia produce cones of all types upon nondiscriminate ablation of these photoreceptors, or upon selective ablation of red or UV cones. Pan‐ablation of cones led to regeneration of the various cone types in relative abundances that resembled those of nonablated controls, that is, red &amp;gt; green &amp;gt; UV ~ blue cones. Moreover, selective loss of red or UV cones biased production toward the cone type that was ablated. In contrast, ablation of blue cones alone largely failed to induce cone production at all, although it did induce cell division in Müller glia. The failure to produce cones upon selective elimination of blue cones may be due to their low abundance compared to other cone types. Alternatively, it may be that blue cone death alone does not trigger a change in progenitor competency to support cone genesis. Our findings add to the growing notion that cell replacement during regeneration does not perfectly mimic programs of cell generation during development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: In search of common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and subplate</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;In search of common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and subplate&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1c125f53-aa84-4b09-8278-11227fa9b15b/cne24922-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarities in gene expression patterns prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity, and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Almost all of the markers we examined that were expressed in the subplate/Layer 6b were also expressed in the claustral complex, but not all claustrum specific or enriched genes were expressed in subplate/Layer 6b, suggesting overall similarities, but also some differences. There are numerous similarities between the adult connectivity patters of Layer 6b and claustrum. In particular, both have extensive cortical connections. However, there are differences in the relative strength of their reciprocal connectivity with various other structures in the adult. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human claustrum, a major hub of widespread neocortical connections, is a thin, bilateral sheet of gray matter located between the insular cortex and the striatum. The subplate is a largely transient cortical structure that contains some of the earliest generated neurons of the cerebral cortex and has important developmental functions to establish intra‐ and extracortical connections. In human and macaque some subplate cells undergo regulated cell death, but some remain as interstitial white matter cells. In mouse and rat brains a compact layer is formed, Layer 6b, and it remains underneath the cortex, adjacent to the white matter. Whether Layer 6b in rodents is homologous to primate subplate or interstitial white matter cells is still debated. Gene expression patterns, such as those of &lt;i&gt;Nurr1/Nr4a2&lt;/i&gt;, have suggested that the rodent subplate and the persistent subplate cells in Layer 6b and the claustrum might have similar origins. Moreover, the birthdates of the claustrum and Layer 6b are similarly precocious in mice. These observations prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity, and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;By combining intracortical electrical microstimulation (ICMS) with intrinsic optical imaging, we find that focal ICMS at single digit locations in monkey cortex (Areas 3a, 3b, 1, 2, and M1) reveals known anatomical connections. This novel method of studying cortical connections is in vivo, rapid, targeted, and mesoscale.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To map in vivo cortical circuitry at the mesoscale, we applied a novel approach to map interareal functional connectivity. Electrical intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in conjunction with optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OIS) was used map functional connections in somatosensory cortical areas in anesthetized squirrel monkeys. ICMS produced activations that were focal and that displayed responses which were stimulation intensity dependent. ICMS in supragranular layers of Brodmann Areas 3b, 1, 2, 3a, and M1 evoked interareal activation patterns that were topographically appropriate and appeared consistent with known anatomical connectivity. Specifically, ICMS revealed Area 3b connections with Area 1; Area 1 connections with Areas 2 and 3a; Area 2 connections with Areas 1, 3a, and M1; Area 3a connections with Areas M1, 1, and 2; and M1 connections with Areas 3a, 1, and 2. These somatosensory connectivity patterns were reminiscent of feedforward patterns observed anatomically, although feedback contributions are also likely present. Further consistent with anatomical connectivity, intra‐areal and intra‐areal patterns of activation were patchy with patch sizes of 200–300 μm. In summary, ICMS with OIS is a novel approach for mapping interareal and intra‐areal connections in vivo. Comparisons with feedforward and feedback anatomical connectivity are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Retinal topography and spectral sensitivity of the Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni)</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Retinal topography and spectral sensitivity of the Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/aecfa197-2730-4367-a5b8-e0c2c3d41093/cne24911-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Histological sections and electroretinography suggest the presence of a heavily rod dominated (and possibly rod‐only) retina in Port Jackson sharks. Mapping of the distribution of retinal neurons reveals a specialisation for higher visual acuity in a narrow horizontal band that corresponds to the part of the visual field covering the water‐substrate interface. Such a specialized retina would be well‐adapted to low‐light (scotopic) vision and a benthic lifestyle, and may assist the shark in finding food and avoiding predators.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated the visual system of the Port Jackson shark &lt;i&gt;Heterodontus portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt;, a shallow‐dwelling benthic species and generalist predator endemic to the temperate coastal waters around southern Australia. Measurements of retinal spectral sensitivity in juvenile sharks, made using single flash and heterochromatic flicker photometry under conditions of dark‐ or light‐adaptation, indicated a peak sensitivity at around 500 nm, with no evidence of a spectral shift with increasing levels of light adaptation. Histological sections of the retina revealed a heavily rod dominated retina containing only a few small cell profiles in the photoreceptor layer that might represent a sparse cone population or may be immature rods. Assessment of retinal topography in juvenile sharks indicated the presence of a distinct specialisation for increased visual spatial acuity in the form of a horizontal streak of higher rod photoreceptor (~80,000 rods mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) and ganglion cell (~1,800 cells mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) densities across the horizontal meridian of the eye. This specialization would be adaptive for panoramic sampling of the part of the visual field corresponding to the substrate‐water interface and remove the need for &lt;i&gt;H. portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt; to move its eyes extensively when resting on the sea floor. The estimated upper limit of spatial resolving power in juvenile &lt;i&gt;H. portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt; was 3.14 cycles deg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is at the lower end of values measured in elasmobranchs. Taken together, these results suggest that the retina of &lt;i&gt;H. portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt; is well adapted for nocturnal vision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Human brain neurons express a novel splice variant of excitatory amino acid transporter 5 (hEAAT5v)</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Human brain neurons express a novel splice variant of excitatory amino acid transporter 5 (hEAAT5v)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a32caef7-64b5-43d5-8395-3ebb1c600fe6/cne24907-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternately spliced human EAAT5 (hEAAT5v) which contains an additional intron after exon 7 of normally spliced human EAAT5 (7‐int) was cloned from human brain. Immunocytochemistry reveals expression of this protein in apical (A) and basal (B) dendrites and axons (Ax) of human cortical pyramidal neurons. The protein is also expressed by GABAergic neurons including Purkinje cells. It plausibly functions as a glutamate‐gated chloride conductance rather than as a glutamate transporter.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excitatory amino acid transporter 5 (EAAT5) is a protein that is known to be alternately spliced and to be abundantly expressed in the retina by populations of neurons including photoreceptors and bipolar cells. EAAT5 acts as a slow glutamate transporter and also as glutamate‐gated chloride channel, the chloride conductance being large enough for EAAT5 to serve functionally as an “inhibitory” glutamate receptor. However, there has been a long‐standing view that the classically spliced form of EAAT5 is not abundant or widespread in the brain and so it has not been extensively investigated in the literature. We recently identified a human‐specific splicing form of EAAT5 that was not expressed by rodents but was shown to be a functional glutamate transporter. We have examined the expression of this form of EAAT5, hEAAT5v at the mRNA, and protein level in human brain, and show that populations of human cortical pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells show significant expression of hEAAT5v. Accordingly, we infer that EAAT5 may well be a player in modulating neuronal function in the human brain and propose that its localization in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons could be compatible with a role in influencing intracellular chloride and thereby neuronal parameters such as membrane potential rather than acting as a presynaptic glutamate transporter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Retinal topography in two species of flamingo (Phoenicopteriformes: Phoenicopteridae)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/45845787-d549-45ca-bb17-973ee6e5cc67/cne24902-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated eye morphology and retinal topography in Caribbean and Chilean flamingos. Both species have a well‐defined visual streak, with the peak retinal ganglion cell densities located in a small central area. The organization of the visual system in these birds reflects their cathemeral activity pattern and the physical nature of the habitats in which they live.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we assessed eye morphology and retinal topography in two flamingo species, the Caribbean flamingo (&lt;i&gt;Phoenicopterus ruber&lt;/i&gt;) and the Chilean flamingo (&lt;i&gt;P. chilensis&lt;/i&gt;). Eye morphology is similar in both species and cornea size relative to eye size (C:A ratio) is intermediate between those previously reported for diurnal and nocturnal birds. Using stereology and retinal whole mounts, we estimate that the total number of Nissl‐stained neurons in the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer in the Caribbean and Chilean flamingo is ~1.70 and 1.38 million, respectively. Both species have a well‐defined visual streak with a peak neuron density of between 13,000 and 16,000 cells mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; located in a small central &lt;i&gt;area&lt;/i&gt;. Neurons in the high‐density regions are smaller and more homogeneous compared to those in medium‐ and low‐density regions. Peak anatomical spatial resolving power in both species is approximately 10–11 cycles/deg. &lt;i&gt;En‐face&lt;/i&gt; images of the fundus in live Caribbean flamingos acquired using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD‐OCT) revealed a thin, dark band running nasotemporally just dorsal to the pecten, which aligned with the visual streak in the retinal topography maps. Cross‐sectional images (B‐scans) obtained with SD‐OCT showed that this dark band corresponds with an area of retinal thickening compared to adjacent areas. Neither the retinal whole mounts, nor the SD‐OCT imaging revealed any evidence of a central fovea in either species. Overall, we suggest that eye morphology and retinal topography in flamingos reflects their cathemeral activity pattern and the physical nature of the habitats in which they live.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Jack Pettigrew was a pioneer in his approach to understanding sensory systems in birds. Here, we review his seminal research on owls as well as more recent studies aimed at understanding the evolution of sensory specializations in hummingbirds and tactile‐feeding species. We also review Pettigrew's work on two unusual, and rarely studied, Australian bird species that exhibit unique auditory and visual specializations in order to occupy their unique niches. Overall, we conclude that a comparative approach can yield unique insights into sensory system function in birds, as well as other vertebrates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Diversity” is an apt descriptor of the research career of Jack Pettigrew as it ranged from the study of trees, to clinical conditions, to sensory neuroscience. Within sensory neuroscience, he was fascinated by the evolution of sensory systems across species. Here, we review some of his work on avian sensory specialists and research that he inspired in others. We begin with an overview of the importance of the Wulst in stereopsis and the need for further study of the Wulst in relation to binocularity across avian species. Next, we summarize recent anatomical, behavioral, and physiological studies on optic flow specializations in hummingbirds. Beyond vision, we discuss the first evidence of a tactile “fovea” in birds and how this led to detailed studies of tactile specializations in waterfowl and sensorimotor systems in parrots. We then describe preliminary studies by Pettigrew of two endemic Australian species, the plains‐wanderer (&lt;i&gt;Pedionomus torquatus&lt;/i&gt;) and letter‐winged kite (&lt;i&gt;Elanus scriptus&lt;/i&gt;), that suggest the evolution of some unique auditory and visual specializations in relation to their unique behavior and ecology. Finally, we conclude by emphasizing the importance of a comparative and integrative approach to understanding avian sensory systems and provide an example of one system that has yet to be properly examined: tactile facial bristles in birds. Through reviewing this research and offering future avenues for discovery, we hope that others also embrace the comparative approach to understanding sensory system evolution in birds and other vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Adult hippocampal neurogenesis in Egyptian fruit bats from three different environments: Are interpretational variations due to the environment or methodology?&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1a9aefde-b6b9-4fe8-ac92-e7cf7f9a8a8d/cne24895-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using immunohistochemical and quantitative methods, we examined adult hippocampal neurogenesis in wild‐caught and captive‐bred Egyptian fruit bats. We find that the effect of the environment on this process is more method dependent than environment dependent, requiring a reassessment of how we interpret differences in the process of adult hippocampal neurogenesis between environments and species. This image shows doublecortin immunostained immature neurons in the dentate gyrus of an Egyptian fruit bat captured in the subtropical woodlands of South Africa.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We quantified both proliferative (Ki‐67 immunohistochemistry) and immature (doublecortin immunohistochemistry) cells within the dentate gyrus of adult Egyptian fruit bats from three distinct environments: (a) primary rainforest, (b) subtropical woodland, and (c) fifth‐generation captive‐bred. We used four different previously reported methods to assess the effect of the environment on proliferative and immature cells: (a) the comparison of raw totals of proliferative and immature cells; (b) these totals standardized to brain mass; (c) these totals expressed as a density using the volume of the granular cell layer (GCLv) for standardization; and (d) these totals expressed as a percentage of the total number of granule cells. For all methods, the numbers of proliferative cells did not differ statistically among the three groups, indicating that the rate of proliferation, while malleable to experimental manipulation or transiently in response to events of importance in the natural habitat, appears to occur, for the most part, at a predetermined rate within a species. For the immature cells, raw numbers and standardizations to brain mass and GCLv revealed no difference between the three groups studied; however, standardization to total granule cell numbers indicated that the two groups of wild‐caught bats had significantly higher numbers of immature neurons than the captive‐bred bats. These contrasting results indicate that the interpretation of the effect of the environment on the numbers of immature neurons appears method dependent. It is possible that current methods are not sensitive enough to reveal the effect of different environments on proliferative and immature cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for parvalbumin reveals the presence of large, multipolar, white matter interstitial cells (white matter neurons) in the subcortical white matter of the telencephalon of the Egyptian fruit bat.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large population of infracortical white matter neurons, or white matter interstitial cells (WMICs), are found within the subcortical white matter of the mammalian telencephalon. We examined WMICs in three species of megachiropterans, &lt;i&gt;Megaloglossus woermanni&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Casinycteris argynnis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Rousettus aegyptiacus&lt;/i&gt;, using immunohistochemical and stereological techniques. Immunostaining for neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN) revealed substantial numbers of WMICs in each species—&lt;i&gt;M. woermanni&lt;/i&gt; 124,496 WMICs, &lt;i&gt;C. argynnis&lt;/i&gt; 138,458 WMICs, and the larger brained &lt;i&gt;R. aegyptiacus&lt;/i&gt; having an estimated WMIC population of 360,503. To examine the range of inhibitory neurochemical types we used antibodies against parvalbumin, calbindin, calretinin, and neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). The calbindin and nNOS immunostained neurons were the most commonly observed, while those immunoreactive for calretinin and parvalbumin were sparse. The proportion of WMICs exhibiting inhibitory neurochemical profiles was ~26%, similar to that observed in previously studied primates. While for the most part the WMIC population in the megachiropterans studied was similar to that observed in other mammals, the one feature that differed was the high proportion of WMICs immunoreactive to calbindin, whereas in primates (macaque monkey, lar gibbon and human) the highest proportion of inhibitory WMICs contain calretinin. Interestingly, there appears to be an allometric scaling of WMIC numbers with brain mass. Further quantitative comparative work across more mammalian species will reveal the developmental and evolutionary trends associated with this infrequently studied neuronal population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neural coding of action in three dimensions: Task‐ and time‐invariant reference frames for visuospatial and motor‐related activity in parietal area V6A&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/22dc559f-a068-4179-a8f7-b77c70bc8216/cne24889-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visually guided action requires integrating information from multiple sources and encoding flexible action representations. We look at objects that we might reach, but also use them as a cue to act in another spatial location. This research article examines the sensorimotor transformations in parietal cortex occurring when we perform various actions in three‐dimensional space.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goal‐directed movements involve a series of neural computations that compare the sensory representations of goal location and effector position, and transform these into motor commands. Neurons in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) control several effectors (e.g., eye, hand, foot) and encode goal location in a variety of spatial coordinate systems, including those anchored to gaze direction, and to the positions of the head, shoulder, or hand. However, there is little evidence on whether reference frames depend also on the effector and/or type of motor response. We addressed this issue in macaque PPC area V6A, where previous reports using a fixate‐to‐reach in depth task, from different starting arm positions, indicated that most units use mixed body/hand‐centered coordinates. Here, we applied singular value decomposition and gradient analyses to characterize the reference frames in V6A while the animals, instead of arm reaching, performed a nonspatial motor response (hand lift). We found that most neurons used mixed body/hand coordinates, instead of “pure” body‐, or hand‐centered coordinates. During the task progress the effect of hand position on activity became stronger compared to target location. Activity consistent with body‐centered coding was present only in a subset of neurons active early in the task. Applying the same analyses to a population of V6A neurons recorded during the fixate‐to‐reach task yielded similar results. These findings suggest that V6A neurons use consistent reference frames between spatial and nonspatial motor responses, a functional property that may allow the integration of spatial awareness and movement control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The postnatal development of MT, V1, LGN, pulvinar and SC in prosimian galagos (Otolemur garnettii)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6c96d210-f11b-4683-9715-04c448be4335/cne24885-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle temporal visual area (MT) is revealed by parvalbumin immunoreactivity in early development (P3) of galagos, suggesting that MT resembles the primary sensory areas by developing early, and the early development of MT may influence the subsequent development of dorsal stream visual areas.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considerable evidence supports the premise that the visual system of primates develops hierarchically, with primary visual cortex developing structurally and functionally first, thereby influencing the subsequent development of higher cortical areas. An apparent exception is the higher order middle temporal visual area (MT), which appears to be histologically distinct near the time of birth in marmosets. Here we used a number of histological and immunohistological markers to evaluate the maturation of cortical and subcortical components of the visual system in galagos ranging from newborns to adults. Galagos are representative of the large strepsirrhine branch of primate evolution, and studies of these primates help identify brain features that are broadly similar across primate taxa. The histological results support the view that MT is functional at or near the time of birth, as is primary visual cortex. Likewise, the superior colliculus, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, and the posterior nucleus of the pulvinar are well‐developed by birth. Thus, these subcortical structures likely provide visual information directly or indirectly to cortex in newborn galagos. We conclude that MT resembles a primary sensory area by developing early, and that the early development of MT may influence the subsequent development of dorsal stream visual areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Visualizing the dopaminergic innervation and myelinated dorsal arcopallium tract, we showed that the avian analogue to the prefrontal cortex (PFC), known as the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), adheres to a species‐specific variation. The NCL in pigeon and chicken is best described as a semilunar structure in the dorsolateral part of the caudal nidopallium. The NCL in carrion crow and zebra finch consists of at least three subareas (NCM, NCLd, and NCLv) that span across the entire back of the caudal forebrain.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the long, separate evolutionary history of birds and mammals, both lineages developed a rich behavioral repertoire of remarkably similar executive control generated by distinctly different brains. The seat for executive functioning in birds is the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) and the mammalian equivalent is known as the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Both are densely innervated by dopaminergic fibers, and are an integration center of sensory input and motor output. Whereas the variation of the PFC has been well documented in different mammalian orders, we know very little about the NCL across the avian clade. In order to investigate whether this structure adheres to species‐specific variations, this study aimed to describe the trajectory of the NCL in pigeon, chicken, carrion crow and zebra finch. We employed immunohistochemistry to map dopaminergic innervation, and executed a Gallyas stain to visualize the dorsal arcopallial tract that runs between the NCL and the arcopallium. Our analysis showed that whereas the trajectory of the NCL in the chicken is highly comparable to the pigeon, the two Passeriformes show a strikingly different pattern. In both carrion crow and zebra finch, we identified four different subareas of high dopaminergic innervation that span the entire caudal forebrain. Based on their sensory input, motor output, and involvement in dopamine‐related cognitive control of the delineated areas here, we propose that at least three morphologically different subareas constitute the NCL in these songbirds. Thus, our study shows that comparable to the PFC in mammals, the NCL in birds varies considerably across species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Investigation of consciousness (experience, mind, awareness, subjectivity) has become an accepted endeavor in neuroscience. One element of expanding a science of consciousness is appreciation of the interdependent co‐creation or enfolding of mind and world. Addressing this interdependence is part of the collaborative engagement of the traditions of Buddhism and science.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigation of consciousness (experience, mind, awareness, subjectivity) has become an accepted endeavor in contemporary neuroscience. However, current work is largely limited to study of neural correlates of consciousness. While this is interesting and important, it may not be sufficient to carry us to a place of truly new insight regarding consciousness. I argue that one element of expanding a science of consciousness is appreciation of the interdependent co‐creation or enfolding of mind and world. Addressing this interdependence is an aspect of the collaborative engagement of the traditions of Buddhism and science—a project that is exploring how complementary worldviews and analytic procedures might further the development of an expanded science of mind. In this essay, written for a collection honoring the life and work of Jack Pettigrew, I describe his connection to this project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual perception requires both visual information and attention. This review compares, across classes of vertebrates, the functional and anatomical characteristics of (a) the neural pathways that process visual information about objects, and (b) stimulus selection pathways that determine the objects to which an animal attends. Early in the evolution of vertebrate species, visual perception was dominated by information transmitted via the midbrain (retinotectal) visual pathway, and attention was probably controlled primarily by a selection network in the midbrain. In contrast, in primates, visual perception is dominated by information transmitted via the forebrain (retinogeniculate) visual pathway, and attention is mediated largely by networks in the forebrain. In birds and nonprimate mammals, both the retinotectal and retinogeniculate pathways contribute critically to visual information processing, and both midbrain and forebrain networks play important roles in controlling attention. The computations and processing strategies in birds and mammals share some strikingly similar characteristics despite over 300 million years of independent evolution and being implemented by distinct brain architectures. The similarity of these functional characteristics suggests that they provide valuable advantages to visual perception in advanced visual systems. A schema is proposed that describes the evolution of the pathways and computations that enable visual perception in vertebrate species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Do all mammals dream?&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/963fe370-7584-4676-bac7-5552b2bc1d4c/cne24860-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photograph of the ventral surface of the brain of the pygmy sperm whale (&lt;i&gt;Kogia breviceps&lt;/i&gt;). Of all mammals, the combination of unusual sleep physiology and associated neuroanatomy, cetaceans are the least likely mammals to experience vivid dream mentation while sleeping. Scale bar = 1 cm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of dreams in human sleep, especially in REM sleep, and the detection of physiologically similar states in mammals has led many to ponder whether animals experience similar sleep mentation. Recent advances in our understanding of the anatomical and physiological correlates of sleep stages, and thus dreaming, allow a better understanding of the possibility of dream mentation in nonhuman mammals. Here, we explore the potential for dream mentation, in both non‐REM and REM sleep across mammals. If we take a hard‐stance, that dream mentation only occurs during REM sleep, we conclude that it is unlikely that monotremes, cetaceans, and otariid seals while at sea, have the potential to experience dream mentation. Atypical REM sleep in other species, such as African elephants and Arabian oryx, may alter their potential to experience REM dream mentation. Alternatively, evidence that dream mentation occurs during both non‐REM and REM sleep, indicates that all mammals have the potential to experience dream mentation. This non‐REM dream mentation may be different in the species where non‐REM is atypical, such as during unihemispheric sleep in aquatic mammals (cetaceans, sirens, and Otariid seals). In both scenarios, the cetaceans are the least likely mammalian group to experience vivid dream mentation due to the morphophysiological independence of their cerebral hemispheres. The application of techniques revealing dream mentation in humans to other mammals, specifically those that exhibit unusual sleep states, may lead to advances in our understanding of the neural underpinnings of dreams and conscious experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Early postnatal gene expression in the developing neocortex of prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) is related to parental rearing style</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24856?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Early postnatal gene expression in the developing neocortex of prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) is related to parental rearing style&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/74e3419e-c2c8-42f5-b219-60e1d99c1c65/cne24856-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prairie voles have a naturally occurring variation in parenting style. Dams and sires, left, can be classified as “high contact” or “low contact” (LC) parents. The adult offspring of high and LC parents show variation in cortical organization and connections. Here, we investigate whether these cortical variations are present at birth, possibly due to epigenetic modifications from altered rearing styles, or whether they are acquired through different contact‐related sensory experiences in early life. By examining the gene expression patterns within the neocortex of newborn voles, we determined that some differences are present in early infancy, such as a lateral shift in &lt;i&gt;Id2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression in LC offspring (right). These results suggest that differences in cortical connections are not present at birth and are likely modulated by differences in parental rearing style. However, differences in gene expression are present and may contribute to anatomical and functional differences observed in adult offspring.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest and most prevalent sensory experience includes tactile, thermal, and olfactory stimulation delivered to the young via contact with the mother, and in some mammals, the father. Prairie voles (&lt;i&gt;Microtus ochrogaster&lt;/i&gt;), like humans, are biparental and serve as a model for understanding the impact of parent/offspring interactions on the developing brain. Prairie voles also exhibit natural variation in the level of tactile stimulation delivered by the parents to the offspring, and this has been well documented and quantified. Previous studies revealed that adult prairie vole offspring who received either high (HC) or low (LC) tactile contact from their parents have differences in the size of cortical fields and the connections of somatosensory cortex. In the current investigation, we examined gene expression, intraneocortical connectivity, and cortical thickness in newborn voles to appreciate when differences in HC and LC offspring begin to emerge. We observed differences in developmentally regulated genes, as well as variation in prelimbic and anterior cingulate cortical thickness at postnatal Day 1 (P1) in HC and LC voles. Results from this study suggest that parenting styles, such as those involving high or low physical contact, impact the developing neocortex via very early sensory experience as well as differences in epigenetic modifications that may emerge in HC and LC voles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Evolutionary shifts dramatically reorganized the human hippocampal complex&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1138b205-ba2f-440f-ab8e-3a1189f8f4d0/cne24822-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timeline of hippocampal complex (HC) reorganization events in primate evolution leading to the human lineage. The six key stages of this deep evolutionary history marked by violet circles over their respective nodes on the phylogenetic tree, and described in the boxes below.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampal complex (HC) is central to long‐term memory storage and retrieval as well as spatial navigation across many species. Notably, humans appear to have greatly enhanced and possibly unique HC‐mediated capacities such as constructive episodic simulation. Key studies have shown that the human HC is disproportionately large amongst hominoids, but much remains unknown at the levels of substructural evolutionary reorganization and ecological selection. Here, we calculated relative sizes of 12 HC subregions in a diverse sample of 44 primate species. We then used a Bayesian phylogenetic method, selective regime analysis, to identify 27 separate evolutionary shifts in HC organization across 65 million years of primate evolution. Additionally, a series of multivariate phylogenetic regressions using HC‐related ecological variables as predictors (Diet Breadth, Population Density, Group Size, Home Range Size, and Residual Home Range) revealed that relative fascia dentata and CA1 size were both significantly predicted by species' home range size (after correcting for body size). However, perhaps the most notable finding of this study was that the shifts in HC size and subregional organization in the human lineage were the largest seen in all of primate evolution, rendering modern humans with a HC that is a clear outlier amongst all nonhuman primates investigated here. Given the extensive literature confirming the relationship between HC organization and function, these selective shifts are likely to have played a significant role in the emergence of human‐specific capacities, such as constructive episodic simulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Major depressive disorder emerges from the complex interactions of biological systems that span genes and molecules through cells, networks, and behavior. Establishing how neurobiological processes coalesce to contribute to depression requires a multiscale approach, encompassing measures of brain structure and function as well as genetic and cell-specific transcriptional data.

&lt;p&gt;High‐level cognitive abilities such as navigation and spatial memory are thought to rely on the activity of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), which encode the animal's position in space with periodic triangular patterns. Yet the neural mechanisms that underlie grid‐cell activity are still unknown. Recent in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that grid cells are embedded in highly structured recurrent networks. But how could recurrent connectivity become structured during development? And what is the functional role of these connections? With mathematical modeling and simulations, we show that recurrent circuits in the MEC could emerge under the supervision of weakly grid‐tuned feedforward inputs. We demonstrate that a learned excitatory connectivity could amplify grid patterns when the feedforward sensory inputs are available and sustain attractor states when the sensory cues are lost. Finally, we propose a Fourier‐based measure to quantify the spatial periodicity of grid patterns: the grid‐tuning index.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Absence of Neuronal Autoantibodies in Neuropsychiatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25908?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25908?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to characterise both neuronal autoantibodies and levels of interferon α, two proposed causative agents in neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from 35 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 15 with NPSLE) showed no antibodies against natively expressed N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDARs), or the surface of live hippocampal neurons. By comparison to controls (n = 104), patients with SLE had antibodies that bound to a peptide representing the extracellular domain of NMDARs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), however, binding was retained against both rearranged peptides and no peptide (r = 0.85 and r = 0.79, respectively, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). In summary, neuronal‐surface reactive antibodies were not detected in NPSLE. Further, while interferon α levels were higher in SLE (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), they lacked specificity for NPSLE. Our findings mandate a search for novel biomarkers in this condition.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Hypersensitivity to Calcitonin Gene–Related Peptide in Post‐Traumatic Headache</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25915?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25915?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate that calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) induces headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features in patients with persistent post‐traumatic headache (PTH) attributed to mild traumatic brain injury (TBI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, two‐way crossover study was conducted. Analyses were intention‐to‐treat. Eligible patients were aged 18 to 65 years and had a history of persistent PTH after mild TBI for at least 12 months. Patients were randomized to receive an intravenous infusion of 1.5μg/min of CGRP or placebo (isotonic saline) over 20 minutes on two separate experimental days. A 12‐hour observational period was used to evaluate the following outcomes: (1) difference in incidence of headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features and (2) difference in area under the curve for headache intensity scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty patients (mean age = 37 years, 25 women [83%]) were randomized and completed the study. During the 12‐hour observational period, 21 of 30 patients (70%) developed headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features after CGRP, compared with 6 patients (20%) after placebo (&lt;i&gt;p &amp;lt;&lt;/i&gt; 0.001). The baseline‐corrected area under the curve for headache intensity scores was significantly larger after CGRP, compared with placebo (&lt;i&gt;p &amp;lt;&lt;/i&gt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with persistent PTH are hypersensitive to CGRP, which underscores its pathophysiological importance. Furthermore, CGRP‐targeted therapies might provide a novel mechanism‐based treatment option for patients with persistent PTH. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02167</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is a multi-modal neuroimaging technique that provides
complementary spatial and temporal resolution for inferring a latent source
space of neural activity. In this paper we address this inference problem
within the framework of transcoding -- mapping from a specific encoding
(modality) to a decoding (the latent source space) and then encoding the latent
source space to the other modality. Specifically, we develop a symmetric method
consisting of a cyclic convolutional transcoder that transcodes EEG to fMRI and
vice versa. Without any prior knowledge of either the hemodynamic response
function or lead field matrix, the method exploits the temporal and spatial
relationships between the modalities and latent source spaces to learn these
mappings. We show, for real EEG-fMRI data, how well the modalities can be
transcoded from one to another as well as the source spaces that are recovered,
all on unseen data. In addition to enabling a new way to symmetrically infer a
latent source space, the method can also be seen as low-cost computational
neuroimaging -- i.e. generating an 'expensive' fMRI BOLD image from 'low cost'
EEG data.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Deep Representational Similarity Learning for analyzing neural signatures in task-based fMRI dataset. (arXiv:2010.02012v1 [eess.IV])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02012</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Similarity analysis is one of the crucial steps in most fMRI studies.
Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) can measure similarities of neural
signatures generated by different cognitive states. This paper develops Deep
Representational Similarity Learning (DRSL), a deep extension of RSA that is
appropriate for analyzing similarities between various cognitive tasks in fMRI
datasets with a large number of subjects, and high-dimensionality -- such as
whole-brain images. Unlike the previous methods, DRSL is not limited by a
linear transformation or a restricted fixed nonlinear kernel function -- such
as Gaussian kernel. DRSL utilizes a multi-layer neural network for mapping
neural responses to linear space, where this network can implement a customized
nonlinear transformation for each subject separately. Furthermore, utilizing a
gradient-based optimization in DRSL can significantly reduce runtime of
analysis on large datasets because it uses a batch of samples in each iteration
rather than all neural responses to find an optimal solution. Empirical studies
on multi-subject fMRI datasets with various tasks -- including visual stimuli,
decision making, flavor, and working memory -- confirm that the proposed method
achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art RSA algorithms.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In order to gain a mechanistic understanding of how tinnitus emerges in the
brain, we must build biologically plausible computational models that mimic
both tinnitus development and perception, and test the tentative models with
brain and behavioral experiments. With a special focus on tinnitus research, we
review recent work at the intersection of artificial intelligence, psychology
and neuroscience, indicating a new research agenda that follows the idea that
experiments will yield theoretical insight only when employed to test
brain-computational models. This view challenges the popular belief, that
tinnitus research is primarily data limited, and that producing large,
multi-modal, and complex datasets, analyzed with advanced data analysis
algorithms, will finally lead to fundamental insights into how tinnitus
emerges. However, there is converging evidence that although modern
technologies allow assessing neural activity in unprecedentedly rich ways in
both, animals and humans, empirical testing one verbally defined hypothesis
about tinnitus after another, will never lead to a mechanistic understanding.
Instead, hypothesis testing needs to be complemented with the construction of
computational models that generate verifiable predictions. We argue, that even
though, contemporary artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches
largely lack biological plausibility, the models to be constructed will have to
draw on concepts from these fields, since they have already proven to do well
in modeling brain function. Nevertheless, biological fidelity will have to be
increased successively, leading to ever better and fine-grained models,
allowing at the end for even testing possible treatment strategies in silico,
before application in animal or patient studies.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Connectomics and network neuroscience offer quantitative scientific
frameworks for modeling and analyzing networks of structurally and functionally
interacting neurons, neuronal populations, and macroscopic brain areas. This
shift in perspective and emphasis on distributed brain function has provided
fundamental insight into the role played by the brain's network architecture in
cognition, disease, development, and aging. In this chapter, we review the core
concepts of human connectomics at the macroscale. From the construction of
networks using functional and diffusion MRI data, to their subsequent analysis
using methods from network neuroscience, this review highlights key findings,
commonly-used methodologies, and discusses several emerging frontiers in
connectomics.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces a multi-level (m-lev) mechanism into Evolution
Strategies (ESs) in order to address a class of global optimization problems
that could benefit from fine discretization of their decision variables. Such
problems arise in engineering and scientific applications, which possess a
multi-resolution control nature, and thus may be formulated either by means of
low-resolution variants (providing coarser approximations with presumably lower
accuracy for the general problem) or by high-resolution controls. A particular
scientific application concerns practical Quantum Control (QC) problems, whose
targeted optimal controls may be discretized to increasingly higher resolution,
which in turn carries the potential to obtain better control yields. However,
state-of-the-art derivative-free optimization heuristics for high-resolution
formulations nominally call for an impractically large number of objective
function calls. Therefore, an effective algorithmic treatment for such problems
is needed. We introduce a framework with an automated scheme to facilitate
guided-search over increasingly finer levels of control resolution for the
optimization problem, whose on-the-fly learned parameters require careful
adaptation. We instantiate the proposed m-lev self-adaptive ES framework by two
specific strategies, namely the classical elitist single-child (1+1)-ES and the
non-elitist multi-child derandomized $(\mu_W,\lambda)$-sep-CMA-ES. We first
show that the approach is suitable by simulation-based optimization of QC
systems which were heretofore viewed as too complex to address. We also present
a laboratory proof-of-concept for the proposed approach on a basic experimental
QC system objective.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hopfield neural networks are a possible basis for modelling associative
memory in living organisms. After summarising previous studies in the field, we
take a new look at learning rules, exhibiting them as descent-type algorithms
for various cost functions. We also propose several new cost functions suitable
for learning. We discuss the role of biases (the external inputs) in the
learning process in Hopfield networks. Furthermore, we apply Newtons method for
learning memories, and experimentally compare the performances of various
learning rules. Finally, to add to the debate whether allowing connections of a
neuron to itself enhances memory capacity, we numerically investigate the
effects of self coupling.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In model-based learning, an agent's model is commonly defined over
transitions between consecutive states of an environment even though planning
often requires reasoning over multi-step timescales, with intermediate states
either unnecessary, or worse, accumulating prediction error. In contrast,
intelligent behaviour in biological organisms is characterised by the ability
to plan over varying temporal scales depending on the context. Inspired by the
recent works on human time perception, we devise a novel approach to learning a
transition dynamics model, based on the sequences of episodic memories that
define the agent's subjective timescale - over which it learns world dynamics
and over which future planning is performed. We implement this in the framework
of active inference and demonstrate that the resulting subjective-timescale
model (STM) can systematically vary the temporal extent of its predictions
while preserving the same computational efficiency. Additionally, we show that
STM predictions are more likely to introduce future salient events (for example
new objects coming into view), incentivising exploration of new areas of the
environment. As a result, STM produces more informative action-conditioned
roll-outs that assist the agent in making better decisions. We validate
significant improvement in our STM agent's performance in the Animal-AI
environment against a baseline system, trained using the environment's
objective-timescale dynamics.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Speech disorders such as stuttering disrupt the normal fluency of speech by
involuntary repetitions, prolongations and blocking of sounds and syllables. In
addition to these disruptions to speech fluency, most adults who stutter (AWS)
also experience numerous observable secondary behaviors before, during, and
after a stuttering moment, often involving the facial muscles. Recent studies
have explored automatic detection of stuttering using Artificial Intelligence
(AI) based algorithm from respiratory rate, audio, etc. during speech
utterance. However, most methods require controlled environments and/or
invasive wearable sensors, and are unable explain why a decision (fluent vs
stuttered) was made. We hypothesize that pre-speech facial activity in AWS,
which can be captured non-invasively, contains enough information to accurately
classify the upcoming utterance as either fluent or stuttered. Towards this
end, this paper proposes a novel explainable AI (XAI) assisted convolutional
neural network (CNN) classifier to predict near future stuttering by learning
temporal facial muscle movement patterns of AWS and explains the important
facial muscles and actions involved. Statistical analyses reveal significantly
high prevalence of cheek muscles (p&amp;lt;0.005) and lip muscles (p&amp;lt;0.005) to predict
stuttering and shows a behavior conducive of arousal and anticipation to speak.
The temporal study of these upper and lower facial muscles may facilitate early
detection of stuttering, promote automated assessment of stuttering and have
application in behavioral therapies by providing automatic non-invasive
feedback in realtime.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) are third-generation Artificial Neural Networks
(ANN) which are close to the biological neural system. In recent years SNN has
become popular in the area of robotics and embedded applications, therefore, it
has become imperative to explore its real-time and energy-efficient
implementations. SNNs are more powerful than their predecessors because they
encode temporal information and use biologically plausible plasticity rules. In
this paper, a simpler and computationally efficient SNN model using FPGA
architecture is described. The proposed model is validated on a Xilinx Virtex 6
FPGA and analyzes a fully connected network which consists of 800 neurons and
12,544 synapses in real-time.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has achieved impressive prediction accuracies in a variety of
scientific and industrial domains. However, the nested non-linear feature of
deep learning makes the learning highly non-transparent, i.e., it is still
unknown how the learning coordinates a huge number of parameters to achieve a
decision making. To explain this hierarchical credit assignment, we propose a
mean-field learning model by assuming that an ensemble of sub-networks, rather
than a single network, are trained for a classification task. Surprisingly, our
model reveals that apart from some deterministic synaptic weights connecting
two neurons at neighboring layers, there exist a large number of connections
that can be absent, and other connections can allow for a broad distribution of
their weight values. Therefore, synaptic connections can be classified into
three categories: very important ones, unimportant ones, and those of
variability that may partially encode nuisance factors. Therefore, our model
learns the credit assignment leading to the decision, and predicts an ensemble
of sub-networks that can accomplish the same task, thereby providing insights
toward understanding the macroscopic behavior of deep learning through the lens
of distinct roles of synaptic weights.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modeling communication dynamics in the brain is a key challenge in network
neuroscience. We present here a framework that combines two measurements for
any system where different communication processes are taking place on top of a
fixed structural topology: Path Processing Score (PPS) estimates how much the
brain signal has changed or has been transformed between any two brain regions
(source and target); Path Broadcasting Strength (PBS) estimates the propagation
of the signal through edges adjacent to the path being assessed. We use PPS and
PBS to explore communication dynamics in large-scale brain networks. We show
that brain communication dynamics can be divided into three main 'communication
regimes' of information transfer: absent communication (no communication
happening); relay communication (information is being transferred almost
intact); transducted communication (the information is being transformed). We
use PBS to categorize brain regions based on the way they broadcast
information. Subcortical regions are mainly direct broadcasters to multiple
receivers; Temporal and frontal nodes mainly operate as broadcast relay brain
stations; Visual and somato-motor cortices act as multi-channel transducted
broadcasters. This work paves the way towards the field of brain network
information theory by providing a principled methodology to explore
communication dynamics in large-scale brain networks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Over-parameterized deep neural networks trained by simple first-order methods
are known to be able to fit any labeling of data. Such over-fitting ability
hinders generalization when mislabeled training examples are present. On the
other hand, simple regularization methods like early-stopping can often achieve
highly nontrivial performance on clean test data in these scenarios, a
phenomenon not theoretically understood. This paper proposes and analyzes two
simple and intuitive regularization methods: (i) regularization by the distance
between the network parameters to initialization, and (ii) adding a trainable
auxiliary variable to the network output for each training example.
Theoretically, we prove that gradient descent training with either of these two
methods leads to a generalization guarantee on the clean data distribution
despite being trained using noisy labels. Our generalization analysis relies on
the connection between wide neural network and neural tangent kernel (NTK). The
generalization bound is independent of the network size, and is comparable to
the bound one can get when there is no label noise. Experimental results verify
the effectiveness of these methods on noisily labeled datasets.

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Learning-Dependent Transcriptional Regulation of BDNF by its Truncated Protein Isoform in Turtle</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01722-5</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The vertebrate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF&lt;/em&gt;) gene produces a number of alternatively spliced transcripts only some of which generate the BDNF protein required for synaptic plasticity and learning. Many of the transcripts are uncharacterized and are of unknown biological significance. Previously, we described alternative splicing within the protein-coding sequence of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF&lt;/em&gt; gene in the pond turtle (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;tBDNF&lt;/em&gt;) that generates a functionally distinct truncated protein isoform (trcBDNF) that is regulated during a neural correlate of eyeblink classical conditioning in ex vivo brainstem preparations. We hypothesized that trcBDNF has a dominant negative function because of its anticorrelated expression pattern compared to its full-length BDNF counterpart. The data presented here suggests that trcBDNF functions as a transcriptional repressor of a conditioning-inducible downstream &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;tBDNF&lt;/em&gt; promoter that controls expression of full-length BDNF required for learning. First, expression of full-length transcripts is negatively correlated with trcBDNF; transcripts are inhibited when endogenous trcBDNF is ectopically induced and expressed when trcBDNF is inhibited. Second, ChIP-qPCR assays of a recombinant trcBDNF protein, RtrcBDNF, show strong binding to the downstream &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;tBDNF&lt;/em&gt; exon III promoter that corresponds with inhibition of conditioning. Third, deletions of the C-terminus of RtrcBDNF result in inhibition of promoter binding and conditioning acquisition when a tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) binding site is accounted for. Finally, microinjection of RtrcBDNF directly into brainstem preparations inhibits conditioning. These data reveal a new mechanism of activity-dependent &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF&lt;/em&gt; transcriptional regulation and suggest that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF&lt;/em&gt; is an autoregulatory gene. How generalizable this mechanism is across plasticity genes remains to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cohen syndrome (CS) is an autosomal recessive congenital disorder characterized by mutation in the vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog B (VPS13B; formerly COH1) gene. In the current study, a Chinese family has two young sibling cases having a developmental delay, physical obesity, high myopia, and a special face, which suspected to be CS. The purpose of the study was to identify variants and further analyze their pathogenicity for CS. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed a compound heterozygous mutation in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VPS13B&lt;/em&gt; gene in the proband, which comprises a frameshift mutation in NM_017890.4: c.10076_10077delCA (p.T3359fs*29) and a putative splice site mutation in c.6940 + 1G &amp;gt; T. Both Minigene assay in vitro and splicing assay in vivo confirmed that the splicing mutation in c.6940 + 1G &amp;gt; T generates a frameshift transcript with whole exon 38 skipping. Eventually, quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that either of the two mutations can lead to degradation of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VPS13B&lt;/em&gt; gene at the transcriptional level. Functional studies of variants identified in CS patients are essential for their subsequent genetic counseling and prenatal diagnoses and could also be the start point for new therapeutic approaches, currently based only on symptomatic treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Cardiogenic vertigo: characteristics and proposed diagnostic criteria</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10252-4</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Early identification of cardiogenic vertigo (CV) is necessary to prevent serious complications of cardiovascular diseases. However, the literature is limited to case reports without detailed clinical features or diagnostic criteria. The aim of this study was to define characteristics of CV and propose diagnostic criteria. This study included patients with CV diagnosed at Pusan National University and Keimyung University Hospitals. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were analyzed. Of 72 patients with clinically suspicious CV, 27 were finally included. The age ranged from 63 to 88 years (75.1 ± 7.2 years). Recurrent vertigo occurred without syncopal attacks in 52% [95% CI, 32–71], while it preceded (37% [19–58]) or followed (11% [2–29]) syncope. The patients with recurrent isolated vertigo had suffered from symptoms from 15 days to 5 years until final diagnosis (median 122 days). The vertigo lasted only for a few seconds (93% [76–99]) or a few minutes (7% [1–24]). Fourteen patients presented with spinning vertigo, and one of them showed spontaneous downbeat nystagmus during the attack. Accompanying symptoms including chest discomfort, palpitation, headache, arm twitching, and lightheadedness were found in 70% [50–86]. Between patients with and without syncope, there was no difference in clinical parameters and results of cardiac function tests. The most common cardiac abnormality during the attacks of vertigo was bradyarrhythmia (89% [71–98]). Cardiovascular diseases can develop recurrent isolated vertigo without or preceding syncope. Onset age, duration of vertigo, accompanying symptoms, and underlying cardiac diseases can aid in differentiation from other vestibular disorders. Early identification of CV would reduce morbidity and mortality associated with cardiac syncope.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Seizures associated with antibodies against cell surface antigens are acute symptomatic and not indicative of epilepsy: insights from long-term data</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Clinicians have questioned whether any disorder involving seizures and neural antibodies should be called “(auto)immune epilepsy.” The concept of “acute symptomatic seizures” may be more applicable in cases with antibodies against neural cell surface antigens. We aimed at determining the probability of achieving seizure-freedom, the use of anti-seizure medication (ASM), and immunotherapy in patients with either constellation. As a potential pathophysiological correlate, we analyzed antibody titer courses.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Retrospective cohort study of 39 patients with seizures and neural antibodies, follow-up ≥ 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Patients had surface antibodies against the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;-methyl-&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-aspartate receptor (NMDAR, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 6), leucine-rich glioma inactivated protein 1 (LGI1, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 11), contactin-associated protein-2 (CASPR2, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 8), or antibodies against the intracellular antigens glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 kDa (GAD65, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 13) or Ma2 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1). Patients with surface antibodies reached first seizure-freedom (88% vs. 7%, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and terminal seizure-freedom (80% vs. 7%, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) more frequently. The time to first and terminal seizure-freedom and the time to freedom from ASM were shorter in the surface antibody group (Kaplan–Meier curves: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001 for first seizure-freedom; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001 for terminal seizure-freedom; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0042 for terminal ASM-freedom). Maximum ASM defined daily doses were higher in the groups with intracellular antibodies. Seizure-freedom was achieved after additional immunotherapy, not always accompanied by increased ASM doses. Titers of surface antibodies but not intracellular antibodies decreased over time.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Seizures with surface antibodies should mostly be considered acute symptomatic and transient and not indicative of epilepsy. This has consequences for ASM prescription and social restrictions. Antibody titers correlate with clinical courses.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Does attention switching between multiple tasks affect gait stability and task performance differently between younger and older adults?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-020-05938-0</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Gait stability and secondary task performance are affected by the need to share attention when dual-tasking. Further decrements may result from the need to switch attention between multiple secondary tasks. The aim of the current study was to determine the effects of attention switching upon gait stability and task performance in healthy younger and older adults. Ten healthy younger and ten healthy older adults walked on a treadmill at their preferred speed during three trials including: (1) baseline walking; (2) non-switching task walking, requiring response to an auditory-spatial or visual-spatial cue presented in an expected order; and (3) switching task walking, which required response to an auditory-spatial or visual-spatial cue presented in an unexpected order. Response time and accuracy, the margin of stability in the frontal (MoS&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ML&lt;/sub&gt;) and sagittal planes (MoS&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;: anterior, MoS&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;: posterior), step width and step length were calculated for non-switching and switching tasks. The MoS&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ML&lt;/sub&gt;, MoS&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, MoS&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;, step width and step length during non-switching and switching tasks were normalized to baseline walking. Older adults took significantly longer to respond to cues and made more errors during the switching task compared to younger adults. Younger adults took narrower steps (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and displayed a reduction in MoS&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ML&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) during the switching task compared with the non-switching task. Conversely, older adults displayed no differences in MoS&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ML&lt;/sub&gt; between tasks. These findings suggest that attention switching results in different task prioritization strategies in younger and older adults during walking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Negative relationship between brain α 1A -AR neurotransmission and βArr2 levels in anxious adolescent rats subjected to early life stress</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-020-05937-1</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Early-life stress is correlated with the development of anxiety-related behavior in adolescence, but underlying mechanisms remain poorly known. The α&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenergic receptor (AR) is linked to mood regulation and its function is assumed to be regulated by β-arrestins (βArrs) via desensitization and downregulation. Here, we investigated correlation between changes in α&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR and βArr2 levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of adolescent and adult male rats subjected to maternal separation (MS) and their relationship with anxiety-like behavior in adolescence. MS was performed 3 h per day from postnatal days 2–11 and anxiety-like behavior was evaluated in the elevated plus-maze and open field tests. The protein levels were examined using western blot assay. MS decreased α&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR expression and increased βArr2 expression in both brain regions of adolescent rats, while induced reverse changes in adulthood. MS adolescent rats demonstrated higher anxiety-type behavior and lower activity in behavioral tests than controls. Decreased α&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR levels in MS adolescence strongly correlated with reduced time spent in the open field central area, consistent with increased anxiety-like behavior. An anxiety-like phenotype was mimicked by acute and chronic treatment of developing rats with prazosin, an α&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR antagonist, suggesting α&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR downregulation may facilitate anxiety behavior in MS adolescent rats. Together, our results indicate a negative correlation between α&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR neurotransmission and βArr2 levels in both adults and anxious-adolescent rats and suggest that increased βArr2 levels may contribute to posttranslational regulation of α&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;-AR and modulation of anxiety-like behavior in adolescent rats. This may provide a path to develop more effective anxiolytic treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Intensity dependent effect of cognitive training on motor cortical plasticity and cognitive performance in humans</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Intervention-induced neuroplastic changes within the motor or cognitive system have been shown in the human brain. While cognitive and motor brain areas are densely interconnected, it is unclear whether this interconnectivity allows for a shared susceptibility to neuroplastic changes. Using the preparation for a theoretical exam as training intervention that primarily engages the cognitive system, we tested the hypothesis whether neuroplasticity acts across interconnected brain areas by investigating the effect on excitability and synaptic plasticity in the motor cortex. 39 healthy students (23 female) underwent 4 weeks of cognitive training while revision time, physical activity, concentration, fatigue, sleep quality and stress were monitored. Before and after cognitive training, cognitive performance was evaluated, as well as motor excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation and long-term-potentiation-like (LTP-like) plasticity using paired-associative-stimulation (PAS). Cognitive training ranged individually from 1 to 7 h/day and enhanced attention and verbal working memory. While motor excitability did not change, LTP-like plasticity increased in an intensity-depending manner: the longer the daily revision time, the smaller the increase of neuroplasticity, and vice versa. This effect was not influenced by physical activity, concentration, fatigue, sleep quality or stress. Motor cortical plasticity is strengthened by a behavioural intervention that primarily engages cognitive brain areas. We suggest that this effect is due to an enhanced susceptibility to LTP-like plasticity, probably induced by heterosynaptic activity that modulates postsynaptic excitability in motorcortical neurones. The smaller increase of PAS efficiency with higher cognitive training intensity suggests a mechanism that balances and stabilises the susceptibility for synaptic potentiation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Two Distinct Populations of α1α6-Containing GABAA-Receptors in Rat Cerebellum</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;GABAA receptors are pentameric GABA-gated chloride channels. The existence of 19 different subunits (six α, three β, three γ, δ, ε, θ, π, and three ρ) in mammalian systems gives rise to an enormous theoretical diversity of GABAA receptor subtypes with distinct subunit composition and unique pharmacological properties. These receptors are already now the drug targets of several clinically used compounds, such as benzodiazepines, anesthetics, and many more. There is a constant quest to identify novel molecules and possible future drug targets: Currently, α6-containing GABAA receptors are being discussed in the context of treating sensorimotor gating deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as tic disorders and schizophrenia. Therefore, we aim to learn more about α6-containing GABAA receptors. They are mostly expressed in the cerebellar granule cell layer, where they form the following subtypes: α6βxγ2, α1α6βxγ2, α6βxδ, and α1α6βxδ. In former studies, α1α6βxγ2-containing GABAA receptors were considered a single receptor population. In the current study, we investigate the possibility, that this population can consist of two subgroups with alternative arrangements depending if α1 neighbors γ2 (forming a “diazepam-sensitive” receptor), or if α6 neighbors γ2 (forming a “diazepam-insensitive” receptor) and aimed to prove the existence of both subtypes in native tissue. We performed immunoprecipitation experiments on rat cerebellar lysates using α1- or α6 subunit-specific antibodies followed by radioligand binding assays with either &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H-flunitrazepam or &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H-Ro 15-4513. Indeed, we were able to prove the existence of two distinct populations of α1α6-containing GABAA-receptors and could quantify the different receptor populations: α1βxγ2 receptors constitute approximately 60% of all γ2-containing receptors in the rat cerebellum, α6βxγ2 about 20%, and both isoforms of α1α6βxγ2 9–15% each. The simple classification of GABAA-receptors into αx-containing subtypes seems not to reflect the complexity of nature; those receptors are more diverse than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: P2X7 Receptor Upregulation in Huntington’s Disease Brains</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a fatal degenerative disorder affecting the nervous system. It is characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric dysfunctions, with a late onset and an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. HD-causing mutation consists in an expansion of repeated CAG triplets in the huntingtin gene (HTT), encoding for an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch in the huntingtin protein (htt). The mutation causes neuronal dysfunction and loss through multiple mechanisms, affecting both the nucleus and cytoplasm. P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) emerged as a major player in neuroinflammation, since ATP – its endogenous ligand – is massively released under this condition. Indeed, P2X7R stimulation in the central nervous system (CNS) is known to enhance the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from microglia and of neurotransmitters from neuronal presynaptic terminals, as well as to promote apoptosis. Previous experiments performed with neurons expressing the mutant huntingtin and exploiting HD mouse models demonstrated a role of P2X7R in HD. On the basis of those results, here, we explore for the first time the status of P2X7R in HD patients’ brain. We report that in HD postmortem striatum, as earlier observed in HD mice, the protein levels of the full-length form of P2X7R, also named P2X7R-A, are upregulated. In addition, the exclusively human naturally occurring variant lacking the C-terminus region, P2X7R-B, is upregulated as well. As we show here, this augmented protein levels can be explained by elevated mRNA levels. Furthermore, in HD patients’ striatum, P2X7R shows not only an augmented total transcript level but also an alteration of its splicing. Remarkably, P2X7R introns 10 and 11 are more retained in HD patients when compared with controls. Taken together, our data confirm that P2X7R is altered in brains of HD subjects and strengthen the notion that P2X7R may represent a potential therapeutic target for HD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Kinase Domain Is a Dynamic Hub for Driving LRRK2 Allostery</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Protein kinases and GTPases are the two major molecular switches that regulate much of biology, and both of these domains are embedded within the large multi-domain Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2). Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common cause of familial Parkinson’s disease (PD) and are also implicated in Crohn’s disease. The recent Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) structure of the four C-terminal domains [ROC COR KIN WD40 (RCKW)] of LRRK2 includes both of the catalytic domains. Although the important allosteric N-terminal domains are missing in the Cryo-EM structure this structure allows us to not only explore the conserved features of the kinase domain, which is trapped in an inactive and open conformation but also to observe the direct allosteric cross-talk between the two domains. To define the unique features of the kinase domain and to better understand the dynamic switch mechanism that allows LRRK2 to toggle between its inactive and active conformations, we have compared the LRRK2 kinase domain to Src, BRaf, and PKA. We also compare and contrast the two canonical glycine-rich loop motifs in LRRK2 that anchor the nucleotide: the G-Loop in protein kinases that anchors ATP and the P-Loop in GTPases that anchors GTP. The RCKW structure also provides a template for the cross-talk between the kinase and GTPase domains and brings new mechanistic insights into the physiological function of LRRK2 and how the kinase domain, along with key phosphorylation sites, can serve as an allosteric hub for mediating conformational changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The locus coeruleus (LC) has long been underappreciated for its role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and other neurodegenerative disorders. While AD and PD are distinct in clinical presentation, both are characterized by prodromal protein aggregation in the LC, late-stage degeneration of the LC, and comorbid conditions indicative of LC dysfunction. Many of these early studies were limited to post-mortem histological techniques due to the LC’s small size and location deep in the brainstem. Thus, there is a growing interest in utilizing in vivo imaging of the LC as a predictor of preclinical neurodegenerative processes and biomarker of disease progression. Simultaneously, neuroimaging in animal models of neurodegenerative disease holds promise for identifying early alterations to LC circuits, but has thus far been underutilized. While still in its infancy, a handful of studies have reported effects of single gene mutations and pathology on LC function in disease using various neuroimaging techniques. Furthermore, combining imaging and optogenetics or chemogenetics allows for interrogation of network connectivity in response to changes in LC activity. The purpose of this article is twofold: (1) to review what magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have revealed about LC dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease and its potential as a biomarker in humans, and (2) to explore how animal models can be used to test hypotheses derived from clinical data and establish a mechanistic framework to inform LC-focused therapeutic interventions to alleviate symptoms and impede disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Specific Frequency Electroacupuncture Stimulation Transiently Enhances the Permeability of the Blood-Brain Barrier and Induces Tight Junction Changes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays an important role in both the physiological state and pharmacological state of the brain. Transiently enhancing the permeability of the BBB may allow the use of more types of medications for neuropsychiatric diseases. Our previous research revealed that electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation at certain parameters can enhance the permeability of the BBB in Sprague-Dawley rats, but this phenomenon is not well characterized. We propose that specific frequency EA can transiently open the BBB and may be related to the change of tight junctions (TJ). To find the best EA frequency among commonly used frequencies, preliminarily explore the mechanism, we detected BBB permeability by measuring the intensity of Evans Blue and 20 kDa FITC-dextran fluorescence in the cerebral cortex. Then, we used a laser spectrometer, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy to detect the mechanism of BBB opening. Finally, measured brain water content, AQP4, GFAP, Iba1, and used the DeadEnd&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; Fluorometric TUNEL System to clear whether the stimulation caused obvious negative effects. The results show that EA stimulation at 2/100 Hz maximally increased BBB permeability, and the BBB closed within 12 h after EA stimulation was removed. EA stimulation increased blood perfusion, c-fos levels, and Substance P expression in the cerebral cortex, decreased ZO-1 and occludin levels and induced ultrastructural changes in TJ morphology. EA stimulation at specific parameters did not cause brain edema, activation of glial cells, or cell apoptosis. This study shows that EA stimulation induces a reversible, frequency-dependent alteration of BBB permeability and proposes a hypothetical mechanism of BBB opening related to vasodilation and TJ disruption. Transiently enhancing the permeability of the BBB with EA at specific parameters may be a new strategies for delivering therapeutics to the central nervous system. Further study of this technology is needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Interaction of Alpha-Synuclein With Lipids: Mitochondrial Cardiolipin as a Critical Player in the Pathogenesis of Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alpha-Synuclein (α-Syn) is a central protein in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, a group of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although its role in neurotransmission is well established, the precise role of this protein in disease pathogenesis is still not fully understood. It is, however, widely regarded to be associated with the misfolding and accumulation of toxic intracellular aggregates. In fact, α-Syn is the most abundant protein component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are also characterized by a high lipid content. Lipids, the main constituents of cellular membranes, have been implicated in many aspects of PD-related processes. α-Syn interacts with membrane phospholipids and free fatty acids via its N-terminal domain, and altered lipid-protein complexes might enhance both its binding to synaptic and mitochondrial membranes and its oligomerization. Several studies have highlighted a specific interaction of α-Syn with the phospholipid cardiolipin (CL), a major constituent of mitochondrial membranes. By interacting with CL, α-Syn is able to disrupt mitochondrial membrane integrity, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, externalized CL is able to facilitate the refolding of toxic α-Syn species at the outer mitochondrial membrane. In this review, we discuss how α-Syn/lipid interactions, in particular the α-Syn/CL interaction at the mitochondrial membrane, may affect α-Syn aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction and may thus represent an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Effects of Dopamine on the Immature Neurons of the Adult Rat Piriform Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.574234</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The layer II of the adult piriform cortex (PCX) contains a numerous population of immature neurons. Interestingly, in both mice and rats, most, if not all, these cells have an embryonic origin. Moreover, recent studies from our laboratory have shown that they progressively mature into typical excitatory neurons of the PCX layer II. Therefore, the adult PCX is considered a “non-canonical” neurogenic niche. These immature neurons express the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), a molecule critical for different neurodevelopmental processes. Dopamine (DA) is a relevant neurotransmitter in the adult CNS, which also plays important roles in neural development and adult plasticity, including the regulation of PSA-NCAM expression. In order to evaluate the hypothetical effects of pharmacological modulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission on the differentiation of immature neurons of the adult PCX, we studied dopamine D2 receptor (D2r) expression in this region and the relationship between dopaminergic fibers and immature neurons (defined by PSA-NCAM expression). In addition, we analyzed the density of immature neurons after chronic treatments with an antagonist and an agonist of D2r: haloperidol and PPHT, respectively. Many dopaminergic fibers were observed in close apposition to PSA-NCAM-expressing neurons, which also coexpressed D2r. Chronic treatment with haloperidol significantly increased the number of PSA-NCAM immunoreactive cells, while PPHT treatment decreased it. These results indicate a prominent role of dopamine, through D2r and PSA-NCAM, on the regulation of the final steps of development of immature neurons in the adult PCX.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Gangliosides in the Brain: Physiology, Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Applications</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gangliosides are glycosphingolipids highly abundant in the nervous system, and carry most of the sialic acid residues in the brain. Gangliosides are enriched in cell membrane microdomains (“lipid rafts”) and play important roles in the modulation of membrane proteins and ion channels, in cell signaling and in the communication among cells. The importance of gangliosides in the brain is highlighted by the fact that loss of function mutations in ganglioside biosynthetic enzymes result in severe neurodegenerative disorders, often characterized by very early or childhood onset. In addition, changes in the ganglioside profile (i.e., in the relative abundance of specific gangliosides) were reported in healthy aging and in common neurological conditions, including Huntington’s disease (HD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. At least in HD, PD and in some forms of epilepsy, experimental evidence strongly suggests a potential role of gangliosides in disease pathogenesis and potential treatment. In this review, we will summarize ganglioside functions that are crucial to maintain brain health, we will review changes in ganglioside levels that occur in major neurological conditions and we will discuss their contribution to cellular dysfunctions and disease pathogenesis. Finally, we will review evidence of the beneficial roles exerted by gangliosides, GM1 in particular, in disease models and in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: The Function of the NMDA Receptor in Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is one of the main forms of neonatal brain injury which could lead to neonatal disability or even cause neonatal death. Therefore, HIE strongly affects the health of newborns and brings heavy burden to the family and society. It has been well studied that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are involved in the excitotoxicity induced by hypoxia ischemia in adult brain. Recently, it has been shown that the NMDA receptor also plays important roles in HIE. In the present review, we made a summary of the molecular mechanism of NMDA receptor in the pathological process of HIE, focusing on the distinct role of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor subtypes and aiming to provide some insights into the clinical treatment and drug development of HIE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Novel Porcine Retina Cultivation Techniques Provide Improved Photoreceptor Preservation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in industrialized countries among people over 60 years. It has multiple triggers and risk factors, but despite intense research efforts, its pathomechanisms are currently not completely understood. AMD pathogenesis is characterized by soft drusen in Bruch’s membrane and involves the retinal pigment epithelium–Bruch’s membrane-choroid complex and adjacent structures, like photoreceptors. This study explores the potential of novel cultivation techniques to preserve photoreceptors in retinal explants to gain better insights in AMD pathology. The porcine retina explants were cultured for 4 and 8 days using three different explantation techniques, namely, control (photoreceptors facing down, touching the filter), filter (photoreceptors facing up, turned sample using a filter), and tweezers (photoreceptors facing up, turned sample using tweezers). Optical coherence tomography revealed that the tweezers method had the best capacity to limit thinning of the retinal explants. Both novel methods displayed advantages in maintaining outer segment thickness. Additionally, immunofluorescence evaluation revealed a better preservation of opsin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells and rhodopsin signal intensity in both novel methods, especially the tweezers method. Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated an upregulation of OPSIN and RHODOPSIN mRNA expression in tweezers samples at 8 days. Amacrine and bipolar cell numbers were not altered at day 4 of cultivation, while cultivation until 8 days led to reduced bipolar cell numbers. At 4 days, CALRETININ mRNA was upregulated in filter samples, but protein kinase C alpha expression was downregulated. Retinal ganglion cells were diminished in both novel techniques due to a direct physical contact with the insert. Remarkably, no difference in TUBB3 mRNA expression was detected among the techniques. Nevertheless, both novel methods exhibited an improved retention of photoreceptor cells. In conclusion, the tweezers technique was the most promising one. Due to the high homology of the porcine to the human retina, it provides a reasonable alternative to in vivo rodent models. Consequently, an adapted coculture system based on the current findings may serve as an ex vivo model suitable to analyze AMD pathomechanisms and novel therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Dynamic Alterations of Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations in Patients With Drug-Naïve First-Episode Early Onset Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00901</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Abnormalities in static neural activity have been widely reported in early onset schizophrenia (EOS). However, dynamic brain activity alterations over time in EOS are unclear. Here, we investigated whether temporal dynamic changes in spontaneous neural activity are influenced by EOS. A total of 78 drug-naïve first-episode patients with EOS and 90 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF) was performed to examine the abnormal time-varying local neural activity in EOS. Furthermore, we investigated the relationships between abnormalities in dALFF variability and clinical characteristics in EOS patients. Compared to HCs, EOS patients showed significantly decreased dALFF variability in the bilateral precuneus, right superior marginal gyrus, right post-central gyrus and increased dALFF in the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Moreover, increased dALFF variability in MTG was negatively associated with negative symptoms in EOS. Our findings reveal increased dynamic local neural activity in higher order networks of the cortex, suggesting that enhanced spontaneous brain activity may be a predominant neural marker for brain maturation. In addition, decreased dALFF variability in the default mode network (DMN) and limbic system may reflect unusually dynamic neural activity. This dysfunctional brain activity could distinguish between patients and HCs and deepen our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of EOS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Contraction Phase and Force Differentially Change Motor Evoked Potential Recruitment Slope and Interhemispheric Inhibition in Young Versus Old</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.581008</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.581008</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Interhemispheric interactions are important for arm coordination and hemispheric specialization. Unilateral voluntary static contraction is known to increase bilateral corticospinal motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude. It is unknown how increasing and decreasing contraction affect the opposite limb. Since dynamic muscle contraction is more ecologically relevant to daily activities, we studied MEP recruitment using a novel method and short interval interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) from active to resting hemisphere at 4 phases of contralateral ECR contraction: Rest, Ramp Up [increasing at 25% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)], Execution (tonic at 50% MVC), and Ramp Down (relaxation at 25% MVC) in 42 healthy adults. We analyzed the linear portion of resting extensor carpi radialis (ECR) MEP recruitment by stimulating at multiple intensities and comparing slopes, expressed as mV per TMS stimulation level, via linear mixed modeling. In younger participants (age ≤ 30), resting ECR MEP recruitment slopes were significantly and equally larger both at Ramp Up (slope increase = 0.047, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and Ramp Down (slope increase = 0.031, p &amp;lt; 0.001) compared to rest, despite opposite directions of force change. In contrast, Active ECR MEP recruitment slopes were larger in Ramp Down than all other phases (Rest:0.184, p &amp;lt; 0.001; Ramp Up:0.128, p = 0.001; Execution: p = 0.003). Older (age ≥ 60) participants’ resting MEP recruitment slope was higher than younger participants across all phases. IHI did not reduce MEP recruitment slope equally in old compared to young. In conclusion, our data indicate that MEP recruitment slope in the resting limb is affected by the homologous active limb contraction force, irrespective of the direction of force change. The active arm MEP recruitment slope, in contrast, remains relatively unaffected. Older participants had steeper MEP recruitment slopes and less interhemispheric inhibition compared to younger participants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Does Cardiorespiratory Fitness Influence the Effect of Acute Aerobic Exercise on Executive Function?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.569010</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.569010</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;The beneficial effects of acute exercise on executive function have been well-documented, but the influence of cardiorespiratory fitness on this effect requires further investigations, especially using imaging technique. This study aimed to examine the effects of cardiorespiratory fitness on acute exercise-induced changes on behavioral performance and on functional brain activation.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;Based on their cardiorespiratory fitness level, 62 participants ranked in the top and bottom of the maximum oxygen consumption (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max) were finally selected and allocated to high-fit group or low-fit group. Both groups were asked to complete the Stroop task after 30 min of aerobic exercise and chair-seated rest (control session). Among them, 26 participants were randomly selected and asked to undergo the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Behavioral results showed that individuals responded significantly faster after exercise than those in the control session. The fMRI results revealed a significant interaction effects of Group by Session in brain regions including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and bilateral dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). For the ACC, activation in the high-fit group was significantly decreased after aerobic exercise compared to those in the control session; whereas an increased activation was noticed in the low-fit group. Regarding to the bilateral DLPFC, activation in high-fit group was significantly decreased after exercise compared to those in the control session, while no significant differences were found in the low-fit group. In addition, for the post-exercise session, a significant positive correlations between activation of the ACC and left DLPFC in the high-fit group was observed. There was a significant negative correlation between activation of the ACC and reaction time in the congruent condition after exercise in the low-fit group.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Findings further clarify the neurophysiological processes of acute exercise-induced changes in cognitive performance as they suggest that cardiorespiratory fitness is an important factor which influences changes in brain activation patterns in response to acute aerobic exercises.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Diazepam on Reaction Times to Stop and Go</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.567177</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.567177</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The ability to stop the execution of a movement in response to an external cue requires intact executive function. The effect of psychotropic drugs on movement inhibition is largely unknown. Movement stopping can be estimated by the Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT). In a recent publication, we validated an improved measure of SSRT (optimum combination SSRT, ocSSRT). Here we explored how diazepam, which enhances transmission at GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, affects ocSSRT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Nine healthy individuals were randomized to receive placebo, 5 mg or 10 mg doses of diazepam. Each participant received both the dosage of drug and placebo orally on separate days with adequate washout. The ocSSRT and simple reaction time (RT) were estimated through a stop-signal task delivered via a battery-operated box incorporating green (Go) and red (Stop) light-emitting diodes. The task was performed just before and 1 h after dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: The mean change in ocSSRT after 10 mg diazepam was significantly higher (+27 ms) than for placebo (−1 ms; p = 0.012). By contrast, the mean change in simple response time remained comparable in all three dosing groups (p = 0.419).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results confirm that a single therapeutic adult dose of diazepam can alter motor inhibition in drug naïve healthy individuals. The selective effect of diazepam on ocSSRT but not simple RT suggests that GABAergic neurons may play a critical role in movement-stopping.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Reduced Frontal Nogo-N2 With Uncompromised Response Inhibition During Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation—More Efficient Cognitive Control?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561780</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We have previously shown invasive vagus nerve stimulation to improve attention and working memory and alter emotion-attention interaction in patients with refractory epilepsy, suggesting that VNS might be useful in the treatment of cognitive impairment. The current research focuses on whether non-invasive, transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has similar effects to VNS. Furthermore, we aimed to assess whether tVNS has an impact on cognitive control in general or on underlying brain physiology in a task that mimics everyday life demands where multiple executive functions are engaged while encountering intervening emotional stimuli. Event-related potentials (ERP) evoked in such a task, specifically centro-parietal P3 and frontal N2 were used as biomarkers for attention allocation and cognitive control required to carry out the task. A single-blinded, sham-controlled, within-subject study on healthy subjects (n = 25) was conducted using Executive Reaction Time Test (RT-test), a Go/NoGo task engaging multiple executive functions along with intervening threat-related distractors while EEG was recorded. tVNS at the left tragus and sham stimulation at the left ear lobe was alternately delivered throughout the task. To assess the impact of tVNS on neural activity underlying attention and cognitive control, centro-parietal P3 and frontal N2 peak amplitudes were measured in Go and NoGo conditions. Task performance was assessed with RTs and different error types reflecting cognitive control in general and distinct executive functions, such as working memory and response inhibition.No significant effects due to tVNS on performance in the Executive RT-test were observed. For N2 there was a main effect of stimulator status and a significant interaction of trial type (Go, NoGo) and stimulator status. Post hoc analysis revealed that tVNS resulted in a significant reduction of frontal N2 only in the NoGo condition. No significant effects were observed for P3 nor were there any effects of emotion. Diminished NoGo-N2 potential along with unaltered task performance during tVNS suggests fewer cognitive control resources were required to successfully withhold a prepotent response. Though caution is warranted, we suggest that tVNS may lead to more efficient neural processing with fewer resources needed for successful cognitive control, providing promise for its potential use in cognitive enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper addresses how impairments in prediction in young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) relate to their behavior during collaboration. To assess it, we developed a task where participants play in collaboration with a synthetic agent to maximize their score. The agent’s behavior changes during the different phases of the game, requiring participants to model the agent’s sensorimotor contingencies to play collaboratively. Our results (n = 30, 15 per group) show differences between autistic and neurotypical individuals in their behavioral adaptation to the other partner. Contrarily, there are no differences in the self-reports of that collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Predicting Antidepressant Citalopram Treatment Response via Changes in Brain Functional Connectivity After Acute Intravenous Challenge</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The early and therapy-specific prediction of treatment success in major depressive disorder is of paramount importance due to high lifetime prevalence, and heterogeneity of response to standard medication and symptom expression. Hence, this study assessed the predictability of long-term antidepressant effects of escitalopram based on the short-term influence of citalopram on functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty nine subjects suffering from major depression were scanned twice with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging under the influence of intravenous citalopram and placebo in a randomized, double-blinded cross-over fashion. Symptom factors were identified for the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D) and Beck's depression inventory (BDI) taken before and after a median of seven weeks of escitalopram therapy. Predictors were calculated from whole-brain functional connectivity, fed into robust regression models, and cross-validated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Significant predictive power could be demonstrated for one HAM-D factor describing insomnia and the total score (r = 0.45–0.55). Remission and response could furthermore be predicted with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73 and 0.68, respectively. Functional regions with high influence on the predictor were located especially in the ventral attention, fronto-parietal, and default mode networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: It was shown that medication-specific antidepressant symptom improvements can be predicted using functional connectivity measured during acute pharmacological challenge as an easily assessable imaging marker. The regions with high influence have previously been related to major depression as well as the response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, corroborating the advantages of the current approach of focusing on treatment-specific symptom improvements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Pain in Endometriosis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Endometriosis is a chronic and debilitating condition affecting ∼10% of women. Endometriosis is characterized by infertility and chronic pelvic pain, yet treatment options remain limited. In many respects this is related to an underlying lack of knowledge of the etiology and mechanisms contributing to endometriosis-induced pain. Whilst many studies focus on retrograde menstruation, and the formation and development of lesions in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, the mechanisms underlying the associated pain remain poorly described. Here we review the recent clinical and experimental evidence of the mechanisms contributing to chronic pain in endometriosis. This includes the roles of inflammation, neurogenic inflammation, neuroangiogenesis, peripheral sensitization and central sensitization. As endometriosis patients are also known to have co-morbidities such as irritable bowel syndrome and overactive bladder syndrome, we highlight how common nerve pathways innervating the colon, bladder and female reproductive tract can contribute to co-morbidity via cross-organ sensitization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Mesenchymal Stromal Cells’ Therapy for Polyglutamine Disorders: Where Do We Stand and Where Should We Go?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by the expansion of the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat. This mutation encodes extended glutamine (Q) tract in the disease protein, resulting in the alteration of its conformation/physiological role and in the formation of toxic fragments/aggregates of the protein. This group of heterogeneous disorders shares common molecular mechanisms, which opens the possibility to develop a pan therapeutic approach. Vast efforts have been made to develop strategies to alleviate disease symptoms. Nonetheless, there is still no therapy that can cure or effectively delay disease progression of any of these disorders. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are promising tools for the treatment of polyQ disorders, promoting protection, tissue regeneration, and/or modulation of the immune system in animal models. Accordingly, data collected from clinical trials have so far demonstrated that transplantation of MSC is safe and delays the progression of some polyQ disorders for some time. However, to achieve sustained phenotypic amelioration in clinics, several treatments may be necessary. Therefore, efforts to develop new strategies to improve MSC’s therapeutic outcomes have been emerging. In this review article, we discuss the current treatments and strategies used to reduce polyQ symptoms and major pre-clinical and clinical achievements obtained with MSC transplantation as well as remaining flaws that need to be overcome. The requirement to cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), together with a short rate of cell engraftment in the lesioned area and low survival of MSC in a pathophysiological context upon transplantation may contribute to the transient therapeutic effects. We also review methods like pre-conditioning or genetic engineering of MSC that can be used to increase MSC survival in vivo, cellular-free approaches—i.e., MSC-conditioned medium (CM) or MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a way of possibly replacing the use of MSC and methods required to standardize the potential of MSC/MSC-derived products. These are fundamental questions that need to be addressed to obtain maximum MSC performance in polyQ diseases and therefore increase clinical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Xenon Exerts Neuroprotective Effects on Kainic Acid-Induced Acute Generalized Seizures in Rats via Increased Autophagy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Xenon has been shown to have neuroprotective effects and is clinically used as a favorable safe inhalation anesthetic. We previously confirmed the neuroprotective effects of xenon treatment in epileptic animals. However, the mechanism underlying these protective effects remains unclear. We aimed to assess the effects of xenon inhalation on autophagy in neuronal injury induced by acute generalized seizures. Kainic acid (KA) was injected into the lateral ventricle of male Sprague–Dawley rats to induce acute generalized seizures. Next, the rats were treated via inhalation of a 70% xenon/21% oxygen/9% nitrogen mixture for 60 min immediately after KA administration. The control group was treated via inhalation of a 79% nitrogen/21% oxygen mixture. Subsequently, two inhibitors (3-methyladenine or bafilomycin A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) or an autophagy inducer (rapamycin) were administered, respectively, before KA and xenon administration to determine the role of autophagy in the protective effects of xenon. The levels of apoptosis, neuronal injury, and autophagy were determined in all the rats. Xenon inhalation significantly attenuated the severity of the seizure-induced neuronal injury. Increased autophagy accompanied this inhibitive effect. Autophagy inhibition eliminated these xenon neuroprotective effects. A simulation of autophagy using rapamycin recapitulated xenon’s protective effects on KA-induced acute generalized seizures in the rats. These findings confirmed that xenon exerts strong neuroprotective effects in KA-induced acute generalized seizures. Further, they indicate that increased autophagy may underlie the protective effects of xenon. Therefore, xenon and autophagy inducers may be useful clinical options for their neuroprotective effects in epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dysregulated Plasma Membrane Turnover Underlying Dendritic Pathology in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Due to their enormous surface area compared to other cell types, neurons face unique challenges in properly handling supply and retrieval of the plasma membrane (PM)—a process termed PM turnover—in their distal areas. Because of the length and extensiveness of dendritic branches in neurons, the transport of materials needed for PM turnover from soma to distal dendrites will be inefficient and quite burdensome for somatic organelles. To meet local demands, PM turnover in dendrites most likely requires local cellular machinery, such as dendritic endocytic and secretory systems, dysregulation of which may result in dendritic pathology observed in various neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Supporting this notion, a growing body of literature provides evidence to suggest the pathogenic contribution of dysregulated PM turnover to dendritic pathology in certain NDs. In this article, we present our perspective view that impaired dendritic endocytic and secretory systems may contribute to dendritic pathology by encumbering PM turnover in NDs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Histological Evidence for the Enteric Nervous System and the Choroid Plexus as Alternative Routes of Neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV2</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.596439</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.596439</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evidence is mounting that the novel corona virus SARS-CoV2 inflicts neurological symptoms in a subgroup of COVID-19 patients. While plenty of theories on the route of neuroinvasion have been proposed, little histological evidence has been presented supporting any of these hypotheses. Therefore, we carried out immunostainings for ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two proteinases crucial for the entry of SARS-CoV2 into host cells, in the human enteric nervous system (ENS), as well as in the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles. Both of these sites are important, yet often neglected entry gates to the nervous system. We found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed by enteric neurons and glial cells of the small and large intestine, as well as choroid plexus epithelial cells, indicating that these cells meet the molecular requirements for viral entry. Together, our results are fundamental histological evidence substantiating current theories of neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Neuronize v2: Bridging the Gap Between Existing Proprietary Tools to Optimize Neuroscientific Workflows</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Knowledge about neuron morphology is key to understanding brain structure and function. There are a variety of software tools that are used to segment and trace the neuron morphology. However, these tools usually utilize proprietary formats. This causes interoperability problems since the information extracted with one tool cannot be used in other tools. This article aims to improve neuronal reconstruction workflows by facilitating the interoperability between two of the most commonly used software tools—Neurolucida (NL) and Imaris (Filament Tracer). The new functionality has been included in an existing tool—Neuronize—giving rise to its second version. Neuronize v2 makes it possible to automatically use the data extracted with Imaris Filament Tracer to generate a tracing with dendritic spine information that can be read directly by NL. It also includes some other new features, such as the ability to unify and/or correct inaccurately-formed meshes (i.e., dendritic spines) and to calculate new metrics. This tool greatly facilitates the process of neuronal reconstruction, bridging the gap between existing proprietary tools to optimize neuroscientific workflows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Visual Corticocortical Inputs to Ferret Area 18</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.581478</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.581478</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual cortical areas in the adult mammalian brain are linked by a network of interareal feedforward and feedback circuits. We investigated the topography of feedback projections to ferret (Mustela putorius furo) area 18 from extrastriate areas 19, 21, and Ssy. Our objective was to characterize the anatomical organization of the extrastriate feedback pool to area 18. We also wished to determine if feedback projections to area 18 share similar features as feedback projections to area 17. We injected the tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) into area 18 of adult ferrets to visualize the distribution and pattern of retrogradely labeled cells in extrastriate cortex. We find several similarities to the feedback projection to area 17: (i) Multiple visual cortical areas provide feedback to area 18: areas 19, 21, Ssy, and weaker inputs from posterior parietal and lateral temporal visual areas. Within each area a greater proportion of feedback projections arises from the infragranular than from the supragranular layers. (ii) The cortical area immediately rostral to area 18 provides the greatest proportion of total cortical feedback, and has the greatest peak density of cells providing feedback to area 18. (iii) The spacing (peak cell density and nearest neighbor distances) of cells in extrastriate cortex providing feedback to areas 17 and 18 are similar. However, peak density of feedback cells to area 18 is comparable in the supra- and infragranular layers, whereas peak density of feedback cells to area 17 is higher in the infragranular layers. Another prominent difference is that dorsal area 18 receives a cortical input that area 17 does not: from ventral cortex representing the upper visual field; this appears to be roughly 25% of the feedback input to area 18. Lastly, area 17 receives a greater proportion of cortical feedback from area 21 than from Ssy, whereas area 18 receives more feedback from Ssy than from area 21. While the organization of feedback projections from extrastriate cortex to areas 17 and 18 is broadly similar, the main difference in input topography might arise due to differences in visual field representations of the two areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: 7 Tesla MRI Followed by Histological 3D Reconstructions in Whole-Brain Specimens</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Post mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on the human brain are of great interest for the validation of in vivo MRI. It facilitates a link between functional and anatomical information available from MRI in vivo and neuroanatomical knowledge available from histology/immunocytochemistry. However, linking in vivo and post mortem MRI to microscopy techniques poses substantial challenges. Fixation artifacts and tissue deformation of extracted brains, as well as co registration of 2D histology to 3D MRI volumes complicate direct comparison between modalities. Moreover, post mortem brain tissue does not have the same physical properties as in vivo tissue, and therefore MRI approaches need to be adjusted accordingly. Here, we present a pipeline in which whole-brain human post mortem in situ MRI is combined with subsequent tissue processing of the whole human brain, providing a 3-dimensional reconstruction via blockface imaging. To this end, we adapted tissue processing procedures to allow both post mortem MRI and subsequent histological and immunocytochemical processing. For MRI, tissue was packed in a susceptibility matched solution, tailored to fit the dimensions of the MRI coil. Additionally, MRI sequence parameters were adjusted to accommodate T1 and T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; shortening, and scan time was extended, thereby benefiting the signal-to-noise-ratio that can be achieved using extensive averaging without motion artifacts. After MRI, the brain was extracted from the skull and subsequently cut while performing optimized blockface imaging, thereby allowing three-dimensional reconstructions. Tissues were processed for Nissl and silver staining, and co-registered with the blockface images. The combination of these techniques allows direct comparisons across modalities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Ofloxacin as a Disruptor of Actin Aggresome “Hirano Bodies”: A Potential Repurposed Drug for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.591579</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a growing number of aging populations that are more prone to the prevalence of neuropathological disorders. Two major diseases that show a late onset of the symptoms include Alzheimer’s disorder (AD) and Parkinson’s disorder (PD), which are causing an unexpected social and economic impact on the families. A large number of researches in the last decade have focused upon the role of amyloid precursor protein, Aβ-plaque, and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (tau-proteins). However, there is very few understanding of actin-associated paracrystalline structures formed in the hippocampus region of the brain and are called Hirano bodies. These actin-rich inclusion bodies are known to modulate the synaptic plasticity and employ conspicuous effects on long-term potentiation and paired-pulse paradigms. Since the currently known drugs have very little effect in controlling the progression of these diseases, there is a need to develop therapeutic agents, which can have improved efficacy and bioavailability, and can transport across the blood–brain barrier. Moreover, finding novel targets involving compound screening is both laborious and is an expensive process in itself followed by equally tedious Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval exercise. Finding alternative functions to the already existing FDA-approved molecules for reversing the progression of age-related proteinopathies is of utmost importance. In the current study, we decipher the role of a broad-spectrum general antibiotic (Ofloxacin) on actin polymerization dynamics using various biophysical techniques like right-angle light scattering, dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, etc. We have also performed in silico docking studies to deduce a plausible mechanism of the drug binding to the actin. We report that actin gets disrupted upon binding to Ofloxacin in a concentration-dependent manner. We have inferred that Ofloxacin, when attached to a drug delivery system, can act as a good candidate for the treatment of neuropathological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Neurogranin: A Potential Biomarker of Neurological and Mental Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurogranin (Ng) is a small protein usually expressed in granule-like structures in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and cortex. However, its clinical value is not fully clear so far. Currently, Ng is proved to be involved in synaptic plasticity, synaptic regeneration, and long-term potentiation mediated by the calcium- and calmodulin-signaling pathways. Due to both the synaptic integrity and function as the growing concerns in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of neurological and mental diseases, a series of researches published focused on the associations between Ng and these kinds of diseases in the past decade. Therefore, in this review, we highlight several diseases, which include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, neuro-HIV, neurosyphilis, schizophrenia, depression, traumatic brain injury, and acute ischemic stroke, and summarize the associations between cerebrospinal fluid or blood-derived Ng with these diseases. We propose that Ng is a potential and promising biomarker to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and severity evaluation of these diseases in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aberrant accumulation of misfolded proteins into amyloid deposits is a hallmark in many age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Pathological inclusions and the associated toxicity appear to spread through the nervous system in a characteristic pattern during the disease. This has been attributed to a prion-like behavior of amyloid-type aggregates, which involves self-replication of the pathological conformation, intercellular transfer, and the subsequent seeding of native forms of the same protein in the neighboring cell. Molecular chaperones play a major role in maintaining cellular proteostasis by assisting the (re)-folding of cellular proteins to ensure their function or by promoting the degradation of terminally misfolded proteins to prevent damage. With increasing age, however, the capacity of this proteostasis network tends to decrease, which enables the manifestation of neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, there has been a plethora of studies investigating how and when chaperones interact with disease-related proteins, which have advanced our understanding of the role of chaperones in protein misfolding diseases. This review article focuses on the steps of prion-like propagation from initial misfolding and self-templated replication to intercellular spreading and discusses the influence that chaperones have on these various steps, highlighting both the positive and adverse consequences chaperone action can have. Understanding how chaperones alleviate and aggravate disease progression is vital for the development of therapeutic strategies to combat these debilitating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: GLT-1 Knockdown Inhibits Ceftriaxone-Mediated Improvements on Cognitive Deficits, and GLT-1 and xCT Expression and Activity in APP/PS1 AD Mice</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) and system x&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; mediate glutamate uptake and release, respectively. Ceftriaxone has been reported to upregulate GLT-1 expression and improve cognitive decline in APP/PS1 mice. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of GLT-1 in ceftriaxone-mediated improvement on cognitive deficits and associated changes in xCT (catalytic subunit of system x&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) expression and activity using GLT-1 knockdown APP/PS1 mice.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;GLT-1 knockdown (GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;) mice were generated in C57BL/6J mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique and crossed to APP/PS1 mice to generate GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;APP/PS1 mice. The cognition was evaluated by novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests. GLT-1 and xCT expression, GLT-1 uptake for glutamate, and glutathione levels of hippocampus were assayed using Western blot and immunohistochemistry, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H-glutamate, and glutathione assay kit, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In comparison with wild-type mice, APP/PS1 mice exhibited significant cognitive deficits, represented with poor performance in novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests, downregulated GLT-1 expression and glutamate uptake. Ceftriaxone treatment significantly improved the above impairments in APP/PS1 mice, but had negligible impact in GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;APP/PS1 mice. The xCT expression increased in APP/PS1 and GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;APP/PS1 mice. This upregulation might be a compensatory change against the accumulated glutamate resulting from GLT-1 impairment. Ceftriaxone treatment restored xCT expression in APP/PS1 mice, but not in GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;APP/PS1 mice. Glutathione levels decreased in APP/PS1 mice in comparison to the wild-type group. After ceftriaxone administration, the decline in glutathione level was restored in APP/PS1 mice, but not in GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;APP/PS1 mice.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Ceftriaxone improves cognitive impairment of APP/PS1 mice by upregulating GLT-1-mediated uptake of glutamate and co-regulation of GLT-1 and xCT in APP/PS1 mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Dependent Shift of AMPA Receptors From Synapses to Intracellular Compartments in Alzheimer’s Disease: Immunocytochemical Analysis of the CA1 Hippocampal Region in APP/PS1 Transgenic Mouse Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synapse loss occurs early in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and animal models. Alterations at synaptic level are a major morphological correlate of the memory deficits and related symptoms of AD. Given the predominant roles of synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain, changes in their dynamic regulation are also implicated in the pathophysiology of AD. Here, we used immunolocalization techniques to analyze the expression and subcellular distribution of AMPARs in the hippocampal region of APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. Immunoblots and histoblots revealed that the total amount of AMPARs and their regional expression pattern in the hippocampus was similar in APP/PS1 mice and in age-matched wild type mice. At the ultrastructural level, two synapse populations were examined using SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labeling in the stratum radiatum in mice: (i) on spines of CA1 pyramidal cells; and (ii) on randomly found dendritic shafts of CA1 interneurons. While 1- and 6-months-old APP/PS1 mice exhibited no change, we observed a significant reduction at 12 months in AMPAR density at synapses in both pyramidal cells and interneurons, compared to wild-type. This reduction of AMPARs in dendritic spines was accompanied by a significant increase in AMPAR subunit proteins identified in intracellular compartments. Our data demonstrate an age-dependent reduction of synaptic AMPARs in APP/PS1 mice, which may contribute to impaired learning and memory at later stages of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;In this study, we aimed to examine if patterns of CSF inflammatory markers are correlated with global cognition, episodic memory, hippocampal volume, and CSF AD-related pathologies among non-demented older people.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We included 217 non-demented older individuals, including 87 subjects with normal cognition (NC) and 130 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Hierarchical cluster analysis including nine inflammatory markers in CSF [Tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α), TNF-R1, TNF-R2, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), TGF-β2, TGF-β3, Interleukin-21 (IL-21), IL-6, and IL-7] was conducted.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We identified two clusters among non-demented older people based on nine inflammatory markers in CSF. Compared to the first cluster, the second cluster showed significantly higher levels of CSF inflammatory markers (TNF-R1, TNF-R2, TGF-β1, TGF-β3, and IL-6). Further, the second cluster was also associated with higher levels of t-tau and p-tau levels in CSF.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We observed a subgroup of non-demented older people characterized by increased levels of inflammatory markers in CSF. Further, this subgroup showed higher levels of t-tau and p-tau levels in CSF.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Target Dysbiosis of Gut Microbes as a Future Therapeutic Manipulation in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is commonly an age-associated dementia with neurodegeneration. The pathogenesis of AD is complex and still remains unclear. The inflammation, amyloid β (Aβ), and neurofibrillary tangles as well misfolded tau protein in the brain may contribute to the occurrence and development of AD. Compared with tau protein, Aβ is less toxic. So far, all efforts made in the treatments of AD with targeting these pathogenic factors were unsuccessful over the past decades. Recently, many studies demonstrated that changes of the intestinal environment and gut microbiota via gut–brain axis pathway can cause neurological disorders, such as AD, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Thus, remodeling the gut microbiota by various ways to maintain their balance might be a novel therapeutic strategy for AD. In the review article, we analyzed the characteristics of gut microbiota and its dysbiosis in AD and its animal models and investigated the possibility of targeting the gut microbiota in the treatment of the patients with AD in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Metabolic profiling during malaria reveals the role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in regulating kidney injury</title>

	<description>Systemic metabolic reprogramming induced by infection exerts profound, pathogen-specific effects on infection outcome. Here, we detail the host immune and metabolic response during sickness and recovery in a mouse model of malaria. We describe extensive alterations in metabolism during acute infection, and identify increases in host-derived metabolites that signal through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a transcription factor with immunomodulatory functions. We find that &lt;i&gt;Ahr&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice are more susceptible to malaria and develop high plasma heme and acute kidney injury. This phenotype is dependent on AHR in &lt;i&gt;Tek&lt;/i&gt;-expressing radioresistant cells. Our findings identify a role for AHR in limiting tissue damage during malaria. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the critical role of host metabolism in surviving infection.</description>

	<title>eLife: Ubiquitin-dependent regulation of a conserved DMRT protein controls sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity and behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59614</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59614</link>
	<description>Sex-specific synaptic connectivity is beginning to emerge as a remarkable, but little explored feature of animal brains. We describe here a novel mechanism that promotes sexually dimorphic neuronal function and synaptic connectivity in the nervous system of the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. We demonstrate that a phylogenetically conserved, but previously uncharacterized Doublesex/Mab-3 related transcription factor (DMRT), &lt;i&gt;dmd-4&lt;/i&gt;, is expressed in two classes of sex-shared phasmid neurons specifically in hermaphrodites but not in males. We find &lt;i&gt;dmd-4&lt;/i&gt; to promote hermaphrodite-specific synaptic connectivity and neuronal function of phasmid sensory neurons. Sex-specificity of DMD-4 function is conferred by a novel mode of posttranslational regulation that involves sex-specific protein stabilization through ubiquitin binding to a phylogenetically conserved but previously unstudied protein domain, the DMA domain. A human DMRT homolog of DMD-4 is controlled in a similar manner, indicating that our findings may have implications for the control of sexual differentiation in other animals as well.</description>

	<title>eLife: Nuclear crowding and nonlinear diffusion during interkinetic nuclear migration in the zebrafish retina</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58635</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58635</link>
	<description>An important question in early neural development is the origin of stochastic nuclear movement between apical and basal surfaces of neuroepithelia during interkinetic nuclear migration. Tracking of nuclear subpopulations has shown evidence of diffusion - mean squared displacements growing linearly in time - and suggested crowding from cell division at the apical surface drives basalward motion. Yet, this hypothesis has not yet been tested, and the forces involved not quantified. We employ long-term, rapid light-sheet and two-photon imaging of early zebrafish retinogenesis to track entire populations of nuclei within the tissue. The time-varying concentration profiles show clear evidence of crowding as nuclei reach close-packing and are quantitatively described by a nonlinear diffusion model. Considerations of nuclear motion constrained inside the enveloping cell membrane show that concentration-dependent stochastic forces inside cells, compatible in magnitude to those found in cytoskeletal transport, can explain the observed magnitude of the diffusion constant.</description>

	<title>eLife: Optical control of ERK and AKT signaling promotes axon regeneration and functional recovery of PNS and CNS in Drosophila</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57395</guid>

	<description>Neuroregeneration is a dynamic process synergizing the functional outcomes of multiple signaling circuits. Channelrhodopsin-based optogenetics shows the feasibility of stimulating neural repair but does not pin down specific signaling cascades. Here, we utilized optogenetic systems, optoRaf and optoAKT, to delineate the contribution of the ERK and AKT signaling pathways to neuroregeneration in live &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;larvae. We showed that optoRaf or optoAKT activation not only enhanced axon regeneration in both regeneration-competent and -incompetent sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system but also allowed temporal tuning and proper guidance of axon regrowth. Furthermore, optoRaf and optoAKT differ in their signaling kinetics during regeneration, showing a gated versus graded response, respectively. Importantly in the central nervous system, their activation promotes axon regrowth and functional recovery of the thermonociceptive behavior. We conclude that non-neuronal optogenetics target damaged neurons and signaling subcircuits, providing a novel strategy in the intervention of neural damage with improved precision.</description>

	<title>eLife: The HIV-1 latent reservoir is largely sensitive to circulating T cells</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57246</link>
	<description>HIV-1 specific CD8+ T cells are an important component of HIV-1 curative strategies. Viral variants in the HIV-1 reservoir may limit the capacity of T cells to detect and clear virus-infected cells. We investigated the patterns of T cell escape variants in the replication-competent reservoir of 25 persons living with HIV-1 (PLWH) durably suppressed on ART. We identified all reactive T cell epitopes in the HIV-1 proteome for each participant and sequenced HIV-1 outgrowth viruses from resting CD4+ T cells. All non-synonymous mutations in reactive T cell epitopes were tested for their effect on the size of the T cell response, with a ≥50% loss defined as an escape mutation. The majority (68%) of T cell epitopes harbored no detectable escape mutations. These findings suggest that circulating T cells in PLWH on ART could contribute to control of rebound and could be targeted for boosting in curative strategies.</description>

	<description>Kim et al. present a temporally precise genetic recording system for lineage tracing and transcriptomics analysis of single cells. They generate a trajectory map and single-cell transcriptional atlas of developing embryoid bodies, an organoid model of pre-gastrulation embryogenesis. These data reveal transcriptional and epigenetic regulators of early cell fate decisions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Species differences in the cerebellar distribution of six members of the Kv1 channel subfamily.</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.328237v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Comprehensive studies on the distribution of the Kv1 subfamily have been performed in rat (Chung et al., 2001) and gerbil (Chung et al., 2005), but not in mouse or human. We hypothesized that species differences may exist in the localization of these proteins. Two sets of polyclonal antibodies to Kv1.1-6 were used. Immunohistochemistry was performed on archived, formalin-fixed tissue from disease-free human, monkey and mouse cerebellum. Mouse staining corresponded to that described in rat and gerbil, with strong Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 immunoreactivities in the basket cell pinceau at the base of Purkinje cells. Kv1.3, Kv1.4, Kv1.5 and Kv1.6 were predominantly expressed in Purkinje cells. Human and monkey samples showed a similar pattern to mouse for Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3 and Kv1.5. However, little or no Purkinje cell staining was seen in the primates with Kv1.4 and Kv1.6, and strong stellate cell expression was noted. All staining was abolished by cognate peptide blocking. Similar distributions were seen with both sets of antibodies. We conclude that there are marked species differences in the distribution of Kv1.4 and Kv1.6 between primates and rodents. Choosing appropriate animal models for studying physiological and disease processes may prove vital for translating research outcomes into clinical applications.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Active probing to highlight approaching transitions to ictal states in coupled neural mass models</title>

	<description>The extraction of electrophysiological features that reliably forecast the occurrence of seizures is one of the most challenging goals in epilepsy research. Among possible approaches to tackle this problem is the use of active probing paradigms in which responses to stimuli are used to detect underlying system changes leading up to seizures. This work evaluates the theoretical and mechanistic underpinnings of this strategy using a well-studied seizure-generating neural mass model with two coupled populations. Different simulations are done by shifting parameters (excitability, slow inhibition, and coupling gains) towards ictal states while low-frequency probing stimuli are applied to either one or both populations. The correlation between the extracted features and the shifted parameter indicates if the impending transition to the ictal state may be identified in advance. Results show that not only can the response to the probing stimuli forecast seizures but this is true regardless of the altered ictogenic parameter. That is, similar feature changes are highlighted by probing stimuli responses in advance of the seizure including: increased response variance and lag-1 autocorrelation, decreased skewness, and increased mutual information between the outputs of both model subsets. These changes were restricted to the stimulated population, showing a local effect of this perturbational approach. The transition latencies from normal activity to sustained discharges of spikes were not affected, suggesting that stimuli had no pro-ictal effects. However, stimuli were found to elicit interictal-like spikes just before the transition to the ictal state. Furthermore, the observed feature changes highlighted by probing the neuronal populations may reflect the phenomenon of critical slowing down, where increased recovery times from perturbations may signal the loss of a systems resilience and are common hallmarks of an impending critical transition. These results provide more evidence that active probing approaches highlight information about underlying system changes involved in ictogenesis and may be able to play a role in assisting seizure forecasting methods which can be incorporated into early-warning systems that ultimately enable closing the loop for targeted seizure-controlling interventions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Brain Activation-based Filtering: a Scholarly Journal Recommendation Model for Human Neuroimaging Studies</title>

	<description>The development of noninvasive neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging was followed by a large volume of human neuroimaging studies of mental processes, mechanisms, and diseases. Due to the high volume of studies and the large number of journals, it is increasingly challenging for neuroscientists to review existing scholarly journals and find the most suitable journal to publish their studies. Therefore, this paper proposes a scholarly journal recommendation model for human neuroimaging studies called brain activation-based filtering (BAF). Based on the collective matrix factorization technique, BAF recommends journals relevant to the activated brain regions that are described in a given neuroimaging study. For instance, if  social brain regions such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and temporoparietal junction are activated in a study, BAF recommends relevant social neuroscience journals (e.g., Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience). Five-fold cross-validation shows that BAF predicts journals with a reliable area under the curve score of 0.855. Furthermore, an interactive Google Colab notebook is offered to recommend relevant journals for a novel human neuroimaging study (https://github.com/JunsolKim/brain-activation-based-filtering).</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The mouse cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.326876v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic loop is one of the fundamental network motifs in the brain. Revealing its structural and functional organization is critical to understanding cognition, sensorimotor behavior, and the natural history of many neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. Classically, the basal ganglia is conceptualized to contain three primary information output channels: motor, limbic, and associative. However, given the roughly 65 cortical areas and two dozen thalamic nuclei that feed into the dorsal striatum, a three-channel view is overly simplistic for explaining the myriad functions of the basal ganglia. Recent works from our lab and others have subdivided the dorsal striatum into numerous functional domains based on convergent and divergent inputs from the cortex and thalamus. To complete this work, we generated a comprehensive data pool of ~700 injections placed across the striatum, external globus pallidus (GPe), substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), thalamic nuclei, and cortex. We identify 14 domains of SNr, 36 in the GPe, and 6 in the parafascicular and ventromedial thalamic nuclei. Subsequently, we identify 6 parallel cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic subnetworks that sequentially transduce specific subsets of cortical information with complex patterns of convergence and divergence through every elemental node of the entire cortico-basal ganglia loop. These experiments reveal multiple important novel features of the cortico-basal ganglia network motif. The prototypical sub-network structure is characterized by a highly interconnected nature, with cortical information processing through one or more striatal nodes, which send a convergent output to the SNr and a more parallelized output to the GPe; the GPe output then converges with the SNr. A domain of the thalamus receives the nigral output, and is interconnected with both the striatal domains and the cortical areas that filter into its nigral input source. This study provides conceptual advancement of our understanding of the structural and functional organization of the classic cortico-basal ganglia network.</description>

	<description>Purposeful behavior requires planning of actions based on external information. However, neuronal mechanisms converting sensory input into a motor plan remain elusive. Here, we combined wide-field calcium imaging, multi-area single-neuron recordings and focal optogenetic inactivation to reveal the precise sequence of cortical activity transforming sensory information into motor planning in mice trained to respond to a brief whisker stimulus by licking after a delay. We found that upon learning, the sensory information, initially highly-localized, rapidly spreads to diverse motor and higher-order areas, together with transient deactivation of orofacial regions, converging during the delay period to a focalized region of the frontal cortex. The secondary whisker motor cortex (wM2) appears as a key relay of this sensorimotor transformation, showing the earliest learning-enhanced response to the whisker stimulus. Our results suggest a specific cortical circuit with wM2 acquiring a pivotal role in transforming whisker information into preparatory activity for goal-directed motor planning.</description>

	<description>For many animal species, vocal communication is a critical social behavior, often a necessary component of reproductive success. In addition to the role of vocal behavior in social interactions, vocalizations are often demanding motor acts. Through understanding the genes involved in regulating and permitting vertebrate vocalization, we can better understand the mechanisms regulating vocal and, more broadly, motor behaviors. Here, we use RNA-sequencing to investigate neural gene expression underlying the performance of an extreme vocal behavior, the courtship hum of the plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus). Single hums can last up to two hours and may be repeated throughout an evening of courtship activity. We asked whether vocal behavioral states are associated with specific gene expression signatures in key brain regions that regulate vocalization by comparing transcript levels in humming versus non-humming males. We find that the circadian-related genes period3 and Clock are significantly upregulated in the vocal motor nucleus and preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus, respectively, in humming compared to non-humming males, indicating that internal circadian clocks may differ between these divergent behavioral states. In addition, we identify suites of differentially expressed genes related to synaptic transmission, ion channels and transport, hormone signaling, and metabolism and antioxidant activity that may permit or support humming behavior. These results underscore the importance of the known circadian control of midshipman humming and provide testable candidate genes for future studies of the neuroendocrine and motor control of energetically demanding courtship behaviors in midshipman fish and other vertebrate groups.</description>

	<description>Real-time fMRI guided neurofeedback training has gained increasing interest as a non-invasive brain regulation technique with the potential to normalize functional brain alterations in therapeutic contexts. Individual variations in learning success and treatment response have been observed, yet the neural substrates underlying the learning of self-regulation remain unclear. Against this background, we explored potential brain structural predictors for learning success with pooled data from three real-time fMRI datasets. Our analysis revealed that gray matter volume of the right putamen could predict neurofeedback learning success across the three datasets (n = 66 in total). Importantly, the original studies employed different neurofeedback paradigms during which different brain regions were trained pointing to a general association with learning success independent of specific aspects of the experimental design. Given the role of the putamen in associative learning the finding may reflect an important role of instrumental learning processes and brain structural variations in associated brain regions for successful acquisition of fMRI neurofeedback-guided self-regulation.</description>

	<description>Rodents are frequently used to model drug addiction, yet their genetic relevance to human addictive behaviors especially the mounting genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings is poorly understood. Considering a possible gateway drug role of nicotine (NIC), we modeled NIC addiction, specifically NIC sensitization (SST) and self-administration (SA), in F1 progeny of inbred Envigo rats (F344/BN) and conducted integrative genomics analyses. We unexpectedly observed male-specific NIC SST and a parental effect of SA only present in paternal F344 crosses. Transcriptional profiling in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell further revealed sex and brain region-specific transcriptomic signatures of SST and SA. We found that genes associated with SST and SA were enriched for those related to synaptic processes, myelin sheath, and tobacco use disorder or chemdependency. Interestingly, SST-associated genes were often downregulated in male VTA but upregulated in female VTA, and strongly enriched for smoking GWAS risk variants, possibly explaining the male-specific SST. For SA, we found widespread region-specific allelic imbalance of expression (AIE), of which genes showing AIE bias towards paternal F344 alleles in NAc core were strongly enriched for SA-associated genes and for GWAS risk variants of smoking initiation, likely contributing to the parental effect of SA. The transcriptional signatures of sex-specific nicotine SST and SA suggest a mechanistic link between genes underlying these processes and human nicotine addiction, providing a resource for understanding the biology underlying the GWAS findings on human smoking and other addictive phenotypes.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: An analysis of tissue-specific alternative splicing at the protein level</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jose Manuel Rodriguez, Fernando Pozo, Tomas di Domenico, Jesus Vazquez, Michael L. Tress&lt;/p&gt;

The role of alternative splicing is one of the great unanswered questions in cellular biology. There is strong evidence for alternative splicing at the transcript level, and transcriptomics experiments show that many splice events are tissue specific. It has been suggested that alternative splicing evolved in order to remodel tissue-specific protein-protein networks. Here we investigated the evidence for tissue-specific splicing among splice isoforms detected in a large-scale proteomics analysis. Although the data supporting alternative splicing is limited at the protein level, clear patterns emerged among the small numbers of alternative splice events that we could detect in the proteomics data. More than a third of these splice events were tissue-specific and most were ancient: over 95% of splice events that were tissue-specific in both proteomics and RNAseq analyses evolved prior to the ancestors of lobe-finned fish, at least 400 million years ago. By way of contrast, three in four alternative exons in the human gene set arose in the primate lineage, so our results cannot be extrapolated to the whole genome. Tissue-specific alternative protein forms in the proteomics analysis were particularly abundant in nervous and muscle tissues and their genes had roles related to the cytoskeleton and either the structure of muscle fibres or cell-cell connections. Our results suggest that this conserved tissue-specific alternative splicing may have played a role in the development of the vertebrate brain and heart.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RaxpIoGOwSw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We developed a computational platform including machine learning and a mechanistic mathematical model to find the optimal protocol for administration of platinum-doublet chemotherapy in a palliative setting. The platform has been applied to advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The 42 NSCLC patients treated with palliative intent at Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, were collected from a retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed in 2004–2014. Patients were followed-up, for three years. Clinical data collected include complete information about the clinical course of the patients including treatment schedule, response according to RECIST classification, and survival. The core of the platform is the mathematical model, in the form of a system of ordinary differential equations, describing dynamics of platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant cancer cells and interactions reflecting competition for space and resources. The model is simulated stochastically by sampling the parameter values from a joint probability distribution function. The machine learning model is applied to calibrate the mathematical model and to fit it to the overall survival curve. The model simulations faithfully reproduce the clinical cohort at three levels long-term response (OS), the initial response (according to RECIST criteria), and the relationship between the number of chemotherapy cycles and time between two consecutive chemotherapy cycles. In addition, we investigated the relationship between initial and long-term response. We showed that those two variables do not correlate which means that we cannot predict patient survival solely based on the initial response. We also tested several chemotherapy schedules to find the best one for patients treated with palliative intent. We found that the optimal treatment schedule depends, among others, on the strength of competition among various subclones in a tumor. The computational platform developed allows optimizing chemotherapy protocols, within admissible limits of toxicity, for palliative treatment of metastatic NSCLC. The simplicity of the method allows its application to chemotherapy optimization in different cancers.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cJ577BZUvzM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Protein binding to small molecules is fundamental to many biological processes, yet it remains challenging to predictively design this functionality &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt;. Current state-of-the-art computational design methods typically rely on existing small molecule binding sites or protein scaffolds with existing shape complementarity for a target ligand. Here we introduce new methods that utilize pools of discrete contacts between protein side chains and defined small molecule ligand substructures (ligand fragments) observed in the Protein Data Bank. We use the Rosetta Molecular Modeling Suite to recombine protein side chains in these contact pools to generate hundreds of thousands of energetically favorable binding sites for a target ligand. These composite binding sites are built into existing scaffold proteins matching the intended binding site geometry with high accuracy. In addition, we apply pools of side chain rotamers interacting with the target ligand to augment Rosetta’s conventional design machinery and improve key metrics known to be predictive of design success. We demonstrate that our method reliably builds diverse binding sites into different scaffold proteins for a variety of target molecules. Our generalizable &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; ligand binding site design method provides a foundation for versatile design of protein to interface previously unattainable molecules for applications in medical diagnostics and synthetic biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tLCJEdsBOQ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Delayed global feedback in the genesis and stability of spatiotemporal excitation patterns in paced biological excitable media</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhen Song, Zhilin Qu&lt;/p&gt;

Biological excitable media, such as cardiac or neural cells and tissue, exhibit memory in which a change in the present excitation may affect the behaviors in the next excitation. For example, a change in calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) concentration in a cell in the present excitation may affect the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics in the next excitation via bi-directional coupling between voltage and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, forming a delayed feedback loop. Since the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics inside the excitable cells are spatiotemporal while the membrane voltage is a global signal, the feedback loop is then a delayed global feedback (DGF) loop. In this study, we investigate the roles of DGF in the genesis and stability of spatiotemporal excitation patterns in periodically-paced excitable media using mathematical models with different levels of complexity: a model composed of coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo units, a 3-dimensional physiologically-detailed ventricular myocyte model, and a coupled map lattice model. We investigate the dynamics of excitation patterns that are temporal period-2 (P2) and spatially concordant or discordant, such as subcellular concordant or discordant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;alternans in cardiac myocytes or spatially concordant or discordant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and repolarization alternans in cardiac tissue. Our modeling approach allows both computer simulations and rigorous analytical treatments, which lead to the following results and conclusions. When DGF is absent, concordant and discordant P2 patterns occur depending on initial conditions with the discordant P2 patterns being spatially random. When the DGF is negative, only concordant P2 patterns exist. When the DGF is positive, both concordant and discordant P2 patterns can occur. The discordant P2 patterns are still spatially random, but they satisfy that the global signal exhibits a temporal period-1 behavior. The theoretical analyses of the coupled map lattice model reveal the underlying instabilities and bifurcations caused by the DGF for the genesis, selection, and stability of spatiotemporal excitation patterns.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cM8FtjAYdZk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Estimation of the force of infection and infectious period of skin sores in remote Australian communities using interval-censored data</title>

Prevalence of impetigo (skin sores) remains high in remote Australian Aboriginal communities, Fiji, and other areas of socio-economic disadvantage. Skin sore infections, driven primarily in these settings by Group A &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; (GAS) contribute substantially to the disease burden in these areas. Despite this, estimates for the force of infection, infectious period and basic reproductive ratio—all necessary for the construction of dynamic transmission models—have not been obtained. By utilising three datasets each containing longitudinal infection information on individuals, we estimate each of these epidemiologically important parameters. With an eye to future study design, we also quantify the optimal sampling intervals for obtaining information about these parameters. We verify the estimation method through a simulation estimation study, and test each dataset to ensure suitability to the estimation method. We find that the force of infection differs by population prevalence, and the infectious period is estimated to be between 12 and 20 days. We also find that optimal sampling interval depends on setting, with an optimal sampling interval between 9 and 11 days in a high prevalence setting, and 21 and 27 days for a lower prevalence setting. These estimates unlock future model-based investigations on the transmission dynamics of skin sores.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TWADoKP271A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cooperative DNA binding is a key feature of transcriptional regulation. Here we examined the role of cooperativity in Notch signaling by CRISPR-mediated engineering of mice in which neither Notch1 nor Notch2 can homo- or heterodimerize, essential for cooperative binding to sequence-paired sites (SPS) located near many Notch-regulated genes. Although most known Notch-dependent phenotypes were unaffected in Notch1/2 dimer–deficient mice, a subset of tissues proved highly sensitive to loss of cooperativity. These phenotypes include heart development, compromised viability in combination with low gene dose, and the gut, developing ulcerative colitis in response to 1% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The most striking phenotypes—gender imbalance and splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma—emerged in combination with gene dose reduction or when challenged by chronic fur mite infestation. This study highlights the role of the environment in malignancy and colitis and is consistent with Notch-dependent anti-parasite immune responses being compromised in Notch dimer–deficient animals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OhWkoT8JGR4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. However, the molecular mechanism controlling microglial Aβ phagocytosis is poorly understood. Here we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino 1 (Peli1) is induced in the microglia of AD-like five familial AD (5×FAD) mice, whose phagocytic efficiency for Aβ was then impaired, and therefore &lt;i&gt;Peli1&lt;/i&gt; depletion suppressed the Aβ deposition in the brains of 5×FAD mice. Mechanistic characterizations indicated that Peli1 directly targeted CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)β, a major transcription factor responsible for the transcription of scavenger receptor CD36. Peli1 functioned as a direct E3 ubiquitin ligase of C/EBPβ and mediated its ubiquitination-induced degradation. Consequently, loss of Peli1 increased the protein levels of C/EBPβ and the expression of CD36 and thus, promoted the phagocytic ability in microglial cells. Together, our findings established Peli1 as a critical regulator of microglial phagocytosis and highlighted the therapeutic potential by targeting Peli1 for the treatment of microglia-mediated neurological diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/FApN5VBcNuo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Rational design of balanced dual-targeting antibiotics with limited resistance</title>

Antibiotics that inhibit multiple bacterial targets offer a promising therapeutic strategy against resistance evolution, but developing such antibiotics is challenging. Here we demonstrate that a rational design of balanced multitargeting antibiotics is feasible by using a medicinal chemistry workflow. The resultant lead compounds, ULD1 and ULD2, belonging to a novel chemical class, almost equipotently inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV complexes and interact with multiple evolutionary conserved amino acids in the ATP-binding pockets of their target proteins. ULD1 and ULD2 are excellently potent against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria. Notably, the efficacy of these compounds was tested against a broad panel of multidrug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; clinical strains. Antibiotics with clinical relevance against staphylococcal infections fail to inhibit a significant fraction of these isolates, whereas both ULD1 and ULD2 inhibit all of them (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] ≤1 μg/mL). Resistance mutations against these compounds are rare, have limited impact on compound susceptibility, and substantially reduce bacterial growth. Based on their efficacy and lack of toxicity demonstrated in murine infection models, these compounds could translate into new therapies against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/SHPpibAf0pQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Mental operations in rhythm: Motor-to-sensory transformation mediates imagined singing</title>

What enables the mental activities of thinking verbally or humming in our mind? We hypothesized that the interaction between motor and sensory systems induces speech and melodic mental representations, and this motor-to-sensory transformation forms the neural basis that enables our verbal thinking and covert singing. Analogous with the neural entrainment to auditory stimuli, participants imagined singing lyrics of well-known songs rhythmically while their neural electromagnetic signals were recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We found that when participants imagined singing the same song in similar durations across trials, the delta frequency band (1–3 Hz, similar to the rhythm of the songs) showed more consistent phase coherence across trials. This neural phase tracking of imagined singing was observed in a frontal-parietal-temporal network: the proposed motor-to-sensory transformation pathway, including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), insula (INS), premotor area, intra-parietal sulcus (IPS), temporal-parietal junction (TPJ), primary auditory cortex (Heschl’s gyrus [HG]), and superior temporal gyrus (STG) and sulcus (STS). These results suggest that neural responses can entrain the rhythm of mental activity. Moreover, the theta-band (4–8 Hz) phase coherence was localized in the auditory cortices. The mu (9–12 Hz) and beta (17–20 Hz) bands were observed in the right-lateralized sensorimotor systems that were consistent with the singing context. The gamma band was broadly manifested in the observed network. The coherent and frequency-specific activations in the motor-to-sensory transformation network mediate the internal construction of perceptual representations and form the foundation of neural computations for mental operations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/r81mYLnIko4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence has suggested an association between sleep duration and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it is unclear if sleep duration is a manifestation of the AD disease process. We studied whether genetic liability for AD predicts sleep duration using a genetic risk score (GRS) for AD (AD‐GRS), in 406,536 UK Biobank participants with European ancestry and without dementia at enrollment. Higher AD‐GRS score was associated with shorter sleep (b = −0.014, 95% confidence interval [CI] = −0.022 to −0.006), especially in those aged 55+. Using AD‐GRS as an instrumental variable for AD diagnosis, incipient AD reduced sleep duration by 1.87 hours (95% CI = 0.96, 2.78). Short sleep duration might be an early marker of AD.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Rivastigmine in Parkinson's Disease Dementia with Orthostatic Hypotension</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25923?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25923?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate if the cognitive benefit of rivastigmine is affected by the presence of orthostatic hypotension (OH) in patients with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a post‐hoc analysis on 1,047 PDD patients from two randomized controlled trials comparing rivastigmine vs. placebo at week 24 (n = 501) and rivastigmine patch vs. capsule at week 76 (n = 546). A drop ≥20 mm Hg in systolic or ≥ 10 in diastolic blood pressure upon standing classified subjects as OH+; otherwise, OH‐. The primary endpoint was the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale‐Cognitive subscale (ADAS‐Cog) at week 24 and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) at week 76, using intention‐to‐treat with retrieved dropout at week 24 and observed cases, at week 76, consistent with the original analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall safety was comparable between OH+ (n = 288, 27.5%) and OH‐ (n = 730, 69.7%), except for higher frequency of syncope (9.2%) in the OH+ placebo arm. The placebo‐adjusted effect of rivastigmine on ADAS‐Cog at week 24 was 5.6 ± 1.2 for OH+ and 1.9 ± 0.9 in OH‐ (p = 0.0165). Among OH+ subjects, the MDRS change from baseline at week 76 was higher for rivastigmine capsules vs. patch (10.6 ± 2.9 vs. ‐1.5 ± 3.0) (p = 0.031). The overall prevalence of OH+ was lower for rivastigmine than placebo at week 24 (28.3% vs 44.6%) (p = 0.0476).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cognitive benefit from rivastigmine is larger in PDD patients with OH, possibly mediated by a direct antihypotensive effect.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Optogenetic spreading depression elicits trigeminal pain and anxiety behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25926?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25926?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (SD) is an intense depolarization underlying migraine aura. Despite the weight of evidence linking SD to the pain phase of migraine, controversy remains over a causal role of SD in cephalgia because of the invasive nature of previous SD induction methods. To overcome this problem, we employed a novel minimally invasive optogenetic SD induction method and examined the effect SD on behavior.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic SD was induced as a single event or repeatedly every other day for 2 weeks. Endpoints including periorbital and hindpaw mechanical allodynia, mouse grimace, anxiety, and working memory were examined in male and female mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single SD produced bilateral periorbital mechanical allodynia that developed within 1 hour and resolved within 2 days. Sumatriptan prevented periorbital allodynia when administered immediately after SD. Repeated SDs also produced bilateral periorbital allodynia that lasted 4 days and resolved within 2 weeks after the last SD. In contrast, the hindpaw withdrawal thresholds did not change after repeated SDs suggesting that SD‐induced allodynia was limited to the trigeminal region. Moreover, repeated SDs increased mouse grimace scores 2 days after the last SD, while single SD did not. Repeated SD also increased thigmotaxis scores as a measure of anxiety. In contrast, neither single nor repeated SDs affected visuospatial working memory. We did not detect sexual dimorphism in any endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, these data show a clinically congruent causal relationship between SD, trigeminal pain and anxiety behavior possibly reflecting SD modulation of hypothalamic, thalamic and limbic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: NOTCH2NLC Intermediate‐length Repeat Expansions are Associated with Parkinson's Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; GGC repeat expansions were recently identified in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID); however, it remains unclear whether they occur in other neurodegenerative disorders. This study aimed to investigate the role of intermediate‐length &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; GGC repeat expansions in Parkinson's disease (PD). We screened for GGC repeat expansions in a cohort of 1011 PD patients and identified 11 patients with intermediate‐length repeat expansions ranging 41–52 repeats, with no repeat expansions in 1134 controls. Skin biopsy revealed phospho‐alpha synuclein deposition, confirming the PD diagnosis in two patients harboring intermediate‐length repeat expansions, who had previously been diagnosed with NIID or essential tremors. Fibroblasts from PD patients harboring intermediate‐length repeat expansions revealed &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; upregulation and autophagic dysfunction. Our results suggest that intermediate‐length repeat expansions in &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; are potentially associated with PD.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study aimed to determine the prevalence and mechanism of linear vertigo reported by the patients during the attacks of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). We prospectively evaluated the characteristics (rotational vs. linear) of positional vertigo in 70 patients with posterior and horizontal canal BPPV using a questionnaire allowing multiple choices. In patients with linear vertigo, we further assessed the directionality of linear vertigo. We adopted the velocity-storage model to explain the occurrence and direction of linear vertigo in these patients with BPPV. Patients reported only rotational vertigo in 46 (46/70, 65.7%), only linear vertigo in 10 (14.3%), and both rotational and linear vertigo in 14 (20%). The patients experienced fear from rotational vertigo in 54 (54/70, 77.1%) and from linear vertigo in 20 (20/70, 28.6%). The direction of linear vertigo was concordant with the direction of inertial acceleration predicted by the velocity-storage model. Patients with BPPV may experience linear as well as rotational vertigo during the attacks. This linear vertigo may be ascribed to centrally estimated inertial acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Tissue Clearing and Expansion Methods for Imaging Brain Pathology in Neurodegeneration: From Circuits to Synapses and Beyond</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Studying the structural alterations occurring during diseases of the nervous system requires imaging heterogeneous cell populations at the circuit, cellular and subcellular levels. Recent advancements in brain tissue clearing and expansion methods allow unprecedented detailed imaging of the nervous system through its entire scale, from circuits to synapses, including neurovascular and brain lymphatics elements. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of brain tissue clearing and expansion methods, mentioning their main advantages and limitations, and suggest their parallel implementation for circuits-to-synapses brain imaging using conventional (diffraction-limited) light microscopy -such as confocal, two-photon and light-sheet microscopy- to interrogate the cellular and molecular basis of neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss recent studies in which clearing and expansion methods have been successfully applied to study neuropathological processes in mouse models and postmortem human brain tissue. Volumetric imaging of cleared intact mouse brains and large human brain samples has allowed unbiased assessment of neuropathological hallmarks. In contrast, nanoscale imaging of expanded cells and brain tissue has been used to study the effect of protein aggregates on specific subcellular structures. Therefore, these approaches can be readily applied to study a wide range of brain processes and pathological mechanisms with cellular and subcellular resolution in a time- and cost-efficient manner. We consider that a broader implementation of these technologies is necessary to reveal the full landscape of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Optogenetic inhibition-mediated activity-dependent modification of CA1 pyramidal-interneuron connections during behavior</title>

	<description>In vitro work revealed that excitatory synaptic inputs to hippocampal inhibitory interneurons could undergo Hebbian, associative or non-associative plasticity. Both behavioral and learning-dependent reorganization of these connections has also been demonstrated by measuring spike transmission probabilities in pyramidal cell-interneuron spike cross-correlations that indicate monosynaptic connections. Here we investigated the activity-dependent modification of these connections during exploratory behavior in rats by optogenetically inhibiting pyramidal cell and interneuron subpopulations. Light application and associated firing alteration of pyramidal and interneuron populations led to lasting changes of pyramidal-interneuron connection weights as indicated by spike transmission changes. Spike transmission alterations were predicted by the light-mediated changes in the number of pre- and postsynaptic spike pairing events and by firing rate changes of interneurons but not pyramidal cells. This work demonstrates the presence of activity-dependent associative and non-associative reorganization of pyramidal-interneuron connections triggered by the optogenetic modification of the firing rate and spike synchrony of cells.</description>

	<title>eLife: Re-assessment of the involvement of Snord115 in the serotonin 2C receptor pathway in a genetically relevant mouse model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60862</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60862</link>
	<description>&lt;i&gt;SNORD115&lt;/i&gt; has been proposed to promote the activity of serotonin (HTR2C) receptor via its ability to base-pair with its pre-mRNA and regulate alternative RNA splicing and/or A-to-I RNA editing. Because &lt;i&gt;SNORD115&lt;/i&gt; genes are deleted in most patients with the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), diminished HTR2C receptor activity could contribute to the impaired emotional response and/or compulsive overeating characteristic of this disease. In order to test this appealing but never demonstrated hypothesis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we created a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated &lt;i&gt;Snord115&lt;/i&gt; knockout mouse. Surprisingly, we uncovered only modest region-specific alterations in &lt;i&gt;Htr2c&lt;/i&gt; RNA editing profiles while &lt;i&gt;Htr2c &lt;/i&gt;alternative RNA splicing was unchanged. These subtle changes, whose functional relevance remains uncertain, were not accompanied by any discernible defects in anxio-depressive-like phenotypes. Energy balance and eating behaviour were also normal, even after exposure to high fat diet. Our study raises questions concerning the physiological role of &lt;i&gt;SNORD115&lt;/i&gt;, notably its involvement in behavioural disturbance associated with PWS.</description>

	<title>eLife: nNOS-expressing interneurons control basal and behaviorally-evoked arterial dilation in somatosensory cortex of mice</title>

	<description>Cortical neural activity is coupled to local arterial diameter and blood flow. However, which neurons control the dynamics of cerebral arteries is not well understood. We dissected the cellular mechanisms controlling the basal diameter and evoked dilation in cortical arteries in awake, head-fixed mice. Locomotion drove robust arterial dilation, increases in gamma band power in the local field potential (LFP), and increases calcium signals in pyramidal and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-expressing neurons. Chemogenetic or pharmocological modulation of overall neural activity up or down caused corresponding increases or decreases in basal arterial diameter. Modulation of pyramidal neuron activity alone had little effect on basal or evoked arterial dilation, despite pronounced changes in the LFP. Modulation of the activity of nNOS-expressing neurons drove changes in the basal and evoked arterial diameter without corresponding changes in population neural activity.</description>

	<description>Vitamin B12 is an essential micronutrient that functions in two metabolic pathways: the canonical propionate breakdown pathway and the methionine/S-adenosylmethionine (Met/SAM) cycle. In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans,&lt;/i&gt; low vitamin B12, or genetic perturbation of the canonical propionate breakdown pathway results in propionate accumulation and the transcriptional activation of a propionate shunt pathway. This propionate-dependent mechanism requires &lt;i&gt;nhr-10&lt;/i&gt; and is referred to as 'B12-mechanism-I'. Here, we report that vitamin B12 represses the expression of Met/SAM cycle genes by a propionate-independent mechanism we refer to as 'B12-mechanism-II'. This mechanism is activated by perturbations in the Met/SAM cycle, genetically or due to low dietary vitamin B12. B12-mechanism-II requires &lt;i&gt;nhr-114&lt;/i&gt; to activate Met/SAM cycle gene expression, the vitamin B12 transporter, &lt;i&gt;pmp-5&lt;/i&gt;, and adjust influx and efflux of the cycle by activating msra-1 and repressing &lt;i&gt;cbs-1&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. Taken together, Met/SAM cycle activity is sensed and transcriptionally adjusted to be in a tight metabolic regime.</description>

	<title>eLife: Ebola and Marburg virus matrix layers are locally ordered assemblies of VP40 dimers</title>

	<description>Filoviruses such as Ebola and Marburg virus bud from the host membrane as enveloped virions. This process is achieved by the matrix protein VP40. When expressed alone, VP40 induces budding of filamentous virus-like particles, suggesting that localization to the plasma membrane, oligomerization into a matrix layer, and generation of membrane curvature are intrinsic properties of VP40. There has been no direct information on the structure of VP40 matrix layers within viruses or virus-like particles. We present structures of Ebola and Marburg VP40 matrix layers in intact virus-like particles, and within intact Marburg viruses. VP40 dimers assemble extended chains via C-terminal domain interactions. These chains stack to form 2D matrix lattices below the membrane surface. These lattices form a patchwork assembly across the membrane and suggesting that assembly may begin at multiple points. Our observations define the structure and arrangement of the matrix protein layer that mediates formation of filovirus particles.</description>

	<title>eLife: M2 cortex-dorsolateral striatum stimulation reverses motor symptoms and synaptic deficits in Huntington’s disease</title>

	<description>Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurological disorder characterized by motor disturbances. HD pathology is most prominent in the striatum, the central hub of the basal ganglia. The cerebral cortex is the main striatal afferent, and progressive cortico-striatal disconnection characterizes HD. We mapped striatal network dysfunction in HD mice to ultimately modulate the activity of a specific cortico-striatal circuit to ameliorate motor symptoms and recover synaptic plasticity. Multimodal MRI in vivo indicates cortico-striatal and thalamo-striatal functional network deficits and reduced glutamate/glutamine ratio in the striatum of HD mice. Moreover, optogenetically-induced glutamate release from M2 cortex terminals in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) was undetectable in HD mice and striatal neurons show blunted electrophysiological responses. Remarkably, repeated M2-DLS optogenetic stimulation normalized motor behavior in HD mice and evoked a sustained increase of synaptic plasticity. Overall, these results reveal that selective stimulation of the M2-DLS pathway can become an effective therapeutic strategy in HD.</description>

	<title>eLife: A powerful drug combination strategy targeting glutamine addiction for the treatment of human liver cancer</title>

	<description>The dependency of cancer cells on glutamine may be exploited therapeutically as a new strategy for treating cancers that lack druggable driver genes. Here we found that human liver cancer was dependent on extracellular glutamine. However, targeting glutamine addiction using the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 as monotherapy had a very limited anticancer effect, even against the most glutamine addicted human liver cancer cells. Using a chemical library, we identified V-9302, a novel inhibitor of glutamine transporter ASCT2, as sensitizing glutamine dependent (GD) cells to CB-839 treatment. Mechanically, a combination of CB-839 and V-9302 depleted glutathione and induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in apoptosis of GD cells. Moreover, this combination also showed tumor inhibition in HCC xenograft mouse models in vivo. Our findings indicate that dual inhibition of glutamine metabolism by targeting both glutaminase and glutamine transporter ASCT2 represents a potential novel treatment strategy for glutamine addicted liver cancers.</description>

	<title>eLife: Structural insights into mRNA reading frame regulation by tRNA modification and slippery codon-anticodon pairing</title>

	<description>Modifications in the tRNA anticodon loop, adjacent to the three-nucleotide anticodon, influence translation fidelity by stabilizing the tRNA to allow for accurate reading of the mRNA genetic code. One example is the N1-methylguaonosine modification at guanine nucleotide 37 (m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G37) located in the anticodon loop, immediately adjacent to the anticodon nucleotides 34-36. The absence of m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G37 in tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Pro&lt;/sup&gt; causes +1 frameshifting on polynucleotide, slippery codons. Here, we report structures of the bacterial ribosome containing tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Pro&lt;/sup&gt; bound to either cognate or slippery codons to determine how the m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G37 modification prevents mRNA frameshifting. The structures reveal that certain codon-anticodon contexts and m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G37 destabilize interactions of tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Pro&lt;/sup&gt; with the peptidyl site, causing large conformational changes typically only seen during EF-G mediated translocation of the mRNA-tRNA pairs. These studies provide molecular insights into how m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G37 stabilizes the interactions of tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Pro&lt;/sup&gt; with the ribosome and the influence of slippery codons on the mRNA reading frame.</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Update on Cerebellar Ataxia with Neuropathy and Bilateral Vestibular Areflexia Syndrome (CANVAS)</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The syndrome of cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia (CANVAS) has emerged progressively during the last 30 years. It was first outlined by the neurootology/neurophysiology community in the vestibular areflexic patients, through the description of patients slowly developing late-onset cerebellar ataxia and bilateral vestibulopathy. The characteristic deficit of visuo-vestibulo-ocular reflex (VVOR) due to the impaired slow stabilizing eye movements was put forward and a specific disease subtending this syndrome was suggested. The association to a peripheral sensory axonal neuropathy was described later on, with neuropathological studies demonstrating that both sensory neuropathy and vestibular areflexia were diffuse ganglionopathy. Clinical and electrophysiological criteria of CANVAS were then proposed in 2016. Besides the classical triad, frequent chronic cough, signs of dysautonomia and neurogenic pains were frequently observed. From the beginning of published cohorts, sporadic as well as familial cases were reported, the last suggestive of an autosomal recessive mode of transmission. The genetic disorder was discovered in 2019, under the form of abnormal biallelic expansion in the replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) in a population of late-onset ataxia. This pathological expansion was found in 100% of the familial form and 92% of sporadic ones when the triad was complete. But using the genetic criteria, the phenotype of CANVAS seems to expand, for exemple including patients with isolated neuronopathy. We propose here to review the clinical, electrophysiological, anatomical, genetic aspect of CANVAS in light of the recent discovery of the genetic aetiology, and discuss differential diagnosis, neuropathology and physiopathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A recessive biallelic repeat expansion, (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;, in the &lt;i&gt;RFC1&lt;/i&gt; gene has been reported to be a frequent cause of late‐onset ataxia. For cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), the recessive biallelic (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; genotype was present in ~92% of cases. This study aimed to examine whether the pentanucleotide repeat (PNR) was related to multiple system atrophy (MSA), which shares a spectrum of symptoms with CANVAS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we screened the pathogenic (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; repeat and 5 other PNRs in 104 Chinese sporadic adult‐onset ataxia of unknown aetiology (SAOA) patients, 282 MSA patients, and 203 unaffected individuals. Multiple molecular genetic tests were used, including long‐range polymerase chain reaction (PCR), repeat‐primed PCR (RP‐PCR), Sanger sequencing, and Southern blot. Comprehensive clinical assessments were conducted, including neurological examination, neuroimaging, nerve electrophysiology, and examination of vestibular function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified biallelic (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; in 1 SAOA patient and 3 MSA patients. Additionally, 1 MSA patient had the (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;/(AAAGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; genotype with uncertain pathogenicity. We also described the carrier frequency for different PNRs in our cohorts. Furthermore, we summarized the distinct phenotypes of affected patients, suggesting that biallelic (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; in &lt;i&gt;RFC1&lt;/i&gt; could be associated with MSA and should be screened routinely in the MSA diagnostic workflow.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results expanded the clinical phenotypic spectrum of &lt;i&gt;RFC1&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders and raised the possibility that MSA might share the same genetic background as CANVAS, which is crucial for re‐evaluating the current CANVAS and MSA diagnostic criteria.

	<title>The Cerebellum: Neuronal Activity of Pallidal Versus Cerebellar Receiving Thalamus in Patients with Cervical Dystonia</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cervical dystonia (CD) is a movement disorder characterized by a stereotyped pattern of involuntary turning or tilting of the head, often combined with jerky or tremulous movements. Hypotheses for the origin of CD have traditionally focused on the basal ganglia, but the contemporary discussion has considered the potential role of altered cerebellar function. As basal ganglia and the cerebellum largely project to the different thalamic nuclei, alterations in pallidal versus cerebellar output could be reflected in the activity of these thalamic regions. In this study, we analyzed a unique historic database where the single-unit activity of pallidal and cerebellar receiving thalamic nuclei was measured en route to the mesencephalon. We compared the single-unit activity of pallidal and cerebellar receiving thalamic neurons in three groups of CD patients manifesting as pure dystonia, pure jerky head oscillations, and dystonia plus jerky head oscillations. We found that among different CD manifestations, the characteristics of neuronal firing, such as burst versus a single-spike pattern, vary in cerebellar thalamic receiving nuclei. The cerebellar receiving region in patients with jerky oscillations had single-spikes neurons primarily. Wherein the manifestation of CD did not influence pattern distribution in the pallidal receiving thalamic area. We also found increased neuronal firing rate correlated with strength of theta-band neuronal oscillations during muscle contractions associated with dystonia. These results demonstrate that the manifestations of CD, such as pure dystonia, pure jerky head oscillations, or dystonia and jerky head oscillations, determine the thalamic neuronal properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A 50-year-old patient was admitted with symptoms of intracranial hypotension. MRI revealed a cervical myelomalacia caused by engorged epidural veins leading to a stenosis of the spinal canal. This condition is rarely described in patients with hydrocephalus and ventricular shunts suffering from chronic overdrainage. However, the reason in this patient was a CSF leak caused by an intradural disc herniation at T12/L1. After surgery, symptoms resolved and the cervical &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-underline&quot;&gt;myelomalacia&lt;/span&gt; and the swollen epidural veins disappeared on postoperative MRI.
      In patients with engorged cervical epidural veins without a ventricular shunt, a CSF leak has to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) has so far been based on retrospective case series. The results of six randomized clinical trials including five different monoclonal antibodies targeting four molecules and three distinct pathophysiological pathways have recently been published.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Literature search on clinical trials and case studies in NMOSD up to July 10. 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We review mechanism of action, efficacy and side effects, and consequences for reproductive health from traditional immunosuppressants and monoclonal antibodies including rituximab, inebilizumab, eculizumab, tocilizumab and satralizumab.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In NMOSD patients with antibodies against aquaporin 4, monoclonal antibodies that deplete B cells (rituximab and inebilizumab) or interfere with interleukin 6 signaling (tocilizumab and satralizumab) or complement activation (eculizumab) have superior efficacy compared to placebo. Tocilizumab and rituximab were also superior to azathioprine in head-to-head studies. Rituximab, tocilizumab and to some extent eculizumab have well-known safety profiles for other inflammatory diseases, and rituximab and azathioprine may be safe during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;There are no effective symptomatic treatments for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Recent studies report benefits of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for freezing of gait (FOG) and gait disorders in Parkinson’s disease and atypical Parkinsonism patients. This is the first study to report therapeutic effects of SCS in Richardson’s syndrome PSP (PSP-RS) patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Epidural SCS was implanted in three female PSP-RS participants (3.2 ± 1.3 years with disease). Six programs (300–400 µs/30–130 Hz) were randomly tested at suprathreshold intensity on separate days. The setting that best improved gait/FOG was used daily by each participant in the study. Protokinetics walkway captured spatiotemporal gait measures and FOG episodes (turning on the spot and while walking) and clinical scales including FOG questionnaire, UPDRS-III (OFF-/ON-&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-dopa), and participant-perceived global impression of change (GISC) were collected at pre-SCS, and 3, 6, 12 months post-SCS.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Participant #1 demonstrated the highest GISC score (6.5/10) with a consistent reduction of FOGs by 43.8%, UPDRS-III score (− 5 points), and improved step length and stride velocity (33.6%) while maintaining a &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-dopa response of ~ 12% over the 12 months. Participant #2, walking FOG frequency and turning duration was reduced by 39.0% (OFF-&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-dopa), and ON-&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-dopa UPDRS-III score worsened (+ 5 points) at 12 months. Participant #3, FOG frequency reduced by 75% up to 6 months rating a GISC 3/10 score, however disease severity worsened at 12 months. Ambulatory gait parameters universally improved by 29.6% in all participants.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The results support the benefit of SCS for FOG and gait symptoms in PSP-RS and suggests early SCS intervention for dopaminergic-resistant gait should be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Early posterior negativity in humans to pictures of snakes and spiders: effects of proximity</title>

	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-020-05925-5</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Snakes have proven to drive early attentional capture due to their evolutionary importance, as reflected by the early posterior negativity (EPN). The EPN snake effect might be partly driven by the proximity of the animal. In this study, by employing full-body (medium shot) and head-focused (close-up) pictures, we investigated whether the relative nearness (proximity) of the animal on the picture affects the snake EPN effect. We presented thirty participants with medium shot and close-up snake, spider and bird pictures in a rapid serial presentation paradigm at a presentation rate of three frames per second. We extracted the mean EPN activity from the 225–330 ms time frame after stimulus onset at the parietal–occipital cluster (PO3, O1, Oz, O2, PO4). The results indicate enhanced EPN for snake pictures as compared to spider and bird pictures. In addition, medium-shot snake pictures elicited higher EPN amplitudes than close-up snake pictures, suggesting that the EPN is higher when local, high spatial frequency attributes are visible. Spatial frequency analysis of the stimuli indicated that medium-shot snake pictures possess more power in the high spatial frequency bands, compared to medium-shot spider and bird pictures.

Deep feedforward neural network models of vision dominate in both computational neuroscience and engineering. The primate visual system, by contrast, contains abundant recurrent connections. Recurrent signal flow enables recycling of limited computational resources over time, and so might boost the performance of a physically finite brain or model. Here we show: (1) Recurrent convolutional neural network models outperform feedforward convolutional models matched in their number of parameters in large-scale visual recognition tasks on natural images. (2) Setting a confidence threshold, at which recurrent computations terminate and a decision is made, enables flexible trading of speed for accuracy. At a given confidence threshold, the model expends more time and energy on images that are harder to recognise, without requiring additional parameters for deeper computations. (3) The recurrent model’s reaction time for an image predicts the human reaction time for the same image better than several parameter-matched and state-of-the-art feedforward models. (4) Across confidence thresholds, the recurrent model emulates the behaviour of feedforward control models in that it achieves the same accuracy at approximately the same computational cost (mean number of floating-point operations). However, the recurrent model can be run longer (higher confidence threshold) and then outperforms parameter-matched feedforward comparison models. These results suggest that recurrent connectivity, a hallmark of biological visual systems, may be essential for understanding the accuracy, flexibility, and dynamics of human visual recognition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O-ZEKwc_nYY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Uncovering the underlying biophysical principles of emergent collective computational abilities, such as working memory, in neural circuits is one of the most essential concerns in modern neuroscience. Working memory system is often desired to be robust against noises. Such systems can be highly flexible for adapting environmental demands. How neural circuits reconfigure themselves according to the cognitive task requirement remains unclear. Previous studies explored the robustness and the flexibility in working memory by tracing individual dynamical trajectories in a limited time scale, where the accuracy of the results depends on the volume of the collected statistical data. Inspired by thermodynamics and statistical mechanics in physical systems, we developed a non-equilibrium landscape and flux framework for studying the neural network dynamics. Applying this approach to a biophysically based working memory model, we investigated how changes in the recurrent excitation mediated by slow NMDA receptors within a selective population and mutual inhibition mediated by GABAergic interneurons between populations affect the robustness against noises. This is realized through quantifying the underlying non-equilibrium potential landscape topography and the kinetics of state switching. We found that an optimal compromise for a working memory circuit between the robustness and the flexibility can be achieved through the emergence of an intermediate state between the working memory states. An optimal combination of both increased self-excitation and inhibition can enhance the flexibility to external signals without significantly reducing the robustness to the random fluctuations. Furthermore, we found that the enhanced performance in working memory is supported by larger energy consumption. Our approach can facilitate the design of new network structure for cognitive functions with the optimal balance between performance and cost. Our work also provides a new paradigm for exploring the underlying mechanisms of many cognitive functions based on non-equilibrium physics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1_XeN3HW1Lw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Modeling the activation of the alternative complement pathway and its effects on hemolysis in health and disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Antonello Caruso, Jannik Vollmer, Matthias Machacek, Elod Kortvely&lt;/p&gt;

The complement system is a powerful mechanism of innate immunity poised to eliminate foreign cells and pathogens. It is an intricate network of &amp;gt;35 proteins, which, once activated, leads to the tagging of the surface to be eliminated, produces potent chemoattractants to recruit immune cells, and inserts cytotoxic pores into nearby lipid surfaces. Although it can be triggered via different pathways, its net output is largely based on the direct or indirect activation of the alternative pathway. Complement dysregulation or deficiencies may cause severe pathologies, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), where a lack of complement control proteins leads to hemolysis and life-threatening anemia. The complexity of the system poses a challenge for the interpretation of experimental data and the design of effective pharmacological therapies. To address this issue, we developed a mathematical model of the alternative complement pathway building on previous modelling efforts. The model links complement activation to the hemolytic activity of the terminal alternative pathway, providing an accurate description of pathway activity as observed in vitro and in vivo, in health and disease. Through adjustment of the parameters describing experimental conditions, the model was capable of reproducing the results of an array of standard assays used in complement research. To demonstrate its clinical applicability, we compared model predictions with clinical observations of the recovery of hematological biomarkers in PNH patients treated with the complement inhibiting anti-C5 antibody eculizumab. In conclusion, the model can enhance the understanding of complement biology and its role in disease pathogenesis, help identifying promising targets for pharmacological intervention, and predict the outcome of complement-targeting pharmacological interventions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oAxIvuJpFf8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A mathematical model of the metastatic bottleneck predicts patient outcome and response to cancer treatment</title>

Metastases are the main reason for cancer-related deaths. Initiation of metastases, where newly seeded tumor cells expand into colonies, presents a tremendous bottleneck to metastasis formation. Despite its importance, a quantitative description of metastasis initiation and its clinical implications is lacking. Here, we set theoretical grounds for the metastatic bottleneck with a simple stochastic model. The model assumes that the proliferation-to-death rate ratio for the initiating metastatic cells increases when they are surrounded by more of their kind. For a total of 159,191 patients across 13 cancer types, we found that a single cell has an extremely low median probability of successful seeding of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;. With increasing colony size, a sharp transition from very unlikely to very likely successful metastasis initiation occurs. The median metastatic bottleneck, defined as the critical colony size that marks this transition, was between 10 and 21 cells. We derived the probability of metastasis occurrence and patient outcome based on primary tumor size at diagnosis and tumor type. The model predicts that the efficacy of patient treatment depends on the primary tumor size but even more so on the severity of the metastatic bottleneck, which is estimated to largely vary between patients. We find that medical interventions aiming at tightening the bottleneck, such as immunotherapy, can be much more efficient than therapies that decrease overall tumor burden, such as chemotherapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-3xBb9QVb78&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented need for rapid diagnostic testing. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a standard assay that includes an RNA extraction step from a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab followed by reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect the purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The current global shortage of RNA extraction kits has caused a severe bottleneck to COVID-19 testing. The goal of this study was to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected from NP samples via a direct RT-qPCR assay that omits the RNA extraction step altogether. The direct RT-qPCR approach correctly identified 92% of a reference set of blinded NP samples (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 155) demonstrated to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by traditional clinical diagnostic RT-qPCR that included an RNA extraction. Importantly, the direct method had sufficient sensitivity to reliably detect those patients with viral loads that correlate with the presence of infectious virus. Thus, this strategy has the potential to ease supply choke points to substantially expand COVID-19 testing and screening capacity and should be applicable throughout the world.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wb1ocz_B5Hc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Clinical Variability in Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type III</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25900?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25900?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report natural history data in a large cohort of 199 patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type III assessed using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE). The aim of the study was to establish the annual rate and possible patterns of progression according to a number of variables, such as age of onset, age at assessment, &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copy number, and functional status.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HFMSE longitudinal changes were assessed using piecewise linear mixed‐effects models. The dependency in the data due to repeated measures was accounted for by a random intercept per individual and an unstructured covariance R matrix was used as correlation structure. An additional descriptive analysis was performed for 123 patients, for a total of 375 12‐month assessments.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A break point at age 7 years was set for the whole cohort and for SMA IIIA and IIIB. Age, SMA type, and ambulatory status were significantly associated with changes in mean HFMSE score, whereas gender and &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copy number were not. The increase in response before the break point of age 7 years is significant only for SMA IIIA (β = 1.79, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). After the break point, the change in the rate of HFMSE score significantly decrease for both SMA IIIA (β = −1.15, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and IIIB (β = −0.69, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings contribute to the understanding of the natural history of SMA type III and will be helpful in the interpretation of the real‐world data of patients treated with commercially available drugs. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Lesion Age Imaging in Acute Stroke: Water Uptake in CT Versus DWI‐FLAIR Mismatch</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25903?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25903?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In acute ischemic stroke with unknown time of onset, magnetic resonance (MR)‐based diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) estimates lesion age to guide intravenous thrombolysis. Computed tomography (CT)‐based quantitative net water uptake (NWU) may be a potential alternative. The purpose of this study was to directly compare CT‐based NWU to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at identifying patients with lesion age &amp;lt; 4.5 hours from symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty patients with acute anterior circulation stroke were analyzed with both imaging modalities at admission between 0.5 and 8.0 hours after known symptom onset. DWI‐FLAIR lesion mismatch was rated and NWU was measured in admission CT. An established NWU threshold (11.5%) was used to classify patients within and beyond 4.5 hours. Multiparametric MRI signal was compared with NWU using logistic regression analyses. The empirical distribution of NWU was analyzed in a consecutive cohort of patients with wake‐up stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median time between CT and MRI was 35 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] = 24–50). The accuracy of DWI‐FLAIR mismatch was 68.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 53.7–81.3%) with a sensitivity of 58% and specificity of 82%. The accuracy of NWU threshold was 86.0% (95% CI = 73.3–94.2%) with a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 78%. The area under the curve (AUC) of multiparametric MRI signal to classify lesion age &amp;lt;4.5 hours was 0.86 (95% CI = 0.64–0.97), and the AUC of quantitative NWU was 0.91 (95% CI = 0.78–0.98). Among 87 patients with wake‐up stroke, 46 patients (53%) showed low NWU (&amp;lt; 11.5%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The predictive power of CT‐based lesion water imaging to identify patients within the time window of thrombolysis was comparable to multiparametric DWI‐FLAIR MRI. A significant proportion of patients with wake‐up stroke exhibit low NWU and may therefore be potentially suitable for thrombolysis. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Network Localization of Alien Limb in Patients with Corticobasal Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25901?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25901?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perirolandic atrophy occurs in corticobasal syndrome (CBS) but is not specific versus progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). There is heterogeneity in the locations of atrophy outside the perirolandic cortex and it remains unknown why atrophy in different locations would cause the same CBS‐specific symptoms. In prior work, we used a wiring diagram of the brain called the human connectome to localize lesion‐induced disorders to symptom‐specific brain networks. Here, we use a similar technique termed “atrophy network mapping” to localize single‐subject atrophy maps to symptom‐specific brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single‐subject atrophy maps were generated by comparing cortical thickness in patients with CBS versus controls. Next, we performed seed‐based functional connectivity using a large normative connectome to determine brain regions functionally connected to each patient's atrophied locations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with CBS had perirolandic atrophy versus controls at the group level, but locations of atrophy in CBS were heterogeneous outside of the perirolandic cortex at the single‐subject level (mean spatial correlation = 0.04). In contrast, atrophy occurred in locations functionally connected to the perirolandic cortex in all patients with CBS (spatial correlation = 0.66). Compared with PSP, patients with CBS had atrophy connected to a network of higher‐order sensorimotor regions beyond perirolandic cortex, matching a CBS atrophy network from a recent meta‐analysis. Finally, atrophy network mapping identified a symptom‐specific network for alien limb, matching a lesion‐induced alien limb network and a network associated with agency in healthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a syndrome‐specific network for CBS and symptom‐specific network for alien limb using single‐subject atrophy maps and the human connectome. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Role of β3‐adrenergic receptor in the modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity in mouse cerebellar cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24712?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Role of β3‐adrenergic receptor in the modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity in mouse cerebellar cortex&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c4aaaad2-75c6-4dcf-a5b4-4e99acaa808b/jnr24712-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study is the first to investigate the localization and function of β3‐adrenoreceptor (AR) in the mouse cerebellum. The immunohistochemical analysis allowed us to demonstrate that β3‐AR is mainly expressed on Purkinje cells. In addition, we found that blocking β3‐AR interfered with motor learning and synaptic plasticity at the parallel fiber–Purkinje cell. The molecular mechanisms underlying the β3‐AR action are likely related to the activation of the PI3K signaling pathway in Purkinje cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convergent lines of evidence have recently highlighted β3‐adrenoreceptors (ARs) as a potentially critical target in the regulation of nervous and behavioral functions, including memory consolidation, anxiety, and depression. Nevertheless, the role of β3‐ARs in the cerebellum has been never investigated. To address this issue, we first examined the effects of pharmacological manipulation of β3‐ARs on motor learning in mice. We found that blockade of β3‐ARs by SR 59230A impaired the acquisition of the rotarod task with no effect on general locomotion. Since the parallel fiber–Purkinje cell (PF–PC) synapse is considered to be the main cerebellar locus of motor learning, we assessed β3‐AR modulatory action on this synapse as well as its expression in cerebellar slices. We demonstrate, for the first time, a strong expression of β3‐ARs on Purkinje cell soma and dendrites. In addition, whole‐cell patch‐clamp recordings revealed that bath application of β3‐AR agonist CL316,243 depressed the PF–PC excitatory postsynaptic currents via a postsynaptic mechanism mediated by the PI3K signaling pathway. Application of CL316,243 also interfered with the expression of PF long‐term potentiation, whereas SR 59230A prevented the induction of LTD at PF–PC synapse. These results underline the critical role of β3‐AR on cerebellar synaptic transmission and plasticity and provide a new mechanism for adrenergic modulation of motor learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Mechanisms underlying the enhancement of γ‐aminobutyric acid responses in the external globus pallidus of R6/2 Huntington’s disease model mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24710?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Mechanisms underlying the enhancement of γ‐aminobutyric acid responses in the external globus pallidus of R6/2 Huntington’s disease model mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f377046c-4556-4d82-b405-6d28b4ef52a9/jnr24710-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses evoked by selective stimulation of indirect pathway striatal neurons are increased in the external globus pallidus (GPe) of R6/2 mice. Using electrophysiology, optogenetics, immunohistochemistry and Western blots we demonstrate that GABA transporter, GAT‐3 function is reduced. This could explain increased decay time of evoked responses in the GPe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Huntington's disease (HD), the output of striatal indirect pathway medium‐sized spiny neurons (MSNs) is altered in its target region, the external globus pallidus (GPe). In a previous study we demonstrated that selective optogenetic stimulation of indirect pathway MSNs induced prolonged decay time of γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses in GPe neurons. Here we identified the mechanism underlying this alteration. Electrophysiological recordings in slices from symptomatic R6/2 and wildtype (WT) mice were used to evaluate, primarily, the effects of GABA transporter (GAT) antagonists on responses evoked by optogenetic activation of indirect pathway MSNs. In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blots (WBs) were used to examine GAT‐3 expression in HD and WT mice. A GAT‐3 blocker (SNAP5114) increased decay time of GABA responses in WT and HD GPe neurons, but the effect was significantly greater in WT neurons. In contrast, a GAT‐1 antagonist (NO‐711) or a GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist (CGP 54626) produced small increases in decay time but no differential effects between genotypes. IHC and WBs showed reduction of GAT‐3 expression in the GPe of HD mice. Thus, reduced expression or dysfunction of GAT‐3 could underlie alterations of GPe responses to GABA inputs from striatum and could be a target for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Role of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptors in stroke prevention and therapy—The best is yet to come?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24709?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Role of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptors (PPARs) in the pathophysiology of stroke and protective effects of PPAR ligands have been widely investigated in the last 20 years. Activation of all three PPAR isoforms, but especially PPAR‐γ, was documented to limit postischemic injury in the numerous &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, as well as in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies. PPARs have been demonstrated to act on multiple mechanisms and were shown to activate multiple protective pathways related to inflammation, apoptosis, BBB protection, neurogenesis, and oxidative stress. The aim of this review was to summarize two decades of PPAR research in stroke with emphasis on &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; animal studies. We focus on each PPAR receptor separately and detail their implication in stroke. This review also discusses recent clinical efforts in the field and the epidemiological data with regard to role of PPAR polymorphisms in susceptibility to stroke, and tries to draw conclusions and describe future perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Melatonin alters neuronal architecture and increases cysteine‐rich protein 1 signaling in the male mouse hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24708?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Melatonin alters neuronal architecture and increases cysteine‐rich protein 1 signaling in the male mouse hippocampus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0aec9295-07a8-415c-a143-0195472ed973/jnr24708-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exogenous melatonin significantly alters hippocampal neuronal micromorphometry, increases cysteine‐rich protein 1 (crp‐1) expression, and improves memory retention in mice. These findings expand our knowledge about the beneficial effects of melatonin on hippocampal neurons, and implicates alterations of structural neuroplasticity and crp‐1 upregulation as possible key players in this process of cognitive function improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal plasticity describes changes in structure, function, and connections of neurons. The hippocampus, in particular, has been shown to exhibit considerable plasticity regarding both physiological and morphological functions. Melatonin, a hormone released by the pineal gland, promotes cell survival and dendrite maturation of neurons in the newborn brain and protects against neurological disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of exogenous melatonin on neuronal architecture and its possible mechanism in the hippocampus of adult male C57BL/6 mice. Melatonin treatment significantly increased the total length and complexity of dendrites in the apical and basal &lt;i&gt;cornu ammonis&lt;/i&gt; (CA) 1 and in the dentate gyrus in mouse hippocampi. Spine density in CA1 apical dendrites was increased, but no significant differences in other subregions were observed. In primary cultured hippocampal neurons, the length and arborization of neurites were significantly augmented by melatonin treatment. Additionally, western blot and immunohistochemical analyses in both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; systems revealed significant increases in the level of cysteine‐rich protein 1 (crp‐1) protein, which is known to be involved in dendritic branching in mouse hippocampal neurons after melatonin treatment. Our results suggest that exogenous melatonin leads to significant alterations of neuronal micromorphometry in the adult hippocampus, possibly via crp‐1 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Quantification of aromatase binding in the female human brain using [11C]cetrozole positron emission tomography</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Quantification of aromatase binding in the female human brain using [11C]cetrozole positron emission tomography&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f4a4bc0d-59f4-4b35-bfd4-0cdcf58e1084/jnr24707-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantification of the binding of [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole to aromatase in the brain is best done using the two‐tissue reversible compartment model, or the simplified reference tissue model with the cerebellum as reference region. Receptor parametric mapping and Logan reference tissue model are suitable for parametric mapping. One hour of data acquisition is sufficient for the quantification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aromatase, the enzyme that in the brain converts testosterone and androstenedione to estradiol and estrone, respectively, is a putative key factor in psychoneuroendocrinology. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; assessment of aromatase was performed to evaluate tracer kinetic models and optimal scan duration, for quantitative analysis of the aromatase positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole. Anatomical magnetic resonance and 90‐min dynamic [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole PET‐CT scans were performed on healthy women. Volume of interest (VOI)‐based analyses with a plasma‐input function were performed using the single‐tissue and two‐tissue (2TCM) reversible compartment models and plasma‐input Logan analysis. Additionally, the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), Logan reference tissue model (LRTM), and standardized uptake volume ratio model, with cerebellum as reference region, were evaluated. Parametric images were generated and regionally averaged voxel values were compared with VOI‐based analyses of the reference tissue models. The optimal reference model was used for evaluation of a decreased scan duration. Differences between the plasma‐input‐ and reference tissue‐based methods and comparisons between scan durations were assessed by linear regression. The [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole time–activity curves were best described by the 2TCM. SRTM nondisplaceable binding potential (BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt;), with cerebellum as reference region, can be used to estimate [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole binding and generated robust and quantitatively accurate results for a reduced scan duration of 60 min. Receptor parametric mapping, a basis function implementation of SRTM, as well as LRTM, produced quantitatively accurate parametric images, showing BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; at the voxel level. As PET tracer, [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole can be employed for relatively short brain scans to measure aromatase binding using a reference tissue‐based approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Insulin deficiency, but not resistance, exaggerates cognitive deficits in transgenic mice expressing human amyloid and tau proteins. Reversal by Exendin‐4 treatment&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/950831d0-aede-4425-a43f-45442741700c/jnr24706-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insulin deficiency, rather than insulin resistance, induces AD‐like features in wild type and transgenic mice carrying amyloid β and tau genes. Treatment with Exendin‐4 ameliorates these features in an intervention paradigm when deficits were already present, reflecting the more likely scenario when patients will consult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological studies have pointed at diabetes as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and this has been supported by several studies in animal models of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, side‐by‐side comparison of the two types of diabetes is limited. We investigated the role of insulin deficiency and insulin resistance in the development of memory impairments and the effect of Exendin‐4 (Ex4) treatment in a mouse model of AD. Three–4‐month‐old female wild type (WT) mice and mice overexpressing human tau and amyloid precursor protein (TAPP) were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) or fed a high‐fat diet (HFD). A second study was performed in TAPP‐STZ mice treated with Ex4, a long‐lasting analog of GLP‐1. Plasma and brain were collected at study termination for ELISA, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry analysis. Learning and memory deficits were impaired in TAPP transgenic mice compared with WT mice at the end of the study. Deficits were exaggerated by insulin deficiency in TAPP mice but 12 weeks of insulin resistance did not affect memory performances in either WT or TAPP mice. Levels of phosphorylated tau were increased in the brain of WT‐STZ and TAPP‐STZ mice but not in the brain of WT or TAPP mice on HFD. In the TAPP‐STZ mice, treatment with Ex4 initiated after established cognitive deficits ameliorated learning, but not memory, impairments. This was accompanied by the reduction of amyloid β and phosphorylated tau expression. Theses studies support the role of Ex4 in AD, independently from its actions on diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Investigation of the effect of dietary intake of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on trauma‐induced white matter injury with quantitative diffusion MRI in mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/12ea5afd-5447-47db-be3d-5167b35c05db/jnr24705-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated potential neuroprotective effects of dietary omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on white matter damage following closed‐head injury in mice. While injured animals exhibited reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the optic tract and brachium compared to the uninjured animals, there was no evidence of neuroprotection from dietary omega‐3 PUFAs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that long‐term supplementation and dietary intake of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may have neuroprotective effects following brain injury. The objective of this study was to investigate potential neuroprotective effects of omega‐3 PUFAs on white matter following closed‐head trauma. The closed‐head injury model of engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA) produces a reproducible injury in the optic tract and brachium of the superior colliculus in mice. Damage is detectable using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, particularly fractional anisotropy (FA), with sensitivity comparable to histology. We acquired &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 38) and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 41) DTI data in mice divided into sham and CHIMERA groups with two dietary groups: one deficient in omega‐3 PUFAs and one adequate in omega‐3 PUFAs. We examined injury effects (reduction in FA) and neuroprotection (FA reduction modulated by diet) in the optic tract and brachium. We verified that diet did not affect FA in sham animals. In injured animals, we found significantly reduced FA in the optic tract and brachium (~10% reduction, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and Bayes factor analysis showed strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. However, Bayes factor analysis showed substantial evidence to accept the null hypothesis of no diet‐related FA differences in injured animals in the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; samples. Our results indicate no neuroprotective effect from adequate dietary omega‐3 PUFA intake on white matter damage following traumatic brain injury. Since damage from CHIMERA mainly affects white matter, our results do not necessarily contradict previous findings showing omega‐3 PUFA‐mediated neuroprotection in gray matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroanatomy of transgender persons in a Non‐Western population and improving reliability in clinical neuroimaging&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9be9bef8-9612-4aeb-a0d6-c59db828e9df/jnr24702-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study assesses the reproducibility of previous neuroanatomical findings in Western transgender persons in a Non‐Western population. It then shows that repeating an anatomical MRI sequence can increase data reliability especially in brain regions that have previously been implicated to differ between transgender and cisgender persons. This &lt;i&gt;scan–rescan&lt;/i&gt; method might enhance the power of studies with small samples due to low prevalence of target population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the neuroanatomy of transgender persons is slowly being charted, findings are presently discrepant. Moreover, the major body of work has focused on Western populations. One important factor is the issue of power and low signal‐to‐noise (SNR) ratio in neuroimaging studies of rare study populations including endocrine or neurological patient groups. The present study focused on the structural neuroanatomy of a Non‐Western (Iranian) sample of 40 transgender men (TM), 40 transgender women (TW), 30 cisgender men (CM), and 30 cisgender women (CW), while assessing whether the reliability of findings across structural anatomical measures including gray matter volume (GMV), cortical surface area (CSA), and cortical thickness (CTh) could be increased by using two back‐to‐back within‐session structural MRI scans. Overall, findings in transgender persons were more consistent with sex assigned at birth in GMV and CSA, while no group differences emerged for CTh. Repeated measures analysis also indicated that having a second scan increased SNR in all regions of interest, most notably bilateral frontal poles, pre‐ and postcentral gyri and putamina. The results suggest that a simple time and cost‐effective measure to improve SNR in rare clinical populations with low prevalence rates is a second anatomical scan when structural MRI is of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Toward quantitative neuroimaging biomarkers for Friedreich's ataxia at 7 Tesla: Susceptibility mapping, diffusion imaging, R2 and R1 relaxometry&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/220e1312-d799-4d4e-a584-4d3ebf3dee91/jnr24701-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantitative 7 Tesla MRI (susceptibility, relaxation, fractional anisotropy) found differences between ten Friedreich's ataxia patients and matched healthy controls in eight structures of brainstem and cerebellum which correlated with disease characteristics. Voxel‐based morphometry revealed white matter atrophy in partially overlapping volumes of interest (VOI) used for the VOI‐based evaluation. *Statistically significant differences between patients and controls; middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), pontine crossing tract (PCT), corticospinal tract (CS), medial lemniscus (ML), inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP), superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), cerebral peduncle (CP), posterior thalamic radiation (PTR), sagittal stratum (SS), dentate nuclei (DN), red nuclei (RN), substantia nigra (SN).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a rare genetic disorder leading to degenerative processes. So far, no effective treatment has been found. Therefore, it is important to assist the development of medication with imaging biomarkers reflecting disease status and progress. Ten FRDA patients (mean age 37 ± 14 years; four female) and 10 age‐ and sex‐matched controls were included. Acquisition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for quantitative susceptibility mapping, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; relaxometry and diffusion imaging was performed at 7 Tesla. Results of volume of interest (VOI)‐based analyses of the quantitative data were compared with a voxel‐based morphometry (VBM) evaluation. Differences between patients and controls were assessed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) with age and sex as covariates, effect size of group differences, and correlations with disease characteristics with Spearman correlation coefficient. For the VBM analysis, a statistical threshold of 0.001 for uncorrected and 0.05 for corrected &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;‐values was used. Statistically significant differences between FRDA patients and controls were found in five out of twelve investigated structures, and statistically significant correlations with disease characteristics were revealed. Moreover, VBM revealed significant white matter atrophy within regions of the brainstem, and the cerebellum. These regions overlapped partially with brain regions for which significant differences between healthy controls and patients were found in the VOI‐based quantitative MRI evaluation. It was shown that two independent analyses provided overlapping results. Moreover, positive results on correlations with disease characteristics were found, indicating that these quantitative MRI parameters could provide more detailed information and assist the search for effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Central nervous system‐infiltrated immune cells induce calcium increase in astrocytes via astroglial purinergic signaling&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f4d5b155-7dba-48a1-bc0d-01dbf95a13a6/jnr24699-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application of the central nervous system (CNS)‐infiltrated immune cells induces a rapid increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in cultured naïve astrocytes through glial purinergic receptor‐mediated signaling. This provides an insight into the astroglial response to the immune cells in their local environment in CNS autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interaction between autoreactive immune cells and astroglia is an important part of the pathologic processes that fuel neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis. In this inflammatory disease, immune cells enter into the central nervous system (CNS) and they spread through CNS parenchyma, but the impact of these autoreactive immune cells on the activity pattern of astrocytes has not been defined. By exploiting naïve astrocytes in culture and CNS‐infiltrated immune cells (CNS IICs) isolated from rat with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), here we demonstrate previously unrecognized properties of immune cell–astrocyte interaction. We show that CNS IICs but not the peripheral immune cell application, evokes a rapid and vigorous intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase in astrocytes by promoting glial release of ATP. ATP propagated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevation through glial purinergic P2X7 receptor activation by the hemichannel‐dependent nucleotide release mechanism. Astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase is specifically triggered by the autoreactive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cell application and these two cell types exhibit close spatial interaction in EAE. Therefore, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals may mediate a rapid astroglial response to the autoreactive immune cells in their local environment. This property of immune cell–astrocyte interaction may be important to consider in studies interrogating CNS autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: The role of nucleus accumbens CREB attenuation in rescuing low voluntary running behavior in female rats</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The role of nucleus accumbens CREB attenuation in rescuing low voluntary running behavior in female rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3e1d9b59-c935-4f2e-9c9f-76ea3bbe3568/jnr24698-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) was evaluated for its role in physical activity motivation of wild‐type (WT) and low voluntary wheel‐running (LVR) rats. Elevated CREB activity has been associated with reward deficits and was found to be higher in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of LVR rats. Reducing NAc activity through Gi‐DREADDs, pharmacology (C646/SR11302), and environmental enrichment increased LVR wheel‐running behavior. These findings highlight a potential molecular pathway important for the motivation to be physically active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the integral role of nucleus accumbens (NAc) cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) activity in motivational processes, the goal of the current study was to determine whether blunting chronic NAc CREB activity could rescue the low physical activity motivation of female, low voluntary running (LVR) rats. NAc CREB phosphorylation is elevated in these rats, a state previously attributed to deficits in reward valuation. It was recently shown that overexpression of the upstream CREB inhibitor, protein kinase inhibitor alpha (PKIα), increased LVR nightly running by ~threefold. Therefore, the current study addresses the extent to which NAc CREB attenuation influences female LVR and wild‐type (WT) wheel‐running behavior. Inducible reductions in NAc neuronal activity using Gi‐coupled hM4Di DREADDs increased running behavior in LVR, but not in WT, rats. Similarly, site‐directed pharmacological inhibition of NAc CREB activity significantly increased LVR nightly running distance and time by ~twofold, with no effect in WT rats. Finally, environmentally enriched LVR rats exhibit higher levels of running compared to socially isolated rats in what appeared to be a CREB‐related manner. Considering the positive outcomes of upstream CREB modulation and environmental enrichment on LVR behavior, we believe that blunting NAc CREB activity has the neuromolecular potential to partially reverse low physical activity motivation, as exemplified by the LVR model. The positive physical activity outcome of early life enrichment adds translatable value to human childhood enrichment and highlights its importance on motivational processes later in life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Our population study found that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of plasma endothelial microvesicles (EMVs) and EMVs‐miR‐155 levels in ischemic stroke (IS) was 0.778 (sensitivity 85.9% and specificity 58%) and 0.851 (sensitivity 75% and specificity 81.2%), respectively, and AUC of their combination was 0.892 (sensitivity 75% and specificity 91.3%). Our study suggests that plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 levels are promising biomarkers for IS. The diagnostic value of EMVs‐miR‐155 is higher and their combination is the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endothelial microvesicles (EMVs) could reflect the status of endothelial cells (ECs) which are involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke (IS). MiR‐155 could regulate EC functions. However, their roles in IS remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the levels of plasma EMVs and EMVs carrying miRNA‐155 (EMVs‐miR‐155) in IS patients to explore their potential roles as biomarkers. Ninety‐three IS patients and 70 controls were recruited in this study. The levels of circulating EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were detected by fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis and quantitative real‐time PCR, respectively. The correlations between level of EMVs/EMVs‐miR‐155 and the onset time, severity, infarct volume, and subtypes of IS were analyzed. The severity and infarct volume were assessed by NIHSS and magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the risk factors of IS. The ROC curve and area under ROC curve (AUC) of EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were determined. The levels of plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were increased significantly in acute and subacute stages of IS and remained unchanged in chronic stage, and were positively related to the infarct volume and NIHSS scores and were associated with large artery atherosclerosis and cardioembolism subtypes defined by Trial of Org 10 172 in acute stroke treatment (TOAST) classification. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were significant and independent risk factors of IS and their AUC were 0.778 and 0.851, respectively, and increased to 0.892 after combination. Our study suggests that plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 are promising biomarkers for IS. The diagnostic value of EMVs‐miR‐155 is higher and their combination is the best.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;CB1R knockout mice showed decreased neuronal dendritic arborization and changes in synaptic structure, as such as lower thickness of postsynaptic density and a reduction in synaptophysin levels in hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) modulates synaptic activity and is widely distributed in brain areas such as the hippocampus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and striatum, among others. CB1R is involved in processes such as memory, learning, motor coordination, and mood. Genetic deletion of CB1R causes behavioral alterations. In this work, we evaluated neuronal morphology and synaptic structure in the hippocampus of adult male CB1R knockout mice (CB1R&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;). Morphological changes in the CB1R&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; hippocampus evidenced a decrease in the expression of cytoskeletal proteins neurofilaments 160 KDa, neurofilaments 200 KDa, and microtubule‐associated protein 2. CA1 neurons showed decreased arborization and changes in synaptic structure such as lower thickness of postsynaptic density and a reduction in synaptophysin levels. Results obtained in the present work provide evidence of the participation of CB1R in the establishment of neuronal structure and networks that could have an important role in neuronal plasticity. In addition, these changes observed in CB1R&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; could be correlated with behavioral alterations reported.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Graphical representation of presented data also showing RhoGTPase regulators that localize to nascent synapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excitatory synapse formation begins in mid‐fetal gestation. However, due to our inability to image fetal synaptogenesis, the initial formation of synapses remains understudied. The recent development of human fetal brain spheroids provides access to this critical period of synapse formation. Using human neurons and brain spheroids, we address how altered actin regulation impacts the formation of excitatory synapses during fetal brain development. Prior to synapse formation, inhibition of RhoA kinase (ROCK) signaling promotes neurite elongation and branching. In addition to increasing neural complexity, ROCK inhibition increases the length of protrusions along the neurite, ultimately promoting excitatory synapse formation in human cortical brain spheroids. A corresponding increase in Rac1‐driven actin polymerization drives this increase in excitatory synaptogenesis. Using STORM super‐resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that actomyosin regulators, including the Rac1 regulator, α‐PIX, and the RhoA regulator, p115‐RhoGEF, localize to nascent excitatory synapses, where they preferentially localize to postsynaptic compartments. These results demonstrate that coordinated RhoGTPase activities underlie the initial formation of excitatory synapses and identify critical cytoskeletal regulators of early synaptogenic events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe and complex psychiatric disorder characterized by intense fear about weight gain and finalized to food‐related control behaviors. Growing interest has been demonstrated about neurobiological processes subtend to AN physiopathology. The present review aimed to collect neurostructural and neurofunctional available data from 2010 to 2019. Results have been organized according to the neuroimaging technique employed, also including a specific section on electroencephalographic results, mostly neglected in previous reviews. Diffuse cerebral vulnerability has been demonstrated and the contribution of several structures has been identified. Insula, cingulate cortex, parietal and frontal areas are primarily involved both by structural and functional perspectives. Moreover, consistent alterations in white matter integrity and brain electrical activity have been reported. Neuroimaging findings give a substantial contribution to AN pathophysiological description, also in order to understand altered but reversible processes in the passage from acute illness phase to disorder's remission, useful also for defining therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Dysfunction of the corticostriatal pathway in autism spectrum disorders</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corticostriatal pathway that carries sensory, motor, and limbic information to the striatum plays a critical role in motor control, action selection, and reward. Dysfunction of this pathway is associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Corticostriatal synapses have unique features in their cortical origins and striatal targets. In this review, we first describe axonal growth and synaptogenesis in the corticostriatal pathway during development, and then summarize the current understanding of the molecular bases of synaptic transmission and plasticity at mature corticostriatal synapses. Genes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been implicated in axonal growth abnormalities, imbalance of the synaptic excitation/inhibition ratio, and altered long‐term synaptic plasticity in the corticostriatal pathway. Here, we review a number of ASD‐associated high‐confidence genes, including &lt;i&gt;FMR1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;KMT2A&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GRIN2B&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SCN2A&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NLGN1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NLGN3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;MET&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CNTNAP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;FOXP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TSHZ3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SHANK3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CHD8&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;RELN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;FOXP1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SYNGAP1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;NRXN&lt;/i&gt;, and discuss their relevance to proper corticostriatal function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Control of cortical synapse development and plasticity by MET receptor tyrosine kinase, a genetic risk factor for autism</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key developmental milestone events of the human brain, such as neurogenesis, synapse formation, maturation, and plasticity, are determined by a myriad of molecular signaling events, including those mediated by a number of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their cognate ligands. Aberrant or mistimed brain development and plasticity can lead to maladaptive changes, such as dysregulated synaptic connectivity and breakdown of circuit functions necessary for cognition and adaptive behaviors, which are hypothesized pathophysiologies of many neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we review recent literature that supports autism spectrum disorder as a likely result of aberrant synapse development due to &lt;i&gt;mistimed&lt;/i&gt; maturation and plasticity. We focus on MET RTK, a prominent genetic risk factor for autism, and discuss how a pleiotropic molecular signaling system engaged by MET exemplifies a genetic program that controls cortical circuit development and plasticity by modulating the anatomical and functional connectivity of cortical circuits, thus conferring genetic risk for neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Intrathecal Injection of SIRT1-modified Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells Alleviates Neuropathic Pain in Rat</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Accumulating evidence has elucidated that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) exert profound analgesic effects on numerous animal models of neuropathic pain, including drug-induced peripheral nerves, diabetes-induced neuropathy, and chronic constriction injury. We aimed to address whether forcing expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) can enhance the efficacy of hMSCs on alleviation of pain sensation. A rat model of chronic constriction injury (CCI) mimicking peripheral nerve injury was incorporated in the study. Paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) testing were used to measure pain-related behavior. Our results demonstrated that SIRT1 was decreased post-CCI surgery. Compared to hMSCs-control implantation, the hMSCs-SIRT1 (hMSCs overexpressing SIRT1) implantation exhibited superior effects on reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in serum and spinal dorsal horn, while ameliorating neuropathic pain in CCI rat. Engineering hMSCs such as overexpressing SIRT1 may serve as a promising strategy for the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Computational Neuroscience: A model for the transfer of control from the brain to the spinal cord through synaptic learning</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The spinal cord is essential to the control of locomotion in legged animals and humans. However, the actual circuitry of the spinal controller remains only vaguely understood. Here we approach this problem from the viewpoint of learning. More precisely, we assume the circuitry evolves through the transfer of control from the brain to the spinal cord, propose a specific learning mechanism for this transfer based on the error between the cord and brain contributions to muscle control, and study the resulting structure of the spinal controller in a simplified neuromuscular model of human locomotion. The model focuses on the leg rebound behavior in stance and represents the spinal circuitry with 150 muscle reflexes. We find that after learning a spinal controller has evolved that produces leg rebound motions in the absence of a central brain input with only three structural reflex groups. These groups contain individual reflexes well known from physiological experiments but thought to serve separate purposes in the control of human locomotion. Our results suggest a more holistic interpretation of the role of individual sensory projections in spinal networks than is common. In addition, we discuss potential neural correlates for the proposed learning mechanism that may be probed in experiments. Together with such experiments, neuromuscular models of spinal learning likely will become effective tools for uncovering the structure and development of the spinal control circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: The Synapse Diversity Dilemma: Molecular Heterogeneity Confounds Studies of Synapse Function</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.590403</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.590403</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have shown an unexpectedly high degree of synapse diversity arising from molecular and morphological differences among individual synapses. Diverse synapse types are spatially distributed within individual dendrites, between different neurons, and across and between brain regions, producing the synaptome architecture of the brain. The spatial organization of synapse heterogeneity is important because the physiological activation of heterogeneous excitatory synapses produces a non-uniform spatial output of synaptic potentials, which confounds the interpretation of measurements obtained from population-averaging electrodes, optrodes and biochemical methods that lack single-synapse resolution. Population-averaging measurements cannot distinguish between changes in the composition of populations of synapses and changing synaptic physiology. Here we consider the implications of synapse diversity and its organization into synaptome architecture for studies of synapse physiology, plasticity, development and behavior, and for the interpretation of phenotypes arising from pharmacological and genetic perturbations. We conclude that prevailing models based on population-averaging measurements need reconsideration and that single-synapse resolution physiological recording methods are required to confirm or refute the major synaptic models of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography Reveals Distinct Retinal Structural and Microvascular Abnormalities in Cerebrovascular Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) is one of the leading global causes of death and severe disability. To date, retinal microangiopathy has become a reflection of cerebral microangiopathy, mirroring the vascular pathological modifications in vivo. To evaluate the retinal structure and microvasculature in patients with CeVD, we conducted a cross-sectional study in Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center and Department of Neurology of Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). CeVD patients (n = 121; 238 eyes) and healthy controls (n = 44; 57 eyes) were included in the analysis. The CeVD group showed significant thinning of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness in the temporal and nasal quadrants, and thinning of the macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) in the inferior quadrant, while macular microvasculature reduction was prominent in all nine quadrants. There were significant correlations between OCTA parameters, visual acuity, and transcranial doppler parameters in the CeVD group. The specific structural parameters combining microvasculature indices showed the best diagnostic accuracies (AUC = 0.918) to discriminate CeVD group from healthy controls. To conclude, we proved that OCTA reveals specific patterns of retinal structural changes and extensive macular microvascular changes in CeVD. Additionally, these retinal abnormalities could prove useful disease biomarkers in the management of individuals at high risk of debilitating complications from a cerebrovascular event.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents an enormous public health challenge currently and with increasing urgency in the coming decades. Our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of AD is rather incomplete, which is manifested in stagnated therapeutic developments. Apart from the well-established Amyloid Hypothesis of AD, gaining traction in recent years is the Pathogen Hypothesis, which postulates a causal role of infectious agents in the development of AD. Particularly, infection by viruses, among a diverse range of microorganisms, has been implicated. Recently, we described a prominent antiviral immune response in human AD brains as well as murine amyloid beta models, which has consequential effects on neuropathology. Such findings expectedly allude to the question about viral infections and AD. In this Perspective, we would like to discuss the molecular mechanism underlying the antiviral immune response, highlight how such pathway directly promotes AD pathogenesis, and depict a multilayered connection between antiviral immune response and other agents and factors relevant to AD. By tying together these threads of evidence, we provide a cohesive perspective on the uprising of antiviral immune response in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Cell Calcium Imaging as a Reliable Method to Study Neuron–Glial Circuits</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.569361</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Complex dynamic cellular networks have been studied in physiological and pathological processes under the light of single-cell calcium imaging (SCCI), a method that correlates functional data based on calcium shifts operated by different intracellular and extracellular mechanisms integrated with their cell phenotypes. From the classic synaptic structure to tripartite astrocytic model or the recent quadripartite microglia added ensemble, as well as other physiological tissues, it is possible to follow how cells signal spatiotemporally to cellular patterns. This methodology has been used broadly due to the universal properties of calcium as a second messenger. In general, at least two types of receptor operate through calcium permeation: a fast-acting ionotropic receptor channel and a slow-activating metabotropic receptor, added to exchangers/transporters/pumps and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release activated by messengers. These prototypes have gained an enormous amount of information in dynamic signaling circuits. SCCI has also been used as a method to associate phenotypic markers during development and stage transitions in progenitors, stem, vascular cells, neuro- and glioblasts, neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia that operate through ion channels, transporters, and receptors. Also, cancer cells or inducible cell lines from human organoids characterized by transition stages are currently being used to model diseases or reconfigure healthy cells in terms of the expression of calcium-binding/permeable molecules and shed light on therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A Benchmark Dataset for RSVP-Based Brain–Computer Interfaces</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.568000</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.568000</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper reports on a benchmark dataset acquired with a brain–computer interface (BCI) system based on the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm. The dataset consists of 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 64 healthy subjects (sub1,…, sub64) while they performed a target image detection task. For each subject, the data contained two groups (“A” and “B”). Each group contained two blocks, and each block included 40 trials that corresponded to 40 stimulus sequences. Each sequence contained 100 images presented at 10 Hz (10 images per second). The stimulus images were street-view images of two categories: target images with human and non-target images without human. Target images were presented randomly in the stimulus sequence with a probability of 1∼4%. During the stimulus presentation, subjects were asked to search for the target images and ignore the non-target images in a subjective manner. To keep all original information, the dataset was the raw continuous data without any processing. On one hand, the dataset can be used as a benchmark dataset to compare the algorithms for target identification in RSVP-based BCIs. On the other hand, the dataset can be used to design new system diagrams and evaluate their BCI performance without collecting any new data through offline simulation. Furthermore, the dataset also provides high-quality data for characterizing and modeling event-related potentials (ERPs) and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) in RSVP-based BCIs. The dataset is freely available from http://bci.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/download.html.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Micro Three-Dimensional Neuronal Cultures Generate Developing Cortex-Like Activity Patterns</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Studies aimed at neurological drug discovery have been carried out both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro cell culture models have showed potential as drug testing platforms characterized by high throughput, low cost, good reproducibility and ease of handling and observation. However, in vitro neuronal culture models are facing challenges in replicating in vivo-like activity patterns. This work reports an in vitro culture technique that is capable of producing micro three-dimensional (μ3D) cultures of only a few tens of neurons. The μ3D cultures generated by this method were uniform in size and density of neurons. These μ3D cultures had complex spontaneous synchronized neuronal activity patterns which were similar to those observed in the developing cortex and in much larger 3D cultures, but not in 2D cultures. Bursts could be reliably evoked by stimulation of single neurons. Synchronized bursts in μ3D cultures were abolished by inhibitors of glutamate receptors, while inhibitors of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors had a more complex effect. This pharmacological profile is similar to bursts in neonatal cortex. Since large numbers of reproducible μ3D cultures can be created and observed in parallel, this model of the developing cortex may find applications in high-throughput drug discovery experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Novel Method for High-Dimensional Anatomical Mapping of Extra-Axial Cerebrospinal Fluid: Application to the Infant Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.561556</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays an essential role in early postnatal brain development. Extra-axial CSF (EA-CSF) volume, which is characterized by CSF in the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain, is a promising marker in the early detection of young children at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Previous studies have focused on global EA-CSF volume across the entire dorsal extent of the brain, and not regionally-specific EA-CSF measurements, because no tools were previously available for extracting local EA-CSF measures suitable for localized cortical surface analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the localized, cortical surface-based analysis of EA-CSF. The proposed processing framework combines probabilistic brain tissue segmentation, cortical surface reconstruction, and streamline-based local EA-CSF quantification. The quantitative analysis of local EA-CSF was applied to a dataset of typically developing infants with longitudinal MRI scans from 6 to 24 months of age. There was a high degree of consistency in the spatial patterns of local EA-CSF across age using the proposed methods. Statistical analysis of local EA-CSF revealed several novel findings: several regions of the cerebral cortex showed reductions in EA-CSF from 6 to 24 months of age, and specific regions showed higher local EA-CSF in males compared to females. These age-, sex-, and anatomically-specific patterns of local EA-CSF would not have been observed if only a global EA-CSF measure were utilized. The proposed methods are integrated into a freely available, open-source, cross-platform, user-friendly software tool, allowing neuroimaging labs to quantify local extra-axial CSF in their neuroimaging studies to investigate its role in typical and atypical brain development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Functional Integration Between the Two Brain Hemispheres: Evidence From the Homotopic Functional Connectivity Under Resting State</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00932</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional integration among neural units is one of the fundamental principles in brain organization that could be examined using resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC). Interhemispheric functional integration plays a critical role in human cognition. Homotopic functional connectivity (HoFC) under resting state provide an avenue to investigate functional integration between the two brain hemispheres, which can improve the present understanding of how interhemispheric interactions affect cognitive processing. In this review, we summarize the progress of HoFC studies under resting state and highlight how these findings have enhanced our understanding of interhemispheric functional organization of the human brain. Future studies are encouraged to address particular methodological issues and to further ascertain behavioral correlates, brain disease’s modulation, task influence, and genetic basis of HoFC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Hemodynamic Scaling of Task-Induced Signal Changes in Tumor Subjects</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.569463</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.569463</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: FMRI signal amplitude can change during stimulus presentation due to underlying neural function and hemodynamic responses limiting the accuracy of fMRI in pre-surgical planning. To account for these changes in fMRI activation signal, we used breath-hold tasks to mimic hemodynamic changes in brain tumor subjects and scaled the activation response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Motor and/or language fMRI was performed in 21 subjects with brain tumor. A breath-hold task was also performed in these subjects to obtain the hemodynamic response changes independent of neural changes. The task activation signals were calibrated on a voxel wise basis for all the subjects. Direct cortical stimulation was used to verify the scaled results of task-based fMRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: After scaling for the hemodynamic response function (HRF) on a voxel wise basis, the spatial extent of the scaled activation was more clustered together and appeared to minimize false positives. Similarly, accounting for the underlying canonical HRF, the percentage increase of active voxels after scaling had lower standard non-deviation suggesting that the activation response across voxels were more similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Although preliminary in nature, this study suggests that the variation in hemodynamic changes can be calibrated using breath-hold in brain tumor subjects and can also be used for other clinical cases where the underlying HRF has been altered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Crosstalk Between Autophagy and Ferroptosis and Its Putative Role in Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.577403</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autophagy is a conserved process to maintains homeostasis via the degradation of toxic cell contents, which can either promote cell survival or accelerate cellular demise. Ferroptosis is a recently discovered iron-dependent cell death pathway associated with the accumulation of lethal reactive lipid species. In the past few years, an increasing number of studies have suggested the crosstalk between autophagy and ferroptosis. Ischemic stroke is a complex brain disease regulated by several cell death pathways, including autophagy and ferroptosis. However, the potential links between autophagy and ferroptosis in ischemic stroke have not yet been explored. In this review, we briefly overview the mechanisms of ferroptosis and autophagy, as well as their possible connections in ischemic stroke. The elucidation of crosstalk between different cell death pathways may provide insight into new future ischemic stroke therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Patient-specific genomics and cross-species functional analysis implicate LRP2 in hypoplastic left heart syndrome</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59554</link>
	<description>Congenital heart diseases (CHDs), including hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), are genetically complex and poorly understood. Here, a multi-disciplinary platform was established to functionally evaluate novel CHD gene candidates, based on whole genome and iPSC RNA sequencing of a HLHS family-trio. Filtering for rare variants and altered expression in proband iPSCs prioritized 10 candidates. siRNA/RNAi-mediated knockdown in generic human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and in developing &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;and zebrafish hearts revealed that LDL receptor-related protein &lt;i&gt;LRP2&lt;/i&gt; is required for cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation. Consistent with hypoplastic heart defects, compared to patents the proband's iPSC-CMs exhibited reduced proliferation. Interestingly, rare, predicted-damaging LRP2 variants were enriched in a HLHS cohort; however, understanding their contribution to HLHS requires further investigation. Collectively, we have established a multi-species high-throughput platform to rapidly evaluate candidate genes and their interactions during heart development, which are crucial first steps towards deciphering oligogenic underpinnings of CHDs, including maladaptive left hearts.</description>

	<title>eLife: GAS5 protects against osteoporosis by targeting UPF1/SMAD7 axis in osteoblast differentiation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.59079</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59079</link>
	<description>Osteoporosis is a common systemic skeletal disorder resulting in bone fragility and increased fracture risk. It is still necessary to explore its detailed mechanisms and identify novel targets for the treatment of osteoporosis. Previously, we found that a lncRNA named &lt;i&gt;GAS5&lt;/i&gt; in human could negatively regulate the lipoblast/adipocyte differentiation. However, it is still unclear whether &lt;i&gt;GAS5&lt;/i&gt; affects osteoblast differentiation and whether&lt;i&gt; GAS5 &lt;/i&gt;is associated with osteoporosis. Our current research found that &lt;i&gt;GAS5 &lt;/i&gt;was decreased in the bones and BMSCs, a major origin of osteoblast, of osteoporosis patients. Mechanistically,&lt;i&gt; GAS5&lt;/i&gt; promotes the osteoblast differentiation by interacting with UPF1 to degrade &lt;i&gt;SMAD7&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. Moreover, a decreased bone mass and impaired bone repair ability were observed in &lt;i&gt;Gas5&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice, manifesting in osteoporosis. The systemic supplement of &lt;i&gt;Gas5&lt;/i&gt;-overexpressing adenoviruses significantly ameliorated bone loss in an osteoporosis mouse model. In conclusion, &lt;i&gt;GAS5&lt;/i&gt; promotes osteoblast differentiation by targeting the UPF1/SMAD7 axis and protects against osteoporosis.</description>

	<title>eLife: Pathway-specific dysregulation of striatal excitatory synapses by LRRK2 mutations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58997</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58997</link>
	<description>LRRK2 is a kinase expressed in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs), cells which lose dopaminergic input in Parkinson’s disease (PD). R1441C and G2019S are the most common pathogenic mutations of LRRK2. How these mutations alter the structure and function of individual synapses on direct and indirect pathway SPNs is unknown and may reveal pre-clinical changes in dopamine-recipient neurons that predispose towards disease. Here, R1441C and G2019S knock-in mice enabled thorough evaluation of dendritic spines and synapses on pathway-identified SPNs. Biochemical synaptic preparations and super-resolution imaging revealed increased levels and altered organization of glutamatergic AMPA receptors in LRRK2 mutants. Relatedly, decreased frequency of miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents accompanied changes in dendritic spine nano-architecture, and single-synapse currents, evaluated using 2-photon glutamate uncaging. Overall, LRRK2 mutations reshaped synaptic structure and function, an effect exaggerated in R1441C dSPNs. These data open the possibility of new neuroprotective therapies aimed at SPN synapse function, prior to disease onset.</description>

	<title>eLife: Gli3 utilizes Hand2 to synergistically regulate tissue-specific transcriptional networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56450</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56450</link>
	<description>Despite a common understanding that Gli TFs are utilized to reiterate a Hh morphogen gradient, genetic analyses suggest craniofacial development does not completely fit this paradigm. Using the mouse model (&lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt;), we demonstrated that rather than being driven by a Hh threshold, robust Gli3 transcriptional activity during skeletal and glossal development required interaction with the basic helix-loop-helix TF Hand2. Not only did genetic and expression data support a co-factorial relationship, but genomic analysis revealed that Gli3 and Hand2 were enriched at regulatory elements for genes essential for mandibular patterning and development. Interestingly, motif analysis at sites co-occupied by Gli3 and Hand2 uncovered mandibular-specific, low-affinity, 'divergent' Gli binding motifs (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;d&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;GBMs). Functional validation revealed these &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;d&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;GBMs conveyed synergistic activation of Gli targets essential for mandibular patterning and development. In summary, this work elucidates a novel, sequence-dependent mechanism for Gli transcriptional activity within the craniofacial complex that is independent of a graded Hh signal.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Penalized regression and model selection methods for polygenic scores on summary statistics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jack Pattee, Wei Pan&lt;/p&gt;

Polygenic scores quantify the genetic risk associated with a given phenotype and are widely used to predict the risk of complex diseases. There has been recent interest in developing methods to construct polygenic risk scores using summary statistic data. We propose a method to construct polygenic risk scores via penalized regression using summary statistic data and publicly available reference data. Our method bears similarity to existing method LassoSum, extending their framework to the Truncated Lasso Penalty (TLP) and the elastic net. We show via simulation and real data application that the TLP improves predictive accuracy as compared to the LASSO while imposing additional sparsity where appropriate. To facilitate model selection in the absence of validation data, we propose methods for estimating model fitting criteria AIC and BIC. These methods approximate the AIC and BIC in the case where we have a polygenic risk score estimated on summary statistic data and no validation data. Additionally, we propose the so-called quasi-correlation metric, which quantifies the predictive accuracy of a polygenic risk score applied to out-of-sample data for which we have only summary statistic information. In total, these methods facilitate estimation and model selection of polygenic risk scores on summary statistic data, and the application of these polygenic risk scores to out-of-sample data for which we have only summary statistic information. We demonstrate the utility of these methods by applying them to GWA studies of lipids, height, and lung cancer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yMeWG-JLNWc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

As continued COVID-19 disruption looks likely across the world, perhaps until 2021, contingency plans are evolving in case of further disruption in the 2020–2021 academic year. This includes delivering face-to-face programs fully online for at least part of the upcoming academic year for new and continuing cohorts. This temporary pivot will necessitate distance teaching and learning across almost every conceivable pedagogy, from fundamental degrees to professionally accredited ones. Each institution, program, and course will have its own myriad of individualized needs; however, there is a common question that unites us all: how do we provide teaching and assessment to students in a manner that is accessible, fair, equitable, and provides the best learning whilst acknowledging the temporary nature of the pivot? No “one size fits all” solution exists, and many of the choices that need to be made will be far from simple; however, this paper provides a starting point and basic principles to facilitate discussions taking place around the globe by balancing what we know from the pedagogy of online learning with the practicalities imposed by this crisis and any future crises.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e9Z_LqD26FY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Models of SIV rebound after treatment interruption that involve multiple reactivation events</title>

In order to assess the efficacy of novel HIV-1 treatments leading to a functional cure, the time to viral rebound is frequently used as a surrogate endpoint. The longer the time to viral rebound, the more efficacious the therapy. In support of such an approach, mathematical models serve as a connection between the size of the latent reservoir and the time to HIV-1 rebound after treatment interruption. The simplest of such models assumes that a single successful latent cell reactivation event leads to observable viremia after a period of exponential viral growth. Here we consider a generalization developed by Pinkevych &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. and Hill &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. of this simple model in which multiple reactivation events can occur, each contributing to the exponential growth of the viral load. We formalize and improve the previous derivation of the dynamics predicted by this model, and use the model to estimate relevant biological parameters from SIV rebound data. We confirm a previously described effect of very early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation on the rate of recrudescence and the viral load growth rate after treatment interruption. We find that every day ART initiation is delayed results in a 39% increase in the recrudescence rate (95% credible interval: [18%, 62%]), and a 11% decrease of the viral growth rate (95% credible interval: [4%, 20%]). We show that when viral rebound occurs early relative to the viral load doubling time, a model with multiple successful reactivation events fits the data better than a model with only a single successful reactivation event.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cZno1WDWtqo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The combination of bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data of the same tumor enables the inference of high-fidelity phylogenies that form the input to many important downstream analyses in cancer genomics. While many studies simultaneously perform bulk and single-cell sequencing, some studies have analyzed initial bulk data to identify which mutations to target in a follow-up single-cell sequencing experiment, thereby decreasing cost. Bulk data provide an additional untapped source of valuable information, composed of candidate phylogenies and associated clonal prevalence. Here, we introduce PhyDOSE, a method that uses this information to strategically optimize the design of follow-up single cell experiments. Underpinning our method is the observation that only a small number of clones uniquely distinguish one candidate tree from all other trees. We incorporate distinguishing features into a probabilistic model that infers the number of cells to sequence so as to confidently reconstruct the phylogeny of the tumor. We validate PhyDOSE using simulations and a retrospective analysis of a leukemia patient, concluding that PhyDOSE’s computed number of cells resolves tree ambiguity even in the presence of typical single-cell sequencing errors. We also conduct a retrospective analysis on an acute myeloid leukemia cohort, demonstrating the potential to achieve similar results with a significant reduction in the number of cells sequenced. In a prospective analysis, we demonstrate the advantage of selecting cells to sequence across multiple biopsies and that only a small number of cells suffice to disambiguate the solution space of trees in a recent lung cancer cohort. In summary, PhyDOSE proposes cost-efficient single-cell sequencing experiments that yield high-fidelity phylogenies, which will improve downstream analyses aimed at deepening our understanding of cancer biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yp0s25yvZoM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Contributing to broader impacts is an important aspect of scientific research. Engaging practicing K–12 teachers as part of a research project can be an effective approach for addressing broader impacts requirements of grants, while also advancing researcher and teacher professional growth. Our focus is on leveraging teachers’ professional expertise to develop science education materials grounded in emerging scientific research. In this paper, we describe ten simple rules for planning, implementing, and evaluating teacher engagement to support the broader impact goals of your research project. These collaborations can lead to the development of instructional materials or activities for students in the classroom or provide science research opportunities for teachers. We share our successes and lessons learned while collaborating with high school biology teachers to create technology-based, instructional materials developed from basic biological research. The rules we describe are applicable across teacher partnerships at any grade level in that they emphasize eliciting and respecting teachers’ professionalism and expertise.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r-dFiGtlm1Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Demographics of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce and student body in the US and Europe continue to show severe underrepresentation of Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC). Among the documented causes of the persistent lack of diversity in STEM are bias, discrimination, and harassment of members of underrepresented minority groups (URMs). These issues persist due to continued marginalization, power imbalances, and lack of adequate policies against misconduct in academic and other scientific institutions. All scientists can play important roles in reversing this trend by shifting the culture of academic workplaces to intentionally implement equitable and inclusive policies, set norms for acceptable workplace conduct, and provide opportunities for mentorship and networking. As scientists are increasingly acknowledging the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in science, there is a need for clear direction on how to take antiracist action. Here we present 10 rules to help labs develop antiracists policies and action in an effort to promote racial and ethnic diversity, equity, and inclusion in science.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hkcDpMKWOWY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A genotype imputation method for de-identified haplotype reference information by using recurrent neural network</title>

Genotype imputation estimates the genotypes of unobserved variants using the genotype data of other observed variants based on a collection of haplotypes for thousands of individuals, which is known as a haplotype reference panel. In general, more accurate imputation results were obtained using a larger size of haplotype reference panel. Most of the existing genotype imputation methods explicitly require the haplotype reference panel in precise form, but the accessibility of haplotype data is often limited, due to the requirement of agreements from the donors. Since de-identified information such as summary statistics or model parameters can be used publicly, imputation methods using de-identified haplotype reference information might be useful to enhance the quality of imputation results under the condition where the access of the haplotype data is limited. In this study, we proposed a novel imputation method that handles the reference panel as its model parameters by using bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN). The model parameters are presented in the form of de-identified information from which the restoration of the genotype data at the individual-level is almost impossible. We demonstrated that the proposed method provides comparable imputation accuracy when compared with the existing imputation methods using haplotype datasets from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) and the Haplotype Reference Consortium. We also considered a scenario where a subset of haplotypes is made available only in de-identified form for the haplotype reference panel. In the evaluation using the 1KGP dataset under the scenario, the imputation accuracy of the proposed method is much higher than that of the existing imputation methods. We therefore conclude that our RNN-based method is quite promising to further promote the data-sharing of sensitive genome data under the recent movement for the protection of individuals’ privacy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/evfPJ-IpVhw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Metabolic inference from genomic sequence information is a necessary step in determining the capacity of cells to make a living in the world at different levels of biological organization. A common method for determining the metabolic potential encoded in genomes is to map conceptually translated open reading frames onto a database containing known product descriptions. Such gene-centric methods are limited in their capacity to predict pathway presence or absence and do not support standardized rule sets for automated and reproducible research. Pathway-centric methods based on defined rule sets or machine learning algorithms provide an adjunct or alternative inference method that supports hypothesis generation and testing of metabolic relationships within and between cells. Here, we present mlLGPR, &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;ulti-&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;abel based on &lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;ogistic re&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;ression for &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;athway p&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;ediction, a software package that uses supervised multi-label classification and rich pathway features to infer metabolic networks in organismal and multi-organismal datasets. We evaluated mlLGPR performance using a corpora of 12 experimental datasets manifesting diverse multi-label properties, including manually curated organismal genomes, synthetic microbial communities and low complexity microbial communities. Resulting performance metrics equaled or exceeded previous reports for organismal genomes and identify specific challenges associated with features engineering and training data for community-level metabolic inference.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fVk9wRrKtV8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: tACS entrains neural activity while somatosensory input is blocked</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000834</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Pedro G. Vieira, Matthew R. Krause, Christopher C. Pack&lt;/p&gt;

Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) modulates brain activity by passing electrical current through electrodes that are attached to the scalp. Because it is safe and noninvasive, tACS holds great promise as a tool for basic research and clinical treatment. However, little is known about how tACS ultimately influences neural activity. One hypothesis is that tACS affects neural responses directly, by producing electrical fields that interact with the brain’s endogenous electrical activity. By controlling the shape and location of these electric fields, one could target brain regions associated with particular behaviors or symptoms. However, an alternative hypothesis is that tACS affects neural activity indirectly, via peripheral sensory afferents. In particular, it has often been hypothesized that tACS acts on sensory fibers in the skin, which in turn provide rhythmic input to central neurons. In this case, there would be little possibility of targeted brain stimulation, as the regions modulated by tACS would depend entirely on the somatosensory pathways originating in the skin around the stimulating electrodes. Here, we directly test these competing hypotheses by recording single-unit activity in the hippocampus and visual cortex of alert monkeys receiving tACS. We find that tACS entrains neuronal activity in both regions, so that cells fire synchronously with the stimulation. Blocking somatosensory input with a topical anesthetic does not significantly alter these neural entrainment effects. These data are therefore consistent with the direct stimulation hypothesis and suggest that peripheral somatosensory stimulation is not required for tACS to entrain neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VtB0bViwC7g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Location and Size of Preterm Cerebellar Hemorrhage and Childhood Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25899?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25899?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the association between cerebellar hemorrhage (CBH) size and location and preschool‐age neurodevelopment in very preterm neonates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preterm magnetic resonance images of 221 very preterm neonates (median gestational age = 27.9 weeks) were manually segmented for CBH quantification and location. Neurodevelopmental assessments at chronological age 4.5 years included motor (Movement Assessment Battery for Children, 2nd Edition [MABC‐2]), visuomotor integration (Beery‐Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual‐Motor Integration, 6th Edition), cognitive (Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scale of Intelligence, 3rd Edition), and behavioral (Child Behavior Checklist) outcomes. Multivariable linear regression models examined the association between CBH size and 4.5‐year outcomes accounting for sex, gestational age, and supratentorial injury. Probabilistic maps assessed CBH location and likelihood of a lesion to predict adverse outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐six neonates had CBH: 14 (6%) with only punctate CBH and 22 (10%) with ≥1 larger CBH. CBH occurred mostly in the inferior aspect of the posterior lobes. CBH total volume was independently associated with MABC‐2 motor scores at 4.5 years (β = −0.095, 95% confidence interval = −0.184 to −0.005), with a standardized β coefficient (−0.16) that was similar to that of white matter injury volume (standardized β = −0.22). CBH size was similarly associated with visuomotor integration and externalizing behavior but not cognition. Voxelwise odds ratio and lesion‐symptom maps demonstrated that CBH extending more deeply into the cerebellum predicted adverse motor, visuomotor, and behavioral outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBH size and location on preterm magnetic resonance imaging were associated with reduced preschool motor and visuomotor function and more externalizing behavior independent of supratentorial brain injury in a dose‐dependent fashion. The volumetric quantification and localization of CBH, even when punctate, may allow opportunity to improve motor and behavioral outcomes by providing targeted intervention.

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; gene is considered to be the most common gene, which is responsible for the development of an autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease with early onset and sometimes broad phenotype. We present a patient with a spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-like phenotype who was found to carry an M233V mutation. General and neurological exam was carried out. Brain MRI as well as genetic testing for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 were performed. The patient was then referred for a next-generation sequencing-based gene panel test with 723 genes included. A 26-year-old man of an Azerbaijani origin presented with a progressive impairment of coordination followed by memory impairment. Family history was positive for a similar disorder suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. Brain MRI showed bilateral hippocampal atrophy (more pronounced in the left), as well as mild atrophy of the left temporoparietal cortex. Tests for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 came negative. Gene panel test showed c.697A &amp;gt; G heterozygous variant in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; gene leading to a M233V amino acid change, which was validated by a Sanger sequencing. So far, M233V mutation has not been associated with a combination of cerebellar and cognitive features at onset. Our case contributes to a better characterization of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; mutations and expands the phenotype of the M233V carriers. We propose to consider &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; mutations in patients presenting with an SCA-like phenotype but negative for common types of SCA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients with autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (CA) with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Abs) may lead to a better prognosis. Herein, we report prodromal transient neurological symptoms that should raise clinical suspicion of CA with GAD-Abs. We initially identified a 70-year-old man who presented a first acute episode of vertigo, diplopia, and ataxia lasting 2 weeks. Two months later, he experienced a similar episode along with new-onset gaze-evoked nystagmus. After 4 months, downbeat nystagmus, left limb dysmetria, and gait ataxia progressively appeared, and an autoimmune CA was diagnosed based on the positivity of GAD-Abs in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We searched retrospectively for similar presentations in a cohort of 31 patients diagnosed with CA and GAD-Abs. We found 11 (35.4%) patients (all women, median age 62 years; 8/11 [72.7%] with autoimmune comorbidities) with transient neurological symptoms antedating CA onset by a median of 3 months, including vertigo in 9 (81.8%; described as paroxysmal in 8) and fluctuating diplopia in 3 (27.3%) patients. The identification of transient neurological symptoms of unknown etiology, such as paroxysmal vertigo and fluctuating diplopia, should lead to GAD-Abs testing in serum and CSF, especially in patients with autoimmune comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by storage of unesterified glycolipids and cholesterol in lysosome. NPC’s clinical presentation is highly heterogeneous, depending on the time of onset. It encompasses visceral, neurological, and/or psychiatric manifestations. As the motor findings are so important and devastating in this disease, there is a lack of description about non-motor symptoms, even though they play important role in quality of life of NPC patients. We described the most common non-motor findings in NPC like cognitive dysfunction, neuroimaging, psychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders, seizures, hearing problems, respiratory and other systemic features, bladder and fecal dysfunction, hypersalivation, and malnutrition. In this review, we highlighted the importance of these undervalued symptoms and their management. Specific measures of all aforementioned clinical features may work as relevant biomarkers in order to evaluate successful therapies in future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Upward Gaze Palsy: a Valuable Sign to Distinguish Spinocerebellar Ataxias</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) represent a large group of heredodegenerative diseases, with great phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity. However, in the clinical neurological practice, some symptoms and signs might help differentiate the SCAs. This study’s aims were to evaluate the frequency of upward gaze palsy (UGP) and investigate its role in assisting in the clinical differentiation of SCAs. We included 419 patients with SCAs (248 with SCA3, 95 with SCA10, 38 with SCA2, 22 with SCA1, 12 with SCA7, and 4 with SCA6). This study compared UGP with other known markers of disease severity—age of onset, disease duration, SARA score, and size of CAG expansion, and also other semiologic features, as bulging eyes. This sign was significantly more prevalent in SCA3 (64.11%), compared with SCA10 (3.16%; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and other SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA7–11.84%; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). UGP showed very high sensibility ins SCA3 (92.9), although lacking of specificity (64.1%). The odds ratio (OR) of UGP were also very high, 23.52 (95% CI 12.38–44.69), and was significantly correlated with larger CAG expansions, age, and disease duration in SCA3 patients, but not with age of onset or severity of the ataxic syndrome. This study showed that UGP is highly suggestive of SCA3 and has high sensitivity for the differential diagnosis among SCAs, and it could be of great value for bedside semiologic tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The advent of preclinical research scanners for in vivo imaging of small animals has added confidence into the multi-step decision-making process of radiotracer discovery and development. Furthermore, it has expanded the utility of imaging techniques available to dissect clinical questions, fostering a cyclic interaction between the clinical and the preclinical worlds. Significant efforts from medicinal chemistry have also made available several high-affinity and selective compounds amenable for radiolabeling, that target different receptors, transporters and enzymes in vivo. This substantially increased the range of applications of molecular imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). However, the process of developing novel radiotracers for in vivo imaging of the human brain is a multi-step process that has several inherent pitfalls and technical difficulties, which often hampers the successful translation of novel imaging agents from preclinical research into clinical use. In this paper, the process of radiotracer development and its relevance in brain research is discussed; as well as, its pitfalls, technical challenges and future promises. Examples of successful and unsuccessful translation of brain radiotracers will be presented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Exploring the Benefits of Doll Play Through Neuroscience</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has long been hypothesized that pretend play is beneficial to social and cognitive development. However, there is little evidence regarding the neural regions that are active while children engage in pretend play. We examined the activation of prefrontal and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) regions using near-infrared spectroscopy while 42 4- to 8-year-old children freely played with dolls or tablet games with a social partner or by themselves. Social play activated right prefrontal regions more than solo play. Children engaged the pSTS during solo doll play but not during solo tablet play, suggesting they were rehearsing social cognitive skills more with dolls. These findings suggest social play utilizes multiple neural regions and highlight how doll play can achieve similar patterns of activation, even when children play by themselves. Doll play may provide a unique opportunity for children to practice social interactions important for developing social-emotional skills, such as empathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Methodological Problems With Online Concussion Testing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.509091</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.509091</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reaction time testing is widely used in online computerized concussion assessments, and most concussion studies utilizing the metric have demonstrated varying degrees of difference between concussed and non-concussed individuals. The problem with most of these online concussion assessments is that they predominantly rely on consumer grade technology. Typical administration of these reaction time tests involves presenting a visual stimulus on a computer monitor and prompting the test subject to respond as quickly as possible via keypad or computer mouse. However, inherent delays and variabilities are introduced to the reaction time measure by both computer and associated operating systems that the concussion assessment tool is installed on. The authors hypothesized systems that are typically used to collect concussion reaction time data would demonstrate significant errors in reaction time measurements. To remove human bias, a series of experiments was conducted robotically to assess timing errors introduced by reaction time tests under four different conditions. In the first condition, a visual reaction time test was conducted by flashing a visual stimulus on a computer monitor. Detection was via photodiode and mechanical response was delivered via computer mouse. The second condition employed a mobile device for the visual stimulus, and the mechanical response was delivered to the mobile device's touchscreen. The third condition simulated a tactile reaction time test, and mechanical response was delivered via computer mouse. The fourth condition also simulated a tactile reaction time test, but response was delivered to a dedicated device designed to store the interval between stimulus delivery and response, thus bypassing any problems hypothesized to be introduced by computer and/or computer software. There were significant differences in the range of responses recorded from the four different conditions with the reaction time collected from visual stimulus on a mobile device being the worst and the device with dedicated hardware designed for the task being the best. The results suggest that some of the commonly used visual tasks on consumer grade computers could be (and have been) introducing significant errors for reaction time testing and that dedicated hardware designed for the reaction time task is needed to minimize testing errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Vicarious reward unblocks associative learning about novel cues in male rats</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60755</link>
	<description>Many species, including rats, are sensitive to social signals and their valuation is important in social learning. Here we introduce a task that investigates if mutual reward delivery in male rats can drive associative learning. We found that when actor rats have fully learned a stimulus-self-reward association, adding a cue that predicted additional reward to a partner unblocked associative learning about this cue. By contrast, additional cues that did not predict partner reward remained blocked from acquiring positive associative value. Importantly, this social unblocking effect was still present when controlling for secondary reinforcement but absent when social information exchange was impeded, when mutual reward outcomes were disadvantageously unequal to the actor or when the added cue predicted reward delivery to an empty chamber. Taken together, these results suggest that mutual rewards can drive associative learning in rats and is dependent on vicariously experienced social and food-related cues.</description>

	<title>eLife: Myogenin is an essential regulator of adult myofibre growth and muscle stem cell homeostasis</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60445</link>
	<description>Growth and maintenance of skeletal muscle fibres depend on coordinated activation and return to quiescence of resident muscle stem cells (MuSCs). The transcription factor Myogenin (Myog) regulates myocyte fusion during development, but its role in adult myogenesis remains unclear. In contrast to mice, &lt;i&gt;myog&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; zebrafish are viable, but have hypotrophic muscles. By isolating adult myofibres with associated MuSCs we found that &lt;i&gt;myog&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; myofibres have severely reduced nuclear number, but increased myonuclear domain size. Expression of fusogenic genes is decreased, Pax7 upregulated, MuSCs are fivefold more numerous and mis-positioned throughout the length of &lt;i&gt;myog&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; myofibres instead of localising at myofibre ends as in wild-type. Loss of Myog dysregulates mTORC1 signalling, resulting in an 'alerted' state of MuSCs, which display precocious activation and faster cell cycle entry ex vivo, concomitant with &lt;i&gt;myod&lt;/i&gt; upregulation. Thus, beyond controlling myocyte fusion, Myog influences the MuSC:niche relationship, demonstrating a multi-level contribution to muscle homeostasis throughout life.</description>

	<title>eLife: Dynamically evolving novel overlapping gene as a factor in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic</title>

	<description>Understanding the emergence of novel viruses requires an accurate and comprehensive annotation of their genomes. Overlapping genes (OLGs) are common in viruses and have been associated with pandemics, but are still widely overlooked. We identify and characterize &lt;i&gt;ORF3d&lt;/i&gt;, a novel OLG in SARS-CoV-2 that is also present in Guangxi pangolin-CoVs but not other closely related pangolin-CoVs or bat-CoVs. We then document evidence of &lt;i&gt;ORF3d&lt;/i&gt; translation, characterize its protein sequence, and conduct an evolutionary analysis at three levels: between taxa (21 members of &lt;i&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus&lt;/i&gt;), between human hosts (3978 SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences), and within human hosts (401 deeply sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples). &lt;i&gt;ORF3d&lt;/i&gt; has been independently identified and shown to elicit a strong antibody response in COVID-19 patients. However, it has been misclassified as the unrelated gene &lt;i&gt;ORF3b&lt;/i&gt;, leading to confusion. Our results liken &lt;i&gt;ORF3d&lt;/i&gt; to other accessory genes in emerging viruses and highlight the importance of OLGs.</description>

	<title>eLife: Establishment and maintenance of motor neuron identity via temporal modularity in terminal selector function</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59464</link>
	<description>Terminal selectors are transcription factors (TFs) that establish during development and maintain throughout life post-mitotic neuronal identity. We previously showed that UNC-3/Ebf, the terminal selector of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; cholinergic motor neurons (MNs), acts indirectly to prevent alternative neuronal identities (Feng et al., 2020). Here, we globally identify the direct targets of UNC-3. Unexpectedly, we find that the suite of UNC-3 targets in MNs is modified across different life stages, revealing ‘temporal modularity’ in terminal selector function. In all larval and adult stages examined, UNC-3 is required for continuous expression of various protein classes (e.g. receptors, transporters) critical for MN function. However, only in late larvae and adults, UNC-3 is required to maintain expression of MN-specific TFs. Minimal disruption of UNC-3’s temporal modularity via genome engineering affects locomotion. Another &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; terminal selector (UNC-30/Pitx) also exhibits temporal modularity, supporting the potential generality of this mechanism for the control of neuronal identity.</description>

The field of transcriptomics uses and measures mRNA as a proxy of gene expression. There are currently two major platforms in use for quantifying mRNA, microarray and RNA-Seq. Many comparative studies have shown that their results are not always consistent. In this study we aim to find a robust method to increase comparability of both platforms enabling data analysis of merged data from both platforms. We transformed high dimensional transcriptomics data from two different platforms into a lower dimensional, and biologically relevant dataset by calculating enrichment scores based on gene set collections for all samples. We compared the similarity between data from both platforms based on the raw data and on the enrichment scores. We show that the performed data transforms the data in a biologically relevant way and filters out noise which leads to increased platform concordance. We validate the procedure using predictive models built with microarray based enrichment scores to predict subtypes of breast cancer using enrichment scores based on sequenced data. Although microarray and RNA-Seq expression levels might appear different, transforming them into biologically relevant gene set enrichment scores significantly increases their correlation, which is a step forward in data integration of the two platforms. The gene set collections were shown to contain biologically relevant gene sets. More in-depth investigation on the effect of the composition, size, and number of gene sets that are used for the transformation is suggested for future research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QAKeFKz1bhY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Healthy adults flexibly adapt their learning strategies to ongoing changes in uncertainty, a key feature of adaptive behaviour. However, the developmental trajectory of this ability is yet unknown, as developmental studies have not incorporated trial-to-trial variation in uncertainty in their analyses or models. To address this issue, we compared adolescents’ and adults’ trial-to-trial dynamics of uncertainty, learning rate, and exploration in two tasks that assess learning in noisy but otherwise stable environments. In an estimation task—which provides direct indices of trial-specific learning rate—both age groups reduced their learning rate over time, as self-reported uncertainty decreased. Accordingly, the estimation data in both groups was better explained by a Bayesian model with dynamic learning rate (Kalman filter) than by conventional reinforcement-learning models. Furthermore, adolescents’ learning rates asymptoted at a higher level, reflecting an over-weighting of the most recent outcome, and the estimated Kalman-filter parameters suggested that this was due to an overestimation of environmental volatility. In a choice task, both age groups became more likely to choose the higher-valued option over time, but this increase in choice accuracy was smaller in the adolescents. In contrast to the estimation task, we found no evidence for a Bayesian expectation-updating process in the choice task, suggesting that estimation and choice tasks engage different learning processes. However, our modeling results of the choice task suggested that both age groups reduced their degree of exploration over time, and that the adolescents explored overall more than the adults. Finally, age-related differences in exploration parameters from fits to the choice data were mediated by participants’ volatility parameter from fits to the estimation data. Together, these results suggest that adolescents overestimate the rate of environmental change, resulting in elevated learning rates and increased exploration, which may help understand developmental changes in learning and decision-making.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q_oMUJUHLS8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

During these days of global emergency for the COVID-19 disease outbreak, there is an urgency to share reliable information able to help worldwide life scientists to get better insights and make sense of the large amount of data currently available. In this study we used the results presented in [1] to perform two different Systems Biology analyses on the HCoV-host interactome. In the first one, we reconstructed the interactome of the HCoV-host proteins, integrating it with highly reliable miRNA and drug interactions information. We then added the IL-6 gene, identified in recent publications [2] as heavily involved in the COVID-19 progression and, interestingly, we identified several interactions with the reconstructed interactome. In the second analysis, we performed a Gene Ontology and a Pathways enrichment analysis on the full set of the HCoV-host interactome proteins and on the ones belonging to a significantly dense cluster of interacting proteins identified in the first analysis. Results of the two analyses provide a compact but comprehensive glance on some of the current state-of-the-art regulations, GO, and pathways involved in the HCoV-host interactome, and that could support all scientists currently focusing on SARS-CoV-2 research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JzU-epzTyFw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Psychiatric disorders are ubiquitously characterized by debilitating social impairments. These difficulties are thought to emerge from aberrant social inference. In order to elucidate the underlying computational mechanisms, patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (N = 29), schizophrenia (N = 31), and borderline personality disorder (N = 31) as well as healthy controls (N = 34) performed a probabilistic reward learning task in which participants could learn from social and nonsocial information. Patients with schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder performed more poorly on the task than healthy controls and patients with major depressive disorder. Broken down by domain, borderline personality disorder patients performed better in the social compared to the non-social domain. In contrast, controls and MDD patients showed the opposite pattern and SCZ patients showed no difference between domains. In effect, borderline personality disorder patients gave up a possible overall performance advantage by concentrating their learning in the social at the expense of the non-social domain. We used computational modeling to assess learning and decision-making parameters estimated for each participant from their behavior. This enabled additional insights into the underlying learning and decision-making mechanisms. Patients with borderline personality disorder showed slower learning from social and non-social information and an exaggerated sensitivity to changes in environmental volatility, both in the non-social and the social domain, but more so in the latter. Regarding decision-making the modeling revealed that compared to controls and major depression patients, patients with borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia showed a stronger reliance on social relative to non-social information when making choices. Depressed patients did not differ significantly from controls in this respect. Overall, our results are consistent with the notion of a general interpersonal hypersensitivity in borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia based on a shared computational mechanism characterized by an over-reliance on beliefs about others in making decisions and by an exaggerated need to make sense of others during learning specifically in borderline personality disorder.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MrkTPYrQlV8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Cyclic transitions between higher order motifs underlie sustained asynchronous spiking in sparse recurrent networks</title>

A basic—yet nontrivial—function which neocortical circuitry must satisfy is the ability to maintain stable spiking activity over time. Stable neocortical activity is asynchronous, critical, and low rate, and these features of spiking dynamics contribute to efficient computation and optimal information propagation. However, it remains unclear how neocortex maintains this asynchronous spiking regime. Here we algorithmically construct spiking neural network models, each composed of 5000 neurons. Network construction synthesized topological statistics from neocortex with a set of objective functions identifying naturalistic low-rate, asynchronous, and critical activity. We find that simulations run on the same topology exhibit sustained asynchronous activity under certain sets of initial membrane voltages but truncated activity under others. Synchrony, rate, and criticality do not provide a full explanation of this dichotomy. Consequently, in order to achieve mechanistic understanding of sustained asynchronous activity, we summarized activity as functional graphs where edges between units are defined by pairwise spike dependencies. We then analyzed the intersection between functional edges and synaptic connectivity- i.e. recruitment networks. Higher-order patterns, such as triplet or triangle motifs, have been tied to cooperativity and integration. We find, over time in each sustained simulation, low-variance periodic transitions between isomorphic triangle motifs in the recruitment networks. We quantify the phenomenon as a Markov process and discover that if the network fails to engage this stereotyped regime of motif dominance “cycling”, spiking activity truncates early. Cycling of motif dominance generalized across manipulations of synaptic weights and topologies, demonstrating the robustness of this regime for maintenance of network activity. Our results point to the crucial role of excitatory higher-order patterns in sustaining asynchronous activity in sparse recurrent networks. They also provide a possible explanation why such connectivity and activity patterns have been prominently reported in neocortex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JIKiGK-cDv0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Small membrane proteins represent a largely unexplored yet abundant class of proteins in pro- and eukaryotes. They essentially consist of a single transmembrane domain and are associated with stress response mechanisms in bacteria. How these proteins are inserted into the bacterial membrane is unknown. Our study revealed that in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, the 27-amino-acid-long model protein YohP is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP), as indicated by in vivo and in vitro site-directed cross-linking. Cross-links to SRP were also observed for a second small membrane protein, the 33-amino-acid-long YkgR. However, in contrast to the canonical cotranslational recognition by SRP, SRP was found to bind to YohP posttranslationally. In vitro protein transport assays in the presence of a SecY inhibitor and proteoliposome studies demonstrated that SRP and its receptor FtsY are essential for the posttranslational membrane insertion of YohP by either the SecYEG translocon or by the YidC insertase. Furthermore, our data showed that the &lt;i&gt;yohP&lt;/i&gt; mRNA localized preferentially and translation-independently to the bacterial membrane in vivo. In summary, our data revealed that YohP engages an unique SRP-dependent posttranslational insertion pathway that is likely preceded by an mRNA targeting step. This further highlights the enormous plasticity of bacterial protein transport machineries.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/J1Buzevc9iA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Matrix proteins are encoded by many enveloped viruses, including influenza viruses, herpes viruses, and coronaviruses. Underneath the viral envelope of influenza virus, matrix protein 1 (M1) forms an oligomeric layer critical for particle stability and pH-dependent RNA genome release. However, high-resolution structures of full-length monomeric M1 and the matrix layer have not been available, impeding antiviral targeting and understanding of the pH-dependent transitions involved in cell entry. Here, purification and extensive mutagenesis revealed protein–protein interfaces required for the formation of multilayered helical M1 oligomers similar to those observed in virions exposed to the low pH of cell entry. However, single-layered helical oligomers with biochemical and ultrastructural similarity to those found in infectious virions before cell entry were observed upon mutation of a single amino acid. The highly ordered structure of the single-layered oligomers and their likeness to the matrix layer of intact virions prompted structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The resulting 3.4-Å–resolution structure revealed the molecular details of M1 folding and its organization within the single-shelled matrix. The solution of the full-length M1 structure, the identification of critical assembly interfaces, and the development of M1 assembly assays with purified proteins are crucial advances for antiviral targeting of influenza viruses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oIHtLnau1qM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Prior anticoagulation in patients with ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25917?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25917?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and acute ischaemic stroke the association of prior anticoagulation with vitamin‐K antagonists (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) with stroke severity, intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) utilization, safety of IVT, and 3‐months outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohort study of consecutive patients (2013–2019) on anticoagulation versus those without (controls) with regard to stroke severity, rates of IVT/MT, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and favorable outcome (mRS 0–2) at 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 8179 patients (mean[SD]age, 79.8[9.6] years;49%women), 1486(18%) were on VKA treatment, 1634(20%) on DOAC treatment at stroke onset, and 5059 controls. Stroke severity was lower in patients on DOACs (median NIHSS 4,[IQR2–11]) as compared to VKA (6,[2–14]) and controls (7,[3–15], P&amp;lt;0.001; quantile regression: β ‐2.1, 95%CI ‐2.6 – ‐1.7). The IVT‐rate in potentially eligible patients was significantly lower in patients on VKA (156/247 (63%);aOR 0.67; 95%CI 0.50–0.90) and particularly in patients on DOACs (69/464 (15%); aOR 0.06; 95%CI 0.05–0.08) as compared to controls (1544/2504 (74%)). sICH after IVT occurred in 3.6%(2.6–4.7%) of controls, 9/195 (4.6%; 1.9–9.2%; aOR 0.93;0.46‐1.90) of patients on VKA and 2/65 (3.1%; 0.4–10.8%, aOR 0.56;0.28–1.12) of those on DOACs. After adjustments for prognostic confounders, DOAC pretreatment was associated with favorable 3‐month outcome (aOR 1.24,1.01–1.51).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior DOAC therapy in patients with AF was associated with decreased admission stroke severity at onset and a remarkably low rate of IVT. Overall, patients on DOAC might have better functional outcome at 3 months. Further research is needed to overcome potential restrictions for IVT in patients taking DOACs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Neuronal Representations of Tactic-Based Sensorimotor Transformations in the Primate Medial Prefrontal, Presupplementary, and Supplementary Motor Areas: A Comparative Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.536246</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.536246</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adaptive context-dependent behaviors necessitate the flexible selection of multiple behavioral tactics, i.e., internal protocols for selecting an action. Previous primate studies have shown that the posterior medial prefrontal cortex (pmPFC) contributes to the selection, retention, and use of tactics, but the manner in which this area employs selected tactics to convert sensory information into action and how that manner differs from downstream cortical motor areas have yet to be fully elucidated. To address this issue, the present study recorded neuronal activity in two monkeys as they performed a two-choice arm reaching task that required the selection of multiple tactics when converting spatial cue information into the direction of arm reaching. Neuronal populations in both pmPFC and presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) represented tactics during their selection, maintenance in memory, and their use in determining an action. Additionally, they represented the monkeys’ action in the behavioral epoch in which the direction of reaching was determined. A striking contrast between the pmPFC and the pre-SMA was the representation of the spatial cue location in the former and its absence in the latter area. In individual neurons, neurons in pmPFC and pre-SMA had either single or mixed representation of tactics and action. Some of the pmPFC neurons additionally encoded cue location. Finally, neurons in the supplementary motor area mainly represented the action. Taken together, the present results indicate that, of these three areas, the pmPFC plays a cardinal role during the integration of behavioral tactics and visuospatial information when selecting an action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Dendritic Spines Shape Analysis—Classification or Clusterization? Perspective</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00031</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00031</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dendritic spines are small protrusions from the dendrite membrane, where contact with neighboring axons is formed in order to receive synaptic input. Changes in size, shape, and density of synaptic spines are associated with learning and memory, and observed after drug abuse in a variety of neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders. Due to the preeminent importance of synaptic spines, there have been major efforts into developing techniques that enable visualization and analysis of dendritic spines in cultured neurons, in fixed slices and in intact brain tissue. The classification of synaptic spines into predefined morphological groups is a standard approach in neuroscience research, where spines are divided into fixed categories such as thin, mushroom, and stubby subclasses. This study examines accumulated evidence that supports the existence of dendritic spine shapes as a continuum rather than separated classes. Using new approaches and software tools we reflect on complex dendritic spine shapes, positing that understanding of their highly dynamic nature is required to perform analysis of their morphology. The study discusses and compares recently developed algorithms that rely on clusterization rather than classification, therefore enabling new levels of spine shape analysis. We reason that improved methods of analysis may help to investigate a link between dendritic spine shape and its function, facilitating future studies of learning and memory as well as studies of brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Tau Protein and Its Role in Blood–Brain Barrier Dysfunction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.570045</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The blood–brain barrier (BBB) plays a crucial role in maintaining the specialized microenvironment of the central nervous system (CNS). In aging, the stability of the BBB declines and the permeability increases. The list of CNS pathologies involving BBB dysfunction is growing. The opening of the BBB and subsequent infiltration of serum components to the brain can lead to a host of processes resulting in progressive synaptic, neuronal dysfunction, and detrimental neuroinflammatory changes. Such processes have been implicated in different diseases, including vascular dementia, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hypoxia, ischemia, and diabetes mellitus. The BBB damage is also observed in tauopathies that lack amyloid-β overproduction, suggesting a role for tau in BBB damage. Tauopathies represent a heterogeneous group of around 20 different neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal deposition of the MAPT in cells of the nervous system. Neuropathology of tauopathies is defined as intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) consisting of aggregated hyper- and abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein and neuroinflammation. Disruption of the BBB found in tauopathies is driven by chronic neuroinflammation. Production of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules by glial cells, neurons, and endothelial cells determine the integrity of the BBB and migration of immune cells into the brain. The inflammatory processes promote structural changes in capillaries such as fragmentation, thickening, atrophy of pericytes, accumulation of laminin in the basement membrane, and increased permeability of blood vessels to plasma proteins. Here, we summarize the knowledge about the role of tau protein in BBB structural and functional changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: L-Asparaginase Exerts Neuroprotective Effects in an SH-SY5Y-A53T Model of Parkinson’s Disease by Regulating Glutamine Metabolism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.563054</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.563054</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide and involves deficiencies in alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) degradation. Effective therapeutic strategies for PD are urgently needed. L-asparaginase (L-ASNase) has been developed for therapeutic applications in many fields because it catalyzes the hydrolysis of asparagine and glutamine in cancer cells, which may also activate autophagy and induce the degradation of accumulated α-Syn. However, the efficacy and related mechanism of L-ASNase in PD remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We determined the correlation between L-ASNase and autophagic degradation of α-Syn in a cell model of PD. Mitochondrial function and apoptosis were examined in the presence or absence of L-ASNase. Then, we applied GC-MS/MS targeted amino acid metabolomics analysis to validate the amino acid regulation induced by L-ASNase treatment. Glutamine was added to verify whether the neuroprotective effect was induced by deprivation of glutamine. α-Syn-related autophagy and mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics were detected to explore the mechanism of L-ASNase-based therapy in PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: L-ASNase activated the autophagic degradation of α-Syn in a cell model of PD without cytotoxicity at specific concentrations/times. Under these conditions, L-ASNase showed substantial neuroprotective effects, including improvements in mitochondrial function and decreased apoptosis. Through GC-MS/MS targeted analysis, glutamine metabolism was identified as the target of L-ASNase in PD treatment, and the neuroprotective effect of L-ASNase was reduced after glutamine supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our study demonstrated for the first time that L-ASNase had a neuroprotective effect on a cell model of PD through a moderate deprivation of glutamine, which induced autophagic activation and mitochondrial fusion. Therefore, we demonstrated that L-ASNase could be a promising and effective drug for PD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: 17β-Estradiol Protects Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells Against Ketamine-Induced Injury Through Estrogen Receptor β Pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.576813</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.576813</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ketamine inhibits neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) proliferation and disrupts normal neurogenesis in the developing brain. 17β-Estradiol alleviates neurogenesis damage and enhances behavioral performance after ketamine administration. However, the receptor pathway of 17β-estradiol that protects NSPCs from ketamine-induced injury remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of estrogen receptor α (ER-α) and estrogen receptor β (ER-β) in 17β-estradiol’s protection against ketamine-exposed NSPCs and explored its potential mechanism. The primary cultured NSPCs were identified by immunofluorescence and then treated with ketamine and varying doses of ER-α agonist 4,4′,4″-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl) trisphenol (PPT) or ER-β agonist 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN) for 24 h. NSPC proliferation was analyzed by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation test. The expression of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK-3β) was quantified by western blotting. It was found that treatment with different concentrations of PPT did not alter the inhibition of ketamine on NSPC proliferation. However, treatment with DPN attenuated the inhibition of ketamine on NSPC proliferation at 24 h after their exposure (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, treatment with DPN increased p-GSK-3β expression in NSPCs exposed to ketamine. These findings indicated that ER-β mediates probably the protective effects of 17β-estradiol on ketamine-damaged NSPC proliferation and GSK-3β is involved in this process&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Investigation on the Alteration of Brain Functional Network and Its Role in the Identification of Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.558434</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.558434</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is generally regarded as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In coping with the challenges caused by AD, we analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 82 MCI subjects and 93 normal controls (NCs). The alteration of brain functional network in MCI was investigated on three scales, including global metrics, nodal characteristics, and modular properties. The results supported the existence of small worldness, hubs, and community structure in the brain functional networks of both groups. Compared with NCs, the network altered in MCI over all the three scales. In scale I, we found significantly decreased characteristic path length and increased global efficiency in MCI. Moreover, altered global network metrics were associated with cognitive level evaluated by neuropsychological assessments. In scale II, the nodal betweenness centrality of some global hubs, such as the right Crus II of cerebellar hemisphere (CERCRU2.R) and fusiform gyrus (FFG.R), changed significantly and associated with the severity and cognitive impairment in MCI. In scale III, although anatomically adjacent regions tended to be clustered into the same module regardless of group, discrepancies existed in the composition of modules in both groups, with a prominent separation of the cerebellum and a less localized organization of community structure in MCI compared with NC. Taking advantages of random forest approach, we achieved an accuracy of 91.4% to discriminate MCI patients from NCs by integrating cognitive assessments and network analysis. The importance of the used features fed into the classifier further validated the nodal characteristics of CERCRU2.R and FFG.R could be potential biomarkers in the identification of MCI. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the brain functional connectome data altered at the stage of MCI and could assist the automatic diagnosis of MCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Deep Learning Based Inter-subject Continuous Decoding of Motor Imagery for Practical Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00918</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inter-subject transfer learning is a long-standing problem in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and has not yet been fully realized due to high inter-subject variability in the brain signals related to motor imagery (MI). The recent success of deep learning-based algorithms in classifying different brain signals warrants further exploration to determine whether it is feasible for the inter-subject continuous decoding of MI signals to provide contingent neurofeedback which is important for neurorehabilitative BCI designs. In this paper, we have shown how a convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning framework can be used for inter-subject continuous decoding of MI related electroencephalographic (EEG) signals using the novel concept of Mega Blocks for adapting the network against inter-subject variabilities. These Mega Blocks have the capacity to repeat a specific architectural block several times such as one or more convolutional layers in a single Mega Block. The parameters of such Mega Blocks can be optimized using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. The results, obtained on the publicly available BCI competition IV-2b dataset, yields an average inter-subject continuous decoding accuracy of 71.49% (κ = 0.42) and 70.84% (κ = 0.42) for two different training methods such as adaptive moment estimation (Adam) and stochastic gradient descent (SGDM), respectively, in 7 out of 9 subjects. Our results show for the first time that it is feasible to use CNN based architectures for inter-subject continuous decoding with a sufficient level of accuracy for developing calibration-free MI-BCIs for practical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: A Multi-Scale Computational Model of Excitotoxic Loss of Dopaminergic Cells in Parkinson's Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Although the exact cause of cell death is not clear, the hypothesis that metabolic deficiency is a key factor has been gaining attention in recent years. In the present study, we investigated this hypothesis using a multi-scale computational model of the subsystem of the basal ganglia comprising the subthalamic nucleus (STN), globus pallidus externa (GPe), and SNc. The proposed model is a multiscale model in that interaction among the three nuclei are simulated using more abstract Izhikevich neuron models, while the molecular pathways involved in cell death of SNc neurons are simulated in terms of detailed chemical kinetics. Simulation results obtained from the proposed model showed that energy deficiencies occurring at cellular and network levels could precipitate the excitotoxic loss of SNc neurons in PD. At the subcellular level, the models show how calcium elevation leads to apoptosis of SNc neurons. The therapeutic effects of several neuroprotective interventions are also simulated in the model. From neuroprotective studies, it was clear that glutamate inhibition and apoptotic signal blocker therapies were able to halt the progression of SNc cell loss when compared to other therapeutic interventions, which only slowed down the progression of SNc cell loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Competition Enhances the Effectiveness and Motivation of Attention Rehabilitation After Stroke. A Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.575403</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Attention deficits are among the most common cognitive impairments observed after experiencing stroke. However, a very limited number of studies have investigated the effectiveness of interventions that specifically focus on the rehabilitation of attention deficits among subjects with impaired attention. Although several interventions have included the use of computerized programs to provide dynamic stimuli, real-time performance feedback, and motivating tasks, existing studies have not exploited the potential benefits of multi-user interactions. Group-based and competitive interventions have been reported to be more enjoyable and motivating, depending on individual traits, and may potentially be more demanding, which may increase their effectiveness. This study investigated the effectiveness and motivating abilities of an intervention specifically designed to address attention deficits. This intervention combined paper-and-pencil tasks and interactive, computerized, multi-touch exercises, which were administered, either non-competitively or competitively, to a group of 43 individuals with chronic stroke. The mediating effects of competitiveness were evaluated for both intervention effectiveness and motivation. Participants were randomly sorted into two groups and underwent 20 one-hour group-based sessions, during which they either worked individually or competed with peers, according to their group allocation. Participants were assessed before and after the intervention, using the Conners' Continuous Performance Test, the d2 Test of Attention, the Color Trail Test, the Digit Span Test, and the Spatial Span Test. The competitiveness and subjective experiences of the participants after the intervention were investigated with the Revised Competitiveness Index and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, respectively. The results showed that participants who competed demonstrated significantly greater improvements in all cognitive abilities, except for divided attention, and reported greater enjoyment than their non-competitive peers. Both groups reported comparable levels of perceived competence, pressure, and usefulness. Interestingly, the competitiveness of the participants did not alter either the effectiveness or the subjective experience of the intervention. These findings suggest that competition might enhance the effectiveness and enjoyment of rehabilitation interventions designed to address attention deficits in individuals post-stroke, regardless of their level of competitiveness and without having a negative effect on their perceived pressure and competence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Hippocampus and Parahippocampus Volume Reduction Associated With Impaired Olfactory Abilities in Subjects Without Evidence of Cognitive Decline</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.556519</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between olfactory recognition and morphological changes in olfactory brain regions including the amygdala, hippocampus, rectus, parahippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and medial frontal cortex in 27 elderly subjects and 27 younger healthy controls. The specific aim of the study was to determine which brain areas are associated with the initial decline of olfaction in elderly subjects, which occurs before the onset of dementia. All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging to measure anatomical brain volume and cortical thickness, and subjects were assessed using tests of olfactory acuity and cognitive function measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Overall brain volume reductions were observed in elderly subjects compared with young healthy controls, but only reduction in the volume of the left hippocampus was associated with decreased olfactory ability. The parahippocampus of elderly subjects was not different from that of controls; the extent of the reduction of parahippocampus volume varied among individuals, and reduction in this region was associated with olfactory decline. Similarly, parahippocampus thinning was associated with decreased olfactory function. The path analysis showed direct and indirect effects of hippocampus and parahippocampus volume on olfactory ability and that volume reductions in these areas were not associated with cognitive function. Parahippocampus volume reduction and thinning exhibited individual variation; this may be the first appearance of pathological changes and may lead to dysfunction in the connection of olfactory memory to the neocortex. Parahippocampus change may reflect the first sign of olfactory impairment prior to pathological changes in the hippocampus, amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Directional Local Field Potentials in the Subthalamic Nucleus During Deep Brain Implantation of Parkinson’s Disease Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.521282</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Segmented deep brain stimulation leads feature directional electrodes that allow for a finer spatial control of electrical stimulation compared to traditional ring-shaped electrodes. These segmented leads have demonstrated enlarged therapeutic windows and have thus the potential to improve the treatment of Parkinson’s disease patients. Moreover, they provide a unique opportunity to record directional local field potentials. Here, we investigated whether directional local field potentials can help identify the best stimulation direction to assist device programming. Four Parkinson’s disease patients underwent routine implantation of the subthalamic nucleus. Firstly, local field potentials were recorded in three directions for two conditions: In one condition, the patient was at rest; in the other condition, the patient’s arm was moved. Secondly, current thresholds for therapeutic and side effects were identified intraoperatively for directional stimulation. Therapeutic windows were calculated from these two thresholds. Thirdly, the spectral power of the total beta band (13–35 Hz) and its sub-bands low, high, and peak beta were analyzed post hoc. Fourthly, the spectral power was used by different algorithms to predict the ranking of directions. The spectral power profiles were patient-specific, and spectral peaks were found both in the low beta band (13–20 Hz) and in the high beta band (20.5–35 Hz). The direction with the highest spectral power in the total beta band was most indicative of the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; best direction when defined by therapeutic window. Based on the total beta band, the resting condition and the moving condition were similarly predictive about the direction ranking and classified 83.3% of directions correctly. However, different algorithms were needed to predict the ranking defined by therapeutic window or therapeutic current threshold. Directional local field potentials may help predict the best stimulation direction. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to better distinguish the informative value of different conditions and the beta sub-bands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Identifiability of a Binomial Synapse</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.558477</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.558477</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synapses are highly stochastic transmission units. A classical model describing this stochastic transmission is called the binomial model, and its underlying parameters can be estimated from postsynaptic responses to evoked stimuli. The accuracy of parameter estimates obtained via such a model-based approach depends on the identifiability of the model. A model is said to be structurally identifiable if its parameters can be uniquely inferred from the distribution of its outputs. However, this theoretical property does not necessarily imply practical identifiability. For instance, if the number of observations is low or if the recording noise is high, the model's parameters can only be loosely estimated. Structural identifiability, which is an intrinsic property of a model, has been widely characterized; but practical identifiability, which is a property of both the model and the experimental protocol, is usually only qualitatively assessed. Here, we propose a formal definition for the practical identifiability domain of a statistical model. For a given experimental protocol, this domain corresponds to the set of parameters for which the model is correctly identified as the ground truth compared to a simpler alternative model. Considering a model selection problem instead of a parameter inference problem allows to derive a non-arbitrary criterion for practical identifiability. We apply our definition to the study of neurotransmitter release at a chemical synapse. Our contribution to the analysis of synaptic stochasticity is three-fold: firstly, we propose a quantitative criterion for the practical identifiability of a statistical model, and compute the identifiability domains of different variants of the binomial release model (uni or multi-quantal, with or without short-term plasticity); secondly, we extend the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), a classically used tool for model selection, to models with correlated data (which is the case for most models of chemical synapses); finally, we show that our approach allows to perform data free model selection, i.e., to verify if a model used to fit data was indeed identifiable even without access to the data, but having only access to the fitted parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Inter-band Bispectral Analysis of EEG Background Activity to Characterize Alzheimer's Disease Continuum</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00070</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to characterize the EEG alterations in inter-band interactions along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. For this purpose, EEG background activity from 51 healthy control subjects, 51 mild cognitive impairment patients, 50 mild AD patients, 50 moderate AD patients, and 50 severe AD patients was analyzed by means of bispectrum. Three inter-band features were extracted from bispectrum matrices: bispectral relative power (BispRP), cubic bispectral entropy (BispEn), and bispectral median frequency (BispMF). BispRP results showed an increase of delta and theta interactions with other frequency bands and the opposite behavior for alpha, beta-1, and beta-2. Delta and theta interactions, along with the rest of the spectrum, also experimented a decrease of BispEn with disease progression, suggesting these bands interact with a reduced variety of components in advanced stages of dementia. Finally, BispMF showed a consistent reduction along the AD continuum in all bands, which is reflective of an interaction of the global spectrum with lower frequency bands as the disease develops. Our results indicate a progressive decrease in inter-band interactions with the severity of the disease, especially those involving high frequency components. Since inter-band coupling oscillations are related to complex and multi-scaled brain processes, these alterations likely reflect the neurodegeneration associated with the AD continuum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been employed for motor function rehabilitation for stroke patients, but its effects on post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) remains controversial.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To identify the effects of rTMS intervention on PSCI patients and its potential neural correlates to behavioral improvements.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We recruited 34 PSCI patients for 20 sessions of 10 Hz rTMS or no-stim control treatments over the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Cognitive function was evaluated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale, Victoria Stroop Test, Rivermead Behavior Memory Test, and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) assessed with the Modified Barthel Index. 14 patients received functional MRI scan, a useful non-invasive technique of determining how structurally segregated and functionally specialized brain areas were interconnected, which was reflected by blood oxygenation level–dependent signals. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC) were applied as the analytical approaches, which were used to measure the resting-state brain activity and functional connection.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;rTMS improved cognitive functions and ADLs for PSCI patients relative to patients who received no-stim control treatment. The cognitive improvements correlated to increased ALFF of the left medial prefrontal cortex, and increased FC of right medial prefrontal cortex and right ventral anterior cingulate cortex.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;10 Hz rTMS at DLPFC could improve cognitive function and quality of life for PSCI patients, which is associated with an altered frontal cortical activity.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Registration&lt;p&gt;Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR-IPR-17011908, http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neuroinflammation Treatment via Targeted Delivery of Nanoparticles</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The lack of effective treatments for most neurological diseases has prompted the search for novel therapeutic options. Interestingly, neuroinflammation is emerging as a common feature to target in most CNS pathologies. Recent studies suggest that targeted delivery of small molecules to reduce neuroinflammation can be beneficial. However, suboptimal drug delivery to the CNS is a major barrier to modulate inflammation because neurotherapeutic compounds are currently being delivered systemically without spatial or temporal control. Emerging nanomaterial technologies are providing promising and superior tools to effectively access neuropathological tissue in a controlled manner. Here we highlight recent advances in nanomaterial technologies for drug delivery to the CNS. We propose that state-of-the-art nanoparticle drug delivery platforms can significantly impact local CNS bioavailability of pharmacological compounds and treat neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Endocannabinoid Signaling Contributes to Experience-Induced Increase of Synaptic Release Sites From Parvalbumin Interneurons in Mouse Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.571133</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;During postnatal development of the visual cortex between eye-opening to puberty, visual experience promotes a gradual increase in the strength of inhibitory synaptic connections from parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-INs) onto layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. However, the detailed connectivity properties and molecular mechanisms underlying these developmental changes are not well understood. Using dual-patch clamp in brain slices from G42 mice, we revealed that both connection probability and the number of synaptic release sites contributed to the enhancement of synaptic strength. The increase of release site number was hindered by dark rearing from eye-opening and rescued by 3-days re-exposure to the normal visual environment. The effect of light re-exposure on restoring synaptic release sites in dark reared mice was mimicked by the agonist of cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptors and blocked by an antagonist of these receptors, suggesting a role for endocannabinoid signaling in light-induced maturation of inhibitory connectivity from PV-INs to pyramidal cells during postnatal development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: TNF-Mediated Homeostatic Synaptic Plasticity: From in vitro to in vivo Models</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since it was first described almost 30 years ago, homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) has been hypothesized to play a key role in maintaining neuronal circuit function in both developing and adult animals. While well characterized in vitro, determining the in vivo roles of this form of plasticity remains challenging. Since the discovery that the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mediates some forms of HSP, it has been possible to probe some of the in vivo contribution of TNF-mediated HSP. Work from our lab and others has found roles for TNF-HSP in a variety of functions, including the developmental plasticity of sensory systems, models of drug addiction, and the response to psychiatric drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: GABAA Receptor-Mediated Epileptogenicity in Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) Depends on Age at Epilepsy Onset</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.562811</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Enhanced spontaneous GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activity is associated with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a developmental malformation of the cerebral cortex. Clinical manifestations in FCD vary with age at epilepsy onset with a more favorable prognosis in patients with late-onset (LO) compared to that in cases with early-onset (EO). This study was designed to test the hypothesis in FCD that spontaneous GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated epileptogenicity depends on the age at epilepsy onset and varies between patients with early and late-onset age in FCD. To this end, brain specimens were obtained from the maximal spiking region (MAX) and minimal spiking region (MIN) of the epileptic foci of EO (n = 14, mean age = 10.6 ± 2.9 years) and LO (n = 10, mean age = 27 ± 5.6 years) patients undergoing electrocorticography (ECoG) guided surgery. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to record spontaneous GABAergic currents from normal-looking pyramidal neurons in slice preparations of resected brain samples. We detected higher frequency and amplitude of GABAergic events in MAX samples compared to MIN samples of LO patients, while they were comparable in MIN and MAX samples of EO patients. Further GABAergic activity in the MIN and MAX samples of EO patients was higher than the MIN samples of LO patients. This suggests that in LO patients, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated epileptogenicity is confined only to the high spiking areas, but in EO patients, it affects low spiking regions as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Changes of Amide Proton Transfer Imaging in Multiple System Atrophy Parkinsonism Type</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.572421</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.572421</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple system atrophy (MSA), an atypical parkinsonism of alpha-synucleinopathies, has no specific biomarker of diagnosis. According to different combinations of symptoms, MSA can be classified as parkinsonism-type MSA (MSA-P) and cerebellar-type MSA (MSA-C; Watanabe et al., 2018). Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging is by far the most studied chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging for its sensitivity to mobile protons and peptides in tissues. We hypothesize that APT imaging may be a feasible biomarker of MSA-P. Twenty MSA-P patients and 20 age-matched normal controls were enrolled in this study and underwent MR exams on a 3.0-T MR scanner. Magnetization transfer spectra at 3.5 ppm were acquired at two transverse slices of the head, including the midbrain and the basal ganglia. Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare the asymmetrical magnetization transfer ratio (MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt;) difference between MSA-P patients and normal controls. The APT MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt; values of MSA patients in the red nucleus (RN) (SN; P = 0.000), substantia nigra (P = 0.000), thalamus (P = 0.000), and putamen (P = 0.013) were significantly higher than those in normal controls. There was a negative correlation between APT MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt; and the score of part III of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (R = −0.338, P = 0.044) in the putamen, while there was a positive correlation between the APT MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt; and the rate of motor symptom progression (R = 0.406, P = 0.017) in the RN. These findings suggest that APT MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt; changes are found and may be of value in the diagnosis of MSA-P.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Related Shifts in Theta Oscillatory Activity During Audio-Visual Integration Regardless of Visual Attentional Load</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Audio-visual integration (AVI) is higher in attended conditions than in unattended conditions. Here, we explore the AVI effect when the attentional recourse is competed by additional visual distractors, and its aging effect using single- and dual-tasks. The results showed the highest AVI effect under single-task-attentional-load condition than under no- and dual-task-attentional-load conditions (all P &amp;lt; 0.05) in both older and younger groups, but the AVI effect was weaker and delayed for older adults compared to younger adults for all attentional-load conditions (all P &amp;lt; 0.05). The non-phase-locked oscillation for AVI analysis illustrated the highest theta and alpha oscillatory activity for single-task-attentional-load condition than for no- and dual-task-attentional-load conditions, and the AVI oscillatory activity mainly occurred in the Cz, CP1 and Oz of older adults but in the Fz, FC1, and Cz of younger adults. The AVI effect was significantly negatively correlated with FC1 (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1468, P = 0.05) and Cz (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1447, P = 0.048) theta activity and with Fz (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1557, P = 0.043), FC1 (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1042, P = 0.008), and Cz (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0897, P = 0.010) alpha activity for older adults but not for younger adults in dual task. These results suggested a reduction in AVI ability for peripheral stimuli and a shift in AVI oscillation from anterior to posterior regions in older adults as an adaptive mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>The CNS accommodates a diverse myeloid immune cell compartment that maintains CNS homeostasis in the steady state while contributing to tissue injury during infectious, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disease conditions. Autophagy and autophagy proteins play fundamental roles in myeloid cell–related immune functions. Many of these processes do not necessarily involve the canonical formation of a double-membrane structure known as the ‘autophagosome’ and reflect noncanonical functions of the autophagy machinery.</description>

	<description>How do four-legged animals adapt their locomotion to the environment? How do central and peripheral mechanisms interact within the spinal cord to produce adaptive locomotion and how is locomotion recovered when spinal circuits are perturbed? Salamanders are the only tetrapods that regenerate voluntary locomotion after full spinal transection. Given their evolutionary position, they provide a unique opportunity to bridge discoveries made in fish and mammalian models. Genetic dissection of salamander neural circuits is becoming feasible with new methods for precise manipulation, elimination, and visualisation of cells.</description>

	<description>Tactile shape recognition requires the perception of object surface angles. Kim et al. show how excitatory neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex construct object-angle representations from sensory input components. Task-relevant sensory components gain influence on object-angle tuning across angle discrimination training, coincident with selective sharpening of trained angle representations.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Inferring a complete genotype-phenotype map from a small number of measured phenotypes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Zachary R. Sailer, Sarah H. Shafik, Robert L. Summers, Alex Joule, Alice Patterson-Robert, Rowena E. Martin, Michael J. Harms&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding evolution requires detailed knowledge of genotype-phenotype maps; however, it can be a herculean task to measure every phenotype in a combinatorial map. We have developed a computational strategy to predict the missing phenotypes from an incomplete, combinatorial genotype-phenotype map. As a test case, we used an incomplete genotype-phenotype dataset previously generated for the malaria parasite’s ‘chloroquine resistance transporter’ (PfCRT). Wild-type PfCRT (PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;3D7&lt;/sup&gt;) lacks significant chloroquine (CQ) transport activity, but the introduction of the eight mutations present in the ‘Dd2’ isoform of PfCRT (PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;Dd2&lt;/sup&gt;) enables the protein to transport CQ away from its site of antimalarial action. This gain of a transport function imparts CQ resistance to the parasite. A combinatorial map between PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;3D7&lt;/sup&gt; and PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;Dd2&lt;/sup&gt; consists of 256 genotypes, of which only 52 have had their CQ transport activities measured through expression in the &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; oocyte. We trained a statistical model with these 52 measurements to infer the CQ transport activity for the remaining 204 combinatorial genotypes between PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;3D7&lt;/sup&gt; and PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;Dd2&lt;/sup&gt;. Our best-performing model incorporated a binary classifier, a nonlinear scale, and additive effects for each mutation. The addition of specific pairwise- and high-order-epistatic coefficients decreased the predictive power of the model. We evaluated our predictions by experimentally measuring the CQ transport activities of 24 additional PfCRT genotypes. The R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; value between our predicted and newly-measured phenotypes was 0.90. We then used the model to probe the accessibility of evolutionary trajectories through the map. Approximately 1% of the possible trajectories between PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;3D7&lt;/sup&gt; and PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;Dd2&lt;/sup&gt; are accessible; however, none of the trajectories entailed eight successive increases in CQ transport activity. These results demonstrate that phenotypes can be inferred with known uncertainty from a partial genotype-phenotype dataset. We also validated our approach against a collection of previously published genotype-phenotype maps. The model therefore appears general and should be applicable to a large number of genotype-phenotype maps.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ACe5JeGOk7c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Minimizing the number of optimizations for efficient community dynamic flux balance analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007786</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by James D. Brunner, Nicholas Chia&lt;/p&gt;

Dynamic flux balance analysis uses a quasi-steady state assumption to calculate an organism’s metabolic activity at each time-step of a dynamic simulation, using the well-known technique of flux balance analysis. For microbial communities, this calculation is especially costly and involves solving a linear constrained optimization problem for each member of the community at each time step. However, this is unnecessary and inefficient, as prior solutions can be used to inform future time steps. Here, we show that a basis for the space of internal fluxes can be chosen for each microbe in a community and this basis can be used to simulate forward by solving a relatively inexpensive system of linear equations at most time steps. We can use this solution as long as the resulting metabolic activity remains within the optimization problem’s constraints (i.e. the solution to the linear system of equations remains a feasible to the linear program). As the solution becomes infeasible, it first becomes a feasible but degenerate solution to the optimization problem, and we can solve a different but related optimization problem to choose an appropriate basis to continue forward simulation. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method by comparing with currently used methods on a four species community, and show that our method requires at least 91% fewer optimizations to be solved. For reproducibility, we prototyped the method using Python.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gastrointestinal microbiota regulate immune responses, but host molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Unbiased screening using SCFA-conjugated affinity nanobeads identified apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), an adaptor protein of inflammasome complex, as a noncanonical SCFA receptor besides GPRs. SCFAs promoted inflammasome activation in macrophages by binding to its ASC PYRIN domain. Activated inflammasome suppressed survival of &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; serovar Typhimurium (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. Typhimurium) in macrophages by pyroptosis and facilitated neutrophil recruitment to promote bacterial elimination and thus inhibit systemic dissemination in the host. Administration of SCFAs or dietary fibers, which are fermented to SCFAs by gut bacteria, significantly prolonged the survival of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. Typhimurium–infected mice through ASC-mediated inflammasome activation. SCFAs penetrated into the inflammatory region of the infected gut mucosa to protect against infection. This study provided evidence that SCFAs suppress &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; infection via inflammasome activation, shedding new light on the therapeutic activity of dietary fiber.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QtDva5UmCgg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Millipede genomes reveal unique adaptations during myriapod evolution</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhe Qu, Wenyan Nong, Wai Lok So, Tom Barton-Owen, Yiqian Li, Thomas C. N. Leung, Chade Li, Tobias Baril, Annette Y. P. Wong, Thomas Swale, Ting-Fung Chan, Alexander Hayward, Sai-Ming Ngai, Jerome H. L. Hui&lt;/p&gt;

The Myriapoda, composed of millipedes and centipedes, is a fascinating but poorly understood branch of life, including species with a highly unusual body plan and a range of unique adaptations to their environment. Here, we sequenced and assembled 2 chromosomal-level genomes of the millipedes &lt;i&gt;Helicorthomorpha holstii&lt;/i&gt; (assembly size = 182 Mb; shortest scaffold/contig length needed to cover 50% of the genome [N50] = 18.11 Mb mainly on 8 pseudomolecules) and &lt;i&gt;Trigoniulus corallinus&lt;/i&gt; (assembly size = 449 Mb, N50 = 26.78 Mb mainly on 17 pseudomolecules). Unique genomic features, patterns of gene regulation, and defence systems in millipedes, not observed in other arthropods, are revealed. Both repeat content and intron size are major contributors to the observed differences in millipede genome size. Tight Hox and the first loose ecdysozoan ParaHox homeobox clusters are identified, and a myriapod-specific genomic rearrangement including &lt;i&gt;Hox3&lt;/i&gt; is also observed. The Argonaute (AGO) proteins for loading small RNAs are duplicated in both millipedes, but unlike in insects, an AGO duplicate has become a pseudogene. Evidence of post-transcriptional modification in small RNAs—including species-specific microRNA arm switching—providing differential gene regulation is also obtained. Millipedes possesses a unique ozadene defensive gland unlike the venomous forcipules found in centipedes. We identify sets of genes associated with the ozadene that play roles in chemical defence as well as antimicrobial activity. Macro-synteny analyses revealed highly conserved genomic blocks between the 2 millipedes and deuterostomes. Collectively, our analyses of millipede genomes reveal that a series of unique adaptations have occurred in this major lineage of arthropod diversity. The 2 high-quality millipede genomes provided here shed new light on the conserved and lineage-specific features of millipedes and centipedes. These findings demonstrate the importance of the consideration of both centipede and millipede genomes—and in particular the reconstruction of the myriapod ancestral situation—for future research to improve understanding of arthropod evolution, and animal evolutionary genomics more widely.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kaYcF_lVjGc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A stearoyl‐CoA desaturase inhibitor prevents multiple Parkinson's disease‐phenotypes in α‐synuclein mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25920?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25920?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) has useful symptomatic treatments that do not slow the neurodegenerative process, and no significant disease‐modifying treatments are approved. A key therapeutic target in PD is α‐synuclein (αS), which is both genetically implicated and accumulates in Lewy bodies rich in vesicles and other lipid membranes. Reestablishing αS homeostasis is a central goal in PD. Based on previous lipidomic analyses, we conducted a mouse trial of a stearoyl‐CoA desaturase (SCD) inhibitor (“5b”) that prevented αS‐positive vesicular inclusions and cytotoxicity in cultured human neurons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral dosing and brain activity of 5b were established in non‐tg mice. 5b in drinking water was given to mice expressing WT human αS (WT) or an amplified familial PD αS mutation [E35K+E46K+E61K (‘3K’)] beginning near the onset of nigral and cortical neurodegeneration and the robust PD‐like motor syndrome in 3K. Motor phenotypes, brain cytopathology and SCD‐related lipid changes were quantified in 5b‐ vs. placebo‐treated mice. Outcomes were compared to effects of crossing 3K to SCD1&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5b treatment reduced αS hyperphosphorylation in E46K‐expressing human neurons, in 3K neural cultures and in both WT and 3K αS mice. 5b prevented subtle gait deficits in WT αS mice and the PD‐like resting tremor and progressive motor decline of 3K αS mice. 5b also increased αS tetramers and reduced PK‐resistant lipid‐rich aggregates. Similar benefits accrued from genetically deleting one SCD allele, providing target validation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prolonged reduction of brain SCD activity prevented PD‐like neuropathology in multiple PD models. Thus, an orally available SCD inhibitor potently ameliorates PD phenotypes, positioning this approach to treat human α‐synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Remote Blood Biomarkers of Longitudinal Cognitive Outcomes in a Population Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25874?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25874?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longitudinal association of the blood biomarkers total tau (t‐tau), neurofilament light (Nf‐L), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) with common sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitive decline is not established.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a single molecule array technology, ultrasensitive immunoassays for serum concentrations of t‐tau, Nf‐L, and GFAP were measured in a population sample of 1,327 participants (60% African Americans and women) who had a clinical evaluation for AD, had completed in‐home cognitive assessments, and had undergone 1.5T structural magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher concentrations of serum biomarkers were associated with the development of clinical AD; especially, the time‐specific associations were notable: t‐tau 8 to 16 years, and Nf‐L and GFAP 4 to 8 years prior to clinical AD. Serum biomarkers were associated with faster cognitive decline over 16 years; baseline t‐tau &amp;gt; 0.40pg/ml had 30% faster decline, Nf‐L &amp;gt; 25.5pg/ml had 110% faster decline, and GFAP &amp;gt; 232pg/ml had 130% faster decline compared to those in the lowest quartile. Participants with baseline GFAP &amp;gt; 232pg/ml showed 160% faster decline in hippocampal volume compared to those with values &amp;lt; 160pg/ml. Additionally, higher baseline t‐tau was associated with faster increase in 3rd ventricular volume, and baseline Nf‐L and GFAP were associated with faster decline in cortical thickness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serum t‐tau, Nf‐L, and GFAP predict the development of sporadic AD and cognitive decline, and changes in structural brain characteristics, suggesting their usefulness not only as screening and predictive biomarkers, but also in capturing the pathogenesis of Alzheimer dementia.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Causal associations between modifiable risk factors and the Alzheimer’s phenome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25918?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25918?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To infer causal relationships between 22 previously reported risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and the “AD phenome”: AD, AD age of onset (AAOS), hippocampal volume, cortical surface area and thickness, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;, tau, and ptau&lt;sub&gt;181&lt;/sub&gt;, and the neuropathological burden of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and vascular brain injury (VBI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for the 22 risk factors were computed in 26,431 AD cases/controls and the association with AD was evaluated using logistic regression. Two‐sample Mendelian randomization was used to infer the causal effect of risk factors on the AD phenome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRS for increased education and diastolic blood pressure were associated with reduced risk for AD. MR indicated that only education was causally associated with reduced risk of AD, delayed AAOS, and increased cortical surface area and thickness. Total‐ and LDL‐cholesterol levels were causally associated with increased neuritic plaque burden, though the effects were driven by SNPs within the &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; locus. Diastolic blood pressure and pulse pressure are causally associated with increased risk of VBI. Furthermore, total cholesterol was associated with decreased hippocampal volume; smoking initiation with decreased cortical thickness; type 2 diabetes with an earlier AAOS; and sleep duration with increased cortical thickness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our comprehensive examination of the genetic evidence for the causal relationships between previously reported risk factors in AD using PRS and MR, supports a causal role for education, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking, and diabetes with the AD phenome.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Astrocytes—The Ultimate Effectors of Long-Range Neuromodulatory Networks?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.581075</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.581075</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It was long thought that astrocytes, given their lack of electrical signaling, were not involved in communication with neurons. However, we now know that one astrocyte on average maintains and regulates the extracellular neurotransmitter and potassium levels of more than 140,000 synapses, both excitatory and inhibitory, within their individual domains, and form a syncytium that can propagate calcium waves to affect distant cells via release of “gliotransmitters” such as glutamate, ATP, or adenosine. Neuromodulators can affect signal-to-noise and frequency transmission within cortical circuits by effects on inhibition, allowing for the filtering of relevant vs. irrelevant stimuli. Moreover, synchronized “resting” and desynchronized “activated” brain states are gated by short bursts of high-frequency neuromodulatory activity, highlighting the need for neuromodulation that is robust, rapid, and far-reaching. As many neuromodulators are released in a volume manner where degradation/uptake and the confines of the complex CNS limit diffusion distance, we ask the question—are astrocytes responsible for rapidly extending neuromodulator actions to every synapse? Neuromodulators are known to influence transitions between brain states, leading to control over plasticity, responses to salient stimuli, wakefulness, and sleep. These rapid and wide-spread state transitions demand that neuromodulators can simultaneously influence large and diverse regions in a manner that should be impossible given the limitations of simple diffusion. Intriguingly, astrocytes are ideally situated to amplify/extend neuromodulator effects over large populations of synapses given that each astrocyte can: (1) ensheath a large number of synapses; (2) release gliotransmitters (glutamate/ATP/adenosine) known to affect inhibition; (3) regulate extracellular potassium that can affect excitability and excitation/inhibition balance; and (4) express receptors for all neuromodulators. In this review article, we explore the hypothesis that astrocytes extend and amplify neuromodulatory influences on neuronal networks via alterations in calcium dynamics, the release of gliotransmitters, and potassium homeostasis. Given that neuromodulatory networks are at the core of our sleep-wake cycle and behavioral states, and determine how we interact with our environment, this review article highlights the importance of basic astrocyte function in homeostasis, general cognition, and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: A Computational Model Integrating Multiple Phenomena on Cued Fear Conditioning, Extinction, and Reinstatement</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.569108</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.569108</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Conditioning, extinction, and reinstatement are fundamental learning processes of animal adaptation, also strongly involved in human pathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and dependencies. Cued fear conditioning, extinction, restatement, and systematic manipulations of the underlying brain amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex, represent key experimental paradigms to study such processes. Numerous empirical studies have revealed several aspects and the neural systems and plasticity underlying them, but at the moment we lack a comprehensive view. Here we propose a computational model based on firing rate leaky units that contributes to such integration by accounting for 25 different experiments on fear conditioning, extinction, and restatement, on the basis of a single neural architecture having a structure and plasticity grounded in known brain biology. This allows the model to furnish three novel contributions to understand these open issues: (a) the functioning of the central and lateral amygdala system supporting conditioning; (b) the role played by the endocannabinoids system in within- and between-session extinction; (c) the formation of three important types of neurons underlying fear processing, namely fear, extinction, and persistent neurons. The model integration of the results on fear conditioning goes substantially beyond what was done in previous models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: SeSBAT: Single Subject Brain Analysis Toolbox. Application to Huntington’s Disease as a Preliminary Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.488652</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.488652</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers require complex processing routines that are time-consuming and labor-intensive for clinical users. The Single Subject Brain Analysis Toolbox (SeSBAT) is a fully automated MATLAB toolbox with a graphical user interface (GUI) that offers standardized and optimized protocols for the pre-processing and analysis of anatomical MRI data at the single-subject level. In this study, the two-fold strategy provided by SeSBAT is illustrated through its application on a cohort of 42 patients with Huntington’s disease (HD), in pre-manifest and early manifest stages, as a suitable model of neurodegenerative processes. On the one hand, hypothesis-driven analysis can be used to extract biomarkers of neurodegeneration in specific brain regions of interest (ROI-based analysis). On the other hand, an exploratory voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach can detect volume changes due to neurodegeneration throughout the whole brain (whole-brain analysis). That illustration reveals the potential of SeSBAT in providing potential prognostic biomarkers in neurodegenerative processes in clinics, which could be critical to overcoming the limitations of current qualitative evaluation strategies, and thus improve the diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, the importance of the availability of tools for characterization at the single-subject level has been emphasized, as there is high interindividual variability in the pattern of neurodegeneration. Thus, tools like SeSBAT could pave the way towards more effective and personalized medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Detection of Synaptic Proteins in Microglia by Flow Cytometry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00149</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence indicates that microglia actively remove synapses in vivo, thereby playing a key role in synaptic refinement and modulation of brain connectivity. This phenomenon was mainly investigated in immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. However, a quantification of synaptic material in microglia using these techniques is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we aimed to quantify synaptic proteins in microglia using flow cytometry. With this approach, we first showed that microglia from the healthy adult mouse brain contain a detectable level of VGLUT1 protein. Next, we found more than two-fold increased VGLUT1 immunoreactivity in microglia from the developing brain (P15) as compared to adult microglia. These data indicate that microglia-mediated synaptic pruning mostly occurs during the brain developmental period. We then quantified the VGLUT1 staining in microglia in two transgenic models characterized by pathological microglia-mediated synaptic pruning. In the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) microglia exhibited a significant increase in VGLUT1 immunoreactivity before the onset of amyloid pathology. Moreover, conditional deletion of TDP-43 in microglia, which causes a hyper-phagocytic phenotype associated with synaptic loss, also resulted in increased VGLUT1 immunoreactivity within microglia. This work provides a quantitative assessment of synaptic proteins in microglia, under homeostasis, and in mouse models of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Effects of Retinal Transcription Regulation After GB20 Needling Treatment in Retina With Optic Neuritis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.568449</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Optic neuritis (ON) is one of the most frequent symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) that results in progressive loss of axons and neurons. In clinical trials of Traditional Chinese Medicine, needling at the GB20 acupoint has been widely used for the treatment of ocular diseases, including ON. However, the molecular mechanisms of needling at this site are still unclear. In this study, we generated an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model and investigated the effects of needling treatment at the GB20 acupoint on retina with EAE-associated ON. RNA sequencing of the retinal transcriptome revealed that, of the 234 differentially expressed genes induced by ON, 100 genes were upregulated, and 134 genes were downregulated by ON, while needling at the GB20 acupoint specifically reversed the expression of 21 genes compared with control treatment at GV16 acupoint. Among the reversed genes, Nr4a3, Sncg, Uchl1, and Tppp3 were involved in axon development and regeneration and were downregulated by ON, indicating the beneficial effect of needling at GB20. Further gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that needling at GB20 affected the molecular process of Circadian rhythm in mouse retina with ON. Our study first reported that needling treatment after ON at the GB20 acupoint regulated gene expression of the retina and reversed the expression of downregulated axon development-related genes. This study also demonstrated that GV16 was a perfect control treatment site for GB20 in animal research. Our study provided a scientific basis for needling treatments at GB20 for ocular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Serum Neurofilament Levels in Children With Febrile Seizures and in Controls</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Neuroaxonal damage is reflected by serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) values in a variety of acute and degenerative diseases of the brain. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of febrile and epileptic seizures on sNfL, serum copeptin, and prolactin levels in children compared with children with febrile infections without convulsions.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A prospective cross-sectional study was performed in children aging 6 months to 5 years presenting with fever (controls, n = 61), febrile seizures (FS, n = 78), or epileptic seizures (ES, n = 16) at our emergency department. sNfL, copeptin, and prolactin were measured within a few hours after the event in addition to standard clinical, neurophysiological, and laboratory assessment. All children were followed up for at least 1 year after presentation concerning recurrent seizures.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Serum copeptin values were on average 4.1-fold higher in FS and 3.2-fold higher in ES compared with controls (both p &amp;lt; 0.01). Serum prolactin values were on average 1.3-fold higher in FS compared with controls ( p &amp;lt; 0.01) and without difference between ES and controls. There was no significant difference of mean sNfL values (95% CI) between all three groups, FS 21.7 pg/ml (19.6–23.9), ES 17.7 pg/ml (13.8–21.6), and controls 23.4 pg/ml (19.2–27.4). In multivariable analysis, age was the most important predictor of sNfL, followed by sex and C reactive protein. Neither the duration of seizures nor the time elapsed from seizure onset to blood sampling had an impact on sNfL. None of the three biomarkers were related to recurrent seizures.&lt;/p&gt;Significance&lt;p&gt;Serum neurofilament light is not elevated during short recovery time after FS when compared with children presenting febrile infections without seizures. We demonstrate an age-dependent decrease of sNfL from early childhood until school age. In contrast to sNfL levels, copeptin and prolactin serum levels are elevated after FS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Effective and Accurate Diagnosis of Subjective Cognitive Decline Based on Functional Connection and Graph Theory View</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is considered the earliest preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that precedes mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Effective and accurate diagnosis of SCD is crucial for early detection of and timely intervention in AD. In this study, brain functional connectome (i.e., functional connections and graph theory metrics) based on the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provided multiple information about brain networks and has been used to distinguish individuals with SCD from normal controls (NCs). The consensus connections and the discriminative nodal graph metrics selected by group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) mainly distributed in the prefrontal and frontal cortices and the subcortical regions corresponded to default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal task control network. Nodal efficiency and nodal shortest path showed the most significant discriminative ability among the selected nodal graph metrics. Furthermore, the comparison results of topological attributes suggested that the brain network integration function was weakened and network segregation function was enhanced in SCD patients. Moreover, the combination of brain connectome information based on multiple kernel-support vector machine (MK-SVM) achieved the best classification performance with 83.33% accuracy, 90.00% sensitivity, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.927. The findings of this study provided a new perspective to combine machine learning methods with exploration of brain pathophysiological mechanisms in SCD and offered potential neuroimaging biomarkers for diagnosis of early-stage AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Effects of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K Signaling Pathway Regulation on Neuron Remodeling Caused by Translocation Repair</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve injury repair has been considered a difficult problem in the field of trauma for a long time. Conventional surgical methods are not applicable in some special types of nerve injury, prompting scholars to seek to develop more effective nerve translocation repair technologies. The purpose of this study was to explore the functional state of neurons in injured lower limbs after translocation repair, with a view to preliminarily clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Eighteen Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into the normal, tibial nerve in situ repair, and common peroneal nerve transposition repair tibial nerve groups. Nerve function assessment and immunohistochemical staining of neurofilament 200 (NF-200), protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) in the dorsal root ganglia were performed at 12 weeks after surgery. Tibial nerve function and neuroelectrophysiological analysis, osmic acid staining, muscle strength testing, and muscle fiber staining showed that the nerve translocation repair could restore the function of the recipient nerve to a certain extent; however, the repair was not as efficient as the in situ repair. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the translocation repair resulted in changes in the microstructure of neuronal cell bodies, and the expressions of Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K in the three dorsal root ganglia groups were significantly different (p &amp;lt; 0.05). This study demonstrates that the nerve translocation repair technology sets up a new reflex loop, with the corresponding neuroskeletal adjustments, in which, donor neurons dominate the recipient nerves. This indicates that nerve translocation repair technology can lead to neuronal remodeling and is important as a supplementary treatment for a peripheral nerve injury. Furthermore, the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway may be involved in the formation of the new neural reflex loop created as a result of the translocation repair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: White Matter Microstructure Changes and Cognitive Impairment in the Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment is a well-defined complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the neural mechanisms are largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;The study aimed to assess white matter (WM) microstructure changes and their relationship with cognitive impairment development during CKD progression.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets were acquired from 38 patients with CKD (19 patients were at stage 3; 19 patients were at stage 4) and 22 healthy controls (HCs). Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was implemented to assess the differences in WM integrity among the three groups. The associations between abnormal WM integrity and clinical indicators (digit symbol test scores, the type A number connection test scores, hemoglobin, serum urea, serum creatinine, serum calcium, and serum potassium levels) were also computed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with patients with CKD at stage 3 and HCs, patients with CKD at stage 4 showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity (MD) in the corpus callosum (CC), anterior thalamic radiation, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Correlation analysis showed that the MD in the genu of CC was negatively associated with the digit symbol test scores (r = -0.61, p = 0.01), and the FA in the left anterior thalamic radiation was positively associated with the level of serum calcium (r = 0.58, p = 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Patients with non-end-stage CKD have multiple abnormalities in WM regions. DTI metrics change with the progression of CKD and are primarily associated with cognitive impairment. The reduced integrity of WM tracts may be related to a low level of blood calcium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Perspective: Phase Amplitude Coupling–Based Phase–Dependent Neuromodulation in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective surgical therapy for Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, limitations of the DBS systems have led to great interest in adaptive neuromodulation systems that can dynamically adjust stimulation parameters to meet concurrent therapeutic demand. Constant high-frequency motor cortex stimulation has not been remarkably efficacious, which has led to greater focus on modulation of subcortical targets. Understanding of the importance of timing in both cortical and subcortical stimulation has generated an interest in developing more refined, parsimonious stimulation techniques based on critical oscillatory activities of the brain. Concurrently, much effort has been put into identifying biomarkers of both parkinsonian and physiological patterns of neuronal activities to drive next generation of adaptive brain stimulation systems. One such biomarker is beta-gamma phase amplitude coupling (PAC) that is detected in the motor cortex. PAC is strongly correlated with parkinsonian specific motor signs and symptoms and respond to therapies in a dose-dependent manner. PAC may represent the overall state of the parkinsonian motor network and have less instantaneously dynamic fluctuation during movement. These findings raise the possibility of novel neuromodulation paradigms that are potentially less invasiveness than DBS. Successful application of PAC in neuromodulation may necessitate phase-dependent stimulation technique, which aims to deliver precisely timed stimulation pulses to a specific phase to predictably modulate to selectively modulate pathological network activities and behavior in real time. Overcoming current technical challenges can lead to deeper understanding of the parkinsonian pathophysiology and development of novel neuromodulatory therapies with potentially less side-effects and higher therapeutic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The simultaneous transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a unique opportunity to non-invasively stimulate brain circuits while simultaneously monitoring changes in brain activity. However, to take advantage of this multimodal technique, some technical issues need to be considered/addressed. In this work, we evaluated technical issues associated with the setup and utilization of this multimodal tool, such as the use of a large single-channel radio frequency (rf) coil, and the artifacts induced by TMS when interleaved with the echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence. We demonstrated that good image quality can be achieved with this rf coil and that the adoption of axial imaging orientation in conjunction with a safe interval of 100 ms, between the TMS pulse and imaging acquisition, is a suitable combination to eliminate potential image artifacts when using the combined TMS-fMRI technique in 3-T MRI scanners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Electroacupuncture Promoted Nerve Repair After Peripheral Nerve Injury by Regulating miR-1b and Its Target Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence indicates that electroacupuncture (EA) has a definite effect on the treatment of peripheral nerve injury (PNI), but its mechanism is not completely clear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes, and EA may enhance PNI repair by regulating miRNAs. In this study, the rat sciatic nerve injury model was treated with EA for 4 weeks. Acupoints Huantiao (GB30) and Zusanli (ST36) were stimulated by EA 20 min once a day, 6 days a week for 4 weeks. We found that EA treatment downregulated the expression of miR-1b in the local injured nerve. In vitro experiments showed that overexpression of miR-1b inhibited the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rat Schwann cell (SC) line, while BDNF knockdown inhibited the proliferation, migration, and promoted apoptosis of SCs. Subsequently, the rat model of sciatic nerve injury was treated by EA treatment and injection of agomir-1b or antagomir-1b. The nerve conduction velocity ratio (NCV), sciatic functional index (SFI), and S100 immunofluorescence staining were examined and showed that compared with the model group, NCV, SFI, proliferation of SC, and expression of BDNF in the injured nerves of rats treated with EA or EA + anti-miR-1b were elevated, while EA + miR-1b was reduced, indicating that EA promoted sciatic nerve function recovery and SC proliferation through downregulating miR-1b. To summarize, EA may promote the proliferation, migration of SC, and nerve repair after PNI by regulating miR-1b, which targets BDNF.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
