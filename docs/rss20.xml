	<description>&lt;p&gt;Networks of randomly connected neurons are among the most popular models in
theoretical neuroscience. The connectivity between neurons in the cortex is
however not fully random, the simplest and most prominent deviation from
randomness found in experimental data being the overrepresentation of
bidirectional connections among pyramidal cells. Using numerical and analytical
methods, we investigated the effects of partially symmetric connectivity on
dynamics in networks of rate units. We considered the two dynamical regimes
exhibited by random neural networks: the weak-coupling regime, where the firing
activity decays to a single fixed point unless the network is stimulated, and
the strong-coupling or chaotic regime, characterized by internally generated
fluctuating firing rates. In the weak-coupling regime, we computed analytically
for an arbitrary degree of symmetry the auto-correlation of network activity in
presence of external noise. In the chaotic regime, we performed simulations to
determine the timescale of the intrinsic fluctuations. In both cases, symmetry
increases the characteristic asymptotic decay time of the autocorrelation
function and therefore slows down the dynamics in the network.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Temporal lobe surgical resection brings seizure remission in up to 80% of
patients, with long-term complete seizure freedom in 41%. However, it is
unclear how surgery impacts on the structural white matter network, and how the
network changes relate to seizure outcome. We used white matter fibre
tractography on preoperative diffusion MRI to generate a structural white
matter network, and postoperative T1-weighted MRI to retrospectively infer the
impact of surgical resection on this network. We then applied graph theory and
machine learning to investigate the properties of change between the
preoperative and predicted postoperative networks. Temporal lobe surgery had a
modest impact on global network efficiency, despite the disruption caused. This
was due to alternative shortest paths in the network leading to widespread
increases in betweenness centrality post-surgery. Measurements of network
change could retrospectively predict seizure outcomes with 79% accuracy and 65%
specificity, which is twice as high as the empirical distribution. Fifteen
connections which changed due to surgery were identified as useful for
prediction of outcome, eight of which connected to the ipsilateral temporal
pole. Our results suggest that the use of network change metrics may have
clinical value for predicting seizure outcome. This approach could be used to
prospectively predict outcomes given a suggested resection mask using
preoperative data only.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a matrix-factorization algorithm that scales to input matrices
with both huge number of rows and columns. Learned factors may be sparse or
dense and/or non-negative, which makes our algorithm suitable for dictionary
learning, sparse component analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization. Our
algorithm streams matrix columns while subsampling them to iteratively learn
the matrix factors. At each iteration, the row dimension of a new sample is
reduced by subsampling, resulting in lower time complexity compared to a simple
streaming algorithm. Our method comes with convergence guarantees to reach a
stationary point of the matrix-factorization problem. We demonstrate its
efficiency on massive functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data (2 TB), and on
patches extracted from hyperspectral images (103 GB). For both problems, which
involve different penalties on rows and columns, we obtain significant
speed-ups compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a practical approach to addressing limitations posed by
use of single active electrodes in applications for sleep stage classification.
Electroencephalography (EEG)-based characterizations of sleep stage progression
contribute the diagnosis and monitoring of the many pathologies of sleep.
Several prior reports have explored ways of automating the analysis of sleep
EEG and of reducing the complexity of the data needed for reliable
discrimination of sleep stages in order to make it possible to perform sleep
studies at lower cost in the home (rather than only in specialized clinical
facilities). However, these reports have involved recordings from electrodes
placed on the cranial vertex or occiput, which can be uncomfortable or
difficult for subjects to position. Those that have utilized single EEG
channels which contain less sleep information, have showed poor classification
performance. We have taken advantage of Rectifier Neural Network for feature
detection and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequential data
learning to optimize classification performance with single electrode
recordings. After exploring alternative electrode placements, we found a
comfortable configuration of a single-channel EEG on the forehead and have
shown that it can be integrated with additional electrodes for simultaneous
recording of the electroocuolgram (EOG). Evaluation of data from 62 people
(with 494 hours sleep) demonstrated better performance of our analytical
algorithm for automated sleep classification than existing approaches using
vertex or occipital electrode placements. Use of this recording configuration
with neural network deconvolution promises to make clinically indicated home
sleep studies practical.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Clinical Facts Along With a Feedback Control Perspective Suggest That Increased Response Time Might be the Cause of Parkinsonian Rest Tremor. (arXiv:1403.0296v3 [q-bio.QM] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
increased response times leading to a variety of biomechanical symptoms such as
tremors, stooping and gait instability. Although the deterioration in
biomechanical control can intuitively be related to sluggish response times,
how the delay leads to such biomechanical symptoms as tremor is not yet
understood. Only recently has it been explained from the perspective of
feedback control theory that delay beyond a threshold can be the cause of
Parkinsonian tremor [1]. This paper correlates several observations from this
perspective to clinical facts and reinforces them with simple numerical and
experimental examples. This work provides a framework towards developing a
deeper conceptual understanding of the mechanism behind PD symptoms.
Furthermore, it lays a foundation for developing tools for diagnosis and
progress tracking of the disease by identifying some key trends.

OpenMM is a molecular dynamics simulation toolkit with a unique focus on extensibility. It allows users to easily add new features, including forces with novel functional forms, new integration algorithms, and new simulation protocols. Those features automatically work on all supported hardware types (including both CPUs and GPUs) and perform well on all of them. In many cases they require minimal coding, just a mathematical description of the desired function. They also require no modification to OpenMM itself and can be distributed independently of OpenMM. This makes it an ideal tool for researchers developing new simulation methods, and also allows those new methods to be immediately available to the larger community.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2d0q0lhNXr0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Trade or sharing that moves infectious planting material between farms can, for vertically-transmitted plant diseases, act as a significant force for dispersal of pathogens, particularly where the extent of material movement may be greater than that of infected vectors or inoculum. The network over which trade occurs will then effect dispersal, and is important to consider when attempting to control the disease. We consider the difference that planting material exchange can make to successful control of cassava brown streak disease, an important viral disease affecting one of Africa's staple crops. We use a mathematical model of smallholders’ fields to determine the effect of informal trade on both the spread of the pathogen and its control using clean-seed systems, determining aspects that could limit the damage caused by the disease. In particular, we identify the potentially detrimental effects of markets, and the benefits of a community-based approach to disease control.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3-AOPyaPHvI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The perceptual representation of individual faces is often explained with reference to a norm-based face space. In such spaces, individuals are encoded as vectors where identity is primarily conveyed by direction and distinctiveness by eccentricity. Here we measured human fMRI responses and psychophysical similarity judgments of individual face exemplars, which were generated as realistic 3D animations using a computer-graphics model. We developed and evaluated multiple neurobiologically plausible computational models, each of which predicts a representational distance matrix and a regional-mean activation profile for 24 face stimuli. In the fusiform face area, a face-space coding model with sigmoidal ramp tuning provided a better account of the data than one based on exemplar tuning. However, an image-processing model with weighted banks of Gabor filters performed similarly. Accounting for the data required the inclusion of a measurement-level population averaging mechanism that approximates how fMRI voxels locally average distinct neuronal tunings. Our study demonstrates the importance of comparing multiple models and of modeling the measurement process in computational neuroimaging.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SUiQg1Y4lJ4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Test of the Stereausis Hypothesis for Sound Localization in Mammals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7278?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7278?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The relative arrival times of sounds at both ears constitute an important cue for localization of low-frequency sounds in the horizontal plane. The binaural neurons of the medial superior olive (MSO) act as coincidence detectors that fire when inputs from both ears arrive near simultaneously. Each principal neuron in the MSO is tuned to its own best interaural time difference (ITD), indicating the presence of an internal delay, a difference in the travel times from either ear to the MSO. According to the stereausis hypothesis, differences in wave propagation along the cochlea could provide the delays necessary for coincidence detection if the ipsilateral and contralateral inputs originated from different cochlear positions, with different frequency tuning. We therefore investigated the relation between interaural mismatches in frequency tuning and ITD tuning during &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; loose-patch (juxtacellular) recordings from principal neurons of the MSO of anesthetized female gerbils. Cochlear delays can be bypassed by directly stimulating the auditory nerve; in agreement with the stereausis hypothesis, tuning for timing differences during bilateral electrical stimulation of the round windows differed markedly from ITD tuning in the same cells. Moreover, some neurons showed a frequency tuning mismatch that was sufficiently large to have a potential impact on ITD tuning. However, we did not find a correlation between frequency tuning mismatches and best ITDs. Our data thus suggest that axonal delays dominate ITD tuning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neurons in the medial superior olive (MSO) play a unique role in sound localization because of their ability to compare the relative arrival time of low-frequency sounds at both ears. They fire maximally when the difference in sound arrival time exactly compensates for the internal delay: the difference in travel time from either ear to the MSO neuron. We tested whether differences in cochlear delay systematically contribute to the total travel time by comparing for individual MSO neurons the best difference in arrival times, as predicted from the frequency tuning for either ear, and the actual best difference. No systematic relation was observed, emphasizing the dominant contribution of axonal delays to the internal delay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Data-Driven Extraction of a Nested Model of Human Brain Function</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Decades of cognitive neuroscience research have revealed two basic facts regarding task-driven brain activation patterns. First, distinct patterns of activation occur in response to different task demands. Second, a superordinate, dichotomous pattern of activation/deactivation, is common across a variety of task demands. We explore the possibility that a hierarchical model incorporates these two observed brain activation phenomena into a unifying framework. We apply a latent variable approach, exploratory bifactor analysis, to a large set of human (both sexes) brain activation maps (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 108) encompassing cognition, perception, action, and emotion behavioral domains, to determine the potential existence of a nested structure of factors that underlie a variety of commonly observed activation patterns. We find that a general factor, associated with a superordinate brain activation/deactivation pattern, explained the majority of the variance (52.37%) in brain activation patterns. The bifactor analysis also revealed several subfactors that explained an additional 31.02% of variance in brain activation patterns, associated with different manifestations of the superordinate brain activation/deactivation pattern, each emphasizing different contexts in which the task demands occurred. Importantly, this nested factor structure provided better overall fit to the data compared with a non-nested factor structure model. These results point to a domain-general psychological process, representing a &quot;focused awareness&quot; process or &quot;attentional episode&quot; that is variously manifested according to the sensory modality of the stimulus and degree of cognitive processing. This novel model provides the basis for constructing a biologically informed, data-driven taxonomy of psychological processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A crucial step in identifying how the brain supports various psychological processes is a well-defined categorization or taxonomy of psychological processes and their interrelationships. We hypothesized that a nested structure of cognitive function, in terms of a canonical domain-general cognitive process, and various subfactors representing different manifestations of the canonical process, is a fundamental organization of human cognition, and we tested this hypothesis using fMRI task-activation patterns. Using a data-driven latent-variable approach, we demonstrate that a nested factor structure underlies a large sample of brain activation patterns across a variety of task domains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Extracellular Zn2+ Is Essential for Amyloid {beta}1-42-Induced Cognitive Decline in the Normal Brain and Its Rescue</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; accumulation is considered an upstream event in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, accumulating evidence indicates that other neurochemical changes potentiate the toxicity of this constitutively generated peptide. Here we report that the interaction of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; with extracellular Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is essential for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; rapid uptake of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into dentate granule cells in the normal rat hippocampus. The uptake of both Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was blocked by CaEDTA, an extracellular Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; chelator, and by Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, a metal that displaces Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; for Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; binding. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; perforant pathway LTP was unaffected by perfusion with 1000 nm Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; in ACSF without Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. However, LTP was attenuated under preperfusion with 5 nm Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; in ACSF containing 10 nm Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, recapitulating the concentration of extracellular Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, but not with 5 nm Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; in ACSF containing 10 nm Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; were not taken up into dentate granule cells under these conditions, consistent with lower affinity of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; for Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; than Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;. Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;-induced attenuation of LTP was rescued by both CaEDTA and CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and was observed even with 500 pm Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;. Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; injected into the dentate granule cell layer of rats induced a rapid memory disturbance that was also rescued by coinjection of CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The present study supports blocking the formation of Zn-Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; in the extracellular compartment as an effective preventive strategy for Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Short-term memory loss occurs in normal elderly and increases in the predementia stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-β&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; (Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;), a possible causing peptide in AD, is bound to Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the extracellular compartment in the hippocampus induced short-term memory loss in the normal rat brain, suggesting that extracellular Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is essential for Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;-induced short-term memory loss. The evidence is important to find an effective preventive strategy for AD, which is blocking the formation of Zn-Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; in the extracellular compartment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Experience-Dependent Plasticity in Accessory Olfactory Bulb Interneurons following Male-Male Social Interaction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7240?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chemosensory information processing in the mouse accessory olfactory system guides the expression of social behavior. After salient chemosensory encounters, the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) experiences changes in the balance of excitation and inhibition at reciprocal synapses between mitral cells (MCs) and local interneurons. The mechanisms underlying these changes remain controversial. Moreover, it remains unclear whether MC–interneuron plasticity is unique to specific behaviors, such as mating, or whether it is a more general feature of the AOB circuit. Here, we describe targeted electrophysiological studies of AOB inhibitory internal granule cells (IGCs), many of which upregulate the immediate-early gene &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt; after male–male social experience. Following the resident–intruder paradigm, &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt;-expressing IGCs in acute AOB slices from resident males displayed stronger excitation than nonexpressing neighbors when sensory inputs were stimulated. The increased excitability of &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt;-expressing IGCs was not correlated with changes in the strength or number of excitatory synapses with MCs but was instead associated with increased intrinsic excitability and decreased HCN channel-mediated &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; currents. Consistent with increased inhibition by IGCs, MCs responded to sensory input stimulation with decreased depolarization and spiking following resident–intruder encounters. These results reveal that nonmating behaviors drive AOB inhibitory plasticity and indicate that increased MC inhibition involves intrinsic excitability changes in &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt;-expressing interneurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) is a site of experience-dependent plasticity between excitatory mitral cells (MCs) and inhibitory internal granule cells (IGCs), but the physiological mechanisms and behavioral conditions driving this plasticity remain unclear. Here, we report studies of AOB neuronal plasticity following male–male social chemosensory encounters. We show that the plasticity-associated immediate-early gene &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt; is selectively expressed in IGCs from resident males following the resident–intruder assay. After behavior, &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt;-expressing IGCs are more strongly excited by sensory input stimulation and MC activation is suppressed. &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt;-expressing IGCs do not show increased excitatory synaptic drive but instead show increased intrinsic excitability. These data indicate that MC–IGC plasticity is induced after male–male social chemosensory encounters, resulting in enhanced MC suppression by &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt;-expressing IGCs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: State-Dependent TMS Reveals Representation of Affective Body Movements in the Anterior Intraparietal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7231?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In humans, recognition of others' actions involves a cortical network that comprises, among other cortical regions, the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), where biological motion is coded and the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), where movement information is elaborated in terms of meaningful goal-directed actions. This action observation system (AOS) is thought to encode neutral voluntary actions, and possibly some aspects of affective motor repertoire, but the role of the AOS' areas in processing affective kinematic information has never been examined. Here we investigated whether the AOS plays a role in representing dynamic emotional bodily expressions. In the first experiment, we assessed behavioral adaptation effects of observed affective movements. Participants watched series of happy or fearful whole-body point-light displays (PLDs) as adapters and were then asked to perform an explicit categorization of the emotion expressed in test PLDs. Participants were slower when categorizing any of the two emotions as long as it was congruent with the emotion in the adapter sequence. We interpreted this effect as adaptation to the emotional content of PLDs. In the second experiment, we combined this paradigm with TMS applied over either the right aIPS, pSTS, and the right half of the occipital pole (corresponding to Brodmann's area 17 and serving as control) to examine the neural locus of the adaptation effect. TMS over the aIPS (but not over the other sites) reversed the behavioral cost of adaptation, specifically for fearful contents. This demonstrates that aIPS contains an explicit representation of affective body movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In humans, a network of areas, the action observation system, encodes voluntary actions. However, the role of these brain regions in processing affective kinematic information has not been investigated. Here we demonstrate that the aIPS contains a representation of affective body movements. First, in a behavioral experiment, we found an adaptation after-effect for emotional PLDs, indicating the existence of a neural representation selective for affective information in biological motion. To examine the neural locus of this effect, we then combined the adaptation paradigm with TMS. Stimulation of the aIPS (but not over pSTS and control site) reversed the behavioral cost of adaptation, specifically for fearful contents, demonstrating that aIPS contains a representation of affective body movements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Triple-Flash Illusion Reveals a Driving Role of Alpha-Band Reverberations in Visual Perception</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7219?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7219?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The modulatory role of spontaneous brain oscillations on perception of threshold-level stimuli is well established. Here, we provide evidence that alpha-band (~10 Hz) oscillations not only modulate perception of threshold-level sensory inputs but also can drive perception and generate percepts without a physical stimulus being present. We used the &quot;triple-flash&quot; illusion: Occasional perception of three flashes when only two spatially coincident veridical ones, separated by ~100 ms, are presented. The illusion was proposed to result from superposition of two hypothetical oscillatory impulse response functions generated in response to each flash: When the delay between flashes matches the period of the oscillation, the superposition enhances a later part of the oscillation that is normally damped; when this enhancement crosses perceptual threshold, a third flash is erroneously perceived (Bowen, 1989). In Experiment 1, we varied stimulus onset asynchrony and validated Bowen's theory: The optimal stimulus onset asynchrony for illusion to occur was correlated, across human subjects (both genders), with the subject-specific impulse response function period determined from a separate EEG experiment. Experiment 2 revealed that prestimulus parietal, but no occipital, alpha EEG phase and power, as well as poststimulus alpha phase-locking, together determine the occurrence of the illusion on a trial-by-trial basis. Thus, oscillatory reverberations create something out of nothing: A third flash where there are only two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We highlight a novel property of alpha-band (~10 Hz) oscillations based on three experiments (two EEG and one psychophysics) by demonstrating that alpha-band oscillations do not merely modulate perception, but can also drive perception. We show that human participants report seeing a third flash when only two are presented (the &quot;triple-flash&quot; illusion) most often when the interflash delay matches the period of participant's oscillatory impulse response function reverberating in alpha. Within-subject, the phase and power of ongoing parietal, but not occipital, alpha-band oscillations at the time of the first flash determine illusory percept on a trial-by-trial basis. We revealed a physiologically plausible mechanism that validates and extends the original theoretical account of the triple-flash illusion proposed by Bowen in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Behavioral Consequences of a Bifacial Map in the Mouse Somatosensory Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The whisker system is an important sensory organ with extensive neural representations in the brain of the mouse. Patterned neural modules (barrelettes) in the ipsilateral principal sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (PrV) correspond to the whiskers. Axons of the PrV barrelette neurons cross the midline and confer the whisker-related patterning to the contralateral ventroposteromedial nucleus of the thalamus, and subsequently to the cortex. In this way, specific neural modules called barreloids and barrels in the contralateral thalamus and cortex represent each whisker. Partial midline crossing of the PrV axons, in a conditional Robo3 mutant (&lt;i&gt;Robo3&lt;sup&gt;R3–5&lt;/sup&gt;cKO&lt;/i&gt;) mouse line, leads to the formation of bilateral whisker maps in the ventroposteromedial, as well as the barrel cortex. We used voltage-sensitive dye optical imaging and somatosensory and motor behavioral tests to characterize the consequences of bifacial maps in the thalamocortical system. Voltage-sensitive dye optical imaging verified functional, bilateral whisker representation in the barrel cortex and activation of distinct cortical loci following ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation of the specific whiskers. The mutant animals were comparable with the control animals in sensorimotor tests. However, they showed noticeable deficits in all of the whisker-dependent or -related tests, including Y-maze exploration, horizontal surface approach, bridge crossing, gap crossing, texture discrimination, floating in water, and whisking laterality. Our results indicate that bifacial maps along the thalamocortical system do not offer a functional advantage. Instead, they lead to impairments, possibly due to the smaller size of the whisker-related modules and interference between the ipsilateral and contralateral whisker representations in the same thalamus and cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The whisker sensory system plays a quintessentially important role in exploratory behavior of mice and other nocturnal rodents. Here, we studied a novel mutant mouse line, in which the projections from the brainstem to the thalamus are disrupted. This led to formation of bilateral whisker maps in both the thalamus and the cortex. The two whisker maps crowd in a space normally devoted to the contralateral map alone and in a nonoverlapping fashion. Stimulation of the whiskers on either side activates the corresponding region of the map. Mice with bilateral whisker maps perform well in general sensorimotor tasks but show poor performance in specific tests that require whisker-dependent tactile discrimination. These observations indicate that contralateral, instead of bilateral, representation of the sensory space plays a critical role in acuity and fine discrimination during somesthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Diverse Roads to Relapse: A Discriminative Cue Signaling Cocaine Availability Is More Effective in Renewing Cocaine Seeking in Goal Trackers Than Sign Trackers and Depends on Basal Forebrain Cholinergic Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7198?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7198?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stimuli associated with taking drugs are notorious instigators of relapse. There is, however, considerable variation in the motivational properties of such stimuli, both as a function of the individual and the nature of the stimulus. The behavior of some individuals (sign trackers, STs) is especially influenced by cues paired with reward delivery, perhaps because they are prone to process information via dopamine-dependent, cue-driven, incentive salience systems. Other individuals (goal trackers, GTs) are better able to incorporate higher-order contextual information, perhaps because of better executive/attentional control over behavior, which requires frontal cortical cholinergic activity. We hypothesized, therefore, that a cue that &quot;sets the occasion&quot; for drug taking (a discriminative stimulus, DS) would reinstate cocaine seeking more readily in GTs than STs and that this would require intact cholinergic neurotransmission. To test this, male STs and GTs were trained to self-administer cocaine using an intermittent access schedule with periods of cocaine availability and unavailability signaled by a DS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and a DS&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Thereafter, half of the rats received an immunotoxic lesion that destroyed 40–50% of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and later, after extinction training, were tested for the ability of noncontingent presentations of the DS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to reinstate cocaine seeking behavior. The DS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was much more effective in reinstating cocaine seeking in GTs than STs and this effect was abolished by cholinergic losses despite the fact that all rats continued to orient to the DS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. We conclude that vulnerability to relapse involves interactions between individual cognitive–motivational biases and the form of the drug cue encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The most predictable outcome of a diagnosis of addiction is a high chance for relapse. When addicts encounter cues previously associated with drug, their attention may be unduly attracted to such cues and these cues can evoke motivational states that instigate and maintain drug-seeking behavior. Although sign-tracking rats were previously demonstrated to exhibit greater relapse vulnerability to Pavlovian drug cues paired with drug delivery, here, we demonstrate that their counterparts, the goal trackers, are more vulnerable if the drug cue acts to signal drug availability and that the forebrain cholinergic system mediates such vulnerability. Given the importance of contextual cues for triggering relapse and the human cognitive–cholinergic capacity for the processing of such cues, goal trackers model essential aspects of relapse vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Saturation in Phosphene Size with Increasing Current Levels Delivered to Human Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7188?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7188?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electrically stimulating early visual cortex results in a visual percept known as a phosphene. Although phosphenes can be evoked by a wide range of electrode sizes and current amplitudes, they are invariably described as small. To better understand this observation, we electrically stimulated 93 electrodes implanted in the visual cortex of 13 human subjects who reported phosphene size while stimulation current was varied. Phosphene size increased as the stimulation current was initially raised above threshold, but then rapidly reached saturation. Phosphene size also depended on the location of the stimulated site, with size increasing with distance from the foveal representation. We developed a model relating phosphene size to the amount of activated cortex and its location within the retinotopic map. First, a sigmoidal curve was used to predict the amount of activated cortex at a given current. Second, the amount of active cortex was converted to degrees of visual angle by multiplying by the inverse cortical magnification factor for that retinotopic location. This simple model accurately predicted phosphene size for a broad range of stimulation currents and cortical locations. The unexpected saturation in phosphene sizes suggests that the functional architecture of cerebral cortex may impose fundamental restrictions on the spread of artificially evoked activity and this may be an important consideration in the design of cortical prosthetic devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the neural basis for phosphenes, the visual percepts created by electrical stimulation of visual cortex, is fundamental to the development of a visual cortical prosthetic. Our experiments in human subjects implanted with electrodes over visual cortex show that it is the activity of a large population of cells spread out across several millimeters of tissue that supports the perception of a phosphene. In addition, we describe an important feature of the production of phosphenes by electrical stimulation: phosphene size saturates at a relatively low current level. This finding implies that, with current methods, visual prosthetics will have a limited dynamic range available to control the production of spatial forms and that more advanced stimulation methods may be required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dopaminergic Modulation of Synaptic Integration and Firing Patterns in the Rat Entopeduncular Nucleus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7177?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is known to differentially modulate the impact of cortical input to the striatum between the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia (BG). However, the role of extrastriatal dopamine receptors (DRs) in BG information processing is less clear. To investigate the role of extrastriatal DRs, we studied their distribution and function in one of the output nuclei of the BG of the rodent, the entopeduncular nucleus (EP). qRT-PCR indicated that all DR subtypes were expressed by EP neurons, suggesting that both D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-like receptors (D1LRs) and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like receptors (D2LRs) were likely to affect information processing in the EP. Whole-cell recordings revealed that striatal inputs to the EP were potentiated by D1LRs whereas pallidal inputs to the EP were depressed by D2LRs. Changes to the paired-pulse ratio of inputs to the EP suggested that dopaminergic modulation of striatal inputs is mediated by postsynaptic receptors, and that of globus pallidus-evoked inputs is mediated by presynaptic receptors. We show that these changes in synaptic efficacy changed the information content of EP neuron firing. Overall, the findings suggest that the dopaminergic system affects the passage of feedforward information through the BG by modulating input divergence in the striatum and output convergence in the EP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The entopeduncular nucleus (EP), one of the basal ganglia (BG) output nuclei, is an important station in information processing in BG. However, it remains unclear how EP neurons encode information and how dopamine affects this process. This contrasts with the well established role of dopamine in the striatum, which is known to redistribute cortical input between the direct and indirect pathways. Here we show that, in symmetry with the striatum, dopamine controls the rebalancing of information flow between the two pathways in the EP. Specifically, we demonstrate that dopamine regulates EP activity by differentially modulating striatal and pallidal GABAergic inputs. These results call for a reassessment of current perspectives on BG information processing by highlighting the functional role of extrastriatal dopamine receptors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Excitation of GABAergic Neurons in the Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis Triggers Immediate Transition from Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep to Wakefulness in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7164?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emotionally salient situations usually trigger arousal along with autonomic and neuroendocrine reactions. To determine whether the extended amygdala plays a role in sleep–wakefulness regulation, we examined the effects of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic excitation of GABAergic neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (GABA&lt;sup&gt;BNST&lt;/sup&gt; neurons). Acute optogenetic excitation of these cells during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep resulted in an immediate state transition to wakefulness, whereas stimulation during REM sleep showed no effect on sleep–wakefulness states in male mice. An anterograde tracing study suggested GABA&lt;sup&gt;BNST&lt;/sup&gt; neurons send axonal projections to several brain regions implicated in arousal, including the preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, deep mesencephalic nucleus, and parabrachial nucleus. A dual orexin receptor antagonist, DORA-22, did not affect the optogenetic transition from NREM sleep to wakefulness. Chemogenetic excitation of GABA&lt;sup&gt;BNST&lt;/sup&gt; neurons evoked a sustained wakefulness state, but this arousal effect was markedly attenuated by DORA-22. These observations suggest that GABA&lt;sup&gt;BNST&lt;/sup&gt; neurons play an important role in transition from NREM sleep to wakefulness without the function of orexin neurons, but prolonged excitation of these cells mobilizes the orexin system to sustain wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We examined the role of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the regulation of wakefulness. Optogenetic excitation of GABAergic neurons in the BNST (GABA&lt;sup&gt;BNST&lt;/sup&gt; neurons) during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in mice resulted in immediate transition to a wakefulness state without function of orexins. Prolonged excitation of GABA&lt;sup&gt;BNST&lt;/sup&gt; neurons by a chemogenetic method evoked a longer-lasting, sustained wakefulness state, which was abolished by preadministration of a dual orexin receptor antagonist, DORA-22. This study revealed a role of the BNST GABAergic system in sleep–wakefulness control, especially in shifting animals' behavioral states from NREM sleep to wakefulness, and provides an important insight into the pathophysiology of insomnia and the role of orexin in arousal regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Selective Inhibition of Trigeminovascular Neurons by Fremanezumab: A Humanized Monoclonal Anti-CGRP Antibody</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A large body of evidence supports an important role for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in migraine pathophysiology. This evidence gave rise to a global effort to develop a new generation of therapeutics that inhibit the interaction of CGRP with its receptor in migraineurs. Recently, a new class of such drugs, humanized anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs), were found to be effective in reducing the frequency of migraine. The purpose of this study was to better understand how the CGRP-mAb fremanezumab (TEV-48125) modulates meningeal sensory pathways. To answer this question, we used single-unit recording to determine the effects of fremanezumab (30 mg/kg, IV) and its isotype control Ab on spontaneous and evoked activity in naive and cortical spreading depression (CSD)-sensitized trigeminovascular neurons in the spinal trigeminal nucleus of anesthetized male and female rats. The study demonstrates that, in both sexes, fremanezumab inhibited naive high-threshold (HT) neurons, but not wide-dynamic range trigeminovascular neurons, and that the inhibitory effects on the neurons were limited to their activation from the intracranial dura but not facial skin or cornea. In addition, when given sufficient time, fremanezumab prevents the activation and sensitization of HT neurons by CSD. Mechanistically, these findings suggest that HT neurons play a critical role in the initiation of the perception of headache and the development of cutaneous allodynia and central sensitization. Clinically, the findings may help to explain the therapeutic benefit of CGRP-mAb in reducing headaches of intracranial origin such as migraine with aura and why this therapeutic approach may not be effective for every migraine patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs) are capable of preventing migraine. However, their mechanism of action is unknown. In the current study, we show that, if given enough time, a CGRP-mAb can prevent the activation and sensitization of high-threshold (central) trigeminovascular neurons by cortical spreading depression, but not their activation from the skin or cornea, suggesting a potential explanation for selectivity to migraine headache, but not other pains, and a predominantly peripheral site of action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Kappa Opioid Receptors Mediate Heterosynaptic Suppression of Hippocampal Inputs in the Rat Ventral Striatum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7140?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Kappa opioid receptors (KORs) are highly enriched within the ventral striatum (VS) and are thought to modulate striatal neurotransmission. This includes presynaptic inhibition of local glutamatergic release from excitatory inputs to the VS. However, it is not known which inputs drive this modulation and what impact they have on the local circuit dynamics within the VS. Individual medium spiny neurons (MSNs) within the VS serve as a site of convergence for glutamatergic inputs arising from the PFC and limbic regions, such as the hippocampus (HP). Recent data suggest that competition can arise between these inputs with robust cortical activation leading to a reduction in ongoing HP-evoked MSN responses. Here, we investigated the contribution of KOR signaling in PFC-driven heterosynaptic suppression of HP inputs onto MSNs using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in slices from adult rats. Optogenetically evoked HP EPSPs were greatly attenuated after a short latency (50 ms) following burst-like PFC electrical stimulation, and the magnitude of this suppression was partially reversed following blockade of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs (GABA Type A receptors), but not GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs (GABA Type B receptors). A similar reduction in suppression was observed in the presence of the KOR antagonist, norBNI. Combined blockade of local GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs and KORs resulted in complete blockade of PFC-induced heterosynaptic suppression of less salient HP inputs. These findings highlight a mechanism by which strong, transient PFC activity can take precedence over other excitatory inputs to the VS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Emerging evidence suggests that kappa opioid receptor (KOR) activation can selectively modulate striatal glutamatergic inputs onto medium spiny neurons (MSNs). In this study, we found that robust cortical stimulation leads to a reduction in ongoing hippocampal-evoked MSNs responses through the combined recruitment of local inhibitory mechanisms and activation of presynaptic KORs in the ventral striatum (VS). These processes are likely to facilitate the efficient transfer of cortical information through the VS during critical decision making by dampening competing information from less salient excitatory inputs. These data provide a novel mechanism through which VS information processing could influence decision making, a function thought to occur primarily in the PFC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase {delta} Mediates the Sema3A-Induced Cortical Basal Dendritic Arborization through the Activation of Fyn Tyrosine Kinase</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) class protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are critical for axonal guidance; however, their relation to specific guidance cues is poorly defined. We here show that PTP-3, a LAR homolog in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, is involved in axon guidance regulated by Semaphorin-2A-signaling. PTP, one of the vertebrate LAR class PTPs, participates in the Semaphorin-3A (Sema3A)-induced growth cone collapse response of primary cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons from &lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt; embryos. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, however, the contribution of PTP in Sema3A-regualted axon guidance was minimal. Instead, PTP played a major role in Sema3A-dependent cortical dendritic growth. &lt;i&gt;Ptp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Sema3a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mutant mice exhibited poor arborization of basal dendrites of cortical layer V neurons. This phenotype was observed in both male and female mutants. The double-heterozygous mutants, &lt;i&gt;Ptp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;; Sema3a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;, also showed a similar phenotype, indicating the genetic interaction. In &lt;i&gt;Ptp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; brains, Fyn and Src kinases were hyperphosphorylated at their C-terminal Tyr527 residues. Sema3A-stimulation induced dephosphorylation of Tyr527 in the dendrites of wild-type cortical neurons but not of &lt;i&gt;Ptp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;. Arborization of cortical basal dendrites was reduced in &lt;i&gt;Fyn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; as well as in &lt;i&gt;Ptp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;; Fyn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; double-heterozygous mutants. Collectively, PTP mediates Sema3A-signaling through the activation of Fyn by C-terminal dephosphorylation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The relation of leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) class protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and specific axon guidance cues is poorly defined. We show that PTP-3, a LAR homolog in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, participates in Sema2A-regulated axon guidance. PTP, a member of vertebrate LAR class PTPs, is involved in Sema3A-regulated cortical dendritic growth. In Sema3A signaling, PTP activates Fyn and Src kinases by dephosphorylating their C-terminal Tyr residues. This is the first evidence showing that LAR class PTPs participate in Semaphorin signaling &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Promoting Sleep Oscillations and Their Functional Coupling by Transcranial Stimulation Enhances Memory Consolidation in Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7111?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7111?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) not only involves loss of memory functions, but also prominent deterioration of sleep physiology, which is already evident at the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Cortical slow oscillations (SO; 0.5–1 Hz) and thalamocortical spindle activity (12–15 Hz) during sleep, and their temporal coordination, are considered critical for memory formation. We investigated the potential of slow oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (so-tDCS), applied during a daytime nap in a sleep-state-dependent manner, to modulate these activity patterns and sleep-related memory consolidation in nine male and seven female human patients with MCI. Stimulation significantly increased overall SO and spindle power, amplified spindle power during SO up-phases, and led to stronger synchronization between SO and spindle power fluctuations in EEG recordings. Moreover, visual declarative memory was improved by so-tDCS compared with sham stimulation and was associated with stronger synchronization. These findings indicate a well-tolerated therapeutic approach for disordered sleep physiology and memory deficits in MCI patients and advance our understanding of offline memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the light of increasing evidence that sleep disruption is crucially involved in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), sleep appears as a promising treatment target in this pathology, particularly to counteract memory decline. This study demonstrates the potential of a noninvasive brain stimulation method during sleep in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor of AD, and advances our understanding of its mechanism. We provide first time evidence that slow oscillatory transcranial stimulation amplifies the functional cross-frequency coupling between memory-relevant brain oscillations and improves visual memory consolidation in patients with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Small GTPase Rac1 Contributes to Extinction of Aversive Memories of Drug Withdrawal by Facilitating GABAA Receptor Endocytosis in the vmPFC</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7096?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7096?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Extinction of aversive memories has been a major concern in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as anxiety disorders and drug addiction. However, the mechanisms underlying extinction of aversive memories are not fully understood. Here, we report that extinction of conditioned place aversion (CPA) to naloxone-precipitated opiate withdrawal in male rats activates Rho GTPase Rac1 in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in a BDNF-dependent manner, which determines GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R) endocytosis via triggering synaptic translocation of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) through facilitating actin polymerization. Active Rac1 is essential and sufficient for GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R endocytosis and CPA extinction. Knockdown of Rac1 expression within the vmPFC of rats using Rac1-shRNA suppressed GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R endocytosis and CPA extinction, whereas expression of a constitutively active form of Rac1 accelerated GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R endocytosis and CPA extinction. The crucial role of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R endocytosis in the LTP induction and CPA extinction is evinced by the findings that blockade of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R endocytosis by a dynamin function-blocking peptide (Myr-P4) abolishes LTP induction and CPA extinction. Thus, the present study provides first evidence that Rac1-dependent GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R endocytosis plays a crucial role in extinction of aversive memories and reveals the sequence of molecular events that contribute to learning experience modulation of synaptic GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R endocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study reveals that Rac1-dependent GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R endocytosis plays a crucial role in extinction of aversive memories associated with drug withdrawal and identifies Arc as a downstream effector of Rac1 regulations of synaptic plasticity as well as learning and memory, thereby suggesting therapeutic targets to promote extinction of the unwanted memories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The mTOR Substrate S6 Kinase 1 (S6K1) Is a Negative Regulator of Axon Regeneration and a Potential Drug Target for Central Nervous System Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7079?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/30/7079?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) positively regulates axon growth in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Although axon regeneration and functional recovery from CNS injuries are typically limited, knockdown or deletion of PTEN, a negative regulator of mTOR, increases mTOR activity and induces robust axon growth and regeneration. It has been suggested that inhibition of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1, gene symbol: RPS6KB1), a prominent mTOR target, would blunt mTOR's positive effect on axon growth. In contrast to this expectation, we demonstrate that inhibition of S6K1 in CNS neurons promotes neurite outgrowth &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; by twofold to threefold. Biochemical analysis revealed that an mTOR-dependent induction of PI3K signaling is involved in mediating this effect of S6K1 inhibition. Importantly, treating female mice &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; with PF-4708671, a selective S6K1 inhibitor, stimulated corticospinal tract regeneration across a dorsal spinal hemisection between the cervical 5 and 6 cord segments (C5/C6), increasing axon counts for at least 3 mm beyond the injury site at 8 weeks after injury. Concomitantly, treatment with PF-4708671 produced significant locomotor recovery. Pharmacological targeting of S6K1 may therefore constitute an attractive strategy for promoting axon regeneration following CNS injury, especially given that S6K1 inhibitors are being assessed in clinical trials for nononcological indications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite mTOR's well-established function in promoting axon regeneration, the role of its downstream target, S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), has been unclear. We used cellular assays with primary neurons to demonstrate that S6K1 is a negative regulator of neurite outgrowth, and a spinal cord injury model to show that it is a viable pharmacological target for inducing axon regeneration. We provide mechanistic evidence that S6K1's negative feedback to PI3K signaling is involved in axon growth inhibition, and show that phosphorylation of S6K1 is a more appropriate regeneration indicator than is S6 phosphorylation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A comparison of single-trial EEG classification and EEG-informed fMRI across three MR compatible EEG recording systems. (arXiv:1707.08077v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to non-invasively measure the
spatiotemporal dynamics of the human brain. One challenge is dealing with the
artifacts that each modality introduces into the other when the two are
recorded concurrently, for example the ballistocardiogram (BCG). We conducted a
preliminary comparison of three different MR compatible EEG recording systems
and assessed their performance in terms of single-trial classification of the
EEG when simultaneously collecting fMRI. We found tradeoffs across all three
systems, for example varied ease of setup and improved classification accuracy
with reference electrodes (REF) but not for pulse artifact subtraction (PAS) or
reference layer adaptive filtering (RLAF).

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Functional connectivity patterns of autism spectrum disorder identified by deep feature learning. (arXiv:1707.07932v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07932</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is regarded as a brain disease with globally
disrupted neuronal networks. Even though fMRI studies have revealed abnormal
functional connectivity in ASD, they have not reached a consensus of the
disrupted patterns. Here, a deep learning-based feature extraction method
identifies multivariate and nonlinear functional connectivity patterns of ASD.
Resting-state fMRI data of 972 subjects (465 ASD 507 normal controls) acquired
from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange were used. A functional
connectivity matrix of each subject was generated using 90 predefined brain
regions. As a data-driven feature extraction method without prior knowledge
such as subjects diagnosis, variational autoencoder (VAE) summarized the
functional connectivity matrix into 2 features. Those feature values of ASD
patients were statistically compared with those of controls. A feature was
significantly different between ASD and normal controls. The extracted features
were visualized by VAE-based generator which can produce virtual functional
connectivity matrices. The ASD-related feature was associated with
frontoparietal connections, interconnections of the dorsal medial frontal
cortex and corticostriatal connections. It also showed a trend of negative
correlation with full-scale IQ. A data-driven feature extraction based on deep
learning could identify complex patterns of functional connectivity of ASD.
This approach will help discover complex patterns of abnormalities in brain
connectivity in various brain disorders.

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Astroglial Versus Neuronal D-Serine: Check Your Controls!</title>

	<description>As we recently reviewed [1], studies from at least six laboratories now indicate that neurons rather than astrocytes are the major sources for D-serine and preferentially express its synthetic enzyme, serine racemase (SR), in the normal brain [1]. We described how several unforeseen artifacts misled established scientists (including ourselves) into believing that serine racemase and D-serine are localized exclusively to astrocytes and represent prima face exemplars of gliotransmission. We were concerned that the purported astrocytic source of D-serine was being perpetuated to this day, despite compelling evidence to the contrary published over the past decade [1].</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Polar-angle representation of saccadic eye movements in human superior colliculus</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/169003v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The superior colliculus (SC) is a layered midbrain structure involved in directing eye movements and coordinating visual attention. Electrical stimulation and neuronal recordings in the intermediate layers of monkey SC have shown a retinotopic organization for the mediation of saccadic eye-movements. However, in human SC the topography of saccades is unknown. Here, a novel experimental paradigm and high-resolution (1.2-mm) functional magnetic resonance imaging methods were used to measure activity evoked by saccadic eye movements within SC. Results provide three critical observations about the topography of the human SC: (1) saccades along the superior-inferior visual axis are mapped across the medial-lateral anatomy of the SC; (2) the saccadic eye-movement representation is in register with the retinotopic organization of visual stimulation; and (3) activity evoked by saccades occurs deeper within SC than that evoked by visual stimulation. These approaches lay the foundation for studying the organization of human subcortical eye-movement mechanisms.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/168997v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The spectrotemporal response function (STRF) model of neural encoding quantitatively associates dynamic auditory neural (output) responses to a spectrogram-like representation of a dynamic (input) stimulus. STRFs were experimentally obtained via whole-head human cortical responses to dynamic auditory stimuli using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The stimuli employed consisted of unpredictable pure tones presented at a range of rates. The predictive power of the estimated STRFs was found to be comparable to those obtained from the cortical single and multiunit activity literature. The STRFs were also qualitatively consistent with those obtained from electrophysiological studies in animal models; in particular their local-field-potential-generated spectral distributions and multiunit-activity-generated temporal distributions. Comparison of these MEG STRFs with others obtained using natural speech and music stimuli reveal a general structure consistent with common baseline auditory processing, including evidence for a transition in low-level neural representations of natural speech by 100 ms, when an appropriately chosen stimulus representation was used. It is also demonstrated that MEG-based STRFs contain information similar to that obtained using classic auditory evoked potential based approaches, but with extended applications to long-duration, non-repeated stimuli.</description>

	<description>Exosomes are thought to be secreted by all cells in the body and to be involved in intercellular communication. Here, we tested whether neural exosomes regulate the development of neural circuits and whether exosome-mediated signaling may be aberrant in the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett Syndrome (RTT). Quantitative proteomic analysis comparing exosomes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) - derived RTT patient or control neural cultures indicates that control exosomes contain signaling components capable of influencing neuronal development and function, which are lacking in RTT exosomes. Moreover, treatment with control exosomes rescues neuron number, apoptosis, synaptic puncta and synchronized firing phenotypes of MeCP2 knockdown in human primary neurons, indicating that exosomes have the capacity to influence neural development and may be a promising avenue to treat neurodevelopmental disorders like Rett Syndrome.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Facilitation of motor excitability during listening to spoken sentences is not modulated by noise or semantic coherence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/168864v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Comprehending speech can be particularly challenging in a noisy environment and in the absence of semantic context. It has been proposed that the articulatory motor system would be recruited especially in difficult listening conditions. However, it remains unknown how signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and semantic context affect the recruitment of the articulatory motor system when listening to continuous speech. The aim of the present study was to address the hypothesis that involvement of the articulatory motor cortex increases when the intelligibility and clarity of the spoken sentences decreases, because of noise and the lack of semantic context. We applied Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to the lip and hand representations in the primary motor cortex and measured motor evoked potentials from the lip and hand muscles, respectively, to evaluate motor excitability when young adults listened to sentences. In Experiment 1, we found that the excitability of the lip motor cortex was facilitated during listening to both semantically anomalous and coherent sentences in noise, but neither SNR nor semantic context modulated the facilitation. In Experiment 2, we replicated these findings and found no difference in the excitability of the lip motor cortex between sentences in noise and clear sentences without noise. Thus, our results show that the articulatory motor cortex is involved in speech processing even in optimal and ecologically valid listening conditions and that its involvement is not modulated by the intelligibility and clarity of speech.</description>

	<description>Fruit flies recognize hundreds of ecologically relevant odors and respond appropriately to them. The noise, redundancy and interconnectedness of the olfactory machinery complicate efforts to pinpoint the functional contributions of any component neuron or receptor to behavior. Some contributions can only be elucidated in flies that carry multiple mutations and transgenes, but the production of such flies is currently labor-intensive and time-consuming. Here, we describe a set of transgenic flies that express the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL80 in specific olfactory sensory neurons (OrX-GAL80s). The GAL80s effectively and specifically subtract the activities of GAL4-driven transgenes that impart anatomical, behavioral, and physiological phenotypes. OrX-GAL80s can allow researchers to efficiently activate only one or a few types of functional neurons in an otherwise nonfunctional olfactory background. Such experiments will improve our understanding of the mechanistic connections between odorant inputs and behavioral outputs at the resolution of only a few functional neurons.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A mixture of sparse coding models explaining properties of face neurons related to holistic and parts-based processing</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Haruo Hosoya, Aapo Hyvärinen&lt;/p&gt;

Experimental studies have revealed evidence of both parts-based and holistic representations of objects and faces in the primate visual system. However, it is still a mystery how such seemingly contradictory types of processing can coexist within a single system. Here, we propose a novel theory called mixture of sparse coding models, inspired by the formation of category-specific subregions in the inferotemporal (IT) cortex. We developed a hierarchical network that constructed a mixture of two sparse coding submodels on top of a simple Gabor analysis. The submodels were each trained with face or non-face object images, which resulted in separate representations of facial parts and object parts. Importantly, evoked neural activities were modeled by Bayesian inference, which had a top-down explaining-away effect that enabled recognition of an individual part to depend strongly on the category of the whole input. We show that this explaining-away effect was indeed crucial for the units in the face submodel to exhibit significant selectivity to face images over object images in a similar way to actual face-selective neurons in the macaque IT cortex. Furthermore, the model explained, qualitatively and quantitatively, several tuning properties to facial features found in the middle patch of face processing in IT as documented by Freiwald, Tsao, and Livingstone (2009). These included, in particular, tuning to only a small number of facial features that were often related to geometrically large parts like face outline and hair, preference and anti-preference of extreme facial features (e.g., very large/small inter-eye distance), and reduction of the gain of feature tuning for partial face stimuli compared to whole face stimuli. Thus, we hypothesize that the coding principle of facial features in the middle patch of face processing in the macaque IT cortex may be closely related to mixture of sparse coding models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Lg2uKR4gUHg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The population extinction pulse we describe here shows, from a quantitative viewpoint, that Earth’s sixth mass extinction is more severe than perceived when looking exclusively at species extinctions. Therefore, humanity needs to address anthropogenic population extirpation and decimation immediately. That conclusion is based on analyses of the numbers and degrees...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/9yd_Yw1y9lY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restrengthening of the residual language network is likely to be crucial for speech recovery in poststroke aphasia. Eight participants with chronic aphasia received intensive speech therapy for 3 weeks, with standardized naming tests and brain magnetic resonance imaging before and after therapy. Kurtosis-based diffusion tensor tractography was used to measure mean kurtosis (MK) along a segment of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). Therapy-related reduction in the number of semantic but not phonemic errors was associated with strengthening (renormalization) of ILF MK (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = −0.90, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 corrected), suggesting that speech recovery is related to structural plasticity of language-specific components of the residual language network.

Metagenomic next generation sequencing can identify unusual or novel microbes and is therefore well suited for investigating the etiology of chronic meningoencephalitis in immunodeficient patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24982-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We present the case of a 34-year-old man with X-linked agammaglobulinemia from Australia suffering from 3 years of meningoencephalitis that defied an etiologic diagnosis despite extensive conventional testing, including a brain biopsy. Metagenomic next generation sequencing of his cerebrospinal fluid and brain biopsy tissue was performed to identify a causative pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24982-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sequences aligning to multiple Cache Valley virus genes were identified via metagenomic next generation sequencing. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry subsequently confirmed the presence of Cache Valley virus in the brain biopsy tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24982-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cache Valley virus, a mosquito-borne orthobunyavirus, has only been identified in 3 immunocompetent North American patients with acute neuroinvasive disease. The reported severity ranges from a self-limiting meningitis to a rapidly fatal meningoencephalitis with multiorgan failure. The virus has never been known to cause a chronic systemic or neurologic infection in humans. Cache Valley virus has also never previously been detected on the Australian continent. Our research subject traveled to North and South Carolina and Michigan in the weeks prior to the onset of his illness. This report demonstrates that metagenomic next generation sequencing allows for unbiased pathogen identification, the early detection of emerging viruses as they spread to new locales, and the discovery of novel disease phenotypes.

IP is caused by pathogenic variants that inactivate the &lt;em&gt;Nemo&lt;/em&gt; gene. Replacing &lt;em&gt;Nemo&lt;/em&gt; through gene therapy might provide therapeutic benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Spontaneous epileptic seizures and the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) were monitored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In parallel, it reduced the incidence of seizures and delayed their occurrence. Neonate mice intravenously injected with the AAV-BR1-CAG-NEMO vector developed no hepatocellular carcinoma or other major adverse effects 11 months after vector injection, demonstrating that the vector has a favorable safety profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As potential treatments for &lt;em&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/em&gt;-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (c9ALS) approach clinical trials, the identification of prognostic biomarkers for c9ALS becomes a priority. We show that levels of phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNFH) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) predict disease status and survival in c9ALS patients, and are largely stable over time. Moreover, c9ALS patients exhibit higher pNFH levels, more rapid disease progression, and shorter survival after disease onset than ALS patients without &lt;em&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/em&gt; expansions. These data support the use of CSF pNFH as a prognostic biomarker for clinical trials, which will increase the likelihood of successfully developing a treatment for c9ALS.

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24979-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients were identified through service neural autoantibody evaluation. Ninety-five had longitudinal follow-up (7–456 months; median = 35).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24979-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 3,910 patients tested, 196 were LGI1-IgG positive, 51 were CASPR2-IgG positive, and 9 were dual positive. Cerebrospinal fluid testing was less sensitive than serum testing, detecting only 24 of 38 (63%) LGI1-IgG–positive and 5 of 6 (83%) CASPR2-IgG–positive patients. LGI1-IgG–positive specimens had higher voltage-gated potassium channel–IgG immunoprecipitation values (0.33nmol/l, range = 0.02–5.14) than CASPR2-IgG–positive specimens (0.10nmol/l, range = 0.00–0.45, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Of patients presenting with pain or peripheral nervous system (PNS) manifestations, 39% were LGI1-IgG seropositive (7% had solely neuropathy or pain). Multivariate analysis identified age as the only significant predictor of central nervous system (CNS) versus PNS involvement (&amp;gt;50 years; odds ratio = 15, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Paroxysmal dizziness spells (PDS), a unique LGI1-IgG accompaniment (14% of patients), frequently delayed the diagnosis. T2-mesiotemporal hyperintensity was more common in LGI1-IgG–positive (41%) than in CASPR2-IgG–positive patients (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.033). T1-bright basal ganglia were confined to LGI1-IgG–positive patients with faciobrachial–dystonic seizures (9 of 39, 31%). Cancer was found in 44% of LGI1-IgG/CASPR2-IgG dual seropositive patients (one-third thymoma). Response to initial immunotherapy was favorable in 97%; mean modified Rankin score was 3 (range = 1–5) at onset and 1.74 (range = 0–6) at last follow-up, with 9% having severe refractory disability, 20% being asymptomatic, 28% receiving immunotherapy, and 58% receiving antiepileptic medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24979-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older age is a strong predictor of CNS involvement in patients seropositive for CASPR2-IgG or LGI1-IgG. Pain, peripheral manifestations, and stereotypic paroxysmal dizziness spells are common with LGI1-IgG. Response to initial immunotherapy is often favorable, but some patients remain severely disabled, requiring long-term immunotherapy and/or antiepileptic medications.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We investigated the association of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related rare variants &lt;em&gt;APP&lt;/em&gt; A673T and &lt;em&gt;ABCA7&lt;/em&gt; rs200538373-C with the levels of β-amyloid (Aβ) and parameters of metabolic and cardiovascular health in a population-based cohort of healthy middle-aged and elderly men. Carriers of protective &lt;em&gt;APP&lt;/em&gt; A673T variant had, on average, 28% lower levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in plasma as compared to the controls and the carriers of &lt;em&gt;ABCA7&lt;/em&gt; rs200538373-C. This is the first report to show decreased Aβ levels in plasma in &lt;em&gt;APP&lt;/em&gt; A673T carriers and thus provides evidence that lower Aβ levels throughout life may be protective against AD.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) deficiency syndrome (GLUT1-DS) leads to a wide range of neurological symptoms. Ketogenic diets are very efficient to control epilepsy and movement disorders. We tested a novel simple and rapid blood test in 30 patients with GLUT1-DS with predominant movement disorders, 18 patients with movement disorders attributed to other genetic defects, and 346 healthy controls. We detected significantly reduced GLUT1 expression only on red blood cells from patients with GLUT1-DS (23 patients; 78%), including patients with inconclusive genetic analysis. This test opens perspectives for the screening of GLUT1-DS in children and adults with cognitive impairment, movement disorder, or epilepsy.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Epileptic networks in action: Synchrony between distant hemodynamic responses</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24973-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural and functional imaging studies in focal epilepsy often reveal distributed regions of abnormality. These are interpreted as representing the existence of epileptic networks, but the presence of actual neuronal interactions between these regions has not been demonstrated. We sought to determine whether the distributed hemodynamic responses often seen in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of scalp interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) actually correspond to synchronized neuronal activities when examining the intracerebral electroencephalogram (iEEG) at distant nodes of the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24973-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We studied 28 patients who underwent first EEG-fMRI and then iEEG, and had significant hemodynamic responses in the gray matter. We coregistered the hemodynamic responses to the iEEG electrode contact positions and analyzed synchrony, measured by correlation, between IEDs recorded by iEEG in regions with and without hemodynamic responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24973-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The synchrony of intracerebral IED activity between pairs of regions showing a hemodynamic response was higher compared to that between pairs of regions without (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and between pairs of regions, one with and one without hemodynamic response (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). These differences were found during the interictal periods with IEDs but were absent during the interictal periods without IEDs. Higher synchrony was also observed between regions involved at seizure onset (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24973-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;EEG-fMRI studies are unique in their ability to reveal hemodynamic concomitants of IEDs anywhere in the brain. This study proves that iEEG activity is synchronized between these regions of hemodynamic response, thus demonstrating the existence of an actual neuronally based interictal epileptic network. This also validates the EEG-fMRI approach to reveal this network noninvasively. Ann Neurol 2017;82:57–66&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24971-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common disabling condition with limited treatment options. Diffusion tensor imaging measures recovery of axonal injury in white matter (WM) tracts after TBI. Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) after TBI may impair axonal and neuropsychological recovery, and serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) may mediate this effect. We conducted a longitudinal study to determine the effects of baseline serum IGF-I concentrations on WM tract and neuropsychological recovery after TBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24971-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-nine adults after TBI (84.6% male, median age = 30.5 years, 87.2% moderate–severe, median time since TBI = 16.3 months, n = 4 with GHD) were scanned twice, 13.3 months (range = 12.1–14.9) apart, and 35 healthy controls were scanned once. Symptom and quality of life questionnaires and cognitive assessments were completed at both visits (n = 33). Our main outcome measure was fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of WM tract integrity, in a priori regions of interest: splenium of corpus callosum (SPCC) and posterior limb of internal capsule (PLIC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24971-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At baseline, FA was reduced in many WM tracts including SPCC and PLIC following TBI compared to controls, indicating axonal injury, with longitudinal increases indicating axonal recovery. There was a significantly greater increase in SPCC FA over time in patients with serum IGF-I above versus below the median for age.

Each patient provided a median of 14 (interquartile range = 13–16) spot urine samples throughout the 5-year follow-up. We estimated 24-hour urine sodium excretion level at each time point using the Tanaka equations, and assessed whether sodium levels estimated from the cumulative average of the repeated measures were associated with clinical (conversion to MS, Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Connectivity Predicts deep brain stimulation outcome in Parkinson disease</title>

Here, we identify the structural and functional connectivity profile of effective DBS to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and test its ability to predict outcome in an independent cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24974-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A training dataset of 51 PD patients with STN DBS was combined with publicly available human connectome data (diffusion tractography and resting state functional connectivity) to identify connections reliably associated with clinical improvement (motor score of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS]). This connectivity profile was then used to predict outcome in an independent cohort of 44 patients from a different center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24974-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the training dataset, connectivity between the DBS electrode and a distributed network of brain regions correlated with clinical response including structural connectivity to supplementary motor area and functional anticorrelation to primary motor cortex (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). This same connectivity profile predicted response in an independent patient cohort (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Structural and functional connectivity were independent predictors of clinical improvement (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and estimated response in individual patients with an average error of 15% UPDRS improvement. Results were similar using connectome data from normal subjects or a connectome age, sex, and disease matched to our DBS patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24974-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective STN DBS for PD is associated with a specific connectivity profile that can predict clinical outcome across independent cohorts. This prediction does not require specialized imaging in PD patients themselves. Ann Neurol 2017;82:67–78&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To characterize the mechanism of Zika virus (ZIKV)-associated microcephaly, we performed immunolabeling on brain tissue from a 20-week fetus with intrauterine ZIKV infection. Although ZIKV demonstrated a wide range of neuronal and non-neuronal tropism, the infection rate was highest in intermediate progenitor cells and immature neurons. Apoptosis was observed in both infected and uninfected bystander cortical neurons, suggesting a role for paracrine factors in induction of neuronal apoptosis. Our results highlight differential neuronal susceptibility and neuronal apoptosis as potential mechanisms in the development of ZIKV-associated microcephaly, and may provide insights into the design and best timing of future therapy.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Chance, long tails, and inference: a non-Gaussian, Bayesian theory of vocal learning in songbirds. (arXiv:1707.07247v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07247</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07247</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional theories of sensorimotor learning posit that animals use sensory
error signals to find the optimal motor command in the face of Gaussian sensory
and motor noise. However, most such theories cannot explain common behavioral
observations, for example that smaller sensory errors are more readily
corrected than larger errors and that large abrupt (but not gradually
introduced) errors lead to weak learning. Here we propose a new theory of
sensorimotor learning that explains these observations. The theory posits that
the animal learns an entire probability distribution of motor commands rather
than trying to arrive at a single optimal command, and that learning arises via
Bayesian inference when new sensory information becomes available. We test this
theory using data from a songbird, the Bengalese finch, that is adapting the
pitch (fundamental frequency) of its song following perturbations of auditory
feedback using miniature headphones. We observe the distribution of the sung
pitches to have long, non-Gaussian tails, which, within our theory, explains
the observed dynamics of learning. Further, the theory makes surprising
predictions about the dynamics of the shape of the pitch distribution, which we
confirm experimentally.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Extracellular monomeric and aggregated tau efficiently enter human neurons through overlapping but distinct pathways</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/168294v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/168294v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>A current working model is that Alzheimer's disease actively spreads from diseased to healthy neurons, mediated by transfer of extracellular, abnormal, disease-specific forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau. It is currently unclear whether transfer of tau between neurons is a toxic gain-of-function process in dementia, or reflects a constitutive biological process. We report two mechanisms of entry of monomeric tau to neurons: a rapid early dynamin-dependent phase, and a second, slower actin-dependent phase, suggesting that monomeric tau enters neurons via rapid saturable clathrin-mediated endocytosis and also by bulk endocytosis. Aggregated tau entry is independent of actin polymerisation and largely dynamin dependent, consistent with clathrin-mediated endocytosis and distinct from macropinocytosis, the major route for aggregated tau entry reported for non-neuronal cells. Anti-tau antibodies abrogate tau entry into neurons, with tau carrying antibody with it into neurons, indicating that antibody binding is insufficient to prevent neuronal tau entry.</description>

	<description>Region and cell-type restricted expression of light activated ion channels is the indispensable tool to study properties of synapses in specific circuits and to monitor synaptic alterations by various stimuli including neuromodulators and behaviors, both ex vivo and in vivo. These analyses require the light-activated proteins or viral vectors for their delivery that do not interfere with the phenomenon under study. Here, we report a case of such interference in which the high-level expression of Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) introduced in the somatostatin-positive GABAergic neurons (SOM-INs) of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) by an adeno-associated virus vector (AAV) weakens the presynaptic GABAb receptor-mediated suppression of GABA release.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dynamic semantic cognition: Characterising coherent and controlled conceptual retrieval through time using magnetoencephalography and chronometric transcranial magnetic stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/168203v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Distinct neural processes are thought to support the retrieval of semantic information that is (i) coherent with strongly-encoded aspects of knowledge, and (ii) non-dominant yet relevant for the current task or context. While the brain regions that support coherent and controlled patterns of semantic retrieval are relatively well-characterised, the temporal dynamics of these processes are not well-understood. This study used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and dual-pulse chronometric transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTMS) in two separate experiments to examine temporal dynamics within the temporal lobe during the retrieval of strong and weak associations. MEG results revealed a dissociation within left temporal cortex: anterior temporal lobe (ATL) showed greater oscillatory response for strong than weak associations, while posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) showed the reverse pattern. In the cTMS experiment, stimulation of ATL at ~150ms disrupted the efficient retrieval of strong associations, indicating a necessary role for ATL in coherent conceptual activations. Stimulation of pMTG at the onset of the second word disrupted the retrieval of weak associations, suggesting this site may maintain information about semantic context from the first word, allowing engagement of semantic control. Together these studies provide converging evidence for a functional dissociation within the temporal lobe, across both tasks and time.</description>

	<description>Cognitive neuroscientists of language comprehension study how neural computations relate to cognitive computations during comprehension. On the cognitive part of the equation, it is important that the computations and processing complexity are explicitly defined. Probabilistic language models can be used to give a computationally explicit account of language complexity during comprehension. Whereas such models have so far predominantly been evaluated against behavioral data, only recently have the models been used to explain neurobiological signals. Measures obtained from these models emphasize the probabilistic, information-processing view of language understanding and provide a set of tools that can be used for testing neural hypotheses about language comprehension. Here, we provide a cursory review of the theoretical foundations and example neuroimaging studies employing probabilistic language models. We highlight the advantages and potential pitfalls of this approach and indicate avenues for future research.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Long-term consolidation switches goal proximity coding from hippocampus to retrosplenial cortex</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/167882v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Recent research indicates the hippocampus may code the distance to the goal during navigation of newly learned environments. It is unclear however, whether this also pertains to highly familiar environments where extensive systems-level consolidation is thought to have transformed mnemonic representations. Here we recorded fMRI while University College London and Imperial College London students navigated virtual simulations of their own familiar campus (&amp;gt; 2 years of exposure) and the other campus learned days before scanning. Posterior hippocampal activity tracked the proximity to the goal in the newly learned campus, but not in the familiar campus. By contrast retrosplenial cortex tracked the distance to the goal in the familiar campus, but not in the recently learned campus. These responses were abolished when participants were guided to their goal by external cues. These results open new avenues of research on navigation and consolidation of spatial information and help advance models of how neural circuits support navigation in novel and highly familiar environments.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Memory retrieval recruits both innate and learned olfactoryprocessing centres in Drosophila</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/167312v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/167312v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Many animals can show either learned or innate behavioural responses to a given stimulus. However, how innate and memory circuits interact to produce an appropriate behavioural response is unknown. The Drosophila olfactory system is an excellent model to study how sensory stimuli are processed, stored and transformed into behaviour. Its numerical simplicity, powerful genetics and similarity to mammalian olfactory circuits have enabled many insights into sensory processing and memory. Two higher brain regions, the lateral horn (LH) and the mushroom body (MB) are thought to mediate innate and learned olfactory behaviour respectively, although the function of the LH has not been directly tested. Here we identify a LH cell-type (PD2a1/b1) that receives input from the MB. In contrast to the above model that LH is only necessary for innate behaviour, this cell-type is required for memory retrieval. Moreover, the activity of this cholinergic cell-type is modulated by training, indicating that memory information is passed to the innate olfactory processing centre. PD2a1/b1 dendrites likely receive input from appetitive olfactory projection neurons while their axons project to convergence zones of the MB extrinsic neurons and interdigitate with MB input and output neurons. This work demonstrates that LH neurons play a role in memory retrieval and illustrates the extensive interconnectivity of these two higher brain regions.</description>

In order to analyse large complex stochastic dynamical models such as those studied in systems biology there is currently a great need for both analytical tools and also algorithms for accurate and fast simulation and estimation. We present a new stochastic approximation of biological oscillators that addresses these needs. Our method, called phase-corrected LNA (pcLNA) overcomes the main limitations of the standard Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) to remain uniformly accurate for long times, still maintaining the speed and analytically tractability of the LNA. As part of this, we develop analytical expressions for key probability distributions and associated quantities, such as the Fisher Information Matrix and Kullback-Leibler divergence and we introduce a new approach to system-global sensitivity analysis. We also present algorithms for statistical inference and for long-term simulation of oscillating systems that are shown to be as accurate but much faster than leaping algorithms and algorithms for integration of diffusion equations. Stochastic versions of published models of the circadian clock and NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B system are used to illustrate our results.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lQP3vGwRoEk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Massive technological advances enabled high-throughput measurements of proteomic changes in biological processes. However, retrieving biological insights from large-scale protein dynamics data remains a challenging task. Here we used the mating differentiation in yeast &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; as a model and developed integrated experimental and computational approaches to analyze the proteomic dynamics during the process of cell fate determination. When exposed to a high dose of mating pheromone, the yeast cell undergoes growth arrest and forms a shmoo-like morphology; however, at intermediate doses, chemotropic elongated growth is initialized. To understand the gene regulatory networks that control this differentiation switch, we employed a high-throughput microfluidic imaging system that allows real-time and simultaneous measurements of cell growth and protein expression. Using kinetic modeling of protein dynamics, we classified the stimulus-dependent changes in protein abundance into two sources: global changes due to physiological alterations and gene-specific changes. A quantitative framework was proposed to decouple gene-specific regulatory modes from the growth-dependent global modulation of protein abundance. Based on the temporal patterns of gene-specific regulation, we established the network architectures underlying distinct cell fates using a reverse engineering method and uncovered the dose-dependent rewiring of gene regulatory network during mating differentiation. Furthermore, our results suggested a potential crosstalk between the pheromone response pathway and the target of rapamycin (TOR)-regulated ribosomal biogenesis pathway, which might underlie a cell differentiation switch in yeast mating response. In summary, our modeling approach addresses the distinct impacts of the global and gene-specific regulation on the control of protein dynamics and provides new insights into the mechanisms of cell fate determination. We anticipate that our integrated experimental and modeling strategies could be widely applicable to other biological systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kbFyR5Y8Az4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-adrenergic signaling broadly contributes to LTP induction</title>

Long-lasting forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) represent one of the major cellular mechanisms underlying learning and memory. One of the fundamental questions in the field of LTP is why different molecules are critical for long-lasting forms of LTP induced by diverse experimental protocols. Further complexity stems from spatial aspects of signaling networks, such that some molecules function in the dendrite and some are critical in the spine. We investigated whether the diverse experimental evidence can be unified by creating a spatial, mechanistic model of multiple signaling pathways in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Our results show that the combination of activity of several key kinases can predict the occurrence of long-lasting forms of LTP for multiple experimental protocols. Specifically Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin activated kinase II, protein kinase A and exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac) together predict the occurrence of LTP in response to strong stimulation (multiple trains of 100 Hz) or weak stimulation augmented by isoproterenol. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that activation of the &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-adrenergic receptor either via canonical (G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled) or non-canonical (G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled) pathways underpins most forms of long-lasting LTP. Simulations make the experimentally testable predictions that a complete antagonist of the &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-adrenergic receptor will likely block long-lasting LTP in response to strong stimulation. Collectively these results suggest that converging molecular mechanisms allow CA1 neurons to flexibly utilize signaling mechanisms best tuned to temporal pattern of synaptic input to achieve long-lasting LTP and memory storage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9MAgSMQVKUQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: MrTADFinder: A network modularity based approach to identify topologically associating domains in multiple resolutions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005647</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Koon-Kiu Yan, Shaoke Lou, Mark Gerstein&lt;/p&gt;

Genome-wide proximity ligation based assays such as Hi-C have revealed that eukaryotic genomes are organized into structural units called topologically associating domains (TADs). From a visual examination of the chromosomal contact map, however, it is clear that the organization of the domains is not simple or obvious. Instead, TADs exhibit various length scales and, in many cases, a nested arrangement. Here, by exploiting the resemblance between TADs in a chromosomal contact map and densely connected modules in a network, we formulate TAD identification as a network optimization problem and propose an algorithm, MrTADFinder, to identify TADs from intra-chromosomal contact maps. MrTADFinder is based on the network-science concept of modularity. A key component of it is deriving an appropriate background model for contacts in a random chain, by numerically solving a set of matrix equations. The background model preserves the observed coverage of each genomic bin as well as the distance dependence of the contact frequency for any pair of bins exhibited by the empirical map. Also, by introducing a tunable resolution parameter, MrTADFinder provides a self-consistent approach for identifying TADs at different length scales, hence the acronym &quot;Mr&quot; standing for Multiple Resolutions. We then apply MrTADFinder to various Hi-C datasets. The identified domain boundaries are marked by characteristic signatures in chromatin marks and transcription factors (TF) that are consistent with earlier work. Moreover, by calling TADs at different length scales, we observe that boundary signatures change with resolution, with different chromatin features having different characteristic length scales. Furthermore, we report an enrichment of HOT (high-occupancy target) regions near TAD boundaries and investigate the role of different TFs in determining boundaries at various resolutions. To further explore the interplay between TADs and epigenetic marks, as tumor mutational burden is known to be coupled to chromatin structure, we examine how somatic mutations are distributed across boundaries and find a clear stepwise pattern. Overall, MrTADFinder provides a novel computational framework to explore the multi-scale structures in Hi-C contact maps.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6Ij5D2Pzpdk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Capturing the diversity of biological tuning curves using generative adversarial networks</title>

	<description>Tuning curves characterizing the response selectivities of biological neurons often exhibit large degrees of irregularity and diversity across neurons. Theoretical network models that feature heterogeneous cell populations or random connectivity also give rise to diverse tuning curves. However, a general framework for fitting such models to experimentally measured tuning curves is lacking. We address this problem by proposing to view mechanistic network models as generative models whose parameters can be optimized to fit the distribution of experimentally measured tuning curves. A major obstacle for fitting such models is that their likelihood function is not explicitly available or is highly intractable to compute. Recent advances in machine learning provide ways for fitting generative models without the need to evaluate the likelihood and its gradient. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) provide one such framework which has been successful in traditional machine learning tasks. We apply this approach in two separate experiments, showing how GANs can be used to fit commonly used mechanistic models in theoretical neuroscience to datasets of measured tuning curves. This fitting procedure avoids the computationally expensive step of inferring latent variables, e.g. the biophysical parameters of individual cells or the particular realization of the full synaptic connectivity matrix, and directly learns model parameters which characterize the statistics of connectivity or of single-cell properties. Another strength of this approach is that it fits the entire, joint distribution of experimental tuning curves, instead of matching a few summary statistics picked a priori by the user. More generally, this framework opens the door to fitting theoretically motivated dynamical network models directly to simultaneously or non-simultaneously recorded neural responses.</description>

	<description>The misfolding and accumulation of tau protein into intracellular aggregates known as neurofibrillary tangles is a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease. However, while tau propagation is a known marker for disease progression, exactly how tau propagates from one cell to another and what mechanisms govern this spread are still unclear. Here, we report that cellular internalization of tau is regulated by quaternary structure and have developed a cellular assay to screen for genetic modulators of tau uptake. Using CRISPRi technology we have tested 3200 genes for their ability to regulate tau entry and identified enzymes in the heparan sulfate proteoglycan biosynthetic pathway as key regulators. We show that 6-O-sulfation is critical for tau-heparan sulfate interactions and that this modification regulates uptake in human central nervous system cell lines, iPS-derived neurons, and mouse organotypic brain slice culture. Together, these results suggest novel strategies to halt tau transmission.</description>

	<description>Humans excel at selectively listening to a target speaker in background noise such as competing voices. While the encoding of speech in the auditory cortex is modulated by selective attention, it remains debated whether such modulation occurs already in subcortical auditory structures. Investigating the contribution of the human brainstem to attention has, in particular, been hindered by the tiny amplitude of the brainstem response. Its measurement normally requires a large number of repetitions of the same short sound stimuli, which may lead to a loss of attention and to neural adaptation. Here we develop a mathematical method to measure the auditory brainstem response to running speech, an acoustic stimulus that does not repeat and that has a high ecological validity. We employ this method to assess the brainstem's activity when a subject listens to one of two competing speakers, and show that the brainstem response is consistently modulated by attention.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Schizophrenia Exhibits Bi-Directional Brain-Wide Alterations in Cortico-Striato-Cerebellar Circuits</title>

	<description>Distributed neural dysconnectivity is considered a hallmark feature of schizophrenia, yet a tension exists between studies pinpointing focal disruptions versus those implicating brain-wide disturbances. The cerebellum and the striatum communicate reciprocally with the thalamus and cerebral cortex through monosynaptic and polysynaptic connections, forming cortico-striatal-thalamic-cerebellar (CSTC) functional pathways that may be sensitive to brain-wide dysconnectivity in schizophrenia. It remains unknown if the same brain-wide pattern of alterations persists across CSTC systems, or if specific alterations exist along key functional elements of these networks. We characterized whole-brain cerebellar and striatal connectivity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in 159 chronic schizophrenia patients and 162 matched controls, along each major cerebellar and striatal functional subdivision. Both cerebellar and striatal associative subdivisions revealed consistent brain-wide bi-directional alterations in patients relative to controls, marked by hyper-connectivity with bilateral sensory-motor cortices and hypo-connectivity with association cortex. These results implicate a consistent motif of brain-wide alterations in cortico-striato-cerebellar systems in schizophrenia, calling into question accounts of exclusively focal functional connectivity disturbances.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Paleo-Oscillomics: Reconstructing Language-Relevant Computational Capacities in Neanderthals from the Molecular Basis of Neural Oscillations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/167528v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Language seemingly evolved from changes in brain anatomy and wiring. We argue that language evolution can be better understood if particular changes in phasal and cross-frequency coupling properties of neural oscillations, resulting in core features of language, are considered. Because we cannot track the oscillatory activity of the brain from extinct hominins, we used our current understanding of the language oscillogenome (that is, the set of genes responsible for basic aspects of the oscillatory activity relevant for language) to infer some properties of the Neanderthal oscillome. We have found that several candidates for the language oscillogenome show differences in their methylation patterns between Neanderthals and humans. We argue that differences in their expression levels could be informative of differences in cognitive functions important for language.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Transmitter Co-Expression Reveals Key Organizational Principles of Local Interneuron Heterogeneity in the Olfactory System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/167403v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Heterogeneity of individual neurons within a population expands the computational power of the entire neural network. However, the organizing principles that support heterogeneity within a neuronal class are often poorly understood. Here, we focus on a highly heterogeneous population of local interneurons whose traits co-vary seemingly at random. We asked if local interneurons (LNs) in the antennal lobe (AL) of Manduca sexta express fixed, predictable combinations of neurotransmitters, or if transmitter co-expression can be explained by random probability. We systematically determined the co-expression of neuropeptides and GABA by LNs and found variable patterns of co-expression for all neuropeptides, except for tachykininergic LNs which exhibited highly stereotyped co-expression on a neuron-by-neuron basis. To test if observed patterns of co-expression were random, we used a computational model and found that the probabilities of transmitter co-expression cannot be explained by independent expression of each transmitter. We also determined that setting a single rule in the model, while leaving the rest of the co-expression up to random probability, allowed the model to replicate the overall heterogeneity of transmitter co-expression across antennal lobe LNs. This implies that certain co-expression relationships contribute to the ground plan of the AL, but that otherwise, transmitter expression amongst LNs may be random, allowing heterogeneous co-expression patterns to emerge. Furthermore, neuropeptide receptor expression suggests that peptidergic signaling from LNs may simultaneously target olfactory receptor neurons, LNs and projection neurons, and thus the effects of different peptides do not segregate based on principal AL cell type. Our data suggest that while specific constraints may partially shape transmitter co-expression in LNs, a large amount of flexibility on a neuron-by-neuron basis produces heterogeneous network parameters.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Risk factor profile of different clinical manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease - data from SHEF-CSVD Study.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/167221v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/167221v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>BACKGROUND: Little is known of the mechanisms of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Both atherosclerosis or non-atherosclerotic diffuse arteriopathy are involved. METHODS: A single-center, prospective, case-control study was performed in consecutive patients with different CSVD manifestations. The study group consisted of 205 patients: 52 with lacunar stroke (LS), 20 with subcortical hemorrhagic stroke (HS), 50 with vascular dementia (VaD), 28 with vascular parkinsonism (VaP) and 55 controls (CG) free of cerebrovascular disease but with high vascular risk. RESULTS: Patients with CSVD had significantly higher prevalence of vascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, polymetabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease. Patients with CSVD had also significantly higher fasting blood glucose, homocysteine, fibrinogen, systolic blood pressure, IMT values and lower eGFR, albumin and HDL levels. After adjustment for age and sex, low eGFR, albumin and high levels of uric acid and fibrinogen were associated with all CSVD groups, elevated fasting glucose was related to LS and HS. In the multivariate analysiss, the independent predictors for CSVD were female sex, low albumin, high fibrinogen, fasting glucose and uric acid. Patients with LS had significantly higher IMT values comparing to other CSVD groups, patients with VaP had a trend towards higher homocysteine levels. CONCLUSION: Risk factor profile for CSVD as a whole differs from subjects with proatherogenic profile without history of cerebrovascular disease. Our results support the concept that CSVD is not homogeneous, and that unique risk factors profiles exist for different clinical manifestations of the disease.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Harmonic brain modes: a unifying framework for linking space and time in brain dynamics</title>

	<description>A fundamental characteristic of spontaneous brain activity is coherent oscillations covering a wide range of frequencies. Interestingly, these temporal oscillations are highly correlated among spatially distributed cortical areas forming structured correlation patterns known as the resting state networks, although the brain is never truly at 'rest'. Here, we introduce the concept of &quot;harmonic brain modes&quot; - fundamental building blocks of complex spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity. We define these elementary harmonic brain modes as harmonic modes of structural connectivity; i.e. connectome harmonics, yielding fully synchronous neural activity patterns with different frequency oscillations emerging on and constraint by the particular structure of the brain. Hence, this particular definition implicitly links the hitherto poorly understood dimensions of space and time in brain dynamics and its underlying anatomy. Further we show how harmonic brain modes can explain the relationship between neurophysiological, temporal and network-level changes in the brain across different mental states; (wakefulness, sleep, anaesthesia, psychedelic). Notably, when decoded as activation of connectome harmonics, spatial and temporal characteristics of neural activity naturally emerge from the interplay between excitation and inhibition and this critical relation fits the spatial, temporal and neurophysiological changes associated with different mental states. Thus, the introduced framework of harmonic brain modes not only establishes a relation between the spatial structure of correlation patterns and temporal oscillations (linking space and time in brain dynamics), but also enables a new dimension of tools for understanding fundamental principles underlying brain dynamics in different states of consciousness.</description>

Only matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) was validated; in pre-PML patients, MMP9 protein levels were significantly reduced at baseline compared with NTZ-ctr patients, and levels remained lower at later time points during NTZ treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Correlated gene expression and anatomical communication support synchronized brain activity in the mouse functional connectome</title>

	<description>Cognition and behavior depend on synchronized intrinsic brain activity which is organized into functional networks across the brain. Research has investigated how anatomical connectivity both shapes and is shaped by these networks, but not how anatomical connectivity interacts with intra-areal molecular properties to drive functional connectivity. Here, we present a novel linear model to explain functional connectivity in the mouse brain by integrating systematically obtained measurements of axonal connectivity, gene expression, and resting state functional connectivity MRI. The model suggests that functional connectivity arises from synergies between anatomical links and inter-areal similarities in gene expression. By estimating these interactions, we identify anatomical modules in which correlated gene expression and anatomical connectivity cooperatively, versus distinctly, support functional connectivity. Along with providing evidence that not all genes equally contribute to functional connectivity, this research establishes new insights regarding the biological underpinnings of coordinated brain activity measured by BOLD fMRI.</description>

Multiple physiological systems interact throughout the development of a complex disease. Knowledge of the dynamics and connectivity of interactions across physiological systems could facilitate the prevention or mitigation of organ damage underlying complex diseases, many of which are currently refractory to available therapeutics (e.g., hypertension). We studied the regulatory interactions operating within and across organs throughout disease development by integrating &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; analysis of gene expression dynamics with a reverse engineering approach to infer data-driven dynamic network models of multi-organ gene regulatory influences. We obtained experimental data on the expression of 22 genes across five organs, over a time span that encompassed the development of autonomic nervous system dysfunction and hypertension. We pursued a unique approach for identification of continuous-time models that jointly described the dynamics and structure of multi-organ networks by estimating a sparse subset of ∼12,000 possible gene regulatory interactions. Our analyses revealed that an autonomic dysfunction-specific multi-organ sequence of gene expression activation patterns was associated with a distinct gene regulatory network. We analyzed the model structures for adaptation motifs, and identified disease-specific network motifs involving genes that exhibited aberrant temporal dynamics. Bioinformatic analyses identified disease-specific single nucleotide variants within or near transcription factor binding sites upstream of key genes implicated in maintaining physiological homeostasis. Our approach illustrates a novel framework for investigating the pathogenesis through model-based analysis of multi-organ system dynamics and network properties. Our results yielded novel candidate molecular targets driving the development of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and immune dysfunction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ys5ZveOcoRU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The increasing number of recording electrodes enhances the capability of
capturing the network's cooperative activity, however, using too many monitors
might alter the properties of the measured neural network and induce noise.
Using a technique that merges simultaneous multi-patch-clamp and
multi-electrode array recordings of neural networks in-vitro, we show that the
membrane potential of a single neuron is a reliable and super-sensitive probe
for monitoring such cooperative activities and their detailed rhythms.
Specifically, the membrane potential and the spiking activity of a single
neuron are either highly correlated or highly anti-correlated with the
time-dependent macroscopic activity of the entire network. This surprising
observation also sheds light on the cooperative origin of neuronal burst in
cultured networks. Our findings present an alternative flexible approach to the
technique based on a massive tiling of networks by large-scale arrays of
electrodes to monitor their activity.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06539</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Catastrophic failures are complete and sudden collapses in the activity of
large networks such as economics, electrical power grids and computer networks,
which typically require a manual recovery process. Here we experimentally show
that excitatory neural networks are governed by a non-Poissonian reoccurrence
of catastrophic failures, where their repetition time follows a multimodal
distribution characterized by a few tenths of a second and tens of seconds
timescales. The mechanism underlying the termination and reappearance of
network activity is quantitatively shown here to be associated with nodal
time-dependent features, neuronal plasticity, where hyperactive nodes damage
the response capability of their neighbors. It presents a complementary
mechanism for the emergence of Poissonian catastrophic failures from damage
conductivity. The effect that hyperactive nodes degenerate their neighbors
represents a type of local competition which is a common feature in the
dynamics of real-world complex networks, whereas their spontaneous recoveries
represent a vitality which enhances reliable functionality.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06501</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural networks are composed of neurons and synapses, which are responsible
for learning in a slow adaptive dynamical process. Here we experimentally show
that neurons act like independent anisotropic multiplex hubs, which relay and
mute incoming signals following their input directions. Theoretically, the
observed information routing enriches the computational capabilities of neurons
by allowing, for instance, equalization among different information routes in
the network, as well as high-frequency transmission of complex time-dependent
signals constructed via several parallel routes. In addition, this kind of hubs
adaptively eliminate very noisy neurons from the dynamics of the network,
preventing masking of information transmission. The timescales for these
features are several seconds at most, as opposed to the imprint of information
by the synaptic plasticity, a process which exceeds minutes. Results open the
horizon to the understanding of fast and adaptive learning realities in higher
cognitive functionalities of the brain.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06314</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging is a technique for observing neuron activity as a series of
images showing indicator fluorescence over time. Manually segmenting neurons is
time-consuming, leading to research on automated calcium imaging segmentation
(ACIS). We evaluated several deep learning models for ACIS on the Neurofinder
competition datasets and report our best model: U-Net2DS, a fully convolutional
network that operates on 2D mean summary images. U-Net2DS requires minimal
domain-specific pre/post-processing and parameter adjustment, and predictions
are made on full $512\times512$ images at $\approx$9K images per minute. It
ranks third in the Neurofinder competition ($F_1=0.569$) and is the best model
to exclusively use deep learning. We also demonstrate useful segmentations on
data from outside the competition. The model's simplicity, speed, and quality
results make it a practical choice for ACIS and a strong baseline for more
complex models in the future.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Grandmothering and cognitive resources are required for the emergence of menopause and extensive post-reproductive lifespan</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Carla Aimé, Jean-Baptiste André, Michel Raymond&lt;/p&gt;

Menopause, the permanent cessation of ovulation, occurs in humans well before the end of the expected lifespan, leading to an extensive post-reproductive period which remains a puzzle for evolutionary biologists. All human populations display this particularity; thus, it is difficult to empirically evaluate the conditions for its emergence. In this study, we used artificial neural networks to model the emergence and evolution of allocation decisions related to reproduction in simulated populations. When allocation decisions were allowed to freely evolve, both menopause and extensive post-reproductive life-span emerged under some ecological conditions. This result allowed us to test various hypotheses about the required conditions for the emergence of menopause and extensive post-reproductive life-span. Our findings did not support the Maternal Hypothesis (menopause has evolved to avoid the risk of dying in childbirth, which is higher in older women). In contrast, results supported a shared prediction from the Grandmother Hypothesis and the Embodied Capital Model. Indeed, we found that extensive post-reproductive lifespan allows resource reallocation to increase fertility of the children and survival of the grandchildren. Furthermore, neural capital development and the skill intensiveness of the foraging niche, rather than strength, played a major role in shaping the age profile of somatic and cognitive senescence in our simulated populations. This result supports the Embodied Capital Model rather than the Grand-Mother Hypothesis. Finally, in simulated populations where menopause had already evolved, we found that reduced post-reproductive lifespan lead to reduced children’s fertility and grandchildren’s survival. The results are discussed in the context of the evolutionary emergence of menopause and extensive post-reproductive life-span.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FLi13w3u1O8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that threatens over half of the world’s population. Despite being endemic to more than 100 countries, government-led efforts and tools for timely identification and tracking of new infections are still lacking in many affected areas. Multiple methodologies that leverage the use of Internet-based data sources have been proposed as a way to complement dengue surveillance efforts. Among these, dengue-related Google search trends have been shown to correlate with dengue activity. We extend a methodological framework, initially proposed and validated for flu surveillance, to produce near real-time estimates of dengue cases in five countries/states: Mexico, Brazil, Thailand, Singapore and Taiwan. Our result shows that our modeling framework can be used to improve the tracking of dengue activity in multiple locations around the world.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/g9WDk61r5gY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Many daily situations require us to track multiple objects and people. This ability has traditionally been investigated in observers tracking objects in a plane. This simplification of reality does not address how observers track objects when targets move in three dimensions. Here, we study how observers track multiple objects in 2D and 3D while manipulating the average speed of the objects and the average distance between them. We show that performance declines as speed increases and distance decreases and that overall tracking accuracy is always higher in 3D than in 2D. The effects of distance and dimensionality interact to produce a more than additive improvement in performance during tracking in 3D compared to 2D. We propose an ideal observer model that uses the object dynamics and noisy observations to track the objects. This model provides a good fit to the data and explains the key findings of our experiment as originating from improved inference of object identity by adding the depth dimension.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5xtwHhtdOOU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Meric Ataman, Vassily Hatzimanikatis&lt;/p&gt;

In the post-genomic era, Genome-scale metabolic networks (GEMs) have emerged as invaluable tools to understand metabolic capabilities of organisms. Different parts of these metabolic networks are defined as subsystems/pathways, which are sets of &lt;i&gt;functional roles&lt;/i&gt; to implement a specific biological process or structural complex, such as glycolysis and TCA cycle. Subsystem/pathway definition is also employed to delineate the biosynthetic routes that produce biomass building blocks. In databases, such as MetaCyc and SEED, these representations are composed of linear routes from precursors to target biomass building blocks. However, this approach cannot capture the nested, complex nature of GEMs. Here we implemented an algorithm, lumpGEM, which generates biosynthetic subnetworks composed of reactions that can synthesize a target metabolite from a set of defined &lt;i&gt;core&lt;/i&gt; precursor metabolites. lumpGEM captures balanced subnetworks, which account for the fate of all metabolites along the synthesis routes, thus encapsulating reactions from various subsystems/pathways to balance these metabolites in the metabolic network. Moreover, lumpGEM collapses these subnetworks into elementally balanced lumped reactions that specify the cost of all precursor metabolites and cofactors. It also generates alternative subnetworks and lumped reactions for the same metabolite, accounting for the flexibility of organisms. lumpGEM is applicable to any GEM and any target metabolite defined in the network. Lumped reactions generated by lumpGEM can be also used to generate properly balanced reduced core metabolic models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JpBFS6QYJ4E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions have proven to be valuable resources in enhancing our understanding of metabolic networks as they encapsulate all known metabolic capabilities of the organisms from genes to proteins to their functions. However the complexity of these large metabolic networks often hinders their utility in various practical applications. Although reduced models are commonly used for modeling and in integrating experimental data, they are often inconsistent across different studies and laboratories due to different criteria and detail, which can compromise transferability of the findings and also integration of experimental data from different groups. In this study, we have developed a systematic semi-automatic approach to reduce genome-scale models into core models in a consistent and logical manner focusing on the central metabolism or subsystems of interest. The method minimizes the loss of information using an approach that combines graph-based search and optimization methods. The resulting core models are shown to be able to capture key properties of the genome-scale models and preserve consistency in terms of biomass and by-product yields, flux and concentration variability and gene essentiality. The development of these “consistently-reduced” models will help to clarify and facilitate integration of different experimental data to draw new understanding that can be directly extendable to genome-scale models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HiU0arwIdrw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous estimates of the utility of polygenic risk score analysis for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease have given Area Under the Curve estimates of &amp;lt;80%. However, these have been based on the genetic analysis of clinical case control series. Here we apply the same analytic approaches to a pathological case control series and show a predictive AUC of 84%. We suggest that this analysis has clinical utility and that there is limited room for further improvement using genetic data. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Oscillations and irregular persistent firing patterns in a homogeneous network of excitatory stochastic neurons with gap junctions in the mean-field limit. (arXiv:1707.06038v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06038</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06038</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We continue the work of a series of previous studies of a mathematical model
that describes the mean-field limit behavior of a homogeneous network of
excitatory point spiking neurons. Contrary to other models, here noise is
intrinsic to the neurons through a membrane-potential dependent spiking rate
probability, that we assume to be given by a power law. This allows one to
collapse several sources of neural noise into a single function, which aids for
a more treatable mathematical and comptuational analysis. In particular, we
give pseudo-analytical expressions for the invariant distributions of membrane
potentials across the population and study their stability computationally. The
neurons are assumed to be connected both by chemical and possibly electrical
(gap junction) synapses and can also undergo a leakage of ions with the
extracellular medium. The distributions are of compact support whenever leakage
or gap junction rates are non-zero and an infinite discontinuity appears at the
maximum potential in the population. This happens invariably for the leakage
(with no gap junctions) and gap junction (without leakage) cases. However,
these discontinuous distributions might only be stable for linear spiking rate
functions. It was recently shown how the network can present highly synchronous
states of global oscillations in its activity when leakage is not present and
gap junctions are strong enough. Here we confirm how oscillations persist also
when weak leakage is considered. Thus, these dendritic (rather than axonal) gap
junctions could play a role in the high levels of neural synchrony necessary
for the development of neural systems at young ages. The model, thus, presents
a rich phenomenology and capability to reproduce several biological features of
neural networks despite of its mathematical simplicity, hence presenting a
powerful tool for high performance computing.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Multidimensional classification of hippocampal shape features discriminates Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment from normal aging. (arXiv:1707.05961v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05961</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05961</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We describe a new method to automatically discriminate between patients with
Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and elderly
controls, based on multidimensional classification of hippocampal shape
features. This approach uses spherical harmonics (SPHARM) coefficients to model
the shape of the hippocampi, which are segmented from magnetic resonance images
(MRI) using a fully automatic method that we previously developed. SPHARM
coefficients are used as features in a classification procedure based on
support vector machines (SVM). The most relevant features for classification
are selected using a bagging strategy. We evaluate the accuracy of our method
in a group of 23 patients with AD (10 males, 13 females, age $\pm$
standard-deviation (SD) = 73 $\pm$ 6 years, mini-mental score (MMS) = 24.4
$\pm$ 2.8), 23 patients with amnestic MCI (10 males, 13 females, age $\pm$ SD =
74 $\pm$ 8 years, MMS = 27.3 $\pm$ 1.4) and 25 elderly healthy controls (13
males, 12 females, age $\pm$ SD = 64 $\pm$ 8 years), using leave-one-out
cross-validation. For AD vs controls, we obtain a correct classification rate
of 94%, a sensitivity of 96%, and a specificity of 92%. For MCI vs controls, we
obtain a classification rate of 83%, a sensitivity of 83%, and a specificity of
84%. This accuracy is superior to that of hippocampal volumetry and is
comparable to recently published SVM-based whole-brain classification methods,
which relied on a different strategy. This new method may become a useful tool
to assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05952</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05952</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive function requires the coordination of neural activity across many
scales, from neurons and circuits to large-scale networks. As such, it is
unlikely that an explanatory framework focused upon any single scale will yield
a comprehensive theory of brain activity and cognitive function. Modelling and
analysis methods for neuroscience should aim to accommodate multiscale
phenomena. Emerging research now suggests that multi-scale processes in the
brain arise from so-called critical phenomena that occur very broadly in the
natural world. Criticality arises in complex systems perched between order and
disorder, and is marked by fluctuations that do not have any privileged spatial
or temporal scale. We review the core nature of criticality, the evidence
supporting its role in neural systems and its explanatory potential in brain
health and disease.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Low-dimensional spike rate models derived from networks of adaptive integrate-and-fire neurons: Comparison and implementation. (arXiv:1611.07999v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07999</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07999</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The spiking activity of single neurons can be well described by a nonlinear
integrate-and-fire model that includes somatic adaptation. When exposed to
fluctuating inputs sparsely coupled populations of these model neurons exhibit
stochastic collective dynamics that can be effectively characterized using the
Fokker-Planck equation. [...] Here we derive from that description four simple
models for the spike rate dynamics in terms of low-dimensional ordinary
differential equations using two different reduction techniques: one uses the
spectral decomposition of the Fokker-Planck operator, the other is based on a
cascade of two linear filters and a nonlinearity, which are determined from the
Fokker-Planck equation and semi-analytically approximated. We evaluate the
reduced models for a wide range of biologically plausible input statistics and
find that both approximation approaches lead to spike rate models that
accurately reproduce the spiking behavior of the underlying adaptive
integrate-and-fire population. [...] The low-dimensional models also well
reproduce stable oscillatory spike rate dynamics that is generated by recurrent
synaptic excitation and neuronal adaptation. [...] We have made available
implementations that allow to numerically integrate the low-dimensional spike
rate models as well as the Fokker-Planck partial differential equation in
efficient ways for arbitrary model parametrizations as open source software.
The derived spike rate descriptions retain a direct link to the properties of
single neurons, allow for convenient mathematical analyses of network states,
and are well suited for application in neural mass/mean-field based brain
network models.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Automatic analysis and 3D-modelling of Hi-C data using TADbit reveals structural features of the fly chromatin colors</title>

The sequence of a genome is insufficient to understand all genomic processes carried out in the cell nucleus. To achieve this, the knowledge of its three-dimensional architecture is necessary. Advances in genomic technologies and the development of new analytical methods, such as Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) and its derivatives, provide unprecedented insights in the spatial organization of genomes. Here we present TADbit, a computational framework to analyze and model the chromatin fiber in three dimensions. Our package takes as input the sequencing reads of 3C-based experiments and performs the following main tasks: (i) pre-process the reads, (ii) map the reads to a reference genome, (iii) filter and normalize the interaction data, (iv) analyze the resulting interaction matrices, (v) build 3D models of selected genomic domains, and (vi) analyze the resulting models to characterize their structural properties. To illustrate the use of TADbit, we automatically modeled 50 genomic domains from the fly genome revealing differential structural features of the previously defined chromatin colors, establishing a link between the conformation of the genome and the local chromatin composition. TADbit provides three-dimensional models built from 3C-based experiments, which are ready for visualization and for characterizing their relation to gene expression and epigenetic states. TADbit is an open-source Python library available for download from https://github.com/3DGenomes/tadbit.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KcHEgsnKcOA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24985-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed prospective data from 665 consecutive CEEGs, including clinical factors and time-to-event emergence of electroencephalographic (EEG) findings over 72 hours. Clinical factors were selected using logistic regression. EEG risk factors were selected a priori. Clinical factors were used for baseline (pre-EEG) risk. EEG findings were used for the creation of a multistate survival model with 3 states (entry, EEG risk, and seizure). EEG risk state is defined by emergence of epileptiform patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

If there were no epileptiform findings on EEG, the risk of seizures within 72 hours was between 9% (no clinical risk factors) and 36% (coma and history of seizures). If epileptiform findings developed, the seizure incidence was between 18% (no clinical risk factors) and 64% (coma and history of seizures). In the absence of epileptiform EEG abnormalities, the duration of monitoring needed for seizure risk of &amp;lt;5% was between 0.4 hours (for patients who are not comatose and had no prior seizure) and 16.4 hours (comatose and prior seizure).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The risk of developing seizures on CEEG decays to &amp;lt;5% by 24 hours if no epileptiform EEG abnormalities emerge, independent of initial clinical risk factors.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Utility of Phase Models in Studying Neural Synchronization. (arXiv:1707.05713v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synchronized neural spiking is associated with many cognitive functions and
thus, merits study for its own sake. The analysis of neural synchronization
naturally leads to the study of repetitive spiking and consequently to the
analysis of coupled neural oscillators. Coupled oscillator theory thus informs
the synchronization of spiking neuronal networks. A crucial aspect of coupled
oscillator theory is the phase response curve (PRC), which describes the impact
of a perturbation to the phase of an oscillator. In neural terms, the
perturbation represents an incoming synaptic potential which may either advance
or retard the timing of the next spike. The phase response curves and the form
of coupling between reciprocally coupled oscillators defines the phase
interaction function, which in turn predicts the synchronization outcome
(in-phase versus anti-phase) and the rate of convergence. We review the two
classes of PRC and demonstrate the utility of the phase model in predicting
synchronization in reciprocally coupled neural models. In addition, we compare
the rate of convergence for all combinations of reciprocally coupled Class I
and Class II oscillators. These findings predict the general synchronization
outcomes of broad classes of neurons under both inhibitory and excitatory
reciprocal coupling.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neuronal paradigm of studying the brain has left us with major
limitations in both our understanding of how neurons process information to
achieve biological intelligence and how such knowledge can be translated into
artificial intelligence. Overturning our fundamental assumptions of how the
brain works, the recent exploration of glia is revealing that these
long-neglected brain cells, and in particular astrocytes, dynamically
contribute to and regulate neuronal activity by interacting with neurons at the
synaptic level. Following recent glial-specific in vivo calcium imaging
studies, we built a biologically-constrained model of an astrocytic-neural
network and analyzed the dynamics of the astrocyte-neural interaction. We show
that the inclusion of astrocytes was sufficient to trigger transitions between
learned states in a Hopfield-type model of memory. The timing of the
transitions was governed by the dynamics of the calcium-dependent slow-currents
in the astrocytic processes ensheathing the synapses. Our results align with
calcium imaging studies that in the last several years have revealed that
astrocytes respond to neural activity on a much faster timescale than
previously believed, and provide a possible computational mechanism for the
long-suspected role of astrocytes in learning and memory. Overall, this paper
aims to steer and expand our concept of information processing in the brain to
include non-neuronal elements.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Brain activity mapping from MEG data via a hierarchical Bayesian algorithm with automatic depth weighting: sensitivity and specificity analysis. (arXiv:1707.05639v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05639</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05639</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A recently proposed IAS MEG inverse solver algorithm, based on the coupling
of a hierarchical Bayesian model with computationally efficient Krylov subspace
linear solver, has been shown to perform well for both superficial and deep
brain sources. However, a systematic study of its sensitivity and specificity
as a function of the activity location is still missing. We propose novel
statistical protocols to quantify the performance of MEG inverse solvers,
focusing in particular on their sensitivity and specificity in identifying
active brain regions. We use these protocols for a systematic study of the
sensitivity and specificity of the IAS MEG inverse solver, comparing the
performance with three standard inversion methods, wMNE, dSPM, and sLORETA. To
avoid the bias of anecdotal tests towards a particular algorithm, the proposed
protocols are Monte Carlo sampling based, generating an ensemble of activity
patches in each brain region identified in a given atlas. The sensitivity is
measured by how much, on average, the reconstructed activity is concentrated in
the brain region of the simulated active patch. The specificity analysis is
based on Bayes factors, interpreting the estimated current activity as data for
testing the hypothesis that the active brain region is correctly identified,
vs. the hypothesis of any erroneous attribution. The methodology allows the
presence of a single or several simultaneous activity regions, without assuming
the knowledge of the number of active regions. The testing protocols suggest
that the IAS solver performs well in terms of sensitivity and specificity both
with cortical and subcortical activity estimation.

&lt;p&gt;Microglia play a part in protein clearance and synaptic pruning. This latter process is re-activated in Alzheimer disease (AD) and promoted by amyloid-β (Aβ). A screen of 18 AD-associated genes revealed that loss of the DNA–RNA binding protein TDP43 led to a considerable increase in &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mice, the ventricular–subventricular zone (V–SVZ) continuously produces neural stem cells (NSCs). Proopiomelanocortin-expressing (POMC+) neurons of the hypothalamus were found to project selectively to anterior ventral (AV) regions of the V–SVZ. Ablation of these neurons decreased NSC proliferation selectively in the AV V–SVZ, &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: CLIC, a tool for expanding biological pathways based on co-expression across thousands of datasets</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005653</guid>

In recent years, there has been a huge rise in the number of publicly available transcriptional profiling datasets. These massive compendia comprise billions of measurements and provide a special opportunity to predict the function of unstudied genes based on co-expression to well-studied pathways. Such analyses can be very challenging, however, since biological pathways are modular and may exhibit co-expression only in specific contexts. To overcome these challenges we introduce CLIC, CLustering by Inferred Co-expression. CLIC accepts as input a pathway consisting of two or more genes. It then uses a Bayesian partition model to simultaneously partition the input gene set into coherent co-expressed modules (CEMs), while assigning the posterior probability for each dataset in support of each CEM. CLIC then expands each CEM by scanning the transcriptome for additional co-expressed genes, quantified by an integrated log-likelihood ratio (LLR) score weighted for each dataset. As a byproduct, CLIC automatically learns the conditions (datasets) within which a CEM is operative. We implemented CLIC using a compendium of 1774 mouse microarray datasets (28628 microarrays) or 1887 human microarray datasets (45158 microarrays). CLIC analysis reveals that of 910 canonical biological pathways, 30% consist of strongly co-expressed gene modules for which new members are predicted. For example, CLIC predicts a functional connection between protein C7orf55 (FMC1) and the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex that we have experimentally validated. CLIC is freely available at www.gene-clic.org. We anticipate that CLIC will be valuable both for revealing new components of biological pathways as well as the conditions in which they are active.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lWN2PxpEdkA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Stress-induced mutagenesis: Stress diversity facilitates the persistence of mutator genes</title>

Mutator strains are expected to evolve when the availability and effect of beneficial mutations are high enough to counteract the disadvantage from deleterious mutations that will inevitably accumulate. As the population becomes more adapted to its environment, both availability and effect of beneficial mutations necessarily decrease and mutation rates are predicted to decrease. It has been shown that certain molecular mechanisms can lead to increased mutation rates when the organism finds itself in a stressful environment. While this may be a correlated response to other functions, it could also be an adaptive mechanism, raising mutation rates only when it is most advantageous. Here, we use a mathematical model to investigate the plausibility of the adaptive hypothesis. We show that such a mechanism can be mantained if the population is subjected to diverse stresses. By simulating various antibiotic treatment schemes, we find that combination treatments can reduce the effectiveness of second-order selection on stress-induced mutagenesis. We discuss the implications of our results to strategies of antibiotic therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZKmz7SIhs_g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A temporal access code to consciousness?. (arXiv:1707.05193v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05193</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;While questions of a functional localization of consciousness in the brain
have been the subject of myriad studies, the idea of a temporal access code as
a specific brain mechanism for consciousness has remained a neglected
possibility. Dresp-Langley and Durup (2009, 2012) proposed a theoretical
approach in terms of a temporal access mechanism for consciousness based on its
two universally recognized properties. Consciousness is limited in processing
capacity and described by a unique processing stream across a single dimension,
which is time. The time ordering function of conscious states is highlighted
and neurobiological theories of the temporal brain activities likely to
underlie such function are discussed, and the properties of the code model are
then introduced. Spatial information is integrated into provisory topological
maps at non-conscious levels through adaptive resonant matching, but does not
form part of the temporal access code as such. The latter, de-correlated from
the spatial code, operates without any need for firing synchrony on the sole
basis of temporal coincidence probabilities in dedicated resonant circuits
through progressively non-arbitrary selection of specific temporal activity
patterns in the continuously developing brain.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Atomistic fingerprint of hyaluronan–CD44 binding</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005663</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/y6U6Stylyck/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Joni Vuorio, Ilpo Vattulainen, Hector Martinez-Seara&lt;/p&gt;

Hyaluronan is a polyanionic, megadalton-scale polysaccharide, which initiates cell signaling by interacting with several receptor proteins including CD44 involved in cell-cell interactions and cell adhesion. Previous studies of the CD44 hyaluronan binding domain have identified multiple widespread residues to be responsible for its recognition capacity. In contrast, the X-ray structural characterization of CD44 has revealed a single binding mode associated with interactions that involve just a fraction of these residues. In this study, we show through atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that hyaluronan can bind CD44 with three topographically different binding modes that in unison define an interaction fingerprint, thus providing a plausible explanation for the disagreement between the earlier studies. Our results confirm that the known crystallographic mode is the strongest of the three binding modes. The other two modes represent metastable configurations that are readily available in the initial stages of the binding, and they are also the most frequently observed modes in our unbiased simulations. We further discuss how CD44, fostered by the weaker binding modes, diffuses along HA when attached. This 1D diffusion combined with the constrained relative orientation of the diffusing proteins is likely to influence the aggregation kinetics of CD44. Importantly, CD44 aggregation has been suggested to be a possible mechanism in CD44-mediated signaling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y6U6Stylyck&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Vocal learning is an exclusively human trait among primates. However, songbirds demonstrate behavioral features resembling human speech learning. Two circuits have a preeminent role in this human behavior; namely, the corticostriatal and the cerebrocerebellar motor loops. While the striatal contribution can be traced back to the avian anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), the sensorimotor adaptation functions of the cerebellum appear to be human specific in acoustic communication. This review contributes to an ongoing discussion on how birdsong translates into human speech.</description>

	<description>Kaneko et al. show a novel mechanism that enables the nervous system to establish long-lasting functional changes in a sensory pathway-specific manner. They demonstrate that by enhancing feedback inhibition, noxious inputs during development specifically reduce the function of the nociceptive circuit.</description>

	<description>The Khakh lab used state-of-the-art optical, anatomical, electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches to explore astrocyte similarities and differences in two neural circuits. Candid evaluation of the data across ten approaches provided not only strong evidence for astrocyte diversity but also an experimental workflow to explore astrocyte diversity across the brain.</description>

	<description>In a recent study, Ebitz and Moore described how subthreshold electrical microstimulation of the macaque frontal eye fields (FEF) modulates the pupillary light reflex. This elegant study suggests that the influence of the FEF and prefrontal cortex on attentional modulation of cortical visual processing extends to the subcortical circuit that mediates a very basic reflex, the pupillary light reflex.</description>

	<description>Specific forms of firing rate correlations can limit efficient information coding in neuronal populations. How this is mitigated is an important topic of current research. A novel study shows that increasing cortical acetylcholine (ACh) levels alter specific aspects of the population correlation structure, which in turn improves population-coding abilities.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Fragments of the protein α-synuclein, which accumulates in substantia nigra neurons in Parkinson disease, are expressed on the surface of these substantia nigra neurons and induce a form of autoimmunity that could account for the degeneration of these cells in the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: The Lateral Habenula and Adaptive Behaviors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30113-3?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30113-3?rss=yes</link>
	<description>The evolutionarily conserved lateral habenula (LHb) enables dynamic responses to continually changing contexts and environmental conditions. A model is proposed to account for greater mnemonic and contextual control over LHb-mediated response flexibility as vertebrate brains became more complex. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) provides instructions for context-specific responses to LHb, which assesses the extent to which this response information matches the motivation or internal state of the individual.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Efficient Prevention of Neurodegenerative Diseases by Depletion of Starvation Response Factor Ataxin-2</title>

	<description>Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) homologs exist in all eukaryotic organisms and may have contributed to their origin. Apart from a role in endocytosis, they are known for global effects on mRNA repair and ribosomal translation. Cell size, protein synthesis, and fat and glycogen storage are repressed by ATXN2 via mTORC1 signaling. However, specific liver mitochondrial matrix enzymes and the mitochondrial repair factor PINK1 require ATXN2 abundance. During periods of starvation, ATXN2 is transcriptionally induced and localized to cytosolic stress granules, where nuclear factors dock to compensate RNA pathology.</description>

	<description>The human brain undergoes rapid growth in both structure and function from infancy through early childhood, and this significantly influences cognitive and behavioral development in later life. A newly emerging research framework, developmental connectomics, provides unprecedented opportunities for exploring the developing brain through non-invasive mapping of structural and functional connectivity patterns. Within this framework, we review recent neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies investigating connectome development from 20 postmenstrual weeks to 5 years of age.</description>

	<description>The quest to comprehend genetic, biological, and symptomatic heterogeneity underlying Alzheimer’s disease (AD) requires a deep understanding of mechanisms affecting complex brain systems. Neuroimaging genetics is an emerging field that provides a powerful way to analyze and characterize intermediate biological phenotypes of AD. Here, we describe recent studies showing the differential effect of genetic risk factors for AD on brain functional connectivity in cognitively normal, preclinical, prodromal, and AD dementia individuals.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Frans B. M. de Waal &amp;amp; Stephanie D. Preston&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research on empathy in humans and other mammals seeks to dissociate emotional and cognitive empathy. These forms, however, remain interconnected in evolution, across species and at the level of neural mechanisms. New data have facilitated the development of empathy models such as the perception–action &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past decade has witnessed a consolidation and refinement of the extraordinary progress made in taste research. This Review describes recent advances in our understanding of taste receptors, taste buds, and the connections between taste buds and sensory afferent fibres. The article discusses new findings &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Brice A Kuhl &amp;amp; Nicole M Long&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A computational model explains how memories of past rewards guide value-based choices. Incorporating behavioral and functional MRI evidence, the findings indicate that 'sampling' from individual memories of past rewards influences choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Michael Hirth, Jagadeesh Gandla &amp;amp; Rohini Kuner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The checkpoint pathway consisting of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and its receptor, PD-1, modulates immune function in cancer and infection, but unexpectedly, it also silences pain signals in nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruption of retinal direction selectivity reveals both peripheral and central computations contributing to direction selectivity in mouse visual cortex. These mechanisms work together to better encode motion directions and speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn.4583&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nn.4583&lt;/a&gt;
