	<description>Cerebellar granule cells are a popular target of neuroanatomical hyperbole, being so small and so numerous. Early theorists proposed unique roles for this vast cell population, ideas that continue to be tested through contemporary approaches. In 2017, a cluster of empirical and theoretical papers offered a fresh and singular look into the functions of granule cells and the computational advantages of their idiosyncratic circuit organization.</description>

	<description>Locomotion is generated by intrinsically oscillating circuits in the spinal cord that are modulated by information from the brain and periphery. In their seminal 1987 publication, Buchanan and Grillner provided for the first time evidence for excitatory spinal neurons receiving inputs from descending commands and sensory afferents, and synapsing onto motoneurons and commissural inhibitory interneurons. These critical findings established the circuit model for central pattern generators incorporating excitatory interneurons’ role in the rhythm-production mechanism.</description>

	<description>The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is a highly conserved signaling system regulating a range of developmental processes. A 1997 paper by Goodrich and colleagues provided major contributions to understanding the Hh pathway by mutating the gene encoding the Hh receptor, Patched, and thereby developing a mouse model for a human cancer predisposition syndrome, known as Gorlin syndrome. These studies provided one of the first genetically engineered mouse models for brain tumors.</description>

	<description>Across the animal kingdom, odors are known as potent stimuli that directly steer behavior. In 2007, Hitoshi Sakano and colleagues used the power of mouse genetics to manipulate the odor map in the olfactory bulb. Elegant behavioral, anatomical, and physiological analyses revealed an apparent dichotomy in how the brain interprets the odor map. Their work paved a way to think of behavioral contingencies as part of early olfactory processing, highlighting innate and learned pathways.</description>

For hypothalamic neuropeptides, nerve endings amongst ependymal cells are seen as a site of release into the cerebrospinal fluid. Recent single-cell RNA-seq data identify tanycytes and ventricular ependyma as alternative sources by being unexpectedly rich in neuroactive substances. This notion, coupled with circuit analysis showing regionalized innervation of periventricular ependyma by intrahypothalamic neurons, could allow for the integration of hypothalamic neuronal activity patterns with brain-wide activity changes upon metabolic challenges through phasic volume transmission primed by neuron–ependyma coupling. Here, we discuss emerging data for an ependymal interface and its breaches in neuropsychiatric disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Graphical abstract for this article&quot; src=&quot;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818301806-fx1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>Posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been implicated in navigation, in the control of movement, and in visually-guided decisions. To relate these views, we measured activity in PPC while mice performed a virtual navigation task driven by visual decisions. PPC neurons were selective for specific combinations of the animal's spatial position and heading angle. This selectivity closely predicted both the activity of individual PPC neurons, and the arrangement of their collective firing patterns in choice-selective sequences. These sequences reflected PPC encoding of the animal's navigation trajectory. Using decision as a predictor instead of heading yielded worse fits, and using it in addition to heading only slightly improved the fits. Alternative models based on visual or motor variables were inferior. We conclude that when mice use vision to choose their trajectories, a large fraction of parietal cortex activity can be predicted from simple attributes such as spatial position and heading.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: ASH1-catalyzed H3K36 methylation drives gene repression and marks H3K27me2/3-competent chromatin</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41497</link>
	<description>Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me), a widely-distributed chromatin mark, largely results from association of the lysine methyltransferase (KMT) SET-2 with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), but most eukaryotes also have additional H3K36me KMTs that act independently of RNAPII. These include the orthologs of ASH1, which are conserved in animals, plants, and fungi but whose function and control are poorly understood. We found that &lt;i&gt;Neurospora crassa&lt;/i&gt; has just two H3K36 KMTs, ASH1 and SET-2, and were able to explore the function and distribution of each enzyme independently. While H3K36me deposited by SET-2 marks active genes, inactive genes are modified by ASH1 and its activity is critical for their repression. ASH1-marked chromatin can be further modified by methylation of H3K27, and ASH1 catalytic activity modulates the accumulation of H3K27me2/3 both positively and negatively. These findings provide new insight into ASH1 function, H3K27me2/3 establishment, and repression in facultative heterochromatin.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40757</link>
	<description>DNA methylation plays an essential role in mammalian genomes and expression of the responsible enzymes is tightly controlled. Deregulation of the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B is frequently observed across cancer types, yet little is known about its ectopic genomic targets. Here, we used an inducible transgenic mouse model to delineate rules for abnormal DNMT3B targeting, as well as the constraints of its activity across different cell types. Our results explain the preferential susceptibility of certain CpG islands to aberrant methylation and point to transcriptional state and the associated chromatin landscape as the strongest predictors. Although DNA methylation and H3K27me3 are usually non-overlapping at CpG islands, H3K27me3 can transiently co-occur with DNMT3B-induced DNA methylation. Our genome-wide data combined with ultra-deep locus-specific bisulfite sequencing suggest a distributive activity of ectopically expressed Dnmt3b that leads to discordant CpG island hypermethylation and provides new insights for interpreting the cancer methylome.</description>

	<description>We rarely experience difficulty picking up objects, yet of all potential grasp points on an object's surface, only a small proportion yield stable, comfortable grasps. Here, we present extensive behavioral data alongside a computational model that correctly predicts human precision grasping of unfamiliar 3D objects. We tracked participants' forefinger and thumb as they picked up objects of 10 wood and brass cubes configured to tease apart effects of shape, weight, orientation, and mass distribution. Grasps were highly systematic and consistent across repetitions and participants. The model combines five cost functions related to force closure, torque, natural grasp axis, grasp aperture, and visibility. Even without free parameters, we find that the model predicts human grasps with striking fidelity: indeed, it predicts individual grasps almost as well as different individuals predict one another's. Adding fittable weights to the model reveals the relative importance of the different constraints: the combination of force closure, hand posture, and grasp size explains most of human grasping behavior, while our participants cared surprisingly little about minimizing torque and optimizing object visibility. Together, these findings provide a unified account of how we derive effective grasps from objects' 3D shape and material properties to interact with them successfully.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Methamphetamine Administration Increases Proceptive Behavior by Activating Src Kinase and Upregulating Progesterone Receptor in the Medial Amygdala</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/475616v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/475616v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Methamphetamine, a psychostimulant drug of abuse, increases sexual motivation both in humans and in rodent models. The activation of dopamine type-1 receptors (D1Rs) within the medial amygdala, in the presence of ovarian hormones (EB+P), are both necessary and sufficient for increases in proceptive, or sexually motivated, behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that methamphetamine increases progesterone receptor expression in the medial amygdala independently of D1R activation, and that lentiviral overexpression of the progesterone receptor was able to recapitulate the methamphetamine-induced enhancement of proceptive behaviors. Furthermore, we found that within the medial amygdala, these progesterone receptors show an increase in phosphorylation of serine 294 of the progesterone receptor in a region-specific manner. The involvement of this phosphorylation site suggests a role for cytosolic kinases, which may be responsible for enhanced progesterone receptor action. The phosphorylation of serine 294 is blocked by D1R antagonists, and by inhibiting cSrc and ERK1/2, downstream of D1R signaling, we identified that Src and ERK1/2 are required for enhanced proceptive behavior. Taken together, we propose that within the medial amygdala, methamphetamine enhances progesterone receptors sensitivity to its cognate ligand via interaction with cSrc kinase and ERK1/2, as well as an increase total progesterone receptors, thus leading to enhanced proceptive behaviors in the rat.</description>

	<description>Neocortical GABAergic interneurons expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) contribute to sensory processing, sensorimotor integration and behavioral control. In contrast to other major subpopulations of GABAergic interneurons, VIP neurons show a remarkable diversity. Studying morphological and electrophysiological properties of VIP cells, we found a peculiar group of neurons in layer II/III of mouse primary somatosensory (barrel) cortex, which showed a highly dynamic burst firing behavior at resting membrane potential that switched to tonic mode at depolarized membrane potentials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that burst firing depends on T-type calcium channels. The burst-tonic switch could be induced by acetylcholine and serotonin. Acetylcholine mediated a depolarization via nicotinic receptors whereas serotonin evoked a biphasic depolarization via ionotropic and metabotropic receptors in 48% of the population and a purely monophasic depolarization via metabotropic receptors in the remaining cells. These data disclose an electrophysiologically-defined subpopulation of VIP neurons that via neuromodulator-induced changes in firing behavior is likely to regulate the state of cortical circuits in a profound manner.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Predictive modelling of functional connectomes from structural connectomes
explores commonalities across multimodal imaging data. However, direct
application of multivariate approaches such as sparse Canonical Correlation
Analysis (sCCA) applies on the vectorised elements of functional connectivity
across subjects and it does not guarantee that the predicted models of
functional connectivity are Symmetric Positive Matrices (SPD). We suggest an
elegant solution based on the transportation of the connectivity matrices on a
Riemannian manifold, which notably improves the prediction performance of the
model. Subsequently, we construct a statistical framework to highlight brain
connections that are selected with probability well above chance and we
estimate their sCCA loadings based on a de-noising approach.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An accurate estimate of limb position is necessary for movement. Where we
localize our unseen hand after a reach depends on felt hand position, or
proprioception, but often only predicted sensory consequences based on
efference copies of motor commands are considered. Both signals should
contribute, so here we use passive training with rotated visual feedback of
hand position to prevent updates of predicted sensory consequences, but still
recalibrate proprioception. After this training we measure participants' hand
location estimates based on both efference-based predictions and afferent
proprioceptive signals with self-generated hand movements as well as based on
proprioception only with robot-generated movements. The changes in hand
localization are equally large after training with robot- and self-generated
hand movements. Both motor and proprioceptive changes are only slightly smaller
as those after training with self-generated movements, confirming that
recalibrated proprioception contributes to motor learning.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The complexity and size of state-of-the-art cell models have significantly
increased in part due to the requirement that these models possess complex
cellular functions which are thought--but not necessarily proven--to be
important. Modern cell models often involve hundreds of parameters; the values
of these parameters come, more often than not, from animal experiments whose
relationship to the human physiology is weak with very little information on
the errors in these measurements. The concomitant uncertainties in parameter
values result in uncertainties in the model outputs or Quantities of Interest
(QoIs). Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) aims at apportioning to individual
parameters (or sets of parameters) their relative contribution to output
uncertainty thereby introducing a measure of influence or importance of said
parameters. New GSA approaches are required to deal with increased model size
and complexity; a three stage methodology consisting of screening (dimension
reduction), surrogate modeling, and computing Sobol' indices, is presented. The
methodology is used to analyze a physiologically validated numerical model of
neurovascular coupling which possess 160 uncertain parameters. The sensitivity
analysis investigates three quantities of interest (QoIs), the average value of
$K^+$ in the extracellular space, the average volumetric flow rate through the
perfusing vessel, and the minimum value of the actin/myosin complex in the
smooth muscle cell. GSA provides a measure of the influence of each parameter,
for each of the three QoIs, giving insight into areas of possible physiological
dysfunction and areas of further investigation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fading of collective attention shapes the evolution of linguistic variants. (arXiv:1811.08465v1 [cs.CL])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08465</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08465</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Language change involves the competition between alternative linguistic forms
(1). Notably, the Spanish past subjunctive comes in two perfectly equivalent
variants ended in -ra or -se (2); for instance, in the sentence 'If I were
there', the verb can be equally translated to estuviera or estuviese. During a
first spontaneous process that began in the Middle Ages, the form -ra migrated
from the indicative to the subjunctive, displacing the original -se form (3-5).
A second period started with the creation of the Royal Spanish Academy in 1713,
which produced a global standardization process that enforced the official
spelling of -ra and -se as perfectly interchangeable variants (6). Time series
extracted from a massive corpus of books (7) show that this standardization
produced a boost in the declining old form -se that eventually faded, leaving
-ra as the dominant one in the present time. The time series were successfully
fitted by a low dimensional model that integrates two basic collective
behaviors: an imitative component, and a fading of collective attention to the
institutional regulation. We show that the natural scale over which collective
attention fades is inversely proportional to the frequency of use of the verbs.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Diffusion geometry approach to efficiently remove electrical stimulation artifacts in intracranial electroencephalography. (arXiv:1811.08428v1 [physics.med-ph])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08428</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical oscillations, electrophysiological activity patterns, associated
with cognitive functions and impaired in many psychiatric disorders can be
observed in intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). Direct cortical
stimulation (DCS) may directly target these oscillations and may serve as
therapeutic approaches to restore functional impairments. However, the presence
of electrical stimulation artifacts in neurophysiological data limits the
analysis of the effects of stimulation. Currently available methods suffer in
performance in the presence of nonstationarity inherent in biological data. Our
algorithm, Shape Adaptive Nonlocal Artifact Removal (SANAR) is based on
unsupervised manifold learning. By estimating the Euclidean median of k nearest
neighbors of each artifact in a nonlocal fashion, we obtain a faithful
representation of the artifact which is then subtracted. This approach
overcomes the challenges presented by nonstationarity. SANAR is effective in
removing stimulation artifacts in the time domain while preserving the spectral
content of the endogenous neurophysiological signal. We demonstrate the
performance in a simulated dataset as well as in human iEEG data. Using two
quantitative measures, that capture how much of information from endogenous
activity is retained, we demonstrate that SANAR's performance exceeds that of
one of the widely used approaches, independent component analysis, in the time
domain as well as the frequency domain. This approach allows for the analysis
of iEEG data, single channel or multiple channels, during DCS, a crucial step
in advancing our understanding of the effects of periodic stimulation and
developing new therapies.

We used herpes simplex virus with bioorthogonally labeled genomes to detect host factors recruited to viral DNA shortly after its nuclear entry and found that the cellular IFI16, PML, and ATRX proteins colocalized with viral DNA by 15 min post infection. HSV-1 infection of ATRX&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;depleted fibroblasts resulted in elevated viral mRNA and accelerated viral DNA accumulation. Despite the early association of ATRX with vDNA, we found that initial viral heterochromatin formation is ATRX-independent. However, viral heterochromatin stability required ATRX from 4-8 h post infection. Inhibition of transcription blocked viral chromatin loss in ATRX-knockout cells; thus, ATRX is uniquely required for heterochromatin maintenance during chromatin stress. These results argue that the initial formation and the subsequent maintenance of viral heterochromatin are separable mechanisms, a concept that likely extrapolates to host cell chromatin and viral latency.</description>

	<description>Reading frame maintenance is critical for accurate translation. We show that the conserved eukaryotic/archaeal protein Mbf1 acts with ribosomal proteins Rps3/uS3 and eukaryotic Asc1/RACK1 to prevent frameshifting at inhibitory CGA-CGA codon pairs in the yeast &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. Mutations in &lt;i&gt;RPS3 &lt;/i&gt;that allow frameshifting implicate eukaryotic conserved residues near the mRNA entry site. Mbf1 and Rps3 cooperate to maintain the reading frame of stalled ribosomes, while Asc1 also mediates distinct events that result in recruitment of the ribosome quality control complex and mRNA decay. Frameshifting occurs through a +1 shift with a CGA codon in the P site and involves competition between codons entering the A site, implying that the wobble interaction of the P site codon destabilizes translation elongation. Thus, eukaryotes have evolved unique mechanisms involving both a universally conserved ribosome component and two eukaryotic-specific proteins to maintain the reading frame at ribosome stalls.</description>

	<description>Sensory navigation results from coordinated transitions between distinct behavioral programs. During chemotaxis in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; larva, the detection of positive odor gradients extends runs while negative gradients promote stops and turns. This algorithm represents a foundation for the control of sensory navigation across phyla. In the present work, we identified an olfactory descending neuron, PDM-DN, which plays a pivotal role in the organization of stops and turns in response to the detection of graded changes in odor concentrations. Artificial activation of this descending neuron induces deterministic stops followed by the initiation of turning maneuvers through head casts. Using electron microscopy, we reconstructed the main pathway that connects the PDM-DN neuron to the peripheral olfactory system and to the pre-motor circuit responsible for the actuation of forward peristalsis. Our results set the stage for a detailed mechanistic analysis of the sensorimotor conversion of graded olfactory inputs into action selection to perform goal-oriented navigation.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: A time-stamp mechanism may provide temporal information necessary for egocentric to allocentric spatial transformations</title>

	<description>Learning the spatial organization of the environment is essential for most animals' survival. This requires the animal to derive allocentric spatial information from egocentric sensory and motor experience. The neural mechanisms underlying this transformation are mostly unknown. We addressed this problem in electric fish, which can precisely navigate in complete darkness and whose brain circuitry is relatively simple. We conducted the first neural recordings in the preglomerular complex, the thalamic region exclusively connecting the optic tectum with the spatial learning circuits in the dorsolateral pallium. While tectal topographic information was mostly eliminated in preglomerular neurons, the time-intervals between object encounters were precisely encoded. We show that this reliable temporal information, combined with a speed signal, can permit accurate estimation of the distance between encounters, a necessary component of path-integration that enables computing allocentric spatial relations. Our results suggest that similar mechanisms are involved in sequential spatial learning in all vertebrates.</description>

	<description>Glutamate receptors are divided in two unrelated families: ionotropic (iGluR), driving synaptic transmission, and metabotropic (mGluR), which modulate synaptic strength. The present classification of GluRs is based on vertebrate proteins and has remained unchanged for over two decades. Here we report an exhaustive phylogenetic study of GluRs in metazoans. Importantly, we demonstrate that GluRs have followed different evolutionary histories in separated animal lineages. Our analysis reveals that the present organization of iGluRs into six classes does not capture the full complexity of their evolution. Instead, we propose an organization into four subfamilies and ten classes, four of which have never been previously described. Furthermore, we report a sister class to mGluR classes I-III, class IV. We show that many unreported proteins are expressed in the nervous system, and that new Epsilon receptors form functional ligand-gated ion channels. We propose an updated classification of glutamate receptors that includes our findings.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Alterations in Schizophrenia-Associated Genes Can Lead to Increased Power in Delta Oscillations</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Genome-wide association studies have implicated many ion channels in schizophrenia pathophysiology. Although the functions of these channels are relatively well characterized by single-cell studies, the contributions of common variation in these channels to neurophysiological biomarkers and symptoms of schizophrenia remain elusive. Here, using computational modeling, we show that a common biomarker of schizophrenia, namely, an increase in delta-oscillation power, may be a direct consequence of altered expression or kinetics of voltage-gated ion channels or calcium transporters. Our model of a circuit of layer V pyramidal cells highlights multiple types of schizophrenia-related variants that contribute to altered dynamics in the delta-frequency band. Moreover, our model predicts that the same membrane mechanisms that increase the layer V pyramidal cell network gain and response to delta-frequency oscillations may also cause a deficit in a single-cell correlate of the prepulse inhibition, which is a behavioral biomarker highly associated with schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Emotions can be characterized by dimensions of arousal and valence (pleasantness). While the functional brain bases of emotional arousal and valence have been actively investigated, the neuromolecular underpinnings remain poorly understood. We tested whether the opioid and dopamine systems involved in reward and motivational processes would be associated with emotional arousal and valence. We used in vivo positron emission tomography to quantify μ-opioid receptor and type 2 dopamine receptor (MOR and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R, respectively) availability in brains of 35 healthy adult females. During subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging carried out to monitor hemodynamic activity, the subjects viewed movie scenes of varying emotional content. Arousal and valence were associated with hemodynamic activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing, including amygdala, thalamus, and superior temporal sulcus. Cerebral MOR availability correlated negatively with the hemodynamic responses to arousing scenes in amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus, whereas no positive correlations were observed in any brain region. D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R availability—here reliably quantified only in striatum—was not associated with either arousal or valence. These results suggest that emotional arousal is regulated by the MOR system, and that cerebral MOR availability influences brain activity elicited by arousing stimuli.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Wheel-running in rodents can mitigate addiction-related effects of drugs of abuse like cocaine. However, experiments using conditioned place preference (CPP) are conflicting, warranting further studies. Our purpose was to test whether wheel-running during adolescence could impact the formation and long-term retention of CPP to cocaine in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were individually housed either with (n=32) or without (n=32) a running wheel from the age of 35 days. Behavioral testing began 3 weeks after such housing, mice underwent a baseline session followed by 10 once-daily conditioning sessions receiving peritoneal injections of 10 mg/kg cocaine and saline on alternate days (n=16), control mice receiving saline every day (n=16). One and 21 days after the last conditioning session, they were tested for CPP. Both groups exhibited comparable well-marked cocaine-induced CPP in both post-conditioning tests resulting in a negligible interaction between housing and the pharmacological treatment (partial eta-squared &amp;lt; 0.01). These results, along with the discrepancy found in the literature, question the nature (and the robustness) of the effects that exercise induces on CPP to cocaine.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/477174v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Copy-number variants of the CYFIP1 gene in humans have been linked to Autism and Schizophrenia, two neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by defects in brain connectivity. CYFIP1 regulates molecular events underlying post-synaptic functions. Here, we show that CYFIP1 plays an important role in brain functional connectivity and callosal functions. In particular, we find that Cyfip1 heterozygous mice have reduced brain functional connectivity and defects in white matter architecture, typically relating to phenotypes found in patients with Autism, Schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, Cyfip1 deficient mice present deficits in the callosal axons, namely reduced myelination, altered pre-synaptic function, and impaired bilateral-connectivity related behavior. Altogether, our results show that Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency compromises brain connectivity and function, which might explain its genetic association to neuropsychiatric disorders.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The cost of being stable: Trade-offs between effort and stability across a landscape of redundant motor solutions</title>

	<description>Current musculoskeletal modeling approaches cannot account for variability in muscle activation patterns seen across individuals, who may differ in motor experience, motor training, or neurological health. While musculoskeletal simulations typically select muscle activation patterns that minimize muscular effort, and generate unstable limb dynamics, a few studies have shown that maximum-effort solutions can improve limb stability. Although humans and animals likely adopt solutions between these two extremes, we lack principled methods to explore how effort and stability shape how muscle activation patterns differ across individuals. Here we characterized trade-offs between muscular effort and limb stability in selecting muscle activation patterns for an isometric force generation task in a musculoskeletal model of the cat hindlimb. We define effort as the sum of squared activation across all muscles, and limb stability by the maximum real part of the eigenvalues of the linearized musculoskeletal system dynamics, with more negative values being more stable. Surprisingly, stability increased rapidly with only small increases in effort from the minimum-effort solution, suggesting that very small amounts of muscle coactivation are beneficial for postural stability. Further, effort beyond 40% of the maximum possible effort did not confer further increases in stability. We also found multiple muscle activation patterns with equivalent effort and stability, which could underlie variability observed across individuals with similar motor ability. Trade-off between muscle effort and limb stability could underlie diversity in muscle activation patterns observed across individuals, disease, learning, and rehabilitation.</description>

	<description>Lengthy use of general anesthetics (GAs) causes cognitive deficits in developing brain?which has raised significant clinical concerns such that FDA is warning on the use of GAs in children younger than 3 years. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms for GAs-induced neurotoxicity remain largely unknown. Here we report that sevoflurane, a commonly used GA in pediatrics, causes compromised astrocyte morphogenesis, spatiotemporally correlated to the synaptic overgrowth with reduced synaptic function in developing cortex in a regional-, exposure-length- and age-specific manner. Sevoflurane disrupts astrocyte Ca2+ homeostasis both acutely and chronically, which leads to the down regulation of Ezrin, an actin-binding membrane protein, which we found is critically involved in astrocyte morphogenesis in vivo. Importantly, in normal developing brain, the genetic intervention of astrocyte morphogenesis is sufficient to produce the aberrant synaptic structure and function virtually identical to the ones induced by lengthy sevoflurane exposure. Our data uncover that astrocytes are unexpectedly central targets for GAs to exert toxic effects, and that astrocyte morphological integrity is crucial for synaptogenesis in the developing brain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cold Inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) adjusts clock gene expression and REM sleep recovery after sleep deprivation</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/476911v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Sleep depriving mice affects clock gene expression, suggesting that these genes partake in sleep homeostasis. The mechanisms linking wakefulness to clock gene expression are, however, not well understood. We propose CIRBP because its rhythmic expression is i) sleep-wake driven and ii) necessary for high-amplitude clock gene expression in vitro. We therefore expect Cirbp knock-out (KO) mice to exhibit attenuated sleep-deprivation (SD) induced changes in clock gene expression, and consequently to differ in their sleep homeostatic regulation. Lack of CIRBP indeed blunted the SD-incurred changes in cortical expression of the clock gene Rev-erb whereas it amplified the changes in Per2 and Clock. Concerning sleep homeostasis, KO mice accrued only half the extra REM sleep wild-type (WT) littermates obtained during recovery. Unexpectedly, KO mice were more active during lights-off which was accompanied by an acceleration of theta oscillations. Thus, CIRBP adjusts cortical clock gene expression after SD and expedites REM sleep recovery.</description>

	<description>Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BK and SK) are ubiquitous in synaptic circuits, but their role in network adaptation and sensory perception remains largely unknown. Using electrophysiological and behavioral assays and biophysical modelling, we discover how visual information transfer in mutants lacking the BK channel (dSlo-), SK channel (dSK-) or both (dSK-;;dSlo-) is shaped in the Drosophila R1-R6 photoreceptor-LMC circuits (R-LMC-R system) through synaptic feedforward-feedback interactions and reduced R1-R6 Shaker and Shab K+ conductances. This homeostatic compensation is specific for each mutant, leading to distinctive adaptive dynamics. We show how these dynamics inescapably increase the energy cost of information and distort the mutants' motion perception, determining the true price and limits of homeostatic compensation in an in vivo genetic animal model. These results reveal why Ca2+-activated K+ channels reduce network excitability (energetics), improving neural adaptability for transmitting and perceiving sensory information.</description>

	<description>Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are essential to brain development and their dysfunction is linked to several disorders, including autism, Zika Virus Congenital Syndrome, and cancer. Understanding of these conditions has been improved by advancements with stem cell-derived NPC models. However, current differentiation methods require many days or weeks to generate NPCs and show variability in efficacy among cell lines. Here, we describe human Stem cell-derived NGN2-accelerated Progenitor cells (SNaPs), which are produced in only 48 hours. SNaPs express canonical forebrain NPC protein markers, are proliferative, multipotent, and like other human NPCs, are susceptible to Zika-mediated death. We further demonstrate SNaPs are valuable for large-scale investigations of genetic and environmental influencers of neurodevelopment by deploying them for genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens. Our studies expand knowledge of NPCs by identifying known and novel Zika host factors, as well as new regulators of NPC proliferation validated by re-identification of the autism spectrum gene PTEN.</description>

	<description>The ongoing activity of the left and right cortical hemispheres shows strong bilateral fluctuations. Here we show that these fluctuations are largely responsible for the variability observed in cortical responses to sensory stimuli. Using widefield imaging of voltage and calcium signals, we measured activity in the cortex of mice performing a visual detection task. Bilateral fluctuations invested all areas, particularly those closest to the midline. Activity was less bilateral in the monocular region of primary visual cortex and, especially during task engagement, in secondary motor cortex. Ongoing bilateral fluctuations dominated unilateral visual responses, and interacted additively with them, explaining much of the variance in trial-by-trial activity. Even though these fluctuations occurred in regions necessary for the task, they did not impact detection behavior. We conclude that bilateral ongoing activity continues during sensory stimulation and has a powerful additive impact on sensory processing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neurovascular coupling preserved in a chronic mouse model of Alzheimers disease: Methodology is critical.</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/474916v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Neurovascular coupling is the process by which neural activity causes localised changes in cerebral blood flow. Impaired neurovascular coupling has been suggested as an early pathogenic factor in Alzheimers disease (AD), and if so, could serve as an early biomarker of cerebral pathology. We have established an anaesthetic regime in which evoked hemodynamic responses are comparable to those in awake mice. This protocol was adapted to allow repeated measurements of neurovascular function over three months in the hAPP-J20 mouse model of AD (J20-AD) and wild-type (WT) controls. Animals were 9-12 months old at the start of the experiment, which is when deficits due to the disease condition would be expected. Mice were chronically prepared with a cranial window through which optical imaging spectroscopy (OIS) was used to generate functional maps of the cerebral blood volume and saturation changes evoked by whisker stimulation and vascular reactivity challenges. Unexpectedly, the hemodynamic responses were largely preserved in the J20-AD group. This result failed to confirm previous investigations using the J20-AD model. However, a final acute electrophysiology and OIS experiment was performed to measure both neural and hemodynamic responses concurrently. In this experiment, previously reported deficits in neurovascular coupling in the J20-AD model were observed. This suggests that J20-AD mice may be more susceptible to the physiologically stressing conditions of an acute experimental procedure compared to WT animals. These results therefore highlight the importance of experimental procedure when determining the characteristics of animal models of human disease.</description>

	<description>Curiosity is often portrayed as a desirable feature of human faculty. For example, a meta-analysis revealed that curiosity predicts academic performance above and beyond intelligence, corroborating findings that curiosity supported long-term consolidation of learning. However, curiosity may come at a cost of strong seductive power that sometimes puts people in a harmful situation. Here, with a set of three behavioural and two neuroimaging experiments including novel stimuli that strongly trigger curiosity (i.e. magic tricks), we examined the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying the irresistible lure of curiosity. We consistently demonstrated that across different samples people were indeed willing to gamble to expose themselves to physical risks (i.e. electric shocks) in order to satisfy their curiosity for trivial knowledge that carries no apparent instrumental values. Also, underlying this seductive power of curiosity is its incentive salience properties, which share common neural mechanisms with extrinsic incentives (i.e. hunger for foods). In particular, the two independent fMRI experiments using different kinds of curiosity-stimulating stimuli found replicable results that acceptance (compared to rejection) of curiosity/incentive-driven gambles was accompanied with an enhanced activity in the striatum.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/471417v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In generative modeling of neuroimaging data, such as dynamic causal modeling (DCM), one typically considers several alternative models, either to determine the most plausible explanation for observed data (Bayesian model selection) or to account for model uncertainty (Bayesian model averaging). Both procedures rest on estimates of the model evidence, a principled trade-off between model accuracy and complexity. In DCM, the log evidence is usually approximated using variational Bayes (VB) under the Laplace approximation (VBL). Although this approach is highly efficient, it makes distributional assumptions and can be vulnerable to local extrema. An alternative to VBL is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, which is asymptotically exact but orders of magnitude slower than VB. This has so far prevented its routine use for DCM. This paper makes four contributions. First, we introduce a powerful MCMC scheme - thermodynamic integration (TI) - to neuroimaging and present a derivation that establishes a theoretical link to VB. Second, this derivation is based on a tutorial-like introduction to concepts of free energy in physics and statistics. Third, we present an implementation of TI for DCM that rests on population MCMC. Fourth, using simulations and empirical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we compare log evidence estimates obtained by TI, VBL, and other MCMC-based estimators (prior arithmetic mean and posterior harmonic mean). We find that model comparison based on VBL gives reliable results in most cases, justifying its use in standard DCM for fMRI. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for complex and/or nonlinear models, TI may provide more robust estimates of the log evidence. Importantly, accurate estimates of the model evidence can be obtained with TI in acceptable computation time. This paves the way for using DCM in scenarios where the robustness of single-subject inference and model selection becomes paramount, such as differential diagnosis in clinical applications.</description>

	<description>Being aware of the phonemes that compose syllables is difficult without having learned to read an alphabetic script, a skill generally acquired around 5 to 7 years of age. Nevertheless, preverbal infants are particularly good at discriminating syllables that differ by a single phoneme. Do they perceive syllables as a whole unit or can they become aware of the underlying phonemes if their attention is attracted to the relevant level of analysis? We trained 3-month-old infants to pair two consonants, co-articulated with different vowels, with two visual shapes. Using event-related potentials, we show that infants generalize the learned associations to new syllables with respect to a familiarization phase. The systematic pairing of a visual label with a phonetic category is thus easy to learn, suggesting that the main process underlying reading (i.e., grapheme-phoneme pairing) is grounded in the early faculties of the human linguistic system.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural stem cells (NSCs) hold great promise for neural repair in cases of CNS injury and neurodegeneration; however, conventional cell-based transplant methods face the challenges of poor survival and inadequate neuronal differentiation. Here, we report an alternative, tissue-based transplantation strategy whereby cerebral organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) were grafted into lesioned mouse cortex. Cerebral organoid transplants exhibited enhanced survival and robust vascularization from host brain as compared to transplants of dissociated neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Engrafted cerebral organoids harbored a large NSC pool and displayed multilineage neurodifferentiation at two and four weeks after grafting. Cerebral organoids therefore represent a promising alternative source to NSCs or fetal tissues for transplantation, as they contain a large set of neuroprogenitors and differentiated neurons in a structured organization. Engrafted cerebral organoids may also offer a unique experimental paradigm for modeling human neurodevelopment and CNS diseases in the context of vascularized cortical tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Superior Visual Timing Sensitivity in Auditory but not Visual World Class Drum Corps Experts</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0241-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;World class drum corps require cooperation among performance artists to render precisely synchronized and asynchronized events. For example, drum corps visual aesthetics often feature salient radial and rotational motion displays from color guard. Accordingly, extensive color guard training might predict superior visual timing sensitivity to asynchronies in radial and rotational motion displays. Less intuitively, one might instead predict superior visual timing sensitivity among world class drum corps musicians, who regularly sub-divide musical tempos into brief time units. This prediction arises from the possibility that auditory training transfers cross-modally. Here, we investigated whether precise visual temporal order judgments more strongly align with color guard’s visual training or musicians’ auditory training. To mimic color guard visual displays, stimuli comprised bilateral plaid patterns that radiated or rotated before changing direction asynchronously. Human participants indicated whether the direction changed first on the left or right –a temporal order judgment (TOJ). Twenty-five percussionists, 67 brass players, and 29 color guard from a world class drum corps collectively completed 67,760 visual TOJ trials. Percussionists exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did brass players, who exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did color guard. Group median thresholds spanned an order of magnitude, ranging between 29 milliseconds (percussionists judging rotational asynchronies) and 290 milliseconds (color guard judging radial asynchronies). The results suggest that visual timing can improve more by training cross-modally than intra-modally, even when intra-modal training and testing stimuli closely match. More broadly, pre-existing training histories can provide a unique window into the nervous system’s timing sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Optimal cognitive and behavioral performance typically occurs when training conditions closely match testing conditions. This fundamental principle from learning and memory predicts greater visual test performance after visual training than after auditory training. Contrastingly, a fundamental sensory principle –superior temporal precision for auditory versus visual stimuli – predicts better visual test performance after auditory training than after visual training. We observed more precise visual timing among musical experts than among visual experts who had years of visual experience that closely matched the testing stimuli. The musicians’ superior performance suggests that shared neural events mediate the precision of auditory and visual timing. Moreover, these shared neural events provide greater temporal precision than does matching sensory modalities across training and testing contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Gas Anesthesia Impairs Peripheral Auditory Sensitivity in Barn Owls (Tyto alba)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0140-18.2018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Auditory nerve single-unit recordings were obtained from two groups of young barn owls (age, between posthatching days 11 and 86) in terminal experiments under two different anesthetic regimes: ketamine (6–11 mg/kg) plus xylazine (~2 mg/kg); or isoflurane (1–1.5%) in oxygen, delivered via artificial respiration. In a second series of minimally invasive experiments, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded in the same four adult barn owls (&lt;i&gt;Tyto alba&lt;/i&gt;; age, between 5 and 32 months) under three different anesthetic protocols: ketamine (10 mg/kg) plus xylazine (3 mg/kg), isoflurane (1–1.5%), and sevoflurane (2–3%) in carbogen. Finally, the ABR measurements on adult owls were repeated in terminal experiments including more invasive procedures such as artificial respiration and higher isoflurane dosage. The main finding was a significant deterioration of auditory sensitivity in barn owls under gas anesthesia, at the level of the auditory nerve (i.e., a very peripheral level of the auditory system). The effect was drastic in the young animals that experienced threshold elevations in auditory nerve single-unit responses of ≥20 dB. ABR thresholds assessed repeatedly in experiments on adult owls were also significantly higher under isoflurane and sevoflurane, on average by 7 and 15 dB, compared with ketamine/xylazine. This difference already occurred with minimal dosages and was reversibly enlarged with increased isoflurane concentration. Finally, there was evidence for confounding detrimental effects associated with artificial respiration over many hours, which suggested oxygen toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Deficiency of AMPAR-Palmitoylation Aggravates Seizure Susceptibility</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic AMPAR expression controls the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity. An excess of synaptic AMPARs leads to epilepsy in response to seizure-inducible stimulation. The appropriate regulation of AMPARs plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying epilepsy remain unclear. Our previous studies have revealed that a key modification of AMPAR trafficking to and from postsynaptic membranes is the reversible, posttranslational &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-palmitoylation at the C-termini of receptors. To clarify the role of palmitoylation-dependent regulation of AMPARs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we generated GluA1 palmitoylation-deficient (Cys811 to Ser substitution) knock-in mice. These mutant male mice showed elevated seizure susceptibility and seizure-induced neuronal activity without impairments in synaptic transmission, gross brain structure, or behavior at the basal level. Disruption of the palmitoylation site was accompanied by upregulated GluA1 phosphorylation at Ser831, but not at Ser845, in the hippocampus and increased GluA1 protein expression in the cortex. Furthermore, GluA1 palmitoylation suppressed excessive spine enlargement above a certain size after LTP. Our findings indicate that an abnormality in GluA1 palmitoylation can lead to hyperexcitability in the cerebrum, which negatively affects the maintenance of network stability, resulting in epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; AMPARs predominantly mediate excitatory synaptic transmission. AMPARs are regulated in a posttranslational, palmitoylation-dependent manner in excitatory synapses of the mammalian brain. Reversible palmitoylation dynamically controls synaptic expression and intracellular trafficking of the receptors. Here, we generated GluA1 palmitoylation-deficient knock-in mice to clarify the role of AMPAR palmitoylation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We showed that an abnormality in GluA1 palmitoylation led to hyperexcitability, resulting in epileptic seizure. This is the first identification of a specific palmitoylated protein critical for the seizure-suppressing process. Our data also provide insight into how predicted receptors such as AMPARs can effectively preserve network stability in the brain. Furthermore, these findings help to define novel key targets for developing anti-epileptic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Multicomponent Neuronal Response Encodes the Larval Decision to Pupariate upon Amino Acid Starvation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Organisms need to coordinate growth with development, particularly in the context of nutrient availability. Thus, multiple ways have evolved to survive extrinsic nutrient deprivation during development. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, growth occurs during larval development. Larvae are thus critically dependent on nutritional inputs; but after critical weight, they pupariate even when starved. How nutrient availability is coupled to the internal metabolic state for the decision to pupariate needs better understanding. We had earlier identified glutamatergic interneurons in the ventral ganglion that regulate pupariation on a protein-deficient diet. Here we report that &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; third instar larvae (either sex) sense arginine to evaluate their nutrient environment using an amino acid transporter Slimfast. The glutamatergic interneurons integrate external protein availability with internal metabolic state through neuropeptide signals. IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated calcium release and store-operated calcium entry are essential in these glutamatergic neurons for such integration and alter neuronal function by reducing the expression of multiple ion channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Coordinating growth with development, in the context of nutrient availability is a challenge for all organisms in nature. After attainment of &quot;critical weight,&quot; insect larvae can pupariate, even in the absence of nutrition. Mechanism(s) that stimulate appropriate cellular responses and allow normal development on a nutritionally deficient diet remain to be understood. Here, we demonstrate that nutritional deprivation, in postcritical weight larvae, is sensed by special sensory neurons through an amino acid transporter that detects loss of environmental arginine. This information is integrated by glutamatergic interneurons with the internal metabolic state through neuropeptide signals. These glutamatergic interneurons require calcium-signaling-regulated expression of a host of neuronal channels to generate complex calcium signals essential for pupariation on a protein-deficient diet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Insensitivity to Pain upon Adult-Onset Deletion of Nav1.7 or Its Blockade with Selective Inhibitors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/47/10180?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/47/10180?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Strong human genetic evidence points to an essential contribution of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 to pain sensation: loss of Nav1.7 function leads to congenital insensitivity to pain, whereas gain-of-function mutations in the &lt;i&gt;SCN9A&lt;/i&gt; gene that encodes Nav1.7 cause painful neuropathies, such as inherited erythromelalgia, a syndrome characterized by episodic spontaneous pain. Selective Nav1.7 channel blockers thus hold promise as potential painkillers with improved safety and reduced unwanted side effects compared with existing therapeutics. To determine the maximum effect of a theoretically perfectly selective Nav1.7 inhibitor, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible KO mouse model enabling genetic deletion of Nav1.7 from adult mice. Electrophysiological recordings of sensory neurons from these mice following tamoxifen injection demonstrated the loss of Nav1.7 channel current and the resulting decrease in neuronal excitability of small-diameter neurons. We found that behavioral responses to most, but surprisingly not all, modalities of noxious stimulus are abolished following adult deletion of Nav1.7, pointing toward indications where Nav1.7 blockade should be efficacious. Furthermore, we demonstrate that isoform-selective acylsulfonamide Nav1.7 inhibitors show robust analgesic and antinociceptive activity acutely after a single dose in mouse pain models shown to be Nav1.7-dependent. All experiments were done with both male and female mice. Collectively, these data expand the depth of knowledge surrounding Nav1.7 biology as it relates to pain, and provide preclinical proof of efficacy that lays a clear path toward translation for the therapeutic use of Nav1.7-selective inhibitors in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Loss-of-function mutations in the sodium channel Nav1.7 cause congenital insensitivity to pain in humans, making Nav1.7 a top target for novel pain drugs. Targeting Nav1.7 selectively has been challenging, however, in part due to uncertainties in which rodent pain models are dependent on Nav1.7. We have developed and characterized an adult-onset Nav1.7 KO mouse model that allows us to determine the expected effects of a theoretically perfect Nav1.7 blocker. Importantly, many commonly used pain models, such as mechanical allodynia after nerve injury, appear to not be dependent on Nav1.7 in the adult. By defining which models are Nav1.7 dependent, we demonstrate that selective Nav1.7 inhibitors can approximate the effects of genetic loss of function, which previously has not been directly established.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: In Vivo Expansion of Regulatory T Cells with IL-2/IL-2 Antibody Complex Protects against Transient Ischemic Stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are known to protect against ischemic stroke. However, the low frequency of Tregs restricts their clinical utility. This study investigated whether expanding the number of Tregs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; with the IL-2/IL-2 antibody complex (IL-2/IL-2Ab) could improve stroke outcomes and further elaborated the mechanisms of protection in male mice. C57BL/6 mice received IL-2/IL-2Ab or isotype IgG (IsoAb) intraperitoneally for 3 d before (pretreatment) or starting 2 h after (posttreatment) 60 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). IL-2/IL-2Ab selectively increased the number of Tregs in the blood, spleen, and lymph nodes. The IL-2/IL-2Ab treatment significantly reduced infarct volume, inhibited neuroinflammation, and improved sensorimotor functions, as manifested by rotarod test and foot fault test, compared with IsoAb-treated stroke mice. Treg depletion was then achieved by diphtheria toxin (DT) injection into transgenic mice expressing the DT receptor under the control of the Foxp3 promoter (DTR mice). The depletion of Tregs completely eliminated IL-2/IL-2Ab-afforded neuroprotection. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of Tregs collected from IL-2/IL-2Ab-treated mice demonstrated more potent neuroprotection than an equal number of Tregs prepared from IsoAb-treated mice, suggesting that IL-2/IL-2Ab not only elevated Treg numbers, but also boosted their functions. Mechanistically, IL-2/IL-2Ab promoted the expression of CD39 and CD73 in expanded Tregs. CD73 deficiency diminished the protective effect of IL-2/IL-2Ab-stimulated Tregs in stroke mice. The results show that IL-2/IL-2Ab expands Tregs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and boosts their immunomodulatory function. The activation of CD39/CD73 signaling in Tregs may participate as a potential mechanism underlying IL-2/IL-2Ab-afforded neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are known to protect against ischemic stroke. However, the low frequency of Tregs restricts their clinical utility. This study reported that systemic administration of the IL-2/IL-2 antibody complex (IL-2/IL-2Ab) robustly and selectively expanded the number of Tregs after stroke. IL-2/IL-2Ab pretreatment or posttreatment significantly improved stroke outcomes in a rodent model of ischemic stroke. We further discovered that IL-2/IL-2Ab not only elevated Treg numbers, but also boosted their functions and enhanced the expression of CD39 and CD73. Using CD73-deficient mice, we confirmed the importance of CD73 in the protective effect of IL-2/IL-2Ab-stimulated Tregs in stroke mice. These results shed light on IL-2/IL-2Ab as a clinically feasible immune therapy to boost endogenous Treg responses and ameliorate ischemic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Instantaneous Midbrain Control of Saccade Velocity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/47/10156?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to interact with our environment requires the brain to transform spatially represented sensory signals into temporally encoded motor commands for appropriate control of the relevant effectors. For visually guided eye movements, or saccades, the superior colliculus (SC) is assumed to be the final stage of spatial representation, and instantaneous control of the movement is achieved through a rate code representation in the lower brain stem. We investigated whether SC activity in nonhuman primates (Macaca mulatta, 2 male and 1 female) also uses a dynamic rate code, in addition to the spatial representation. Noting that the kinematics of amplitude-matched movements exhibit trial-to-trial variability, we regressed instantaneous SC activity with instantaneous eye velocity and found a robust correlation throughout saccade duration. Peak correlation was tightly linked to time of peak velocity, the optimal efferent delay between SC activity and eye velocity was constant at ~12 ms both at onset and during the saccade, and SC neurons with higher firing rates exhibited stronger correlations. Moreover, the strong correlative relationship and constant efferent delay observation were preserved when eye movement profiles were substantially altered by a blink-induced perturbation. These results indicate that the rate code of individual SC neurons can control instantaneous eye velocity and argue against a serial process of spatial-to-temporal transformation. They also motivated us to consider a new framework of saccade control that does not incorporate traditionally accepted elements, such as the comparator and resettable integrator, whose neural correlates have remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; All movements exhibit time-varying features that are under instantaneous control of the innervating neural command. At what stage in the brain is dynamical control present? It is well known that, in the skeletomotor system, neurons in the motor cortex use dynamical control. In the oculomotor system, in contrast, instantaneous velocity control of saccadic eye movements is not thought to be enforced until the lower brainstem. Using correlations between residual signals across trials, we show that instantaneous control of saccade velocity is present earlier in the visuo-oculomotor neuraxis, at the level of superior colliculus. The results require us to consider alternate frameworks of the neural control of saccades.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visual Evidence Accumulation Guides Decision-Making in Unrestrained Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to manipulate neural activity with precision is an asset in uncovering neural circuits for decision-making. Diverse tools for manipulating neurons are available for mice, but their feasibility remains unclear, especially when decisions require accumulating visual evidence. For example, whether mice' decisions reflect leaky accumulation is unknown, as are the relevant/irrelevant factors that influence decisions. Further, causal circuits for visual evidence accumulation are poorly understood. To address this, we measured decisions in mice judging the fluctuating rate of a flash sequence. An initial analysis (&amp;gt;500,000 trials, 29 male and female mice) demonstrated that information throughout the 1000 ms trial influenced choice, with early information most influential. This suggests that information persists in neural circuits for ~1000 ms with minimal accumulation leak. Next, in a subset of animals, we probed strategy more extensively and found that although animals were influenced by stimulus rate, they were unable to entirely suppress the influence of stimulus brightness. Finally, we identified anteromedial (AM) visual area via retinotopic mapping and optogenetically inhibited it using JAWS. Light activation biased choices in both injected and uninjected animals, demonstrating that light alone influences behavior. By varying stimulus–response contingency while holding stimulated hemisphere constant, we surmounted this obstacle to demonstrate that AM suppression biases decisions. By leveraging a large dataset to quantitatively characterize decision-making behavior, we establish mice as suitable for neural circuit manipulation studies. Further, by demonstrating that mice accumulate visual evidence, we demonstrate that this strategy for reducing uncertainty in decision-making is used by animals with diverse visual systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To connect behaviors to their underlying neural mechanism, a deep understanding of behavioral strategy is needed. This understanding is incomplete for mice. To surmount this, we measured the outcome of &amp;gt;500,000 decisions made by 29 mice trained to judge visual stimuli and performed behavioral/optogenetic manipulations in smaller subsets. Our analyses offer new insights into mice' decision-making strategies and compares them with those of other species. We then disrupted neural activity in a candidate neural structure and examined the effect on decisions. Our findings establish mice as suitable for visual accumulation of evidence decisions. Further, the results highlight similarities in decision-making strategies across very different species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Temporal Contingencies Determine Whether Adaptation Strengthens or Weakens Normalization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/47/10129?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental and nearly ubiquitous feature of sensory encoding is that neuronal responses are strongly influenced by recent experience, or adaptation. Theoretical and computational studies have proposed that many adaptation effects may result in part from changes in the strength of normalization signals. Normalization is a &quot;canonical&quot; computation in which a neuron's response is modulated (normalized) by the pooled activity of other neurons. Here, we test whether adaptation can alter the strength of cross-orientation suppression, or masking, a paradigmatic form of normalization evident in primary visual cortex (V1). We made extracellular recordings of V1 neurons in anesthetized male macaques and measured responses to plaid stimuli composed of two overlapping, orthogonal gratings before and after prolonged exposure to two distinct adapters. The first adapter was a plaid consisting of orthogonal gratings and led to stronger masking. The second adapter presented the same orthogonal gratings in an interleaved manner and led to weaker masking. The strength of adaptation's effects on masking depended on the orientation of the test stimuli relative to the orientation of the adapters, but was independent of neuronal orientation preference. Changes in masking could not be explained by altered neuronal responsivity. Our results suggest that normalization signals can be strengthened or weakened by adaptation depending on the temporal contingencies of the adapting stimuli. Our findings reveal an interplay between two widespread computations in cortical circuits, adaptation and normalization, that enables flexible adjustments to the structure of the environment, including the temporal relationships among sensory stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Two fundamental features of sensory responses are that they are influenced by adaptation and that they are modulated by the activity of other nearby neurons via normalization. Our findings reveal a strong interaction between these two aspects of cortical computation. Specifically, we show that cross-orientation masking, a form of normalization, can be strengthened or weakened by adaptation depending on the temporal contingencies between sensory inputs. Our findings support theoretical proposals that some adaptation effects may involve altered normalization and offer a network-based explanation for how cortex adjusts to current sensory demands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning new skills by watching others is important for social and motor development throughout the lifespan. Prior research has suggested that observational learning shares common substrates with physical practice at both cognitive and brain levels. In addition, neuroimaging studies have used multivariate analysis techniques to understand neural representations in a variety of domains, including vision, audition, memory, and action, but few studies have investigated neural plasticity in representational space. Therefore, although movement sequences can be learned by observing other people's actions, a largely unanswered question in neuroscience is how experience shapes the representational space of neural systems. Here, across a sample of male and female participants, we combined pretraining and posttraining fMRI sessions with 6 d of observational practice to determine whether the observation of action sequences elicits sequence-specific representations in human frontoparietal brain regions and the extent to which these representations become more distinct with observational practice. Our results showed that observed action sequences are modeled by distinct patterns of activity in frontoparietal cortex and that such representations largely generalize to very similar, but untrained, sequences. These findings advance our understanding of what is modeled during observational learning (sequence-specific information), as well as how it is modeled (reorganization of frontoparietal cortex is similar to that previously shown following physical practice). Therefore, on a more fine-grained neural level than demonstrated previously, our findings reveal how the representational structure of frontoparietal cortex maps visual information onto motor circuits in order to enhance motor performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Learning by watching others is a cornerstone in the development of expertise and skilled behavior. However, it remains unclear how visual signals are mapped onto motor circuits for such learning to occur. Here, we show that observed action sequences are modeled by distinct patterns of activity in frontoparietal cortex and that such representations largely generalize to very similar, but untrained, sequences. These findings advance our understanding of what is modeled during observational learning (sequence-specific information), as well as how it is modeled (reorganization of frontoparietal cortex is similar to that previously shown following physical practice). More generally, these findings demonstrate how motor circuit involvement in the perception of action sequences shows high fidelity to prior work, which focused on physical performance of action sequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the adult brain, the extracellular matrix (ECM) influences recovery after injury, susceptibility to mental disorders, and is in general a strong regulator of neuronal plasticity. The proteoglycan aggrecan is a core component of the condensed ECM structures termed perineuronal nets (PNNs), and the specific role of PNNs on neural plasticity remains elusive. Here, we genetically targeted the &lt;i&gt;Acan&lt;/i&gt; gene encoding for aggrecan using a novel animal model. This allowed for conditional and targeted loss of aggrecan &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, which ablated the PNN structure and caused a shift in the population of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons toward a high plasticity state. Selective deletion of the &lt;i&gt;Acan&lt;/i&gt; gene in the visual cortex of male adult mice reinstated juvenile ocular dominance plasticity, which was mechanistically identical to critical period plasticity. Brain-wide targeting improved object recognition memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The study provides the first direct evidence of aggrecan as the main functional constituent and orchestrator of perineuronal nets (PNNs), and that loss of PNNs by aggrecan removal induces a permanent state of critical period-like plasticity. Loss of aggrecan ablates the PNN structure, resulting in invoked juvenile plasticity in the visual cortex and enhanced object recognition memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Abstract Representation of Prospective Reward in the Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motivation enhances memory by increasing hippocampal engagement during encoding. However, whether such increased hippocampal activation reflects encoding of the value of highly rewarding events per se is less understood. Here, using a monetary incentive encoding task with a novel manipulation, we tested in humans whether the hippocampus represents abstract reward value, independent of perceptual content. During functional MRI scanning, men and women studied object pairs, each preceded by a monetary reward cue indicating the amount of money they would receive if they successfully remembered the object pair at test. Reward cues varied on both the level of reward (penny, dime, and dollar) and visual form (picture or word) across trials to dissociate hippocampal responses to reward value from those reflecting the perceptual properties of the cues. Behaviorally, participants remembered pairs associated with the high reward (dollar) more often than pairs associated with lower rewards. Neural pattern-similarity analysis revealed that hippocampal and parahippocampal cortex activation patterns discriminated between cues of different value regardless of their visual form, and that hippocampal discrimination of value was most pronounced in participants who showed the greatest behavioral sensitivity to reward. Strikingly, hippocampal patterns were most distinct for reward cues that differed in value but had similar visual appearance, consistent with theoretical proposals of hippocampal-pattern differentiation of competing representations. Our data illustrate how contextual representations within the hippocampus go beyond space and time to include information about the motivational salience of events, with hippocampal reward coding tracking the motivational impact on later memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Motivation, such as the promise of future rewards, enhances hippocampal engagement during encoding and promotes successful retention of events associated with valuable rewards. However, whether the hippocampus explicitly encodes reward value, dissociable from sensory information, is unclear. Here, we show that the hippocampus forms abstract representation of valuable rewards, encoding conceptual rather than perceptual information about the motivational context of individual events. Reward representation within the hippocampus is associated with preferential retention of high-value events in memory. Furthermore, we show that hippocampal-pattern differentiation serves to emphasize differences between visually similar events with distinct motivational salience. Collectively, these findings indicate that hippocampal contextual representations enable individuals to distinguish the motivational value of events, leading to prioritized encoding of significant memories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sleep and Wakefulness Are Controlled by Ventral Medial Midbrain/Pons GABAergic Neurons in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep–wake behavior is controlled by a wide range of neuronal populations in the mammalian brain. Although the ventral midbrain/pons (VMP) area is suggested to participate in sleep–wake regulation, the neuronal mechanisms have remained unclear. Here, we found that nonspecific cell ablation or selective ablation of GABAergic neurons by expressing diphtheria toxin fragment A in the VMP in male mice induced a large increase in wakefulness that lasted at least 4 weeks. In contrast, selective ablation of dopaminergic neurons in the VMP had little effect on wakefulness. Chemogenetic inhibition of VMP GABAergic neurons also markedly increased wakefulness. The wake-promoting effect of the VMP GABAergic neuron ablation or inhibition was attenuated to varying degrees by the administration of dopamine D1 or D2/3 receptor antagonists and abolished by the administration of both antagonists together. In contrast, chemogenetic activation of VMP GABAergic neurons very strongly increased slow-wave sleep and reduced wakefulness. These findings suggest that VMP GABAergic neurons regulate dopaminergic actions in the sleep–wake behavior of mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Current understanding of the neuronal mechanisms and populations that regulate sleep–wake behavior is incomplete. Here, we identified a GABAergic ventral midbrain/pons area that is necessary for controlling the daily amount of sleep and wakefulness in mice. We also found that these inhibitory neurons control wakefulness by suppressing dopaminergic systems. Surprisingly, activation of these neurons strongly induced slow-wave sleep while suppressing wakefulness. Our study reveals a new brain mechanism critical for sleep–wake regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nonlinear Lateral Interactions in V1 Population Responses Explained by a Contrast Gain Control Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;How do cortical responses to local image elements combine to form a spatial pattern of population activity in primate V1? Here, we used voltage-sensitive dye imaging, which measures summed membrane potential activity, to examine the rules that govern lateral interactions between the representations of two small local-oriented elements in macaque (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) V1. We find strong subadditive and mostly orientation-independent interactions for nearby elements [2–4 mm interelement cortical distance (IED)] that gradually become linear at larger separations (&amp;gt;6 mm IED). These results are consistent with a population gain control model describing nonlinear V1 population responses to single oriented elements. However, because of the membrane potential-to-spiking accelerating nonlinearity, the model predicts supra-additive lateral interactions of spiking responses for intermediate separations at a range of locations between the two elements, consistent with some prior facilitatory effects observed in electrophysiology and psychophysics. Overall, our results suggest that population-level lateral interactions in V1 are primarily explained by a simple orientation-independent contrast gain control mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Interactions between representations of simple visual elements such as oriented edges in primary visual cortex (V1) are thought to contribute to our ability to easily integrate contours and segment surfaces, but the mechanisms that govern these interactions are primarily unknown. Our study provides novel evidence that lateral interactions at the population level are governed by a simple contrast gain–control mechanism, and we show how this divisive gain–control mechanism can give rise to apparently facilitatory spiking responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Hippocampal Film Editor: Sensitivity and Specificity to Event Boundaries in Continuous Experience</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/47/10057?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The function of the human hippocampus is normally investigated by experimental manipulation of discrete events. Less is known about what triggers hippocampal activity during more naturalistic, continuous experience. We hypothesized that the hippocampus would be sensitive to the occurrence of event boundaries, that is, moments in time identified by observers as a transition between events. To address this, we analyzed functional MRI data from two groups: one (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 253, 131 female) who viewed an 8.5 min film and another (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15, 6 female) who viewed a 120 min film. We observed a strong hippocampal response at boundaries defined by independent observers, which was modulated by boundary salience (the number of observers that identified each boundary). In the longer film, there were sufficient boundaries to show that this modulation remained after covarying out a large number of perceptual factors. This hypothesis-driven approach was complemented by a data-driven approach, in which we identified hippocampal events as moments in time with the strongest hippocampal activity. The correspondence between these hippocampal events and event boundaries was highly significant, revealing that the hippocampal response is not only sensitive, but also specific to event boundaries. We conclude that event boundaries play a key role in shaping hippocampal activity during encoding of naturalistic events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent years have seen the field of human neuroscience research transitioning from experiments with simple stimuli to the study of more complex and naturalistic experience. Nonetheless, our understanding of the function of many brain regions, such as the hippocampus, is based primarily on the study of brief, discrete events. As a result, we know little of what triggers hippocampal activity in real-life settings when we are exposed to a continuous stream of information. When does the hippocampus &quot;decide&quot; to respond during the encoding of naturalistic experience? We reveal here that hippocampal activity measured by fMRI during film watching is both sensitive and specific to event boundaries, identifying a potential mechanism whereby event boundaries shape experience by modulation of hippocampal activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Unilateral, 3D Arm Movement Kinematics Are Encoded in Ipsilateral Human Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/47/10042?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is increasing evidence that the hemisphere ipsilateral to a moving limb plays a role in planning and executing movements. However, the exact relationship between cortical activity and ipsilateral limb movements is uncertain. We sought to determine whether 3D arm movement kinematics (speed, velocity, and position) could be decoded from cortical signals recorded from the hemisphere ipsilateral to the moving limb. By having invasively monitored patients perform unilateral reaches with each arm, we also compared the encoding of contralateral and ipsilateral limb kinematics from a single cortical hemisphere. In four motor-intact human patients (three male, one female) implanted with electrocorticography electrodes for localization of their epileptic foci, we decoded 3D movement kinematics of both arms with accuracies above chance. Surprisingly, the spatial and spectral encoding of contralateral and ipsilateral limb kinematics was similar, enabling cross-prediction of kinematics between arms. These results clarify our understanding that the ipsilateral hemisphere robustly contributes to motor execution and supports that the information of complex movements is more bihemispherically represented in humans than has been previously understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although limb movements are traditionally understood to be driven by the cortical hemisphere contralateral to a moving limb, movement-related neural activity has also been found in the ipsilateral hemisphere. This study provides the first demonstration that 3D arm movement kinematics can be decoded from human electrocorticographic signals ipsilateral to the moving limb. Surprisingly, the spatial and spectral encoding of contralateral and ipsilateral limb kinematics was similar. The finding that specific kinematics are encoded in the ipsilateral hemisphere demonstrates that the ipsilateral hemisphere contributes to the execution of unilateral limb movements, improving our understanding of motor control. Additionally, the bihemisheric representation of voluntary movements has implications for the development of neuroprosthetic systems for reaching and for neurorehabilitation strategies following cortical injuries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Specificity of Primate Amygdalar Pathways to Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The amygdala projects to hippocampus in pathways through which affective or social stimuli may influence learning and memory. We investigated the still unknown amygdalar termination patterns and their postsynaptic targets in hippocampus from system to synapse in rhesus monkeys of both sexes. The amygdala robustly innervated the stratum lacunosum-moleculare layer of cornu ammonis fields and uncus anteriorly. Sparser terminations in posterior hippocampus innervated the radiatum and pyramidal layers at the prosubicular/CA1 juncture. The terminations, which were larger than other afferents in the surrounding neuropil, position the amygdala to influence hippocampal input anteriorly, and its output posteriorly. Most amygdalar boutons (76–80%) innervated spines of excitatory hippocampal neurons, and most of the remaining innervated presumed inhibitory neurons, identified by morphology and label with parvalbumin or calretinin, which distinguished nonoverlapping neurochemical classes of hippocampal inhibitory neurons. In CA1, amygdalar axons innervated some calretinin neurons, which disinhibit pyramidal neurons. By contrast, in CA3 the amygdala innervated both calretinin and parvalbumin neurons; the latter strongly inhibit nearby excitatory neurons. In CA3, amygdalar pathways also made closely spaced dual synapses on excitatory neurons. The strong excitatory synapses in CA3 may facilitate affective context representations and trigger sharp-wave ripples associated with memory consolidation. When the amygdala is excessively activated during traumatic events, the specialized innervation of excitatory neurons and the powerful parvalbumin inhibitory neurons in CA3 may allow the suppression of activity of nearby neurons that receive weaker nonamygdalar input, leading to biased passage of highly charged affective stimuli and generalized fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Strong pathways from the amygdala targeted the anterior hippocampus, and more weakly its posterior sectors, positioned to influence a variety of emotional and cognitive functions. In hippocampal field CA1, the amygdala innervated some calretinin neurons, which disinhibit excitatory neurons. By contrast, in CA3 the amygdala innervated calretinin as well as some of the powerful parvalbumin inhibitory neurons and may help balance the activity of neural ensembles to allow social interactions, learning, and memory. These results suggest that when the amygdala is hyperactive during emotional upheaval, it strongly activates excitatory hippocampal neurons and parvalbumin inhibitory neurons in CA3, which can suppress nearby neurons that receive weaker input from other sources, biasing the passage of stimuli with high emotional import and leading to generalized fear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stigmergy has proved its great superiority in terms of distributed control,
robustness and adaptability, thus being regarded as an ideal solution for
large-scale swarm control problems. Based on new discoveries on astrocytes in
regulating synaptic transmission in the brain, this paper has mapped stigmergy
mechanism into the interaction between synapses and investigated its
characteristics and advantages. Particularly, we have divided the interaction
between synapses which are not directly connected into three phases and
proposed a stigmergic learning model. In this model, the state change of a
stigmergy agent will expand its influence to affect the states of others. The
strength of the interaction is determined by the level of neural activity as
well as the distance between stigmergy agents. Inspired by the morphological
and functional changes in astrocytes during environmental enrichment, it is
likely that the regulation of distance between stigmergy agents plays a
critical role in the stigmergy learning process. Simulation results have
verified its importance and indicated that the well-regulated distance between
stigmergy agents can help to obtain stigmergy learning gain.

	<description>Recombination, the exchange of information between different genetic polymer strands, is of fundamental importance in biology for genome maintenance and genetic diversification mediated by dedicated recombinase enzymes. Here, we describe a pervasive non-enzymatic capacity for recombination (and ligation) in random-sequence genetic oligomer pools. Specifically, we examine random and semi-random eicosamer (N&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;) pools of RNA, DNA and the unnatural genetic polymers ANA (arabino-), HNA (hexitol-) and AtNA (altritol-nucleic acids). While DNA, ANA and HNA pools proved inert, RNA and AtNA pools displayed diverse modes of spontaneous intermolecular recombination, connecting recombination mechanistically to the vicinal ring cis-diol configuration shared by RNA and AtNA. Thus, the chemical constitution that renders both susceptible to hydrolysis emerges as the fundamental determinant of an innate capacity for recombination, which is shown to enable a concomitant increase in compositional, informational and structural pool complexity and hence evolutionary potential.</description>

	<description>The mechanisms underlying axon regeneration in mature neurons are relevant to the understanding of normal nervous system maintenance and for developing therapeutic strategies for injury. Here, we report novel pathways in axon regeneration, identified by extending our previous function-based screen using the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;mechanosensory neuron axotomy model. We identify an unexpected role of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) synthesizing enzyme, NMAT-2/NMNAT, in axon regeneration. NMAT-2 inhibits axon regrowth via cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms. NMAT-2 enzymatic activity is required to repress regrowth. Further, we find differential requirements for proteins in membrane contact site, components and regulators of the extracellular matrix, membrane trafficking, microtubule and actin cytoskeleton, the conserved Kelch-domain protein IVNS-1, and the orphan transporter MFSD-6 in axon regrowth. Identification of these new pathways expands our understanding of the molecular basis of axonal injury response and regeneration.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Rotavirus VP3 targets MAVS for degradation to inhibit type III interferon expression in intestinal epithelial cells</title>

	<description>Rotaviruses (RVs), a leading cause of severe diarrhea in young children&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and many mammalian species, have evolved multiple strategies to counteract the host innate immunity, specifically interferon (IFN) signaling through RV non-structural protein 1 (NSP1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. However, whether RV structural components also subvert antiviral response remains under-studied. Here, we found that MAVS, critical for the host RNA sensing pathway upstream of IFN induction&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, is degraded by the RV RNA methyl- and guanylyl-transferase (VP3) in a host-range-restricted manner. Mechanistically, VP3 localizes to the mitochondria and mediates the phosphorylation of a previously unidentified SPLTSS motif within the MAVS proline-rich region, leading to its proteasomal degradation and blockade of IFN-λ production in RV-infected intestinal epithelial cells. Importantly, VP3 inhibition of MAVS activity contributes to enhanced RV replication and to viral pathogenesis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Collectively, our findings establish RV VP3 as a viral antagonist of MAVS function in mammals and uncover a novel pathogen-mediated inhibitory mechanism of MAVS signaling.</description>

	<description>The biogenesis of 60S ribosomal subunits is initiated in the nucleus where rRNAs and proteins form pre-60S particles. These pre-60S particles mature by transiently interacting with various assembly factors. The ~5000 amino-acid AAA+ ATPase Rea1 (or Midasin) generates force to mechanically remove assembly factors from pre-60S particles, which promotes their export to the cytosol. Here we present three Rea1 cryoEM structures. We visualize the Rea1 engine, a hexameric ring of AAA+ domains, and identify an α-helical bundle of AAA2 as a major ATPase activity regulator. The α-helical bundle interferes with nucleotide induced conformational changes that create a docking site for the substrate binding MIDAS domain on the AAA+ ring. Furthermore, we reveal the architecture of the Rea1 linker, which is involved in force generation and extends from the AAA+ ring. The data presented here provide insights into the mechanism of one of the most complex ribosome maturation factors.</description>

	<description>The brain displays a remarkable ability to adapt following injury by altering its connections through neural plasticity. Many of the biological mechanisms that underlie plasticity are known, but there is little knowledge as to when, or where in the brain plasticity will occur following injury. This knowledge could guide plasticity-promoting interventions and create a more accurate roadmap of the recovery process following injury. We causally investigated the time-course of plasticity after hippocampal lesions using multi-modal MRI in monkeys. We show that post-injury plasticity is highly dynamic, but also largely predictable on the basis of the functional connectivity of the lesioned region, gradients of cell densities across the cortex and the pre-lesion network structure of the brain. The ability to predict which brain areas will plastically adapt their functional connectivity following injury may allow us to decipher why some brain lesions lead to permanent loss of cognitive function, while others do not.</description>

	<description>How does our brain give rise to passive or active defensive responses when we are confronted with threats? In a recent study in Cell, Terburg, Scheggia and colleagues (Terburg et al., 2018) show that, in both humans and rats, a pathway originating from the amygdala can help suppress passive responses, thereby facilitating active responses to imminent threats.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Toll-like receptor 3 activation increases voluntary alcohol intake in C57BL/6J male mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/476457v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/476457v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Many genes differentially expressed in brain tissue from human alcoholics and animals that have consumed large amounts of alcohol are components of the innate immune toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway. TLRs initiate inflammatory responses via two branches: (1) MyD88-dependent or (2) TRIF-dependent. All TLRs signal through MyD88 except TLR3. Prior work demonstrated a direct role for MyD88-dependent signaling in regulation of alcohol consumption. However, the role of TLR3 as a potential regulator of excessive alcohol drinking has not previously been investigated. To test the possibility TLR3 activation regulates alcohol consumption, we injected mice with the TLR3 agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and tested alcohol consumption in an every-other-day two-bottle choice test. Poly(I:C) produced a persistent increase in alcohol intake that developed over several days. Repeated poly(I:C) and ethanol exposure altered innate immune transcript abundance; increased levels of TRIF-dependent pathway components correlated with increased alcohol consumption. Administration of poly(I:C) before exposure to alcohol did not alter alcohol intake, suggesting that poly(I:C) and ethanol must be present together to change drinking behavior. To determine which branch of TLR signaling mediates poly(I:C)-induced changes in drinking behavior, we tested either mice lacking MyD88 or mice administered a TLR3/dsRNA complex inhibitor. MyD88 null mutants showed poly(I:C)-induced increases in alcohol intake. In contrast, mice pretreated with a TLR3/dsRNA complex inhibitor reduced their alcohol intake, suggesting poly(I:C)-induced escalations in alcohol intake function are, at least partially, dependent on TLR3. Together, these results strongly suggest that TLR3-dependent signaling drives excessive alcohol drinking behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Front-end Weber-Fechner gain control enhances the fidelity of combinatorial odor coding</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/475103v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/475103v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Odor identity is encoded by spatiotemporal patterns of activity in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In natural environments, the intensity and timescales of odor signals can span several orders of magnitude, and odors can mix with one another, potentially scrambling the combinatorial code mapping neural activity to odor identity. Recent studies have shown that in Drosophila the ORNs that express the olfactory co-receptor Orco scale their gain inversely with mean odor concentration according to the Weber-Fechner Law of psychophysics. Here we use a minimal biophysical model of signal transduction, ORN firing, and signal decoding to investigate the implications of this front-end scaling law for the neural representations of odor identity. We find that Weber-Fechner scaling enhances coding capacity and promotes the reconstruction of odor identity from dynamic odor signals, even in the presence of confounding background odors and rapid intensity fluctuations. We show that these enhancements are further aided by downstream transformations such as normalization and divergence in the antennal lobe and mushroom body. Thus, despite the broad overlap between individual ORN tuning curves, a mechanism of front-end adaptation, when endowed with Weber-Fechner scaling, may play a vital role in preserving representations of odor identity in naturalistic odor landscapes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Can you have multiple attentional templates? Large-scale replications of Van Moorselaar, Theeuwes and Olivers (2014) and Hollingworth and Beck (2016)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/474932v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Stimuli that resemble the content of visual working memory (VWM) capture attention. However, theories disagree on how many VWM items can bias attention simultaneously. The multiple-state account posits a distinction between template and accessory VWM items, such that only a single template item biases attention. In contrast, homogenous-state accounts posit that all VWM items bias attention. Recently, Van Moorselaar et al. (2014) and Hollingworth and Beck (2016) tested these accounts, but obtained seemingly contradictory results. Van Moorselaar et al. (2014) found that a distractor in a visual-search task captured attention more when it matched the content of VWM (memory-driven capture). Crucially, memory-driven capture disappeared when more than one item was held in VWM, in line with the multiple-state account. In contrast, Hollingworth and Beck (2016) found memory-driven capture even when multiple items were kept in VWM, in line with a homogenous-state account. Considering these mixed results, we replicated both studies with a larger sample, and found that all key results are reliable. It is unclear to what extent these divergent results are due to paradigm differences between the studies. We conclude that is crucial to our understanding of VWM to determine the boundary conditions under which memory-driven capture occurs.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Older adults sacrifice response speed to preserve multisensory integration performance</title>

	<description>Ageing is thought to impact multisensory integration, but the underlying computational mechanisms are poorly understood. Signals that come from a common source should be integrated, weighted by their reliability; those that do not share a source should be segregated. Combining psychophysics and Bayesian modelling we investigated how ageing affects audiovisual integration of spatial signals. Under unspeeded conditions, older and younger adults were comparable in their localisation responses and common-source judgements. Likewise, the Bayesian Causal Inference model fitted to observers' response choices indicated that sensory reliabilities and arbitration between integration and segregation were similar across age groups. However, under speeded conditions, older observers were slower at localising sounds, particularly when they were paired with spatially incongruent visual signals. A Bayesian evidence accumulation model, fitted jointly to response choices and response times, revealed that older observers accumulate noisier auditory representations for longer, set higher decisional thresholds, and have impaired motor speeds. Thus, modelling the within-trial dynamics of multisensory evidence accumulation reveals that older observers preserve audiovisual localisation performance by sacrificing response speed.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Waving goodbye to contrast: Self-generated hand movements attenuate visual sensitivity</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/474783v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>It is well known that the human brain continuously predicts the sensory consequences of its own body movements, which typically results in sensory attenuation. Yet, the extent and exact mechanisms underlying sensory attenuation are still debated. To explore this issue, we asked participants to decide which of two visual stimuli was of higher contrast in a virtual reality situation where one of the stimuli could appear behind the participants' invisible moving hand or not. Over two experiments, we measured the effects of such &quot;virtual occlusion&quot; on first-order sensitivity and on metacognitive monitoring. Our findings show that self-generated hand movements reduced the apparent contrast of the stimulus. This result can be explained by the active inference theory. Moreover, sensory attenuation seemed to affect only first-order sensitivity and not (second-order) metacognitive judgments of confidence.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Deepbinner: Demultiplexing barcoded Oxford Nanopore reads with deep convolutional neural networks</title>

Multiplexing, the simultaneous sequencing of multiple barcoded DNA samples on a single flow cell, has made Oxford Nanopore sequencing cost-effective for small genomes. However, it depends on the ability to sort the resulting sequencing reads by barcode, and current demultiplexing tools fail to classify many reads. Here we present Deepbinner, a tool for Oxford Nanopore demultiplexing that uses a deep neural network to classify reads based on the raw electrical read signal. This ‘signal-space’ approach allows for greater accuracy than existing ‘base-space’ tools (Albacore and Porechop) for which signals must first be converted to DNA base calls, itself a complex problem that can introduce noise into the barcode sequence. To assess Deepbinner and existing tools, we performed multiplex sequencing on 12 amplicons chosen for their distinguishability. This allowed us to establish a ground truth classification for each read based on internal sequence alone. Deepbinner had the lowest rate of unclassified reads (7.8%) and the highest demultiplexing precision (98.5% of classified reads were correctly assigned). It can be used alone (to maximise the number of classified reads) or in conjunction with other demultiplexers (to maximise precision and minimise false positive classifications). We also found cross-sample chimeric reads (0.3%) and evidence of barcode switching (0.3%) in our dataset, which likely arise during library preparation and may be detrimental for quantitative studies that use multiplexing. Deepbinner is open source (GPLv3) and available at https://github.com/rrwick/Deepbinner.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zSKzkzc7_uc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

To transmit information efficiently in a changing environment, the retina adapts to visual contrast by adjusting its gain, latency and mean response. Additionally, the temporal frequency selectivity, or bandwidth changes to encode the absolute intensity when the stimulus environment is noisy, and intensity differences when noise is low. We show that the On pathway of On-Off retinal amacrine and ganglion cells is required to change temporal bandwidth but not other adaptive properties. This remarkably specific adaptive mechanism arises from differential effects of contrast on the On and Off pathways. We analyzed a biophysical model fit only to a cell’s membrane potential, and verified pharmacologically that it accurately revealed the two pathways. We conclude that changes in bandwidth arise mostly from differences in synaptic threshold in the two pathways, rather than synaptic release dynamics as has previously been proposed to underlie contrast adaptation. Different efficient codes are selected by different thresholds in two independently adapting neural pathways.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sklOjZc6RaM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Decision making often requires weighing costs and benefits of different options that vary in terms of reward magnitude and uncertainty. Previous studies using pharmacological inactivations have shown that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) pathway promotes choice towards larger/riskier rewards. Neural activity in BLA and NAc show distinct, phasic changes in firing prior to choice and following action outcomes, yet, how these temporally-discrete patterns of activity within BLA-NAc circuitry influence choice is unclear. We assessed how optogenetic silencing of BLA terminals in the NAc altered action selection during probabilistic decision making. Rats received intra-BLA infusions of viruses encoding the inhibitory opsin eArchT and were well-trained on a probabilistic discounting task, where they chose between smaller/certain rewards and larger rewards delivered in a probabilistic manner, with the odds of obtaining the larger reward changing over a session (50-12.5%). During testing, activity of BLA&amp;amp;cenveo_unknown_entity_wingdings_F0E0;NAc inputs were suppressed with 4-7 s pulses of light delivered via optic fibers into the NAc during discrete task events: prior to choice or after choice outcomes. Inhibition prior to choice reduced selection of the preferred option, suggesting that during deliberation, BLA-NAc activity biases choice towards preferred rewards. Inhibition during reward omissions increased risky choice during the low-probability block, indicating that activity after non-rewarded actions serves to modify subsequent choice. In contrast, silencing during rewarded outcomes did not reliably affect choice. These data demonstrate how patterns of activity in BLA-NAc circuitry convey different types of information that guide action selection in situations involving reward uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Amygdala projections to the nucleus accumbens form a neural circuit that has been implicated in guiding risk-related decision making, and dysfunction in this circuitry is thought to underlie aberrant decision making observed a variety of psychiatric illnesses. The present study used temporally-discrete optogenetic inhibition to identify how activity in amygdala inputs to the accumbens, during different phases of the decision process, promotes optimal decision making. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms through which these circuits contribute to normal and abnormal decisions involving reward uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Current theories suggest that the ability to control the body and to predict its associated sensory consequences is key for skilled motor behavior. It is also suggested that these abilities need both be updated when the mapping between motor commands and sensory consequences is altered. Here we challenge this view by investigating the transfer of adaptation to rotated visual feedback between one task in which human participants had to control a cursor with their hand in order to track a moving target, and another in which they had to predict with their eyes the visual consequences of their hand movement on the cursor. Hand and eye tracking performances were evaluated respectively through cursor-target and gaze-cursor distance. Results reveal a striking dissociation: although prior adaptation of hand tracking greatly facilitates eye tracking, adaptation of eye tracking does not transfer to hand tracking. We conclude that although the update of control is associated with the update of prediction, prediction can be updated independently of control. To account for this pattern of results we propose that task demands mediate the update of prediction and control. Although a joint update of prediction and control seemed mandatory for success in our hand tracking task, the update of control was only facultative for success in our eye tracking task. More generally those results promote the view that prediction and control are mediated by separate neural processes and suggest that people can learn to predict movement consequences without necessarily promoting their ability to control these movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Current theories suggest that accurately predicting the sensory consequences of one’s actions is central for perception, awareness of action, and motor learning. In the latter case, it is assumed that prediction errors are used to train the controller that transforms our desired sensory consequences into motor commands. Here we show that, following exposure to biased hand visual feedback, people can update their ability to predict visual consequences of hand movements without necessarily improving their ability to control these movements. This work challenges the view that the joint update of prediction and control is mandatory when facing a change in the mapping between motor commands and sensory consequences. Instead we propose that task demands mediate the update of prediction and control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The nervous system seamlessly integrates perception and action. This ability is essential for stable representation of and appropriate responses to the external environment. How the sensorimotor integration underlying this ability occurs at the level of individual neurons is of keen interest. In &lt;i&gt;C. elegans,&lt;/i&gt; RIA interneurons receive input from sensory pathways and have reciprocal connections with head motor neurons. RIA simultaneously encodes both head orientation and sensory stimuli, which may allow it to integrate these two signals to detect the spatial distribution of stimuli across head sweeps and generate directional head responses. Here, we show that blocking synaptic release from RIA disrupts head orientation behaviors in response to unilaterally presented stimuli. We found that sensory encoding in RIA is gated according to head orientation. This dependence on head orientation is independent of motor encoding in RIA, suggesting a second, posture-dependent pathway upstream of RIA. This gating mechanism may allow RIA to selectively attend to stimuli that are asymmetric across head sweeps. Attractive odor removal during head bends triggers rapid head withdrawal in the opposite direction. Unlike sensory encoding, this directional response is dependent on motor inputs to and synaptic output from RIA. Together, these results suggest that RIA is part of a sensorimotor pathway that is dynamically regulated according to head orientation at two levels: the first is a gate that filters sensory representations in RIA, and the second is a switch that routes RIA synaptic output to dorsal or ventral head motor neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Simple head orientation behaviors in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; provide an opportunity to dissect sensorimotor integration at the cellular and subcellular levels. We describe a single interneuron that coordinates posture, sensation, and movement to detect the spatial distribution of stimuli and direct motor output to guide navigation behavior. Our findings underscore the fundamental role of neural mechanisms for integrating sensory input into ongoing behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;GABAergic cells constitute 20–40% of the cells that project from the inferior colliculus [(IC) a midbrain auditory hub] to the medial geniculate body [(MG) the main auditory nucleus of the thalamus]. Four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells have been identified based on their association with perineuronal nets (PNs) and dense rings of axosomatic terminals expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2 rings). These subtypes differ in their soma size and distribution within the IC. Based on previous work emphasizing large GABAergic cells as the origin of GABAergic IC–MG projections, we hypothesized that GABAergic IC cells surrounded by PNs and VGLUT2 rings, which tend to have larger somas, were more likely to project to the MG than smaller cells lacking these extracellular markers. Here, we injected retrograde tract tracers into the MG of guinea pigs of either sex and analyzed retrogradely labeled GABAergic cells in the ipsilateral IC for soma size and association with PNs and/or VGLUT2 rings. We found a range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC–MG pathway, which were reflective of the full range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC. Further, we found that all four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells participate in the IC–MG pathway, and that GABAergic cells lacking PNs and VGLUT2 rings were more prevalent within the pathway than would be expected based on their overall prevalence in the IC. These results may provide an anatomical substrate for the multiple roles of inhibition in the IC–MG pathway, which have emerged in electrophysiological studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>MicroRNA (miRNA)-124 is expressed in neurons, where it represses genes inhibitory for neuronal differentiation, including the RNA binding protein PTBP1. PTBP1 maintains nonneuronal splicing patterns of mRNAs that switch to neuronal isoforms upon neuronal differentiation. We find that primary (pri)-miR-124-1 is expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells where mature miR-124...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/WSzMAXmiUq0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Multiple mutations are typically required to significantly improve protein stability or aggregation kinetics. However, when several substitutions are made in a single protein, the mutations can potentially interact in a nonadditive manner, resulting in epistatic effects, which can hamper protein-engineering strategies to improve thermostability or aggregation kinetics. Here, we have...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/BOb3KqJ3n7U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Coding with transient trajectories in recurrent neural networks. (arXiv:1811.07592v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07592</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07592</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Following a stimulus, the neural response typically strongly varies in time
and across neurons before settling to a steady-state. While classical
population coding theory disregards the temporal dimension, recent works have
argued that trajectories of transient activity can be particularly informative
about stimulus identity and may form the basis of computations through
dynamics. Yet an understanding of the dynamical mechanisms needed to generate a
population code based on transient trajectories is still missing. Here we show
that a broad class of high-dimensional linear networks of recurrently connected
units exhibits the properties needed for transient coding. We first identify a
general criterion that distinguishes two classes of networks depending on
properties of the connectivity matrix: networks in which all inputs lead to
weak, decaying transients, and networks in which specific inputs elicit
strongly amplified transient responses and are mapped onto orthogonal output
states during the dynamics. For the second class of networks, we provide a
procedure to identify transiently amplified inputs and the corresponding
readouts for arbitrary connectivity matrices. We then exploit our approach to
build the minimal connectivity which robustly implements trajectories that map
a specific input onto a specific output state, and we demonstrate that the
capacity of the obtained networks increases proportionally with their size.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Eigenmodes of a broad class of &quot;sparse&quot; random matrices, with interactions
concentrated near the diagonal, exponentially localize in space, as initially
discovered in 1957 by Anderson for quantum systems. Anderson localization plays
ubiquitous roles in varieties of problems from electrons in solids to
mechanical and optical systems. However, its implications in neuroscience
(where the connections can be strongly asymmetric) have been largely
unexplored, mainly because synaptic connectivity matrices of neural systems are
often &quot;dense&quot;, which makes the eigenmodes spatially extended. Here, we explore
roles that Anderson localization could be playing in neural networks by
focusing on &quot;spatially structured&quot; disorder in synaptic connectivity matrices.
Recently, neuroscientists have experimentally confirmed that the local
excitation and global inhibition (LEGI) ring attractor model can functionally
represent head direction cells in Drosophila melanogaster central brain. We
first study a non-Hermitian (i.e. asymmetric) tight-binding model with disorder
and then establish a connection to the LEGI ring attractor model. We discover
that (i) Principal eigenvectors of the LEGI ring attractor networks with
structured nearest neighbor disorder are &quot;quasi-localized&quot;, even with fully
dense inhibitory connections. (ii) The quasi-localized eigenvectors play
dominant roles in the early time neural dynamics, and the location of the
principal quasi-localized eigenvectors predict an initial location of the &quot;bump
of activity&quot; representing, say, a head direction of an insect. Our
investigations open up a new venue for explorations at the intersection between
the theory of Anderson localization and neural networks with spatially
structured disorder.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Frequent Network Neighborhood Mapping of the Human Hippocampus Shows Much More Frequent Neighbor Sets in Males Than in Females. (arXiv:1811.07423v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the study of the human connectome, the vertices and the edges of the
network of the human brain is analyzed: the vertices of the graphs are the
anatomically identified gray matter areas of the subjects; this set is exactly
the same for all the subjects. The edges of the graphs correspond to the axonal
fibers, connecting these areas. In the biological applications of graph theory,
it happens very rarely that scientists examine numerous large graphs on the
very same, labeled vertex set. Exactly this is the case in the study of the
connectomes. Because of the particularity of these sets of graphs, novel,
robust methods need to be developed for their analysis. Here we introduce the
new method of the Frequent Network Neighborhood Mapping for the connectome,
which serves as a robust identification of the neighborhoods of given vertices
of special interest in the graph. We apply the novel method for mapping the
neighborhoods of the human hippocampus and discover strong statistical
asymmetries between the connectomes of the sexes, computed from the Human
Connectome Project. We analyze 413 braingraphs, each with 463 nodes. We show
that the hippocampi of men have much more significantly frequent neighbor sets
than women; therefore, in a sense, the connections of the hippocampi are more
regularly distributed in men and more varied in women. Our results are in
contrast to the volumetric studies of the human hippocampus, where it was shown
that the relative volume of the hippocampus is the same in men and women.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although Darwinian models are rampant in the social sciences, social
scientists do not face the problem that motivated Darwin's theory of natural
selection: the problem of explaining how lineages evolve despite that any
traits they acquire are regularly discarded at the end of the lifetime of the
individuals that acquired them. While the rationale for framing culture as an
evolutionary process is correct, it does not follow that culture is a Darwinian
or selectionist process, or that population genetics and phylogenetics provide
viable starting points for modeling cultural change. This paper lays out
step-by-step arguments as to why this approach is ill-conceived, focusing on
the lack of randomness and lack of a self-assembly code in cultural evolution,
and summarizes an alternative approach.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We examine whether a single biophysical cortical circuit model can explain
both spiking and perceptual variability. We consider perceptual rivalry, which
provides a window into intrinsic neural processing since neural activity in
some brain areas is correlated to the alternating perception rather than the
constant ambiguous stimulus. The prevalent theory for spiking variability is a
chaotic attractor called the balanced state; whereas, the source of perceptual
variability is an open question. We present a dynamical model with a chaotic
attractor that explains both spiking and perceptual variability and adheres to
a broad set of strict experimental constraints. The model makes quantitative
predictions for how both spiking and perceptual variability will change as the
stimulus changes.

	<description>Gyrase is a unique type IIA topoisomerase that uses ATP hydrolysis to maintain the negatively supercoiled state of bacterial DNA. In order to perform its function, gyrase undergoes a sequence of conformational changes that consist of concerted gate openings, DNA cleavage, and DNA strand passage events. Structures where the transported DNA molecule (T-segment) is trapped by the A subunit have not been observed. Here we present the cryoEM structures of two oligomeric complexes of open gyrase A dimers and DNA. The protein subunits in these complexes were solved to 4 Å and 5.16 Å resolution. One of the complexes traps a linear DNA molecule, a putative T-segment, which interacts with the open gyrase A dimers in two states, representing steps either prior to or after passage through the DNA-gate. The structures locate the T-segment in important intermediate conformations of the catalytic cycle and provide insights into gyrase-DNA interactions and mechanism.</description>

	<description>Estrogen Receptor-alpha (ER) drives 75% of breast cancers. Stimulation of the ER by estra-2-diol forms a transcriptionally-active chromatin-bound complex. Previous studies reported that ER binding follows a cyclical pattern. However, most studies have been limited to individual ER target genes and without replicates. Thus, the robustness and generality of ER cycling are not well understood. We present a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of the ER after activation, based on 6 replicates at 10 time-points, using our method for precise quantification of binding, Parallel-Factor ChIP-seq. In contrast to previous studies, we identified a sustained increase in affinity, alongside a class of estra-2-diol independent binding sites. Our results are corroborated by quantitative re-analysis of multiple independent studies. Our new model reconciles the conflicting studies into the ER at the TFF1 promoter and provides a detailed understanding in the context of the ER's role as both the driver and therapeutic target of breast cancer.</description>

	<description>The stochastic multicolor labeling method ‘Brainbow’ is a powerful strategy to label multiple neurons differentially with fluorescent proteins; however, the fluorescence levels provided by the original attempts to use this strategy were inadequate. In the present study, we developed a stochastic multicolor labeling method with enhanced expression levels that uses a tetracycline-operator system (Tetbow). We optimized Tetbow for either plasmid or virus vector-mediated multicolor labeling. When combined with tissue clearing, Tetbow was powerful enough to visualize the three-dimensional architecture of individual neurons. Using Tetbow, we were able to visualize the axonal projection patterns of individual mitral/tufted cells along several millimeters in the mouse olfactory system. We also developed a Tetbow system with chemical tags, in which genetically encoded chemical tags were labeled with synthetic fluorophores. This was useful in expanding the repertoire of the fluorescence labels and the applications of the Tetbow system. Together, these new tools facilitate light-microscopy-based neuronal tracing at both a large scale and a high resolution.</description>

	<description>Mollicutes, a widespread class of bacteria associated with animals and plants, were recently identified as abundant abdominal endosymbionts in healthy workers of attine fungus-farming leaf-cutting ants. We obtained draft genomes of the two most common strains harbored by Panamanian fungus-growing ants. Reconstructions of their functional significance showed that they are independently acquired symbionts, most likely to decompose excess arginine consistent with the farmed fungal cultivars providing this nitrogen-rich amino-acid in variable quantities. Across the attine lineages, the relative abundances of the two Mollicutes strains are associated with the substrate types that foraging workers offer to fungus gardens. One of the symbionts is specific to the leaf-cutting ants and has special genomic machinery to catabolize citrate/glucose into acetate, which appears to deliver direct metabolic energy to the ant workers. Unlike other Mollicutes associated with insect hosts, both attine ant strains have complete phage-defense systems, underlining that they are actively maintained as mutualistic symbionts.</description>

	<description>Barriers to microbial migrations can lead adaptive radiations and increased endemism. We propose that extreme unbalanced nutrient stoichiometry of essential nutrients can be a barrier to microbial immigration over geological timescales. At the oasis in the Cuatro Ciénegas Basin in Mexico, nutrient stoichiometric proportions are skewed given the low phosphorus availability in the ecosystem. We show that this endangered oasis can be a model for a &lt;i&gt;lost world&lt;/i&gt;. The ancient niche of extreme unbalanced nutrient stoichiometry favoured survival of ancestral microorganisms. This extreme nutrient imbalance persisted due to environmental stability and low extinction rates, generating a diverse and unique bacterial community. Several endemic clades of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; invaded the Cuatro Cienegas region in two geological times, the late Precambrian and the Jurassic. Other lineages of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Clostridium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bacteroidetes&lt;/i&gt; migrated into the basin in isolated events. Cuatro Ciénegas Basin conservation is vital to the understanding of early evolutionary and ecological processes.</description>

	<description>Cell fate decisions occur through the switch-like, irreversible activation of fate-specifying genes. These activation events are often assumed to be tightly coupled to changes in upstream transcription factors, but could also be constrained by &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-epigenetic mechanisms at individual gene loci. Here, we studied the activation of &lt;i&gt;Bcl11b&lt;/i&gt;, which controls T-cell fate commitment. To disentangle &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; effects, we generated mice where two &lt;i&gt;Bcl11b&lt;/i&gt; copies are tagged with distinguishable fluorescent proteins. Quantitative live microscopy of progenitors from these mice revealed that &lt;i&gt;Bcl11b&lt;/i&gt; turned on after a stochastic delay averaging multiple days, which varied not only between cells but also between &lt;i&gt;Bcl11b&lt;/i&gt; alleles within the same cell. Genetic perturbations, together with mathematical modeling, showed that a distal enhancer controls the rate of epigenetic activation, while a parallel Notch-dependent &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-acting step stimulates expression from activated loci. These results show that developmental fate transitions can be controlled by stochastic &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-acting events on individual loci.</description>

	<description>The hologenome concept proposes that microbes together with their hosting organism are an independent unit of selection. Motivated by this concept, we hypothesized that thermal acclimation in poikilothermic organisms is connected to their microbiome composition due to their inability to maintain their body temperature. To test this hypothesis, we used a unique experimental setup with a transgenerational selective breeding scheme for cold tolerance in tropical tilapias. We tested the effects of the selection on the gut microbiome and host transcriptomic response. Interestingly, we found that host genetic selection for thermal tolerance shapes microbiome composition and its response to cold. The microbiomes of cold-resistant fish showed higher resilience to temperature changes, indicating that the microbiome is shaped by its host's selection. These findings are consistent with the hologenome concept and highlight the connection between the host and its microbiome's response to the environment.</description>

The robust computational design of functional proteins has the potential to deeply impact translational research and broaden our understanding of the determinants of protein function and stability. The low success rates of computational design protocols and the extensive in vitro optimization often required, highlight the challenge of designing proteins that perform essential biochemical functions, such as binding or catalysis. One of the most simplistic approaches for the design of function is to adopt functional motifs in naturally occurring proteins and transplant them to computationally designed proteins. The structural complexity of the functional motif largely determines how readily one can find host protein structures that are “designable”, meaning that are likely to present the functional motif in the desired conformation. One promising route to enhance the “designability” of protein structures is to allow backbone flexibility. Here, we present a computational approach that couples conformational folding with sequence design to embed functional motifs into heterologous proteins—Rosetta Functional Folding and Design (FunFolDes). We performed extensive computational benchmarks, where we observed that the enforcement of functional requirements resulted in designs distant from the global energetic minimum of the protein. An observation consistent with several experimental studies that have revealed function-stability tradeoffs. To test the design capabilities of FunFolDes we transplanted two viral epitopes into distant structural templates including one &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; “functionless” fold, which represent two typical challenges where the designability problem arises. The designed proteins were experimentally characterized showing high binding affinities to monoclonal antibodies, making them valuable candidates for vaccine design endeavors. Overall, we present an accessible strategy to repurpose old protein folds for new functions. This may lead to important improvements on the computational design of proteins, with structurally complex functional sites, that can perform elaborate biochemical functions related to binding and catalysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7gRf2xrFcak&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Recent advances in modeling oxygen supply to cortical brain tissue have begun to elucidate the functional mechanisms of neurovascular coupling. While the principal mechanisms of blood flow regulation after neuronal firing are generally known, mechanistic hemodynamic simulations cannot yet pinpoint the exact spatial and temporal coordination between the network of arteries, arterioles, capillaries and veins for the entire brain. Because of the potential significance of blood flow and oxygen supply simulations for illuminating spatiotemporal regulation inside the cortical microanatomy, there is a need to create mathematical models of the entire cerebral circulation with realistic anatomical detail. Our hypothesis is that an anatomically accurate reconstruction of the cerebrocirculatory architecture will inform about possible regulatory mechanisms of the neurovascular interface. In this article, we introduce large-scale networks of the murine cerebral circulation spanning the Circle of Willis, main cerebral arteries connected to the pial network down to the microcirculation in the capillary bed. Several multiscale models were generated from state-of-the-art neuroimaging data. Using a vascular network construction algorithm, the entire circulation of the middle cerebral artery was synthesized. Blood flow simulations indicate a consistent trend of higher hematocrit in deeper cortical layers, while surface layers with shorter vascular path lengths seem to carry comparatively lower red blood cell (RBC) concentrations. Moreover, the variability of RBC flux decreases with cortical depth. These results support the notion that plasma skimming serves a self-regulating function for maintaining uniform oxygen perfusion to neurons irrespective of their location in the blood supply hierarchy. Our computations also demonstrate the practicality of simulating blood flow for large portions of the mouse brain with existing computer resources. The efficient simulation of blood flow throughout the entire middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory is a promising milestone towards the final aim of predicting blood flow patterns for the entire brain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9OY-184gvy8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: 3DMorph automatic analysis of microglial morphology in 3 dimensions from ex vivo and in vivo imaging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0266-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Microglia are dynamic immune cells of the central nervous system, and their morphology is commonly used as a readout of cellular function. However, current morphological analysis techniques rely on either tracing of cells or 2D projection analysis, which are time-consuming, subject to bias, and may ignore important three-dimensional (3D) information. Therefore, we have created 3DMorph, a Matlab-based script that analyzes microglial morphology from 3D data. The program initially requires input of threshold levels, cell size expectations, and preferred methods of skeletonization. This makes 3DMorph easily scalable and adaptable to different imaging parameters or cell types. After these settings are defined, the program is completely automatic and can batch process files without user input. Output data includes cell volume, territorial volume, branch length, number of endpoints and branch points, and average distance between cells. We show that 3DMorph is accurate when compared to manual tracing, with significantly decreased user input time. Importantly, 3DMorph is capable of processing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microglial morphology, as well as other 3D branching cell types, from mouse cranial windows or acute hippocampal slices. Therefore, we present a novel, user-friendly, scalable, and semi-automatic method of analyzing cell morphology in 3 dimensions. This method should improve the accuracy of cell measurements, remove user bias between conditions, increase reproducibility between experimenters and labs, and reduce user input time. We provide this open source code on GitHub so that it is free and accessible to all investigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Microglial morphology is often considered to be an indicator of cellular activity, however current techniques to analyze morphology either lose valuable z-dimension information or are time intensive to perform. Therefore, we introduce 3DMorph, a MATLAB-based program that semi-automatically processes individual microglial morphology from overlapping 3D clusters, improving accuracy and processing time compared to current tools. 3DMorph is straightforward to use and adaptable to many imaging or experimental parameters. Once user settings are selected, 3DMorph can run in batch mode to automatically process multiple files. We validate 3DMorph against current techniques, and demonstrate the ability to detect differences in microglial morphologies from different &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; experimental conditions, as well as from &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data, and images of other branching cell types.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Development of GABAergic inputs is not altered in early maturation of adult born dentate granule neurons in Fragile X mice</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation and the most common known cause of autism. Loss of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in mice (&lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO) leads to altered synaptic and circuit maturation in the hippocampus that are correlated with alterations in hippocampal-dependent behaviors. Previous studies have demonstrated that loss of FMRP increased the rate of proliferation of progenitor cells and altered their fate specification in adult &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. While these studies clearly demonstrate a role for FMRP in adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, it is not known whether the functional synaptic maturation and integration of adult born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) into hippocampal circuits is affected in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Here we used retroviral labeling to birthdate abDGCs in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice which allowed us to perform targeted patch clamp recording to measure the development of synaptic inputs to these neurons at precise time points after differentiation. The frequency and amplitude of spontaneous GABAergic events increased over the first three weeks after differentiation, however this normal development of GABAergic synapses was not altered in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice. Furthermore, the relatively depolarized GABA reversal potential (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;GABA&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) in immature abDGCs was unaffected by loss of FMRP as was the development of dendritic arbor of the adult generated neurons. These studies systematically characterized the functional development of abDGCs during the first four weeks after differentiation and demonstrate that the maturation of GABAergic synaptic inputs to these neurons is not grossly affected by the loss of FMRP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Loss of FMRP causes Fragile X Syndrome, a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that causes multiple alterations in the development of synapses and neurons. Previous studies have described a role for FMRP in neurogenesis and hippocampal-dependent conditioning tasks linked to neurogenesis. This study systematically assessed the functional development of GABAergic inputs to adult born dentate granule cells during the first four weeks after differentiation of adult neural stem cells in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The majority of inherited retinal degenerations are due to photoreceptor cell
death. In many cases ganglion cells are spared making it possible to stimulate
them to restore visual function. Several studies (Bi et al., 2006; Lin et al.,
2008; Sengupta et al., 2016; Caporale et al., 2011; Berry et al., 2017) have
shown that it is possible to express an optogenetic protein in ganglion cells
and make them light sensitive. This is a promising strategy to restore vision
since optical targeting may be more precise than electrical stimulation with a
retinal prothesis. However the spatial resolution of
optogenetically-reactivated retinas has not been measured with fine-grained
stimulation patterns. Since the optogenetic protein is also expressed in axons,
it is unclear if these neurons will only be sensitive to the stimulation of a
small region covering their somas and dendrites, or if they will also respond
to any stimulation overlapping with their axon, dramatically impairing spatial
resolution. Here we recorded responses of mouse and macaque retinas to random
checkerboard patterns following an in vivo optogenetic therapy. We show that
optogenetically activated ganglion cells are each sensitive to a small region
of visual space. A simple model based on this small receptive field predicted
accurately their responses to complex stimuli. From this model, we simulated
how the entire population of light sensitive ganglion cells would respond to
letters of different sizes. We then estimated the maximal acuity expected by a
patient, assuming it could make an optimal use of the information delivered by
this reactivated retina. The obtained acuity is above the limit of legal
blindness. This high spatial resolution is a promising result for future
clinical studies.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ancient mind/body problem continues to be one of deepest mysteries of
science and of the human spirit. Despite major advances in many fields, there
is still no plausible link between subjective experience (qualia) and its
realization in the body. This paper outlines some of the elements of a rigorous
science of mind (SoM) - key ideas include scientific realism of mind, agnostic
mysterianism, careful attention to language, and a focus on concrete
(touchstone) questions and results.

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agonism of the protease activated receptor (PAR) 1 by activated protein C (APC) provides neuroprotection and vasculoprotection in experimental neuro‐injury models. The pleiotropic PAR1 agonist, 3K3A‐APC, reduces neurologic injury and promotes vascular integrity; 3K3A‐APC proved safe in human volunteers. We performed a randomized, controlled, blinded, trial to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of 3K3A‐APC in ischemic stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NeuroNEXT trial RHAPSODY used a novel continual reassessment method to determine the MTD using tiers of 120, 240, 360 and 540μg/kg 3K3A‐APC. After intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, intraarterial mechanical thrombectomy, or both, patients were randomized to one of the four doses or placebo. Vasculoprotection was assessed as microbleed and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) rates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between January 2015 and July 2017 we treated 110 patients. Demographics resembled a typical stroke population. The MTD was the highest dose 3K3A‐APC tested, 540μg/kg, with an estimated toxicity rate of 7%. There was no difference in prespecified ICH rates. In exploratory analyses, 3K3A‐APC reduced ICH rates compared to placebo from 86.5% to 67.4% in the combined treatment arms (p=0.046), and total hemorrhage volume from an average of 2.1±5.8 mL in placebo to 0.8±2.1 mL in the combined treatment arms (p=0.066).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RHAPSODY is the first trial of a neuroprotectant for acute ischemic stroke in a trial design allowing thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or both. The MTD was 540μg/kg for the PAR1 active cytoprotectant 3K3A‐APC. A trend toward lower hemorrhage rate in an exploratory analysis requires confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

Covalent modification of proteins by ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains is one of the most prevalent post-translational modifications in eukaryotes. Different types of ubiquitin chains are assumed to selectively signal respectively modified proteins for different fates. In support of this hypothesis, structural studies have shown that the eight possible ubiquitin dimers adopt different conformations. However, at least in some cases, these structures cannot sufficiently explain the molecular basis of the selective signaling mechanisms. This indicates that the available structures represent only a few distinct conformations within the entire conformational space adopted by a ubiquitin dimer. Here, molecular simulations on different levels of resolution can complement the structural information. We have combined exhaustive coarse grained and atomistic simulations of all eight possible ubiquitin dimers with a suitable dimensionality reduction technique and a new method to characterize protein-protein interfaces and the conformational landscape of protein conjugates. We found that ubiquitin dimers exhibit characteristic linkage type-dependent properties in solution, such as interface stability and the character of contacts between the subunits, which can be directly correlated with experimentally observed linkage-specific properties.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6aIN2Kla9rU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Essential metabolic reactions are shaping constituents of metabolic networks, enabling viable and distinct phenotypes across diverse life forms. Here we analyse and compare modelling predictions of essential metabolic functions with experimental data and thereby identify core metabolic pathways in prokaryotes. Simulations of 15 manually curated genome-scale metabolic models were integrated with 36 large-scale gene essentiality datasets encompassing a wide variety of species of bacteria and archaea. Conservation of metabolic genes was estimated by analysing 79 representative genomes from all the branches of the prokaryotic tree of life. We find that essentiality patterns reflect phylogenetic relations both for modelling and experimental data, which correlate highly at the pathway level. Genes that are essential for several species tend to be highly conserved as opposed to non-essential genes which may be conserved or not. The tRNA-charging module is highlighted as ancestral and with high centrality in the networks, followed closely by cofactor metabolism, pointing to an early information processing system supplied by organic cofactors. The results, which point to model improvements and also indicate faults in the experimental data, should be relevant to the study of centrality in metabolic networks and ancient metabolism but also to metabolic engineering with prokaryotes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YfypktDVdWM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Embryonic neocortical microglia express Toll-like receptor 9 and respond to plasmid DNA injected into the ventricle: technical considerations regarding microglial distribution in electroporated brain walls</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Microglia, the resident immune cells in the central nervous system, play multiple roles during development. In the embryonic cerebral wall, microglia modulate the functions of neural stem/progenitor cells through their distribution in regions undergoing cell proliferation and/or differentiation. Previous studies using CX3CR1-GFP transgenic mice demonstrated that microglia extensively survey these regions. To simultaneously visualize microglia and neural-lineage cells that interact with each other, we applied the &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; electroporation (IUE) technique, which has been widely used for gene-transfer in neurodevelopmental studies, to CX3CR1-GFP mice (males and females). However, we unexpectedly faced a technical problem: although microglia are normally distributed homogeneously throughout the mid-embryonic cortical wall with only limited luminal entry, the intraventricular presence of exogenously derived plasmid DNAs induced microglia to accumulate along the apical surface of the cortex and aggregate in the choroid plexus. This effect was independent of capillary needle puncture of the brain wall or application of electrical pulses. The microglial response occurred at plasmid DNA concentrations lower than those routinely used for IUE, and was mediated by activation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), an innate immune sensor that recognizes unmethylated cytosine-phosphate guanosine (CpG) motifs abundant in microbial DNA. Administration of plasmid DNA together with oligonucleotide (ODN) 2088, the antagonist of TLR9, restored the normal (dispersed) intramural localization of microglia and decreased luminal accumulation of these cells. Thus, via TLR9, intraventricular plasmid DNA administration causes aberrant distribution of embryonic microglia, suggesting that the behavior of microglia in brain primordia subjected to IUE should be carefully interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Microglia have been recently shown to play multiple roles in the embryonic brain. In the trials for labeling neural-lineage cells using IUE technique in CX3CR1-GFP mice, in which microglia express GFP, to achieve dual live-imaging of these cell types, we unexpectedly found that intra-ventricular administration of plasmid DNA caused microglial aberrant accumulation along the luminal surface of the cerebral wall and in the choroid plexus. Notably, Co-administration of TLR9 antagonist into the ventricle together with plasmid DNA restored the normal dispersed localization of microglia in the mid-embryonic (E14) cortex, suggesting that massive microglial accumulation induced by plasmid DNA is primarily mediated by TLR9 activation. Our findings have implications for the application of IUE to investigate embryonic microglia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Enhancing GABAergic transmission improves locomotion in a C. elegans model of Spinal Muscular Atrophy</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of spinal motor neurons resulting in variable degrees of muscular wasting and weakness. It is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the &lt;i&gt;Survival Motor Neuron&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt;) gene. &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;) mutants lacking &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; recapitulate several aspects of the disease including impaired movement and shorted life span. We examined whether genes previously implicated in life span extension conferred benefits to &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; lacking SMN. We find that reducing DAF-2/insulin receptor signaling activity promotes survival and improves locomotor behavior in this &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; model of SMA. The locomotor dysfunction in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; lacking &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; correlated with structural and functional abnormalities in GABAergic neuromuscular junctions. Moreover, we demonstrated that reduction in DAF-2 signaling reversed these abnormalities. Remarkably, enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission alone was able to correct the locomotor dysfunction. Our work indicated that an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory activity within motor circuits and underlies motor system dysfunction in this SMA model. Interventions aimed at restoring the balance of excitatory/inhibitory activity in motor circuits could be of benefit to individuals with SMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; SMA is a pediatric motor neuron disease resulting from the loss of the SMN protein. While great effort has been expended on interventions aimed at increasing levels of compensatory SMN1, identification of genes that modify the SMA phenotype has lagged. Here we undertook a targeted genetic screen to identify SMA disease suppressors. We demonstrated that reduced insulin/insulin-like signaling is beneficial for not only longevity but also locomotor activity in SMA worm models. Our results from anatomical, functional, and genetic studies show that the impairment of GABAergic neurotransmission contributes to locomotor dysfunction in &lt;i&gt;smn-1&lt;/i&gt; null worms. Enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission alone can correct the locomotor dysfunction. This work leads to new understanding of disease pathogenesis and opens up new opportunities for therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Treatments to stop gray matter degeneration are needed to prevent progressive disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). We tested whether inhibiting mixed-lineage kinases (MLKs), which can drive inflammatory microglial activation and neuronal degeneration, could protect hippocampal synapses in C57BL/6 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a disease model that recapitulates the excitatory synaptic injury that occurs widely within the gray matter in MS. URMC-099, a broad spectrum MLK inhibitor with additional activity against LRRK2 and other kinases, prevented loss of PSD95-positive postsynaptic structures, shifted activated microglia toward a less inflammatory phenotype, and reversed deficits in hippocampal-dependent contextual fear conditioning in EAE mice when administered after the onset of motor symptoms. A narrow spectrum inhibitor designed to be highly selective for MLK3 failed to protect synapses in EAE hippocampi, and could not rescue cultured neurons from trophic deprivation in an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model of MLK-driven neuronal degeneration. These results suggest that URMC-099 may have potential as a neuroprotective treatment in MS, and demonstrate that a broad spectrum of inhibition against a combination of MLK and other kinases is more effective in neuroinflammatory disease than selectively targeting a single kinase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Multiple sclerosis (MS) causes progressive neurologic decline that correlates with damage to gray matter in the brain, and is not stopped by current treatments. We used a mouse model of MS, in which gray matter injury is associated with inflammatory molecules produced by activated microglia, to test novel neuroprotective treatments. URMC-099, a mixed-lineage kinase (MLK) inhibitor that has anti-inflammatory and direct neuroprotective properties, prevented loss of hippocampal synapses and reversed deficits in learning and memory in a mouse model of MS. An MLK inhibitor with a narrower range of specificity was not effective, suggesting that combination kinase inhibition with URMC-099 may have potential as a neuroprotective treatment in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Memory formation is a protracted process that initially involves the hippocampus and becomes increasingly dependent on the cortex over time, but the mechanisms of this transfer are unclear. We recently showed that hippocampal depletion of the histone variant H2A.Z enhances both recent and remote memories, but the use of virally mediated depletion reduced H2A.Z levels throughout testing, making its temporally specific function unclear. Given the lack of drugs that target histone variants, we tested existing drugs for efficacy against H2A.Z based on their targeting of known H2A.Z regulators. The Tip60 (part of H2A.Z deposition complex) inhibitor Nu9056 reduced H2A.Z binding, whereas the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin-A increased H2A.Z acetylation without influencing total H2A.Z in cultured hippocampal neurons. Tip60 (but not HDAC) inhibition 23 h after learning enhanced remote (tested at 7 d) and not recent (tested at 24 h) contextual fear memory in mice. In contrast, Tip60 inhibition 30 d after learning impaired recall of remote memory after 1 h, but protected the memory from further decline 24 h later. These data provide the first evidence of a delayed postlearning role for histone variants in supporting memory transfer during systems consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: p11 in Cholinergic Interneurons of the Nucleus Accumbens Is Essential for Dopamine Responses to Rewarding Stimuli</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0332-18.2018?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0332-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A recent study showed that p11 expressed in cholinergic interneurons (CINs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key regulator of depression-like behaviors. Dopaminergic neurons projecting to the NAc are responsible for reward-related behaviors, and their function is impaired in depression. The present study investigated the role of p11 in NAc CINs in dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The extracellular dopamine and acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the NAc were determined in freely moving male mice using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microdialysis. Rewarding stimuli (cocaine, palatable food, and female mouse encounter) induced an increase in dopamine efflux in the NAc of wild-type (WT) mice. The dopamine responses were attenuated (cocaine) or abolished (food and female mouse encounter) in constitutive p11 knock-out (KO) mice. The dopamine response to cocaine was accompanied by an increase in ACh NAc efflux, whereas the attenuated dopamine response to cocaine in p11 KO mice was restored by activation of nicotinic or muscarinic ACh receptors in the NAc. Dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli and ACh release in the NAc were attenuated in mice with deletion of p11 from cholinergic neurons (ChAT-p11 cKO mice), whereas gene delivery of p11 to CINs restored the dopamine responses. Furthermore, chemogenetic studies revealed that p11 is required for activation of CINs in response to rewarding stimuli. Thus, p11 in NAc CINs plays a critical role in activating these neurons to mediate dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The dysregulation of mesolimbic dopamine system by dysfunction of p11 in NAc CINs may be involved in pathogenesis of depressive states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: In Vivo Volume Dynamics of Dendritic Spines in the Neocortex of Wild-Type and Fmr1 KO Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excitatory synapses are often formed at small protrusions of dendrite, called dendritic spines, in most projection neurons, and the spine-head volumes show strong correlations with synaptic connectivity. We examined the dynamics of spine volume in the adult mouse visual cortex using time-lapse &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon imaging with a resonant Galvano scanner. Contrary to expectations, we found that the spines in the adult neocortex showed fluctuations to a similar degree as that observed in young hippocampal preparations, but there were systematic differences in how the dynamics were dependent on spine volumes, thus allowing for fewer fluctuations in small spines, which could account for the relatively low turnover rates of neocortical spines &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We found that spine volumes fluctuated to a greater extent in a mouse model (&lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knockout) of fragile X mental retardation than in wild-type mice, and the spine turnover rates were also higher in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice. Such features of spine dynamics in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice could be represented by a single slope factor in our model. Our data and model indicate a small but significant change in the average spine volume and more eminent differences in the statistical distribution in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice even in adulthood, which reflects the abnormal &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; dynamics of spine volumes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The role of orexin during development, and especially in terms of spinal cord function, is not well understood. It is for this reason that we focused on the network actions of orexin during the first week of development. We found that orexinergic fibers were present in the lumbar spinal cord of postnatal day 0 (P0) to P3 mice. The fibers were expressed mainly in the dorsal horn, but occasional fibers were observed in the ventral horn. Both orexin (OX) A and OXB increased the motoneurons (MNs) tonic neurogram discharge. However, only OXA was found to significantly increase spontaneous bursting activity and the frequency of fictive locomotor bursts. We show that OXA is able to act directly on MNs. To test the contribution of the recurrent MN collaterals, we blocked the nicotinic cholinergic drive and observed that OXA retained its ability to increase fictive locomotor activity. Additionally, we recorded neurograms from ventral lateral funiculi, where OXA had no effect on population discharge. These effects were also confirmed by recording from descending commissural interneurons via patch recordings. The loci of the effects of OXA were further investigated in a dorsal horn-removed preparation where OXA also shows an increase in the discharge from ventral root neurograms but no increase in the frequency of spontaneous or fictive locomotion burst activity. In summary, multiple lines of evidence from our work demonstrate the robust effects of orexins on spinal cord networks and MNs at the time of birth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;CD137L (4-1BBL) is a costimulatory molecule whose signaling can promote monocyte/macrophage functions; however, CD137L-mediated microglial response and its role in neuropathic pain remain unknown. We investigated CD137L following peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain using a spinal nerve L5 transection (L5Tx) murine model in both sexes. First, C57BL/6_CD137L knock-out (KO) mice displayed decreased mechanical and diminished heat hypersensitivity compared to wild-type (WT) controls, beginning on day 3 to up to day 35 post-L5Tx. Purified anti-mouse CD137L neutralizing monoclonal antibody (0.1 or 0.5 µg) was also used to identify CD137L’s window of action in BALB/c mice. Anti-CD137L antibody was intrathecally administered either from day 0 (before surgery) to day 7 (early treatment), or from day 6 to 13 post-L5Tx (late treatment), and nociceptive thresholds were assessed before surgery to up to day 35 post-surgery. Early treatment with anti-CD137L reduced L5Tx-induced mechanical but not heat hypersensitivity, while later treatment did not alter either sensitivity. Pro- versus anti-inflammatory responses within the lumbar spinal cord following L5Tx were further evaluated via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in time-course studies. Following L5Tx, female CD137L KO mice did not show increased iNOS mRNA and had reduced numbers of IL-1β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells compared to WT. At 21 d post-surgery, CD137L KO mice had higher total numbers of arginase (Arg)-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells and Arg-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia. Altogether, results indicate that spinal cord CD137L contributes to the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain, which may be in part mediated through CD137L’s modulation of the pro- and anti-inflammatory balance within the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Changes in GABAergic Transmission to and Intrinsic Excitability of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Neurons during the Estrous Cycle in Mice</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons form the final common central output pathway controlling fertility and are regulated by steroid feedback. In females, estradiol feedback action varies between negative and positive; negative feedback typically regulates episodic GnRH release whereas positive feedback initiates a surge of GnRH, and subsequently luteinizing hormone (LH) release ultimately triggering ovulation. During the estrous cycle, changes between estradiol negative and positive feedback occur with cycle stage and time of day, with positive feedback in the late afternoon of proestrus in nocturnal species. To test the hypotheses that synaptic and intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons are regulated by cycle stage and time of day, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp studies of GnRH neurons in brain slices from mice at two times considered negative feedback (diestrous PM and proestrous AM) and during positive feedback (proestrous PM). GABAergic transmission can excite GnRH neurons and was higher in cells from proestrous PM mice than cells from proestrous AM mice and approached traditional significance levels relative to cells from diestrous PM mice. Action potential response to current injection was also greater in cells from proestrous PM mice than the other two groups. Interestingly, the hormonal milieu of proestrous AM provided stronger negative feedback on both GnRH neuron excitability and GABAergic postsynaptic current (PSC) amplitude than diestrous PM. These observations demonstrate elements of both synaptic and intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons are regulated in a cycle-dependent manner and provide insight into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cyclic changes in neuroendocrine function among states of estradiol negative and positive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Reading literature (e.g., an entire book) is an enriching experience that qualitatively differs from reading a single sentence; however, the brain dynamics of such context-dependent memory remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate mnemonic neural dynamics during natural reading of literature by performing electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Brain activities of human participants recruited on campus were correlated with their subsequent memory, which was quantified by semantic correlation between the read text and reports subsequently written by them based on state of the art natural language processing procedures. The results of the EEG data analysis showed a significant positive relationship between subsequent memory and fixation-related EEG. Sentence-length and paragraph-length mnemonic processes were associated with N1-P2 and P3 fixation-related potential (FRP) components and fixation-related -band (4–8 Hz) EEG power, respectively. In contrast, the results of fMRI analysis showed a significant negative relationship between subsequent memory and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation. Sentence-length and paragraph-length mnemonic processes were associated with networks of regions forming part of the salience network and the default mode network (DMN), respectively. Taken together with the EEG results, these memory-related deactivations in the salience network and the DMN were thought to reflect the reading of sentences characterized by low mnemonic load and the suppression of task-irreverent thoughts, respectively. It was suggested that the context-dependent mnemonic process during literature reading requires large-scale network deactivation, which might reflect coordination of a range of voluntary processes during reading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In recent years, the ability to sample large populations of retinal cells has accelerated cell type classification based on different criteria like genetics, morphology, function, and circuitry. For example, recent work includes bipolar and retinal ganglion cell classifications based on single-cell transcriptomes, large-scale electron microscopy reconstruction, and population-level functional imaging. With comprehensive descriptions of several retinal cell classes now within reach, it is important to reflect on the priority of these different criteria to create an accurate and useful classification. Here, we argue that functional information about retinal cells should be prioritized over other criteria when addressing questions of visual function because this criterion provides the most meaningful information about how the retina works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>Adaptation to the ever-changing world is critical for survival, and our brains are particularly tuned to remember events that differ from previous experiences. Novel experiences induce dopamine release in the hippocampus, a process which promotes memory persistence. While axons from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were generally thought to be the exclusive source of hippocampal dopamine, recent studies have demonstrated that noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) corelease noradrenaline and dopamine in the hippocampus and that their dopamine release boosts memory retention as well.</description>

Cytoplasmic flows are an ubiquitous feature of biological systems, in particular in large cells, such as oocytes and eggs in early animal development. Here we show that cytoplasmic flows in starfish oocytes, which can be imaged well with transmission light microscopy, are fully determined by the cortical dynamics during surface contraction waves. We first show that the dynamics of the oocyte surface is highly symmetric around the animal-vegetal axis. We then mathematically solve the Stokes equation for flows inside a deforming sphere using the measured surface displacements as boundary conditions. Our theoretical predictions agree very well with the intracellular flows quantified by particle image velocimetry, proving that during this stage the starfish cytoplasm behaves as a simple Newtonian fluid on the micrometer scale. We calculate the pressure field inside the oocyte and find that its gradient is too small as to explain polar body extrusion, in contrast to earlier suggestions. Myosin II inhibition by blebbistatin confirms this conclusion, because it diminishes cell shape changes and hydrodynamic flow, but does not abolish polar body formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TABMnyJYzl0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Patterning the insect eye: From stochastic to deterministic mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006363</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Haleh Ebadi, Michael Perry, Keith Short, Konstantin Klemm, Claude Desplan, Peter F. Stadler, Anita Mehta&lt;/p&gt;

While most processes in biology are highly deterministic, stochastic mechanisms are sometimes used to increase cellular diversity. In human and Drosophila eyes, photoreceptors sensitive to different wavelengths of light are distributed in stochastic patterns, and one such patterning system has been analyzed in detail in the Drosophila retina. Interestingly, some species in the dipteran family Dolichopodidae (the “long legged” flies, or “Doli”) instead exhibit highly orderly deterministic eye patterns. In these species, alternating columns of ommatidia (unit eyes) produce corneal lenses of different colors. Occasional perturbations in some individuals disrupt the regular columns in a way that suggests that patterning occurs via a posterior-to-anterior signaling relay during development, and that specification follows a local, cellular-automaton-like rule. We hypothesize that the regulatory mechanisms that pattern the eye are largely conserved among flies and that the difference between unordered Drosophila and ordered dolichopodid eyes can be explained in terms of relative strengths of signaling interactions rather than a rewiring of the regulatory network itself. We present a simple stochastic model that is capable of explaining both the stochastic Drosophila eye and the striped pattern of Dolichopodidae eyes and thereby characterize the least number of underlying developmental rules necessary to produce both stochastic and deterministic patterns. We show that only small changes to model parameters are needed to also reproduce intermediate, semi-random patterns observed in another Doli species, and quantification of ommatidial distributions in these eyes suggests that their patterning follows similar rules.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WfAj38t5J5A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Ponce-Alvarez et al. show that zebrafish larvae generate spontaneous neuronal avalanches across the entire brain. These collective cascading events exhibit scale invariance, typical of critical phenomena (e.g., earthquakes, paper crumpling). The brain’s critical dynamics are modulated during interactions with the environment.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Theta Bursts Precede, and Spindles Follow, Cortical and Thalamic Downstates in Human NREM Sleep</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9989?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since their discovery, slow oscillations have been observed to group spindles during non-REM sleep. Previous studies assert that the slow-oscillation downstate (DS) is preceded by slow spindles (10–12 Hz) and followed by fast spindles (12–16 Hz). Here, using both direct transcortical recordings in patients with intractable epilepsy (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 10, 8 female), as well as scalp EEG recordings from a healthy cohort (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3, 1 female), we find in multiple cortical areas that both slow and fast spindles follow the DS. Although discrete oscillations do precede DSs, they are theta bursts (TBs) centered at 5–8 Hz. TBs were more pronounced for DSs in NREM stage 2 (N2) sleep compared with N3. TB with similar properties occur in the thalamus, but unlike spindles they have no clear temporal relationship with cortical TB. These differences in corticothalamic dynamics, as well as differences between spindles and theta in coupling high-frequency content, are consistent with NREM theta having separate generative mechanisms from spindles. The final inhibitory cycle of the TB coincides with the DS peak, suggesting that in N2, TB may help trigger the DS. Since the transition to N1 is marked by the appearance of theta, and the transition to N2 by the appearance of DS and thus spindles, a role of TB in triggering DS could help explain the sequence of electrophysiological events characterizing sleep. Finally, the coordinated appearance of spindles and DSs are implicated in memory consolidation processes, and the current findings redefine their temporal coupling with theta during NREM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sleep is characterized by large slow waves which modulate brain activity. Prominent among these are downstates (DSs), periods of a few tenths of a second when most cells stop firing, and spindles, oscillations at ~12 times a second lasting for ~a second. In this study, we provide the first detailed description of another kind of sleep wave: theta bursts (TBs), a brief oscillation at ~six cycles per second. We show, recording during natural sleep directly from the human cortex and thalamus, as well as on the scalp, that TBs precede, and spindles follow DSs. TBs may help trigger DSs in some circumstances, and could organize cortical and thalamic activity so that memories can be consolidated during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ipsilesional Motor Cortex Plasticity Participates in Spontaneous Hindlimb Recovery after Lateral Hemisection of the Thoracic Spinal Cord in the Rat</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9977?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;After an incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) spontaneous motor recovery can occur in mammals, but the underlying neural substrates remain poorly understood. The motor cortex is crucial for skilled motor learning and the voluntary control of movement and is known to reorganize after cortical injury to promote recovery. Motor cortex plasticity has also been shown to parallel the recovery of forelimb function after cervical SCI, but whether cortical plasticity participates in hindlimb recovery after SCI remains unresolved. Using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) mapping, behavioral and cortical inactivation techniques in the female Long–Evans rat, we evaluated the spontaneous cortical mechanisms of hindlimb motor recovery 1–5 weeks after lateral hemisection of the thoracic (T8) spinal cord that ablated the crossed corticospinal tract (CST) from the contralesional motor cortex while sparing the majority of the CST from the ipsilesional motor cortex. Hemisection initially impaired hindlimb motor function bilaterally but significant recovery occurred during the first 3 weeks. ICMS revealed time-dependent changes in motor cortex organization, characterized by a chronic abolishment of hindlimb motor representation in the contralesional motor cortex and the development of transient bilateral hindlimb representation in the ipsilesional motor cortex 3 weeks after hemisection, when significant behavioral recovery occurred. Consistently, reversible inactivation of the ipsilesional, but not the contralesional motor cortex, during skilled ladder walking 3 weeks after hemisection reinstated deficits in both hindlimbs. These findings indicate that the ipsilesional motor cortex transiently reorganizes after lateral hemisection of the thoracic spinal cord to support recovery of hindlimb motor function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Partial motor recovery can occur after an incomplete spinal cord injury and is hypothesized to result from the reorganization of spared descending motor pathways. The motor cortex is crucial for the control of voluntary movement and contains topographical movement representations (motor maps) that are highly plastic. We examined the organization of hindlimb motor maps bilaterally after a lateral hemisection of the spinal cord to show that while motor maps are abolished in the deefferented cortex, the spared ipsilesional cortex transiently reorganizes to gain a representation of the affected hindlimb after injury that relates to recovery. This finding demonstrates that plasticity in the ipsilesional motor cortex at early time points after spinal cord hemisection is initially important to support motor recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galloway–Mowat syndrome (GAMOS) is a neural and renal disorder, characterized by microcephaly, brain anomalies, and early‐onset nephrotic syndrome. Biallelic mutations in &lt;i&gt;WDR73&lt;/i&gt; and the four subunit genes of the KEOPS complex are reported to cause GAMOS. Furthermore, an identical homozygous &lt;i&gt;NUP107&lt;/i&gt; (nucleoporin 107 kDa) mutation was identified in four GAMOS‐like families, although biallelic &lt;i&gt;NUP107&lt;/i&gt; mutations were originally identified in steroid‐resistant nephrotic syndrome. NUP107 and NUP133 (nucleoporin 133 kDa) are interacting subunits of the nuclear pore complex in the nuclear envelope during interphase, and these proteins are also involved in centrosome positioning and spindle assembly during mitosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linkage analysis and whole exome sequencing were performed in a previously reported GAMOS family with brain atrophy and steroid‐resistant nephrotic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a homozygous &lt;i&gt;NUP133&lt;/i&gt; mutation, c.3335‐11T&amp;gt;A, which results in the insertion of 9 bp of intronic sequence between exons 25 and 26 in the mutant transcript. NUP133 and NUP107 interaction was impaired by the &lt;i&gt;NUP133&lt;/i&gt; mutation based on an immunoprecipitation assay. Importantly, focal cortical dysplasia type IIa was recognized in the brain of an autopsied patient and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was confirmed in the kidneys of the three examined patients. A &lt;i&gt;nup133&lt;/i&gt;‐knockdown zebrafish model exhibited microcephaly, fewer neuronal cells, underdeveloped glomeruli, and fusion of the foot processes of the podocytes, which mimicked human GAMOS features. &lt;i&gt;nup133&lt;/i&gt; morphants could be rescued by human wildtype &lt;i&gt;NUP133&lt;/i&gt; mRNA but not by mutant mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data indicate that the biallelic &lt;i&gt;NUP133&lt;/i&gt; loss‐of‐function mutation causes GAMOS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: February 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 54&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Clint J Perry, Lars Chittka&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small brains of insects and other invertebrates are often thought to constrain these animals to live entirely ‘in the moment’. In this view, each one of their many seemingly hard-wired behavioral routines is triggered by a precisely defined environmental stimulus configuration, but there is no mental appreciation of the possible outcomes of one’s actions, and therefore little flexibility. However, many studies show problem-solving behavior in various arthropod species that falls outside the range of fixed behavior routines. We propose that a basic form of foresight, the ability to predict the outcomes of one’s own actions, is at the heart of such behavioral flexibility, and that the evolutionary roots of such outcome expectation are found in the need to disentangle sensory input that is predictable from self-generated motion versus input generated by changes in the outside world. Based on this, locusts, grasshoppers, dragonflies and flies seem to use internal models of the surrounding world to tailor their actions adaptively to predict the imminent future. Honeybees and orb-weaving spiders appear to act towards a desired outcome of their respective constructions, and the genetically pre-programmed routines that govern these constructions are subordinate to achieving the desired goal. Jumping spiders seem to preplan their route to prey suggesting they recognize the spatial challenge and actions necessary to obtain prey. Bumblebees and ants utilize objects not encountered in the wild as types of tools to solve problems in a manner that suggests an awareness of the desired outcome. Here we speculate that it may be simpler, in terms of the required evolutionary changes, computation and neural architecture, for arthropods to recognize their goal and predict the outcomes of their actions towards that goal, rather than having a large number of pre-programmed behaviors necessary to account for their observed behavioral flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Relation between firing statistics of spiking neuron with delayed excitatory feedback and without feedback. (arXiv:1811.05403v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05403</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05403</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A class of spiking neuronal models with threshold 2 is considered. It is
defined by a set of conditions typical for basic threshold-type models, such as
the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) or the binding neuron model and also for
some artificial neurons. A neuron is stimulated with a Poisson stream of
excitatory impulses. Each output impulse is conveyed through the feedback line
to the neuron input after finite delay $\Delta$. This impulse is identical to
those delivered from the input stream. We have obtained a general relation
allowing calculating exactly the probability density function (pdf) $p(t)$ of
output interspike intervals (ISI) values for a neuron with feedback based on
known pdf $p^0(t)$ for the same neuron without feedback, intensity of the input
stream $\lambda$ and the properties of the feedback line. Also, we derive the
exact relation for calculating the moments of $p(t)$ based on known moments of
$p^0(t)$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obtained general expression for $p(t)$ is checked numerically using Monte
Carlo simulation for the case of LIF model. The course of $p(t)$ has a
$\delta$-function type peculiarity. This fact contributes to the discussion
about the possibility to model neuronal activity with Poisson process,
supporting the 'no' answer.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In neural networks with identical neurons, the matrix of connection weights
completely describes the network structure and thereby determines how it is
processing information. However, due to the non-linearity of these systems, it
is not clear if similar microscopic connection structures also imply similar
functional properties, or if a network is impacted more by macroscopic
structural quantities, such as the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory
connections (balance), or the ratio of non-zero connections (density). To
clarify these questions, we focus on motifs of three binary neurons with
discrete ternary connection strengths, an important class of network building
blocks that can be analyzed exhaustively. We develop new, permutation-invariant
metrics to quantify the structural and functional distance between two given
network motifs. We then use multidimensional scaling to identify and visualize
clusters of motifs with similar structural and functional properties. Our
comprehensive analysis reveals that the function of a neural network is only
weakly correlated with its microscopic structure, but depends strongly on the
balance of the connections.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Automated methods for Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification have the
potential for great clinical benefits and may provide insight for combating the
disease. Machine learning, and more specifically deep neural networks, have
been shown to have great efficacy in this domain. These algorithms often use
neurological imaging data such as MRI and PET, but a comprehensive and balanced
comparison of these modalities has not been performed. In order to accurately
determine the relative strength of each imaging variant, this work performs a
comparison study in the context of Alzheimer's dementia classification using
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Furthermore,
this work analyzes the benefits of using both modalities in a fusion setting
and discusses how these data types may be leveraged in future AD studies using
deep learning.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Electrophysiological indicators of gesture perception. (arXiv:1811.05058v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05058</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05058</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: While there has been abundant research concerning neurological
responses to gesture generation, the time course of gesture processing is not
well understood. Specifically, it is not clear if or how particular
characteristics within the kinematic execution of gestures capture attention
and aid in the classification of gestures with communicative intent. If indeed
key features of gestures with perceptual saliency exist, such features could
help form the basis of a compact representation of the gestures in memory.
Methods: This study used a set of available gesture videos as stimuli. The
timing for salient features of performed gestures was determined by isolating
inflection points in the hands' motion trajectories. Participants passively
viewed the gesture videos while continuous EEG data was collected. We focused
on mu oscillations (10 Hz) and used linear regression to test for associations
between the timing of mu oscillations and inflection points in motion
trajectories. Results: Peaks in the EEG signals at central and occipital
electrodes were used to isolate the salient events within each gesture. EEG
power oscillations were detected 343 and 400ms on average after inflection
points at occipital and central electrodes, respectively. A regression model
showed that inflection points in the motion trajectories strongly predicted
subsequent mu oscillations (R^2=0.961, p&amp;lt;.01). Conclusion: The results suggest
that coordinated activity in the visual and motor cortices are highly
correlated with key motion components within gesture trajectories. These points
may be associated with neural signatures used to encode gestures in memory for
later identification and even recognition.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Silent Synapse Unsilencing in Hippocampal CA1 Neurons for Associative Fear Memory Storage</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Clarifying learning-induced synaptic plasticity in hippocampal circuits is critical for understanding hippocampal mechanisms of memory acquisition and storage. Many in vitro studies have demonstrated learning-associated plasticity at hippocampal synapses. However, as a neural basis of memory encoding, the nature of synaptic plasticity underlying hippocampal neuronal responses to memorized stimulation remains elusive. Using in vivo whole-cell recording in anaesthetized adult rats and mice, we investigated synaptic activity of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) in response to a flash of visual stimulation as the conditioned stimulus (CS) in associative fear conditioning. We found that shortly (&amp;lt;3 days) after conditioning, excitatory synaptic responses and spiking responses to the flash CS emerged in a large number (~70%) of CA1 PCs, a neuronal population previously unresponsive to the flash before conditioning. The learning-induced CA1 excitatory responsiveness was further indicated to result from postsynaptic unsilencing at flash-associated silent synapses, with NMDA receptor-gated responses we recently reported in naive animals. Our findings suggest that associative fear learning can induce excitatory responsiveness to the memorized CS in a large population of CA1 neurons, via a process of postsynaptic unsilencing at CA1 silent synapses, which may be critical for hippocampal acquisition and storage of associative memory.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Person-Based Brain Morphometric Similarity is Heritable and Correlates With Biological Features</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The characterization of the functional significance of interindividual variation in brain morphometry is a core aim of cognitive neuroscience. Prior research has focused on interindividual variation at the level of regional brain measures thus overlooking the fact that each individual brain is a person-specific ensemble of interdependent regions. To expand this line of inquiry we introduce the person-based similarity index (PBSI) for brain morphometry. The conceptual unit of the PBSI is the individual person’s brain structural profile which considers all relevant morphometric measures as features of a single vector. In 2 independent cohorts (total of 1756 healthy participants), we demonstrate the foundational validity of this approach by affirming that the PBSI scores for subcortical volume and cortical thickness in healthy individuals differ between men and women, are heritable, and robust to variation in neuroimaging parameters, sample composition, and regional brain morphometry. Moreover, the PBSI scores correlate with age, body mass index, and fluid intelligence. Collectively, these results suggest that the person-based measures of brain morphometry are biologically and functionally meaningful and have the potential to advance the study of human variation in multivariate brain imaging phenotypes in healthy and clinical populations.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Food-restriction (FR) stress evokes foraging, which translates to increased wheel running exercise (EX) for caged rodents, a maladaptive behavior, since it does not improve food access and exacerbates weight loss. While almost all adolescent rodents increase EX following FR, some then become resilient by suppressing EX by the second–fourth FR day, which minimizes weight loss. We asked whether GABAergic plasticity in the hippocampus may underlie this gain in resilience. In vitro slice physiology revealed doubling of pyramidal neurons’ GABA response in the dorsal hippocampus of food-restricted animals with wheel access (FR + EX for 4 days), but without increase of mIPSC amplitudes. mIPSC frequency increased by 46%, but electron microscopy revealed no increase in axosomatic GABAergic synapse number onto pyramidal cells and only a modest increase (26%) of GABAergic synapse lengths. These changes suggest increase of vesicular release probability and extrasynaptic GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and unsilencing of GABAergic synapses. GABAergic synapse lengths correlated with individual’s suppression of wheel running and weight loss. These analyses indicate that EX can have dual roles—exacerbate weight loss but also promote resilience to some by dampening hippocampal excitability.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The human brain undergoes dramatic structural changes during childhood that co-occur with behavioral development. These age-related changes are documented for the brain’s gray matter and white matter. However, their interrelation is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated age-related effects in cortical thickness (CT) and in cortical surface area (SA) as parts of the gray matter volume as well as age effects in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; relaxation times in the white matter. Data from &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 170 children between the ages of 3 and 7 years contributed to the sample. We found a high spatial overlap of age-related correlations between SA and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; relaxation times of the corresponding white matter connections, but no such relation between SA and CT. These results indicate that during childhood the developmental expansion of the cortical surface goes hand-in-hand with age-related increase of white matter fiber connections terminating in the cortical surface.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Moth olfactory receptor neurons adjust their encoding efficiency to temporal statistics of pheromone fluctuations</title>

The efficient coding hypothesis predicts that sensory neurons adjust their coding resources to optimally represent the stimulus statistics of their environment. To test this prediction in the moth olfactory system, we have developed a stimulation protocol that mimics the natural temporal structure within a turbulent pheromone plume. We report that responses of antennal olfactory receptor neurons to pheromone encounters follow the temporal fluctuations in such a way that the most frequent stimulus timescales are encoded with maximum accuracy. We also observe that the average coding precision of the neurons adjusted to the stimulus-timescale statistics at a given distance from the pheromone source is higher than if the same encoding model is applied at a shorter, non-matching, distance. Finally, the coding accuracy profile and the stimulus-timescale distribution are related in the manner predicted by the information theory for the many-to-one convergence scenario of the moth peripheral sensory system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T3ETnhHC120&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Humans can meaningfully report their confidence in a perceptual or cognitive decision. It is widely believed that these reports reflect the Bayesian probability that the decision is correct, but this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested against non-Bayesian alternatives. We use two perceptual categorization tasks in which Bayesian confidence reporting requires subjects to take sensory uncertainty into account in a specific way. We find that subjects do take sensory uncertainty into account when reporting confidence, suggesting that brain areas involved in reporting confidence can access low-level representations of sensory uncertainty, a prerequisite of Bayesian inference. However, behavior is not fully consistent with the Bayesian hypothesis and is better described by simple heuristic models that use uncertainty in a non-Bayesian way. Both conclusions are robust to changes in the uncertainty manipulation, task, response modality, model comparison metric, and additional flexibility in the Bayesian model. Our results suggest that adhering to a rational account of confidence behavior may require incorporating implementational constraints.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k1ezyXe_qUo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Population genetic modeling can enhance Bayesian phylogenetic inference by providing a realistic prior on the distribution of branch lengths and times of common ancestry. The parameters of a population genetic model may also have intrinsic importance, and simultaneous estimation of a phylogeny and model parameters has enabled phylodynamic inference of population growth rates, reproduction numbers, and effective population size through time. Phylodynamic inference based on pathogen genetic sequence data has emerged as useful supplement to epidemic surveillance, however commonly-used mechanistic models that are typically fitted to non-genetic surveillance data are rarely fitted to pathogen genetic data due to a dearth of software tools, and the theory required to conduct such inference has been developed only recently. We present a framework for coalescent-based phylogenetic and phylodynamic inference which enables highly-flexible modeling of demographic and epidemiological processes. This approach builds upon previous structured coalescent approaches and includes enhancements for computational speed, accuracy, and stability. A flexible markup language is described for translating parametric demographic or epidemiological models into a structured coalescent model enabling simultaneous estimation of demographic or epidemiological parameters and time-scaled phylogenies. We demonstrate the utility of these approaches by fitting compartmental epidemiological models to Ebola virus and Influenza A virus sequence data, demonstrating how important features of these epidemics, such as the reproduction number and epidemic curves, can be gleaned from genetic data. These approaches are provided as an open-source package &lt;i&gt;PhyDyn&lt;/i&gt; for the BEAST2 phylogenetics platform.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KBwoD24QGeY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Inferring interaction partners from protein sequences using mutual information</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Anne-Florence Bitbol&lt;/p&gt;

Functional protein-protein interactions are crucial in most cellular processes. They enable multi-protein complexes to assemble and to remain stable, and they allow signal transduction in various pathways. Functional interactions between proteins result in coevolution between the interacting partners, and thus in correlations between their sequences. Pairwise maximum-entropy based models have enabled successful inference of pairs of amino-acid residues that are in contact in the three-dimensional structure of multi-protein complexes, starting from the correlations in the sequence data of known interaction partners. Recently, algorithms inspired by these methods have been developed to identify which proteins are functional interaction partners among the paralogous proteins of two families, starting from sequence data alone. Here, we demonstrate that a slightly higher performance for partner identification can be reached by an approximate maximization of the mutual information between the sequence alignments of the two protein families. Our mutual information-based method also provides signatures of the existence of interactions between protein families. These results stand in contrast with structure prediction of proteins and of multi-protein complexes from sequence data, where pairwise maximum-entropy based global statistical models substantially improve performance compared to mutual information. Our findings entail that the statistical dependences allowing interaction partner prediction from sequence data are not restricted to the residue pairs that are in direct contact at the interface between the partner proteins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sTP41XDQ1ZA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The wiring diagram of the mouse brain has recently been mapped at a
mesoscopic scale in the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas. Axonal
projections from brain regions were traced using green fluoresent proteins. The
resulting data were registered to a common three-dimensional reference space.
They yielded a matrix of connection strengths between 213 brain regions. Global
features such as closed loops formed by connections of similar intensity can be
inferred using tools from persistent homology. We map the wiring diagram of the
mouse brain to a simplicial complex (filtered by connection strengths). We work
out generators of the first homology group. Some regions, including nucleus
accumbens, are connected to the entire brain by loops, whereas no region has
non-zero connection strength to all brain regions. Thousands of loops go
through the isocortex, the striatum and the thalamus. On the other hand,
medulla is the only major brain compartment that contains more than 100 loops.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Detection of REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder by Automated Polysomnography Analysis. (arXiv:1811.04662v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04662</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04662</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests Rapid-Eye-Movement (REM) Sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) is
an early predictor of Parkinson's disease. This study proposes a
fully-automated framework for RBD detection consisting of automated sleep
staging followed by RBD identification. Analysis was assessed using a limited
polysomnography montage from 53 participants with RBD and 53 age-matched
healthy controls. Sleep stage classification was achieved using a Random Forest
(RF) classifier and 156 features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG),
electrooculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) channels. For RBD detection, a
RF classifier was trained combining established techniques to quantify muscle
atonia with additional features that incorporate sleep architecture and the EMG
fractal exponent. Automated multi-state sleep staging achieved a 0.62 Cohen's
Kappa score. RBD detection accuracy improved by 10% to 96% (compared to
individual established metrics) when using manually annotated sleep staging.
Accuracy remained high (92%) when using automated sleep staging. This study
outperforms established metrics and demonstrates that incorporating sleep
architecture and sleep stage transitions can benefit RBD detection. This study
also achieved automated sleep staging with a level of accuracy comparable to
manual annotation. This study validates a tractable, fully-automated, and
sensitive pipeline for RBD identification that could be translated to wearable
take-home technology.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Topographic maps in the brain are fundamental to processing of causality. (arXiv:1811.04581v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04581</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04581</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ubiquity of topographic maps in the brain has long been known, and
molecular mechanisms for the formation of topographic organization of neural
systems have been revealed. Less attention has been given to the question of
why are the maps topographical and why so ubiquitous. In this study, I explore
the implications of the topographic maps for brain function, by employing the
mathematical framework of the Zeeman topology. I propose the notion about the
meaning of topographic order as generic mechanisms for the representation and
analysis of causal structure, implemented by the neural systems. This leads to
a much improved understanding of the division of labour between chemical
systems and neural systems in the formation of maps to deal with causality.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A regularity index for dendrites - local statistics of a neuron's input space</title>

Neurons collect their inputs from other neurons by sending out arborized dendritic structures. However, the relationship between the shape of dendrites and the precise organization of synaptic inputs in the neural tissue remains unclear. Inputs could be distributed in tight clusters, entirely randomly or else in a regular grid-like manner. Here, we analyze dendritic branching structures using a regularity index &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;, based on average nearest neighbor distances between branch and termination points, characterizing their spatial distribution. We find that the distributions of these points depend strongly on cell types, indicating possible fundamental differences in synaptic input organization. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; is independent of cell size and we find that it is only weakly correlated with other branching statistics, suggesting that it might reflect features of dendritic morphology that are not captured by commonly studied branching statistics. We then use morphological models based on optimal wiring principles to study the relation between input distributions and dendritic branching structures. Using our models, we find that branch point distributions correlate more closely with the input distributions while termination points in dendrites are generally spread out more randomly with a close to uniform distribution. We validate these model predictions with connectome data. Finally, we find that in spatial input distributions with increasing regularity, characteristic scaling relationships between branching features are altered significantly. In summary, we conclude that local statistics of input distributions and dendrite morphology depend on each other leading to potentially cell type specific branching features.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ori6Lo6m244&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Functional mechanisms underlie the emergence of a diverse range of plasticity phenomena</title>

Diverse plasticity mechanisms are orchestrated to shape the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying brain functions. However, why these plasticity rules emerge and how their dynamics interact with neural activity to give rise to complex neural circuit dynamics remains largely unknown. Here we show that both Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity rules emerge from a functional perspective of neuronal dynamics whereby each neuron learns to encode its own activity in the population activity, so that the activity of the presynaptic neuron can be decoded from the activity of its postsynaptic neurons. We explain how a range of experimentally observed plasticity phenomena with widely separated time scales emerge from learning this encoding function, including STDP and its frequency dependence, and metaplasticity. We show that when implemented in neural circuits, these plasticity rules naturally give rise to essential neural response properties, including variable neural dynamics with balanced excitation and inhibition, and approximately log-normal distributions of synaptic strengths, while simultaneously encoding a complex real-world visual stimulus. These findings establish a novel function-based account of diverse plasticity mechanisms, providing a unifying framework relating plasticity, dynamics and neural computation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4hnBgLInEwc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Population structure can strongly affect evolutionary dynamics. The most general way to describe population structures are graphs. An important observable on evolutionary graphs is the probability that a novel mutation spreads through the entire population. But what drives this spread of a mutation towards fixation? Here, we propose a novel way to understand the forces driving fixation by borrowing techniques from evolutionary demography to quantify the invasion fitness and the effective population size for different graphs. Our method is very general and even applies to weighted graphs with node dependent fitness. However, we focus on analytical results for undirected graphs with node independent fitness. The method will allow to conceptually integrate evolutionary graph theory with theoretical genetics of structured populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uezjpMD9TOY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Despite advances in experimental techniques and accumulation of large datasets concerning the composition and properties of the cortex, quantitative modeling of cortical circuits under in-vivo-like conditions remains challenging. Here we report and publicly release a biophysically detailed circuit model of layer 4 in the mouse primary visual cortex, receiving thalamo-cortical visual inputs. The 45,000-neuron model was subjected to a battery of visual stimuli, and results were compared to published work and new in vivo experiments. Simulations reproduced a variety of observations, including effects of optogenetic perturbations. Critical to the agreement between responses in silico and in vivo were the rules of functional synaptic connectivity between neurons. Interestingly, after extreme simplification the model still performed satisfactorily on many measurements, although quantitative agreement with experiments suffered. These results emphasize the importance of functional rules of cortical wiring and enable a next generation of data-driven models of in vivo neural activity and computations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hU_7d7E5u8Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Oscillations in working memory and neural binding: A mechanism for multiple memories and their interactions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006517</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jason E. Pina, Mark Bodner, Bard Ermentrout&lt;/p&gt;

Neural oscillations have been recorded and implicated in many different basic brain and cognitive processes. For example, oscillatory neural activity has been suggested to play a role in binding and in the maintenance of information in working memory. With respect to the latter, the majority of work has focused primarily on oscillations in terms of providing a “code” in working memory. However, oscillations may additionally play a fundamental role by enabling or facilitating essential properties and behaviors that neuronal networks must exhibit in order to produce functional working memory and the processes it supports, such as combining items in memory into bound objects or separating bound objects into distinct items. In the present work, we present a biologically plausible working memory model and demonstrate that specific types of stable oscillatory dynamics that arise may play critical roles in providing mechanisms for working memory and the cognitive functions that it supports. Specifically, these roles include (1) enabling a range of different types of binding, (2) both enabling and limiting capacities of bound and distinct items held active in working memory, and (3) facilitating transitions between active working memory states as required in cognitive function. Several key results arise within the examinations, such as the occurrence of different network capacities for working memory and binding, differences in processing times for transitions in working memory states, and the emergence of a combinatorially rich and complex range of oscillatory states that are sufficient to map onto a wide range of cognitive operations supported by working memory, such as variable binding, reasoning, and language. In particular, we show that these oscillatory states and their transitions can provide a specific instantiation of current established connectionist models in representing these functions. Finally, we further characterize the dependence of the relevant oscillatory solutions on certain critical parameters, including mutual inhibition and synaptic timescales.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n2vXpNJbJkw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the association between clinical outcomes and acute systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels achieved after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eligible patients who were randomized to the Antihypertensive Treatment in Intracerebral Hemorrhage 2 (ATACH‐2) trial (&lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt; NCT01176565) were divided into 5 groups by 10‐mmHg strata of average hourly minimum SBP (&amp;lt;120 mmHg, 120‐130, 130‐140, 140‐150 and ≥150) during 2 to 24 hours after randomization. Outcomes included: 90‐day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 4‐6; hematoma expansion, defined as an increase ≥6 mL from baseline to 24‐hour computed tomography; and cardio‐renal adverse events within 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 1,000 subjects in ATACH‐2, 995 with available SBP data were included in the analyses. The proportion of mRS 4‐6 was 37.5%, 36.0%, 42.8%, 38.6%, and 38.0%, respectively. For the ‘140‐150’ group relative to the ‘120‐130’, the odds ratio, adjusting for sex, race, age, onset‐to‐randomization time, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, hematoma volume, and hematoma location, was 1.62 (95% confidence interval 1.02‐2.58). Hematoma expansion was identified in 16.9%, 13.7%, 21.4%, 18.5%, and 26.4%, respectively. The ‘140‐150’ (odds ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.05‐3.09) and ‘≥150’ (1.98, 1.12‐3.51) showed a higher frequency of expansion than ‘120‐130’ group. Cardio‐renal events occurred in 13.6%, 16.6%, 11.5%, 8.1%, and 8.2%, respectively. The ‘140‐150’ (0.43, 0.19‐0.88) and ‘≥150’ (0.44, 0.18‐0.96) showed a lower frequency of the events than the ‘120‐130’.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beneficial effects of lowering and maintaining SBP at 120‐130 mmHg during the first 24 hours on clinical outcomes by suppressing hematoma expansion was somewhat offset by cardio‐renal complications.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The degree to which Alzheimer's versus other neuropathologies contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's dementia is unknown. We examined the risk of Alzheimer's dementia attributable to pathologic AD and eight other neuropathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants (n=1,161) came from two clinical‐pathologic studies of aging. Multivariable logistic regression models examined associations of eight neuropathologic indices with Alzheimer's dementia and quantified the percentage of cases attributable to each. Further, because some dementia cases are not driven by common neuropathologies, we re‐estimated the attributable risks after empirically adjusting for such cases.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 1,161 persons, 512 (44.1%) had Alzheimer's dementia at the time of death. With the exception of microinfarcts, all neuropathologic indices were independently associated with greater odds of Alzheimer's dementia. 210 (41.0%) Alzheimer's dementia cases were attributable to pathologic AD. Separately, 8.9% were attributable to macroscopic infarcts, 10.8% to Lewy bodies, 5.2% to hippocampal sclerosis, 11.7% to TDP‐43, 8.1% to CAA, 6.0% to atherosclerosis and 5.2% to arteriolosclerosis. A total of 83.3% of cases were attributable to all eight indices combined. However, after further adjustment for cases driven by other factors, a total of 67.5% of cases were attributable to all eight neuropathologic indices combined.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathologic AD accounts for a considerable percentage of Alzheimer's dementia cases, but multiple other neuropathologies also contribute. In total, just over two thirds of Alzheimer's dementia cases are attributable to common age‐related neuropathologies, suggesting that other disease and resilience factors are important.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study we evaluate the role of the thalamus in the neural circuitry of arousal. Level of consciousness within the first 12 hours of a thalamic stroke is assessed with lesion symptom mapping. Impaired arousal correlates with lesions in the paramedian posterior thalamus near the centromedian and parafascicular nuclei, posterior hypothalamus, and midbrain tegmentum. All patients with severely impaired arousal (coma, stupor) had lesion extension into the midbrain and/or pontine tegmentum, whereas purely thalamic lesions did not severely impair arousal. These results are consistent with growing evidence that pathways most critical for human arousal lay outside the thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sensitive Period for Cognitive Repurposing of Human Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy280</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Studies of sensory loss are a model for understanding the functional flexibility of human cortex. In congenital blindness, subsets of visual cortex are recruited during higher-cognitive tasks, such as language and math tasks. Is such dramatic functional repurposing possible throughout the lifespan or restricted to sensitive periods in development? We compared visual cortex function in individuals who lost their vision as adults (after age 17) to congenitally blind and sighted blindfolded adults. Participants took part in resting-state and task-based fMRI scans during which they solved math equations of varying difficulty and judged the meanings of sentences. Blindness at any age caused “visual” cortices to synchronize with specific frontoparietal networks at rest. However, in task-based data, visual cortices showed regional specialization for math and language and load-dependent activity only in congenital blindness. Thus, despite the presence of long-range functional connectivity, cognitive repurposing of human cortex is limited by sensitive periods.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Functional Connectivity Changes of Key Regions for Motor Initiation in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy259</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy259/5174331?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Akinesia, a cardinal symptom of Parkinson’s disease, has been linked to abnormal activation in putamen and posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC). However, little is known whether clinical severity of akinesia is linked to dysfunctional connectivity of these regions. Using a seed-based approach, we here investigated resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of putamen, pMFC and primary motor cortex (M1) in 60 patients with Parkinson’s disease on regular medication and 72 healthy controls. We found that in patients putamen featured decreases of connectivity for a number of cortical and subcortical areas engaged in sensorimotor and cognitive processing. In contrast, the pMFC showed reduced connectivity with a more focal cortical network involved in higher-level motor-cognition. Finally, M1 featured a selective disruption of connectivity in a network specifically connected with M1. Correlating clinical impairment with connectivity changes revealed a relationship between akinesia and reduced RSFC between pMFC and left intraparietal lobule (IPL). Together, the present study demonstrated RSFC decreases in networks for motor initiation and execution in Parkinson’s disease. Moreover, results suggest a relationship between pMFC-IPL decoupling and the manifestation of akinetic symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The first voxel-level resting-state functional connectivity (FC) neuroimaging analysis of depression of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed in 282 patients with major depressive disorder compared with 254 controls, some higher, and some lower FCs. However, in 125 unmedicated patients, primarily increases of FC were found: of the subcallosal anterior cingulate with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, of the pregenual/supracallosal anterior cingulate with the medial orbitofrontal cortex, and of parts of the anterior cingulate with the inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and with early cortical visual areas. In the 157 medicated patients, these and other FCs were lower than in the unmedicated group. Parcellation was performed based on the FC of individual ACC voxels in healthy controls. A pregenual subdivision had high FC with medial orbitofrontal cortex areas, and a supracallosal subdivision had high FC with lateral orbitofrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. The high FC in depression between the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the subcallosal parts of the ACC provides a mechanism for more non-reward information transmission to the ACC, contributing to depression. The high FC between the medial orbitofrontal cortex and supracallosal ACC in depression may also contribute to depressive symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: February 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 54&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Priyanka Rao-Ruiz, Julia Yu, Steven A Kushner, Sheena A Josselyn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extensive work in computational modeling has highlighted the advantages for employing sparse yet distributed data representation and storage Kanerva (1998), properties that extend to neuronal networks encoding mnemonic information (memory traces or engrams). While neurons that participate in an engram are distributed across multiple brain regions, within each region, the cellular sparsity of the mnemonic representation appears to be quite fixed. Although technological advances have enabled significant progress in identifying and manipulating engrams, relatively little is known about the region-dependent microcircuit rules governing the cellular sparsity of an engram. Here we review recent studies examining the mechanisms that help shape engram architecture and examine how these processes may regulate memory function. We speculate that countervailing forces in local microcircuits contribute to the generation and maintenance of engrams and discuss emerging questions regarding how engrams are formed, stored and used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 5% of cerebral small vessel diseases are hereditary, which include &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders. &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt; encode type IV collagen α1/2 chains in the basement membranes of cerebral vessels. &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt; mutations impair the secretion of collagen to the extracellular matrix, thereby resulting in vessel fragility. The diagnostic yield for &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt; variants is around 20%–30%, suggesting other mutated genes might be associated with this disease. This study aimed to identify novel genes that cause &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole exome sequencing was performed in two families with suspected &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders. We validated the role of &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; variants by constructing a 3D structural model, evaluating ColGalT1 protein expression and ColGalT activity by western blotting and collagen galactosyltransferase assays, and performing &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; RNA interference and rescue experiments.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exome sequencing demonstrated biallelic variants in &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; encoding collagen β (1‐O) galactosyltransferase 1, which was involved in the post‐translational modification of type IV collagen in two unrelated patients: c.452T&amp;gt;G (p.Leu151Arg) and c.1096delG (p.Glu366Argfs*15) in Patient 1, and c.460G&amp;gt;C (p.Ala154Pro) and c.1129G&amp;gt;C (p.Gly377Arg) in Patient 2. 3D model analysis suggested that p.Leu151Arg and p.Ala154Pro destabilized protein folding, which impaired enzymatic activity. ColGalT1 protein expression and ColGalT activity in Patient 1 were undetectable. RNA interference studies demonstrated that reduced ColGalT1 altered COL4A1 secretion, and rescue experiments showed that mutant &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; insufficiently restored COL4A1 production in cells compared with wild‐type.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biallelic &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; variants cause cerebral small vessel abnormalities through a common molecular pathogenesis with &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Etiologic diagnosis is uncertain in 35% to 50% of patients with encephalitis, despite its substantial global prevalence and disease burden. We report on 2 adult female patients with fatal leukoencephalitis associated with human pegivirus‐1 (HPgV‐1) brain infection. Neuroimaging showed inflammatory changes in cerebral white matter. Brain‐derived HPgV‐1 RNA sequences clustered phylogenetically with other pegiviruses despite an 87‐nucleotide deletion in the viral nonstructural (NS)2 gene. Neuropathology disclosed lymphocyte infiltration and gliosis predominantly in brain white matter. HPgV‐1 NS5A antigen was detected in lymphocytes as well as in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. HPgV‐1 neuroadaptation should be considered in the differential diagnosis of progressive leukoencephalitis in humans. Ann Neurol 2018&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: KCTD7 deficiency defines a distinct neurodegenerative disorder with a conserved autophagy‐lysosome defect</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25351?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25351?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several small case series identified &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; mutations in patients with a rare autosomal recessive disorder designated progressive myoclonic epilepsy (EPM3) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN14). Despite the name KCTD (potassium channel tetramerization domain), KCTD protein family members lack predicted channel domains. We sought to translate insight gained from yeast studies to uncover disease mechanisms associated with deficiencies in KCTD7 of unknown function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; variants in new and published patients were assessed for disease causality using genetic analyses, cell‐based functional assays of patient fibroblasts and knockout yeast, and electron microscopy of patient samples.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; mutations can exhibit movement disorders or developmental regression before seizure onset, and are distinguished from similar disorders by an earlier age of onset. Although most published &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; patient variants were excluded from a genome sequence database of normal human variations, most newly identified patient variants are present in this database, potentially challenging disease causality. However, genetic analysis and impaired biochemical interactions with cullin 3 support a causal role for patient &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; variants, suggesting deleterious alleles of &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; and other rare disease variants may be underestimated. Both patient‐derived fibroblasts and yeast lacking Whi2 with sequence similarity to KCTD7 have impaired autophagy consistent with brain pathology.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biallelic &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; mutations define a neurodegenerative disorder with lipofuscin and lipid droplet accumulation but without defining features of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis or lysosomal storage disorders. &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; deficiency appears to cause an underlying autophagy‐lysosome defect conserved in yeast, thereby assigning a biological role for KCTD7.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Magnetic resonance T1w/T2w ratio: A parsimonious marker for Parkinson's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25376?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newer MRI techniques have shown promise in capturing early Parkinson's disease (PD)‐related changes in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), the key pathological loci. Their translational value, however, is hindered by technical complexity and inconsistent results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel yet simple MRI contrast, the T1w/T2w ratio, was used to study 76 PD patients and 70 controls. The T1w/T2w ratio maps were analyzed using both voxel‐based and region‐of‐interest approaches in normalized space. The sensitivity and specificity of the SN T1w/T2w ratio in discriminating between PD and controls also were assessed. In addition, its diagnostic performance was tested in a subgroup of PD patients with disease duration ≤2 years (PDE). A second independent cohort of 73 PD and 49 controls was used for validation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to controls, PD patients showed a higher T1w/T2w ratio in both the right (cluster size=164 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and left (cluster size=213 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, p&amp;lt;0.0001) midbrain that was located ventrolateral to the red nucleus and corresponded to the SNc. The region‐of‐interest approach confirmed the group difference in the SNc T1w/T2w ratio between PD and controls (p&amp;lt;0.0001). The SNc T1w/T2w ratio had high sensitivity (0.908) and specificity (0.80) to separate PD and controls (AUC=0.926), even for PDE patients (AUC=0.901, sensitivity=0.857, specificity=0.857). These results were validated in the second cohort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T1w/T2w ratio can detect PD‐related changes in the SN and may be used as a novel, parsimonious &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; biomarker for the disease, particularly early stage patients, with high translational value for clinical practice and research.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Switching the manufacturer of antiepileptic drugs is associated with higher risk of seizures: A nationwide study of prescription data in Germany</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25353?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25353?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite bioequivalence, the exchangeability of antiepileptic drugs in clinical settings is disputed. Therefore, we investigated the risk for recurrent seizures after switching the manufacturer of the same drug in a large German cohort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anonymous patient data from practice neurologists throughout Germany between 2011 and 2016 were collected using the IMS Disease Analyzer database (QuintilesIMS, Frankfurt, Germany). People with epilepsy were included if at least 2 prescriptions within 360 days and 1 within 180 days prior to the index date were available. The cohort was separated into a seizure group and seizure‐free controls. Both groups were matched 1:1 according to age, gender, insurance status, and treating physician. The risk for breakthrough seizures after a manufacturer switch of the same antiepileptic drug was analyzed using multivariate regression models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 3,530 people with epilepsy were included (each group, n = 1,765; age = 53.7 ± 19.8 years). Patients with seizures had switched the drug manufacturer more often than controls (26.8% vs 14.2%; odds ratio [OR] = 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08–1.69, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009), both from branded to generic (5.5% vs 2.4%; OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.30–2.64, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and between generic drugs (14.7% vs 7.1%; OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.13–1.87, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previously seizure‐free patients, switching the manufacturer of antiepileptic medications was associated with a higher risk for seizure recurrence. Our retrospective approach does not allow us to determine whether other changes in medical care at the same time could contribute to the recurrence. However, it would be prudent to avoid switching the manufacturer of anticonvulsants in seizure‐free patients. Ann Neurol 2018&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated the therapeutic potential of the interleukin‐6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab in 7 patients with new‐onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) who remained refractory to conventional immunotherapy with rituximab (n=5) or without rituximab (n=2). Status epilepticus (SE) was terminated after 1‐2 doses of tocilizumab in six patients with a median interval of three days from the initiation. They had no recurrence of SE during the observation. However, two patients experienced severe adverse events related to infection during the tocilizumab therapy. Further prospective controlled studies are warranted to validate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with NORSE.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Brain‐State Dependent Stimulation boosts functional recovery following stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25375?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25375?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjuvant protocols devised to enhance motor recovery in subacute stroke patients have failed to show benefits with respect to classic therapeutic interventions. Here we evaluate the efficacy of a novel brain‐state dependent intervention based on known mechanisms of memory and learning, that is integrated as part of the weekly rehabilitation program in subacute stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐four hospitalized subacute stroke patients were randomly assigned to two intervention groups; 1. The associative group received thirty pairings of a peripheral electrical nerve stimulus (ES) such that the generated afferent volley arrived precisely during the most active phase of the motor cortex as patients attempted to perform a movement; 2. In the control group the ES intensity was too low to generate a stimulation of the nerve. Functional (including the lower extremity Fugl‐Meyer assessment (LE‐FM; primary outcome measure)) and neurophysiological (changes in motor evoked potentials (MEPs)) assessments were performed prior to and following the intervention period.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The associative group significantly improved functional recovery with respect to the control group (median (interquartile range) LE‐FM improvement: 6.5 (3.5‐8.25) and 3 (0.75‐3), respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.029). Significant increases in MEP amplitude were seen following all sessions in the associative group only (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;’s≤0.006).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first evidence of a clinical effect of a neuromodulatory intervention in the subacute phase of stroke. This was evident with relatively few repetitions in comparison to available techniques, making it a clinically‐viable approach. The results indicate the potential of the proposed neuromodulation system in daily clinical routine for stroke rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;

In this Review, Jaffrey and Wilkinson discuss how this pathway affects the nervous system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/_giWGVF5hrk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Neuron: Merkel Cells Activate Sensory Neural Pathways through Adrenergic Synapses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30942-5?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30942-5?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Hoffman et al. reveal the molecular machinery underlying neurotransmission at a gentle-touch receptor. Employing Eccles’s classical criteria for a chemical synapse, they show that epithelial Merkel cells communicate with sensory neurons through β2-adrenergic receptors at excitatory synapses.</description>

	<title>Neuron: Complement C3aR Inactivation Attenuates Tau Pathology and Reverses an Immune Network Deregulated in Tauopathy Models and Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30939-5?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30939-5?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Litvinchuk et al. show that complement C3aR plays a critical role in mediating immune homeostasis and tau pathology. The identification of a conserved C3aR network and crosstalk between complement signaling with STAT3 activation reveal novel pathogenic and therapeutic insights.</description>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30936-X?rss=yes</link>
	<description>During navigation, animals regulate both rotation and translation. Creamer et al. investigate how visual motion cues regulate walking speed in Drosophila. They find that orientation and walking speed are stabilized by algorithms with distinct tunings but employ overlapping circuitry.</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Propagation of Information Along the Cortical Hierarchy as a Function of Attention While Reading and Listening to Stories</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy282</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy282/5158241?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;How does attention route information from sensory to high-order areas as a function of task, within the relatively fixed topology of the brain? In this study, participants were simultaneously presented with 2 unrelated stories—one spoken and one written—and asked to attend one while ignoring the other. We used fMRI and a novel intersubject correlation analysis to track the spread of information along the processing hierarchy as a function of task. Processing the unattended spoken (written) information was confined to auditory (visual) cortices. In contrast, attending to the spoken (written) story enhanced the stimulus-selective responses in sensory regions and allowed it to spread into higher-order areas. Surprisingly, we found that the story-specific spoken (written) responses for the attended story also reached secondary visual (auditory) regions of the unattended sensory modality. These results demonstrate how attention enhances the processing of attended input and allows it to propagate across brain areas.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The GABA Developmental Shift Is Abolished by Maternal Immune Activation Already at Birth</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy279</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy279/5158235?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that maternal immune activation (MIA) leads to developmental brain disorders, but whether the pathogenic mechanism impacts neurons already at birth is not known. We now report that MIA abolishes in mice the oxytocin-mediated delivery γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing in CA3 pyramidal neurons, and this is restored by the NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist bumetanide. Furthermore, MIA hippocampal pyramidal neurons at birth have a more exuberant apical arbor organization and increased apical dendritic length than age-matched controls. The frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic postsynaptic currents is also increased in MIA offspring, as well as the pairwise correlation of the synchronized firing of active cells in CA3. These alterations produced by MIA persist, since at P14–15 GABA action remains depolarizing, produces excitatory action, and network activity remains elevated with a higher frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic postsynaptic currents. Therefore, the pathogenic actions of MIA lead to important morphophysiological and network alterations in the hippocampus already at birth.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Selective Role of the Putamen in Serial Reversal Learning in the Marmoset</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy276</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy276/5158234?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fronto-striatal circuitry involving the orbitofrontal cortex has been identified as mediating successful reversal of stimulus-outcome contingencies. The region of the striatum that most contributes to reversal learning remains unclear, with studies in primates implicating both caudate nucleus and putamen. We trained four marmosets on a touchscreen-based serial reversal task and implanted each with cannulae targeting both putamen and caudate bilaterally. This allowed reversible inactivation of the two areas within the same monkeys, but across separate sessions, to directly investigate their respective contributions to reversal performance. Behavioral sensitivity to the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; agonist muscimol varied across subjects and between brain regions, so each marmoset received a range of doses. Intermediate doses of intra-putamen muscimol selectively impaired reversal performance, leaving the baseline discrimination phase unchanged. There was no effect of low doses and high doses were generally disruptive. By contrast, low doses of intra-caudate muscimol improved reversal performance, while high doses impaired both reversal and baseline discrimination performance. These data provide evidence for a specific role of the putamen in serial reversal learning, which may reflect the more habitual nature of repeated reversals using the same stimulus pair.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: 27-Hydroxycholesterol Induces Aberrant Morphology and Synaptic Dysfunction in Hippocampal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy274</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy274/5158244?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, but how high blood cholesterol levels are linked to neurodegeneration is still unknown. Here, we show that an excess of the blood–brain barrier permeable cholesterol metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH) impairs neuronal morphology and reduces hippocampal spine density and the levels of the postsynaptic protein PSD95. Dendritic spines are the main postsynaptic elements of excitatory synapses and are crucial structures for memory and cognition. Furthermore, PSD95 has an essential function for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. PSD95 synthesis is controlled by the REST–miR124a–PTBP1 axis. Here, we report that high levels of 27-OH induce REST–miR124a–PTBP1 axis dysregulation in a possible RxRγ-dependent manner, suggesting that 27-OH reduces PSD95 levels through this mechanism. Our results reveal a possible molecular link between hypercholesterolemia and neurodegeneration. We discuss the possibility that reduction of 27-OH levels could be a useful strategy for preventing memory and cognitive decline in neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/span&gt;</description>
