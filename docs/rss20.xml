	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A minimally invasive neurostimulation method for controlling abnormal synchronisation in the neuronal activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006296</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Malbor Asllani, Paul Expert, Timoteo Carletti&lt;/p&gt;

Many collective phenomena in Nature emerge from the -partial- synchronisation of the units comprising a system. In the case of the brain, this self-organised process allows groups of neurons to fire in highly intricate partially synchronised patterns and eventually lead to high level cognitive outputs and control over the human body. However, when the synchronisation patterns are altered and hypersynchronisation occurs, undesirable effects can occur. This is particularly striking and well documented in the case of epileptic seizures and tremors in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease. In this paper, we propose an innovative, minimally invasive, control method that can effectively desynchronise misfiring brain regions and thus mitigate and even eliminate the symptoms of the diseases. The control strategy, grounded in the Hamiltonian control theory, is applied to ensembles of neurons modelled via the Kuramoto or the Stuart-Landau models and allows for heterogeneous coupling among the interacting unities. The theory has been complemented with dedicated numerical simulations performed using the small-world Newman-Watts network and the random Erdős-Rényi network. Finally the method has been compared with the gold-standard Proportional-Differential Feedback control technique. Our method is shown to achieve equivalent levels of desynchronisation using lesser control strength and/or fewer controllers, being thus minimally invasive.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HZMLntdffDE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Correction of copy number induced false positives in CRISPR screens</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006279</guid>

Cell autonomous cancer dependencies are now routinely identified using CRISPR loss-of-function viability screens. However, a bias exists that makes it difficult to assess the true essentiality of genes located in amplicons, since the entire amplified region can exhibit lethal scores. These false-positive hits can either be discarded from further analysis, which in cancer models can represent a significant number of hits, or methods can be developed to rescue the true-positives within amplified regions. We propose two methods to rescue true positive hits in amplified regions by correcting for this copy number artefact. The Local Drop Out (LDO) method uses the relative lethality scores within genomic regions to assess true essentiality and does not require additional orthogonal data (e.g. copy number value). LDO is meant to be used in screens covering a dense region of the genome (e.g. a whole chromosome or the whole genome). The General Additive Model (GAM) method models the screening data as a function of the known copy number values and removes the systematic effect from the measured lethality. GAM does not require the same density as LDO, but does require prior knowledge of the copy number values. Both methods have been developed with single sample experiments in mind so that the correction can be applied even in smaller screens. Here we demonstrate the efficacy of both methods at removing the copy number effect and rescuing hits from some of the amplified regions. We estimate a 70–80% decrease of false positive hits with either method in regions of high copy number compared to no correction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HKcn4ktDbyU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are processed from primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs), and their expression is controlled at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. However, how regulation at multiple levels achieves precise control remains elusive. Using published and new datasets, we profile a time course of mature and pri-miRNAs in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryos and reveal the dynamics of miRNA production and degradation as well as dynamic changes in pri-miRNA isoform selection. We found that 5' nucleotides influence stability of mature miRNAs. Furthermore, distinct half-lives of miRNAs from the &lt;i&gt;mir-309&lt;/i&gt; cluster shape their temporal expression patterns, and the importance of rapid degradation of the miRNAs in gene regulation is detected as distinct evolutionary signatures at the target sites in the transcriptome. Finally, we show that rapid degradation of miR-3/-309 may be important for regulation of the planar cell polarity pathway component Vang. Altogether, the results suggest that complex mechanisms regulate miRNA expression to support normal development.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Inhibiting the integrated stress response pathway prevents aberrant chondrocyte differentiation thereby alleviating chondrodysplasia</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37673</link>
	<description>The integrated stress response (ISR) is activated by diverse forms of cellular stress, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and is associated with diseases. However, the molecular mechanism(s) whereby the ISR impacts on differentiation is incompletely understood. Here, we exploited a mouse model of Metaphyseal Chondrodysplasia type Schmid (MCDS) to provide insight into the impact of the ISR on cell fate. We show the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway that mediates preferential synthesis of ATF4 and CHOP, dominates in causing dysplasia by reverting chondrocyte differentiation via ATF4-directed transactivation of &lt;i&gt;Sox9&lt;/i&gt;. Chondrocyte survival is enabled, cell autonomously, by CHOP and dual CHOP-ATF4 transactivation of &lt;i&gt;Fgf21.&lt;/i&gt; Treatment of mutant mice with a chemical inhibitor of PERK signaling prevents the differentiation defects and ameliorates chondrodysplasia. By preventing aberrant differentiation, titrated inhibition of the ISR emerges as a rationale therapeutic strategy for stress-induced skeletal disorders.</description>

Building on our previous work which described the sexually dimorphic expression of a neuroendocrine ligand, DAF-7, and its role in behavioral decision-making in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; (Hilbert and Kim, 2017), we show here that sex-specific expression of &lt;i&gt;daf-7&lt;/i&gt; is regulated by another neuroendocrine ligand, Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF-1), which has previously been implicated in regulating male-specific behavior (Barrios et al., 2012). Our analysis revealed that PDF-1 signaling acts sex- and cell-specifically in the ASJ neurons to regulate the expression of &lt;i&gt;daf-7,&lt;/i&gt; and we show that differences in PDFR-1 receptor activity account for the sex-specific effects of this pathway. Our data suggest that modulation of the sex-shared nervous system by a cascade of neuroendocrine signals can shape sexually dimorphic behaviors.</description>

	<description>Protein function arises from a poorly understood pattern of energetic interactions between amino acid residues. Sequence-based strategies for deducing this pattern have been proposed, but lack of benchmark data has limited experimental verification. Here, we extend deep-mutation technologies to enable measurement of many thousands of pairwise amino acid couplings in several homologs of a protein family - a deep coupling scan (DCS). The data show that cooperative interactions between residues are loaded in a sparse, evolutionarily conserved, spatially contiguous network of amino acids. The pattern of amino acid coupling is quantitatively captured in the coevolution of amino acid positions, especially as indicated by the statistical coupling analysis (SCA), providing experimental confirmation of the key tenets of this method. This work exposes the collective nature of physical constraints on protein function and clarifies its link with sequence analysis, enabling a general practical approach for understanding the structural basis for protein function.</description>

	<description>Molecular tension sensors have contributed to a growing understanding of mechanobiology. However, the limited dynamic range and inability to specify the mechanical sensitivity of these sensors has hindered their widespread use in diverse contexts. Here, we systematically examine the components of tension sensors that can be altered to improve their functionality. Guided by the development of a first principles model describing the mechanical behavior of these sensors, we create a collection of sensors that exhibit predictable sensitivities and significantly improved performance &lt;i&gt;in cellulo&lt;/i&gt;. Utilized in the context of vinculin mechanobiology, a trio of these new biosensors with distinct force- and extension-sensitivities reveal that an extension-based control paradigm regulates vinculin loading in a variety of mechanical contexts. To enable the rational design of molecular tension sensors appropriate for diverse applications, we predict the mechanical behavior, in terms of force and extension, of additional 1020 distinct designs.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The major β-catenin/E-cadherin junctional binding site is a primary molecular mechano-transductor of differentiation in vivo</title>

	<description>&lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, the primary molecular mechanotransductive events mechanically initiating cell differentiation remain unknown. Here we find the molecular stretching of the highly conserved Y654-β-catenin-D665-E-cadherin binding site as mechanically induced by tissue strain. It triggers the increase of accessibility of the Y654 site, target of the Src42A kinase phosphorylation leading to irreversible unbinding. Molecular dynamics simulations of the β-catenin/E-cadherin complex under a force mimicking a 6 pN physiological mechanical strain predict a local 45% stretching between the two α-helices linked by the site and a 15% increase in accessibility of the phosphorylation site. Both are quantitatively observed using FRET lifetime imaging and non-phospho Y654 specific antibody labelling, in response to the mechanical strains developed by endogenous and magnetically mimicked early mesoderm invagination of gastrulating &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryos. This is followed by the predicted release of 16% of β-catenin from junctions, observed in FRAP, which initiates the mechanical activation of the β-catenin pathway process.</description>

	<description>Hearing loss in mammals is an irreversible process caused by degeneration of the hair cells of the inner ear. Current therapies for hearing loss include hearing aids and cochlear implants that provide substantial benefits to most patients, but also have several shortcomings. There is great interest in the development of regenerative therapies to treat deafness in the future. Cell-based therapies, based either on adult, multipotent stem, or other types of pluripotent cells, offer promise for generating differentiated cell types to replace lost or damaged hair cells of the inner ear.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Simultaneous multi-area recordings suggest a novel hypothesis about how attention improves performance</title>

	<description>Visual attention dramatically improves subjects' ability to see and also modulates the responses of visual and oculomotor neurons. Despite hundreds of studies demonstrating the co-occurrence of behavioral and neuronal effects of attention (Carrasco, 2011), the relationship between neuronal modulations and improved performance remains unknown. There are three dominant hypotheses (Figure 1A): that attention 1) improves visual information coding (Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004; Maunsell, 2015), 2) improves communication between visual and oculomotor brain areas (Fries, 2015), or 3) reduces uncontrolled fluctuations in the animals' cognitive state, thereby improving performance and rendering observed effects of attention on response variability as epiphenomena (Ecker et al., 2016). Here we show that none of these hypotheses account for observed perceptual improvements and we provide evidence for a novel hypothesis: that the well known effects of attention on firing rates and shared response variability in visual cortex reshape the representation of attended stimuli such that they more effectively drive downstream neurons and guide decisions without explicitly changing the weights relating sensory responses to downstream neurons or behavior (Figure 1B). We assessed each hypothesized mechanism by recording simultaneously from groups of neurons in two stages of visuomotor processing: area MT, which encodes motion information (Born and Bradley, 2005) and the superior colliculus (SC), where neuronal responses are either visual, oculomotor, or intermediate (Wurtz and Albano, 1980; Sparks, 1999; Gandhi and Katnani, 2011) and have been hypothesized to be involved in computing perceptual decisions (Horwitz and Newsome, 1999). Constraining our analyses by the animals' behavior and the simultaneous recordings from both areas allowed us to reject each prior hypothesis and greatly clarified the relationship between attention, neuronal responses and behavior. Our results suggest a path toward understanding the neural underpinnings of perception and cognition in health and disease by analyzing neuronal responses in ways that are constrained by behavior and interactions between brain areas.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Subunit exchange enhances information retention by CaMKII in dendritic spines</title>

	<description>Molecular bistables are strong candidates for long-term information storage, for example, in synaptic plasticity. Calcium/calmodulin dependent protein Kinase II (CaMKII) is a highly expressed synaptic protein which has been proposed to form a molecular bistable switch capable of maintaining its state for years despite protein turnover and stochastic noise. It has recently been shown that CaMKII holoenzymes exchange subunits among themselves. Here we used computational methods to analyze the effect of subunit exchange on the CaMKII pathway in the presence of diffusion in two different micro-environments, the Post Synaptic Density (PSD) and spine cytosol. We show that in the PSD, subunit exchange leads to coordinated switching and prolongs state stability of the fraction of CaMKII that is present in clusters; and underlies spreading of activation among the remaining CaMKII that is uniformly distributed. Subunit exchange increases the robustness of the CaMKII switch measured as range of bistability both with respect to protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) levels and protein turnover rates. In the phosphatase rich spine cytosol, subunit exchange leads to slower decay of activity following calcium stimuli. We find that subunit exchange can explain two time courses of CaMKII activity decay observed in recent experiments monitoring endogenous activity of CaMKII in the spine. Overall, CaMKII exhibits multiple timescales of activity in the synapse and subunit exchange enhances the information retention ability of CaMKII by improving the stability of its switching in the PSD, and by slowing the decay of its activity in the spine cytosol. The existence of diverse timescales in the synapse has important theoretical implications for memory storage in networks.</description>

	<description>Understanding the magnitude and structure of inter-neuronal correlations and their relationship to synaptic connectivity structure is an important and difficult problem in computational neuroscience. Early studies show that neuronal network models with excitatory-inhibitory balance naturally create very weak spike train correlations. Later work showed that, under some connectivity structures, balanced networks can produce larger correlations between some neuron pairs, even when the average correlation is very small. All of these previous studies assume that the local neuronal network receives feedforward synaptic input from a population of uncorrelated spike trains. We show that when spike trains providing feedforward input are correlated, the downstream recurrent neuronal network produces much larger correlations. We provide an in-depth analysis of the resulting &quot;correlated state'' in balanced networks and show that, unlike the asynchronous state of previous work, it produces &quot;tight'' excitatory-inhibitory balance, consistent with in vivo cortical recordings.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/372599v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Synchronized oscillations within and between brain areas facilitate normal processing, but are often amplified in disease. A prominent example is the abnormally sustained beta-frequency (~20Hz) oscillations recorded from the cortex and subthalamic nucleus of Parkinson's Disease patients. Computational modelling suggests that the amplitude of such oscillations could be modulated by applying stimulation at a specific phase. Such a strategy would allow selective targeting of the oscillation, with relatively little effect on other activity parameters. Here we demonstrate in awake, parkinsonian patients undergoing functional neurosurgery, that electrical stimulation arriving on consecutive cycles of a specific phase of the subthalamic oscillation can suppress its amplitude and coupling to cortex. Stimulus-evoked changes in spiking did not have a consistent time course, suggesting that the oscillation was modulated independently of net output. Phase-dependent stimulation could thus be a valuable strategy for treating brain diseases and probing the function of oscillations in the healthy brain.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/372508v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>When listening, familiarity with an attended talker's voice improves speech comprehension. Here, we instead investigated the effect of familiarity with a distracting talker. In an irrelevant-speech task, we assessed listeners' working memory for the serial order of spoken digits when a task-irrelevant, distracting sentence was produced by either a familiar or an unfamiliar talker. We tested two groups of listeners using the same experimental procedure. The first group were undergraduate psychology students (N=66) who had attended an introductory statistics course. Critically, each student had been taught by one of two course instructors, whose voices served as familiar and unfamiliar task-irrelevant talkers. The students made more errors when the task-irrelevant sentence was produced by the familiar compared to the unfamiliar talker. There was evidence for the absence of this effect in a second group of listeners; that is, family members and friends (N=20) who had known either one of the two talkers for more than ten years. While familiarity with an attended talker benefits speech comprehension, our findings indicate that familiarity with an ignored talker deteriorates working memory for target speech. The absence of this effect for family members and friends suggests that the degree of talker familiarity modulates distraction by irrelevant speech.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Spatial frequency tuning of perceptual learning and transfer in global motion</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/372458v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Perceptual learning is typically highly specific to the stimuli and task used during training. However, recently it has been shown that training on global motion can transfer to untrained tasks, reflecting the generalising properties of mechanisms at this level of processing. We investigated if a) feedback was required for learning when using an equivalent noise global motion coherence task, and b) the transfer across spatial frequency of training on a global motion coherence task, and the transfer of this training to a measure of contrast sensitivity. For our first experiment two groups, with and without feedback, trained for ten days on a broadband global motion coherence task. Results indicated that feedback was a requirement for learning. For the second experiment training consisted of five days of direction discrimination on one of three global motion tasks (broadband, low or high frequency random-dot Gabors), with trial-by-trial auditory feedback. A pre- and post-training assessment was also conducted, consisting of all three types of global motion stimuli (without feedback) and high and low spatial frequency contrast sensitivity. We predicted that if learning involves low level processing, then based on the frequency specificity of the lower level areas, transfer would be contingent on the frequency of training. However, if learning involves a higher, global level of processing, more selective transfer would occur that matches the broadband tuning of the higher processing levels. Our training paradigm was successful at eliciting improvement in the trained tasks over the five days. However, post-training assessments found learning and transfer exclusively for the group trained on low spatial frequency global motion. This group exhibited increased sensitivity to low spatial frequency contrast, and an improvement for the broadband global motion condition. Our findings are consistent with perceptual learning which depends on the global stage of motion processing in V5.</description>

	<description>Adverse early life events are a well-established risk factor for the precipitation of behavioral disorders characterized by anomalies in the dopaminergic system, such as schizophrenia and addiction. The correlation between early life conditions and the dopaminergic system has been causally investigated in more than 90 rodent publications. Here, we tested the validity of the hypothesis that early life stress (ELS) alters dopamine signaling by performing an extensive 3-level mixed effect meta-analysis. We included several ELS models and biochemical indicators of the dopaminergic system in a variety of brain areas, for a total of 1009 comparisons. Contrary to our expectations, only a few comparisons displayed a significant effect. Specifically, the striatal area was the most vulnerable, displaying decreased dopamine precursor and increased metabolites after ELS. To make all data openly accessible, we created the MaDEapp, a tool to explore data of the meta-analysis with the intent to guide future (pre)clinical research and allow power calculations. All in all, ELS causes limited yet robust changes on biochemical indicators of the dopaminergic system.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Large propulsion demands increase locomotor learning at the expense of step length asymmetry</title>

	<description>There is a clinical interest in increasing the extent of locomotor learning induced by split-belt treadmills that move each leg at different speeds. However, factors facilitating locomotor learning are poorly understood. We hypothesized that augmenting the braking forces, rather than propulsion forces, experienced at the feet would increase locomotor adaptation and learning. To test this, forces were modulated during split-belt walking with distinct slopes: inclined (larger propulsion than braking), declined (larger braking than propulsion), and flat (similar propulsion and braking). These groups were compared using step length asymmetry, which is a clinically relevant measure robustly adapted on split-belt treadmills. Unexpectedly, the group with larger propulsion demands (i.e., the incline group) adapted faster and more, and had larger after-effects when the split-belt perturbation was removed. We also found that subjects who propelled more during baseline and experienced larger disruptions of propulsion forces in early adaptation exhibited greater after-effects, which further highlights the catalytic role of propulsion on locomotor learning. The relevance of mechanical demands on shaping our movements was also indicated by the steady state split-belt behavior, during which each group recovered their baseline leg orientation to meet leg-specific force demands at the expense of step length symmetry. Notably, the flat group was nearly symmetric, whereas the incline and decline group overshot and undershot symmetry, respectively. Taken together, our results indicate that forces propelling the body facilitate gait adaptation during split-belt walking. Therefore, interventions that increase propulsion demands may be a viable strategy for augmenting locomotor learning in individuals with hemiparesis.</description>

	<description>Functional lateralisation is a fundamental principle of the human brain. However, a comprehensive taxonomy of functional lateralisation and its organization in the brain is missing. We report the first complete map of functional hemispheric asymmetries in the human brain, reveal its low dimensional structure, and its relationship with structural inter-hemispheric connectivity. Our results suggest that the lateralisation of brain functions is distributed along four functional axes: symbolic communication, perception/action, emotion, and decision-making, and that cortical regions which show that asymmetries in task-evoked activity have reduced connections with the opposite hemisphere.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Ventromedial prefrontal cortex is not critical for behavior change without external reinforcement</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/372185v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Cue-approach training (CAT) is a novel paradigm that has been shown to induce preference changes towards items without external reinforcements. In the task the mere association of a neutral cue and a speeded button response has been shown to induce a behavioral change lasting months. This paradigm includes several phases whereby after the training of individual items, behavior change is manifested through binary choices of items with similar initial values. Neuroimaging data have implicated the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during the choice phase of this task. However, it still remains unclear what are the underlying neural mechanisms during training. Here, we sought to determine whether the ventromedial frontal cortex (VMF) is critical for the non-reinforced preference change induced by CAT. For this purpose, eleven participants with focal lesions involving the VMF and 30 healthy age-matched controls performed the CAT. We found that at the individual level, a similar proportion of VMF and healthy participants showed a preference shift following CAT. The VMF group performed similarly to the healthy age-matched control group in the ranking and training phases. As a group the healthy age-matched controls exhibited a behavior change, but the VMF participants as a group did not. We did not find an association between individual lesion patterns and performance in the task. We conclude that a fully intact VMF is not critical to induce non-externally reinforced preference change and suggest potential mechanisms for this novel type of behavioral change.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: First- and second-order contributions to depth perception in anti-correlated random dot stereograms</title>

	<description>The binocular energy model of neural responses predicts that depth from binocular disparity might be perceived in the reversed direction when the contrast of dots presented to one eye is reversed. While reversed depth has been found using anti-correlated random-dot stereogram (ACRDS) the findings are inconsistent across studies. The mixed findings may be accounted for by the presence of a gap between the target and surround, or as a result of overlap of dots around the vertical edges of the stimuli. To test this, we assessed whether (1) the gap size (0, 19.2 or 38.4 arc min) (2) the correlation of dots or (3) the border orientation (circular target, or horizontal or vertical edge) affected the perception of depth. Reversed depth from ACRDS (circular no-gap condition) was seen by a minority of participants, but this effect reduced as the gap size increased. Depth was mostly perceived in the correct direction for ACRDS edge stimuli, with the effect increasing with the gap size. The inconsistency across conditions can be accounted for by the relative reliability of first- and second-order depth detection mechanisms, and the coarse spatial resolution of the latter.</description>

	<description>There is extensive evidence that human brain functional organization is dynamic, varying within a subject as the brain switches between tasks demands. This functional organization also varies across subjects, even when they are all engaged in similar tasks. Currently, we lack a comprehensive model that unifies the two dimensions of variation (brain state and subject). Using fMRI data obtained across multiple task-evoked and rest conditions (which we operationally define as brain states) and across multiple subjects, we develop a state- and subject-specific functional network parcellation (the assignment of nodes to networks). Our parcellation approach provides a measure of how node-to-network assignment (NNA) changes across states and across subjects. We demonstrate that the brain's functional networks are not spatially fixed, but reconfigure with brain state. This reconfiguration is robust and reliable to such an extent that it can be used to predict brain state with accuracies up to 97%.</description>

	<description>Scientific efforts to teach humans novel verbal information during sleep have been largely unsuccessful. However, recent findings demonstrate that sleeping humans can learn entirely new non-verbal information in a stage-dependent manner. The brain activity supporting the learning of novel information presented during sleep is still unknown. Here, we aimed to elucidate the brain processes enabling sleep-stage-dependent novel associative learning during sleep. We presented auditory-olfactory conditioning during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep while measuring electrophysiological and behavioural responses during sleep and the subsequent morning. We found that associative learning during sleep modulated learning-related delta and sigma power in NREM sleep. Furthermore, learning-related delta power was associated with learning-related behaviour both during sleep and the subsequent morning, but notably, this delta-behaviour relationship changed between learning during sleep and during retrieval the following morning. Together, these findings suggest that slow waves have a functional role in sleep stage-dependent associative learning in sleep.</description>

	<description>Movement-related theta oscillations in rodent hippocampus coordinate forward sweeps of location-specific neural activity that could be used to evaluate spatial trajectories online. This raises the possibility that increases in human hippocampal theta power accompany the evaluation of upcoming spatial choices. To test this hypothesis, we measured hippocampal oscillations during a spatial planning task that closely resembles a perceptual decision-making paradigm. In this task, female and male participants searched visually for the shortest path between a start and goal location in novel mazes that contained multiple choice points, and were subsequently asked to make a spatial decision at one of those choice points. During the search/planning period, we observed ~3-6 Hz hippocampal theta power increases that were negatively correlated with subsequent decision speed, where decision speed correlated with choice accuracy. Notably, hippocampal theta power increases were preferentially induced by planning in mazes containing a sequence of choices that were initially straightforward and subsequently ambiguous. These results implicate the hippocampal theta rhythm in the searches of deep decision trees, with a particular bottleneck form.</description>

	<description>Attention and salience processing have been linked to the intrinsic between- and within-network dynamics of large scale networks engaged in internal (default mode network, DN) and external attention allocation (dorsal attention, DAN, salience network, SN). The central oxytocin (OXT) system appears ideally organized to modulate widely distributed neural systems and to regulate the switch between internal attention and salient stimuli in the environment. The current randomized placebo (PLC) controlled between-subject pharmacological resting-state fMRI study in N = 187 (OXT, n = 94; n = 93; single-dose intranasal administration) healthy male and female participants employed an independent component analysis (ICA) approach to determine the modulatory effects of OXT on the within- and between-network dynamics of the DAN-SN-DN triple network system. OXT increased the functional integration between subsystems within SN and DN and increased functional segregation of the DN with the SN and DAN engaged in attentional control. Whereas no sex differences were observed, OXT effects on the DN-SN interaction were modulated by autism traits. Together, the findings suggest that OXT may facilitate efficient attentional allocation towards social cues by modulating the intrinsic functional dynamics between DN components engaged in social processing and large-scale networks involved in external attentional demands (SN, DAN).</description>

	<description>The visual system is supposed to extract distance information from the environment in order to scale the size and distance of objects in the visual scene. The purpose of this article is to challenge this account in three stages: First, I identify three shortcomings of the literature on vergence as our primary cue to near distances. Second, I present the results from two experiments that control for these shortcomings, but at the cost of eradicating vergence and accommodation as effective distance cues (average gain of y = 0.161x + 38.64). Third, I argue that if all our cues to distance are either (a) ineffective (vergence; accommodation; motion parallax), (b) merely relative (angular size; diplopia), or (c) merely cognitive (familiar size; vertical disparity), then the visual system does not appear to extract absolute distance information, and we should be open to the possibility that vision functions without scale.</description>

	<description>Because multivariate autoregressive models have failed to adequately account for the complexity of neural signals, researchers have predominantly relied on non-parametric methods when studying the relations between brain and behavior. Using a database of medial temporal lobe (MTL) recordings from 96 neurosurgical patients, we show that time series models with volatility described by a multivariate stochastic latent variable process and lagged interactions between signals in different brain regions provide new insights into the dynamics of brain function. We estimate both the parameters describing the latent variable processes and the directional correlations in volatility between brain regions using Bayesian sampling techniques. The implied volatility inferred from our process positively correlates with high-frequency spectral activity, a signal that correlates with neuronal activity and is widely used to study brain function. We show that volatility features derived from our model can reliably decode good vs. poor memory states, and that this classifier performs as well as those using spectral features. Using the multivariate stochastic volatility model, we uncovered hippocampal-perirhinal bidirectional connections in the MTL regions that are associated with successful memory encoding.</description>

	<description>To date there exists no reliable method to non-invasively upregulate or downregulate the state of the resting motor system over a large dynamic range. Here we show that an operant conditioning paradigm which provides neurofeedback of the size of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), enables participants to self-modulate their own brain state. Following training, participants were able to robustly increase (by 83.8%) and decrease (by 30.6%) their MEP amplitudes. This volitional up- versus downregulation of corticomotor excitability caused an increase of late-cortical disinhibition (LCD), a read-out of presynaptic GABAB disinhibition which was accompanied by an increase of gamma and a decrease of alpha oscillations in the trained hemisphere. This approach paves the way for future investigations into how altered brain state influences motor neurophysiology and recovery of function in a neurorehabilitation context.</description>

	<description>Bilingual individuals automatically translate written words from one language to another. While this process is established in spoken-language bilinguals, there is less known about its occurrence in deaf bilinguals who know signed and spoken languages. Since sign language uses motion and space to convey linguistic content, it is possible that action simulation in the brain's sensorimotor system plays a role in this process. We recorded EEG from deaf participants fluent in ASL as they read individual English words and found significant differences in alpha and beta EEG at central electrode sites during the reading of English words whose ASL translations use two hands, compared to English words whose ASL translations use one hand. Hearing non-signers did not show any differences between conditions. These results demonstrate the involvement of the sensorimotor system in cross-linguistic, cross-modal translation, and suggest that action simulation processes may be key to deaf signers' language concepts.</description>

Perceptual decision-making relies on the gradual accumulation of noisy sensory evidence. It is often assumed that such decisions are degraded by adding noise to a stimulus, or to the neural systems involved in the decision making process itself. But it has been suggested that adding an optimal amount of noise can, under appropriate conditions, enhance the quality of subthreshold signals in nonlinear systems, a phenomenon known as &lt;i&gt;stochastic resonance&lt;/i&gt;. Here we asked whether perceptual decisions made by human observers obey these stochastic resonance principles, by adding noise directly to the visual cortex using transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) while participants judged the direction of coherent motion in random-dot kinematograms presented at the fovea. We found that adding tRNS bilaterally to visual cortex enhanced decision-making when stimuli were just below perceptual threshold, but not when they were well below or above threshold. We modelled the data under a drift diffusion framework, and showed that bilateral tRNS selectively increased the drift rate parameter, which indexes the rate of evidence accumulation. Our study is the first to provide causal evidence that perceptual decision-making is susceptible to a stochastic resonance effect induced by tRNS, and to show that this effect arises from selective enhancement of the rate of evidence accumulation for sub-threshold sensory events.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hJxUrn196_0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Bladder small DRG neurons, which are putative nociceptors pivotal to urinary bladder function, express more than a dozen different ionic membrane mechanisms: ion channels, pumps and exchangers. Small-conductance Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (SK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;) channels which were earlier thought to be gated solely by intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration ([Ca]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) have recently been shown to exhibit inward rectification with respect to membrane potential. The effect of SK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; inward rectification on the excitability of these neurons is unknown. Furthermore, studies on the role of K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channels in repetitive firing and their contributions to different types of afterhyperpolarization (AHP) in these neurons are lacking. In order to study these phenomena, we first constructed and validated a biophysically detailed single compartment model of bladder small DRG soma constrained by physiological data. The model includes twenty-two major known membrane mechanisms along with intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics comprising Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion, cytoplasmic buffering, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial mechanisms. Using modelling studies, we show that inward rectification of SK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; is an important parameter regulating neuronal repetitive firing and that its absence reduces action potential (AP) firing frequency. We also show that SK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; is more potent in reducing AP spiking than the large-conductance K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channel (BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;) in these neurons. Moreover, BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; was found to contribute to the fast AHP (fAHP) and SK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; to the medium-duration (mAHP) and slow AHP (sAHP). We also report that the slow inactivating A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel (slow K&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) current in these neurons is composed of 2 components: an initial fast inactivating (time constant ∼ 25-100 ms) and a slow inactivating (time constant ∼ 200-800 ms) current. We discuss the implications of our findings, and how our detailed model can help further our understanding of the role of C-fibre afferents in the physiology of urinary bladder as well as in certain disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w7djXqEISFc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The mammalian visual system consists of several anatomically distinct areas, layers, and cell types. To understand the role of these subpopulations in visual information processing, we analyzed neural signals recorded from excitatory neurons from various anatomical and functional structures. For each of 186 mice, one of six genetically tagged cell types and one of six visual areas were targeted while the mouse was passively viewing various visual stimuli. We trained linear classifiers to decode one of six visual stimulus categories with distinct spatiotemporal structures from the population neural activity. We found that neurons in both the primary visual cortex and secondary visual areas show varying degrees of stimulus-specific decodability, and neurons in superficial layers tend to be more informative about the stimulus categories. Additional decoding analyses of directional motion were consistent with these findings. We observed synergy in the population code of direction in several visual areas suggesting area-specific organization of information representation across neurons. These differences in decoding capacities shed light on the specialized organization of neural information processing across anatomically distinct subpopulations, and further establish the mouse as a model for understanding visual perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Addiction is characterized by a profound intersubject (phenotypic) variability in the expression of addictive symptomatology and propensity to relapse following treatment. However, laboratory investigations have primarily focused on common neural substrates in addiction and have not yet been able to identify mechanisms that can account for the multifaceted phenotypic behaviors reported in the literature. To fill this knowledge gap theoretically, here we simulated phenotypic variations in addiction symptomology and responses to putative treatments, using both a neural model, based on cortico-striatal circuit dynamics, and an algorithmic model of reinforcement learning (RL). These simulations rely on the widely accepted assumption that both the ventral, model-based, goal-directed system and the dorsal, model-free, habitual system are vulnerable to extra-physiologic dopamine reinforcements triggered by addictive rewards. We found that endophenotypic differences in the balance between the two circuit or control systems resulted in an inverted-U shape in optimal choice behavior. Specifically, greater unbalance led to a higher likelihood of developing addiction and more severe drug-taking behaviors. Furthermore, endophenotypes with opposite asymmetrical biases among cortico-striatal circuits expressed similar addiction behaviors, but responded differently to simulated treatments, suggesting personalized treatment development could rely on endophenotypic rather than phenotypic differentiations. We propose our simulated results, confirmed across neural and algorithmic levels of analysis, inform on a fundamental and, to date, neglected quantitative method to characterize clinical heterogeneity in addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A relatively new analysis technique, known as neural decoding or multivariate pattern analysis, has become increasingly popular for cognitive neuroimaging studies over recent years. These techniques promise to uncover the representational contents of neural signals, as well as the underlying code and the dynamic profile thereof. A field in which these techniques have led to novel insights in particular is that of visual working memory (VWM). In the present study we subjected human volunteers to a combined VWM/imagery task while recording their neural signals using MEG. We applied multivariate decoding analyses to uncover the temporal profile underlying the neural representations of the memorized item. Analysis of gaze position however revealed that our results were contaminated by systematic eye movements, suggesting that the MEG decoding results from our originally planned analyses were confounded. In addition to the eye movement analyses, we also present the original analyses to highlight how these might have readily led to invalid conclusions. Finally, we demonstrate a potential remedy, whereby we train the decoders on a functional localizer that was specifically designed to target bottom-up sensory signals and as such avoids eye movements. We conclude by arguing for more awareness of the potentially pervasive and ubiquitous effects of eye movement-related confounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Neural decoding is an important and relatively novel technique that has opened up new avenues for cognitive neuroscience research. However, with its promises also come potential caveats. In this study we show that neural decoding may be susceptible to confounds induced by small task- and stimulus-specific eye movements in the context of a visual working memory task. Such eye movements during working memory tasks have been reported before, and may in fact be a common phenomenon. Given the widespread use of neural decoding and the potentially contaminating effects of eye movements, we therefore believe that our results are of significant relevance for the field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of nicotine dependence is higher than that for any other substance abuse disorder; still, the underlying mechanisms are not fully established. To this end, we studied acute effects by nicotine on neurotransmission in the dorsolateral striatum, a key brain region with respect to the formation of habits. Electrophysiological recordings in acutely isolated brain slices from rodent showed that nicotine (10 nm to 10 μm) produced an LTD of evoked field potentials. Current-clamp recordings revealed no significant effect by nicotine on membrane voltage or action potential frequency, indicating that the effect by nicotine is primarily synaptic. Nicotine did not modulate sIPSCs, or the connectivity between fast-spiking interneurons and medium spiny neurons, as assessed by whole-cell recordings combined with optogenetics. However, the frequency of sEPSCs was significantly depressed by nicotine. The effect by nicotine was mimicked by agonists targeting α7- or α4-containing nAChRs and blocked in slices pretreated with a mixture of antagonists targeting these receptor subtypes. Nicotine-induced LTD was furthermore inhibited by dopamine D2 receptor antagonist and occluded by D2 receptor agonist. In addition, modulation of cholinergic neurotransmission suppressed the responding to nicotine, which might reflect upon the postulated role for nAChRs as a presynaptic filter to differentially govern dopamine release depending on neuronal activity. Nicotine-induced suppression of excitatory inputs onto medium spiny neurons may promote nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation and putatively initiate neuroadaptations that could contribute to the transition toward compulsive drug taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To decrease smoking, prevalence factors that may contribute to the development of nicotine addiction need to be identified. The data presented here show that nicotine suppresses striatal neurotransmission by selectively reducing the frequency of excitatory inputs to medium spiny neurons (MSNs) while rendering excitability, inhibitory neurotransmission, and fast-spiking interneuron-MSN connectivity unaltered. In addition, we show that the effect displayed by nicotine outlasts the presence of the drug, which could be fundamental for the addictive properties of nicotine. Considering the inhibitory tone displayed by MSNs on dopaminergic cell bodies and local terminals, nicotine-induced long-lasting depression of striatal output could play a role in behavioral transformations associated with nicotine use, and putatively elicit neuroadaptations underlying compulsive drug-seeking habits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the nervous system, myelination of axons enables rapid impulse conduction and is a specialized function of glial cells. Myelinating glia are the last cell type to emerge in the evolution of vertebrate nervous systems, presumably in ancient jawed vertebrates (gnathostomata) because jawless vertebrates (agnathans) lack myelin. We have hypothesized that, in these unmyelinated species, evolutionary progenitors of myelinating cells must have existed that should still be present in contemporary agnathan species. Here, we used advanced electron microscopic techniques to reveal axon–glia interactions in the sea lamprey &lt;i&gt;Petromyzon marinus&lt;/i&gt;. By quantitative assessment of the spinal cord and the peripheral lateral line nerve, we observed a marked maturation-dependent growth of axonal calibers. In peripheral nerves, all axons are ensheathed by glial cells either in bundles or, when larger than the threshold caliber of 3 μm, individually. The ensheathing glia are covered by a basal lamina and express &lt;i&gt;SoxE&lt;/i&gt;-transcription factors, features of mammalian Remak-type Schwann cells. In larval lamprey, the ensheathment of peripheral axons leaves gaps that are closed in adults. CNS axons are also covered to a considerable extent by glial processes, which contain a high density of intermediate filaments, glycogen particles, large lipid droplets, and desmosomes, similar to mammalian astrocytes. Indeed, by &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, these glial cells express the astrocyte marker &lt;i&gt;Aldh1l1&lt;/i&gt;. Specimens were of unknown sex. Our observations imply that radial sorting, ensheathment, and presumably also metabolic support of axons are ancient functions of glial cells that predate the evolutionary emergence of myelin in jawed vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We used current electron microscopy techniques to examine axon–glia units in a nonmyelinated vertebrate species, the sea lamprey. In the PNS, lamprey axons are fully ensheathed either individually or in bundles by cells ortholog to Schwann cells. In the CNS, axons associate with astrocyte orthologs, which contain glycogen and lipid droplets. We suggest that ensheathment, radial sorting, and metabolic support of axons by glial cells predate the evolutionary emergence of myelin in ancient jawed vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: lncRNA TNXA-PS1 Modulates Schwann Cells by Functioning As a Competing Endogenous RNA Following Nerve Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As the major glia in PNS, Schwann cells play a critical role in peripheral nerve injury repair. Finding an efficient approach to promote Schwann cell activation might facilitate peripheral nerve repair. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to regulate gene expression and take part in many biological processes. However, the role of lncRNAs in peripheral nerve regeneration is not fully understood. In this study, we obtained a global lncRNA portrayal following sciatic nerve injury in male rats using microarray and further investigated one of these dys-regulated lncRNAs, TNXA-PS1, confirming its vital role in regulating Schwann cells. Silencing TNAX-PS1 could promote Schwann cell migration and mechanism analyses showed that TNXA-PS1 might exert its regulatory role by sponging miR-24–3p/miR-152–3p and affecting dual specificity phosphatase 1 (Dusp1) expression. Systematic lncRNA expression profiling of sciatic nerve segments following nerve injury in rats suggested lncRNA TNXA-PS1 as a key regulator of Schwann cell migration, providing a potential therapeutic target for nerve injury repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The PNS has an intrinsic regeneration capacity after injury in which Schwann cells play a crucial role. Therefore, further exploration of functional molecules in the Schwann cell phenotype modulation is of great importance. We have identified a set of dys-regulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in rats following sciatic nerve injury and found that the expression of TNXA-PS1 was significantly downregulated. Mechanically analyses showed that TNXA-PS1 might act as a competing endogenous RNA to affect dual specificity phosphatase 1 (Dusp1) expression, regulating migration of Schwann cells. This study provides for the first time a global landscape of lncRNAs following sciatic nerve injury in rats and broadens the known functions of lncRNA during nerve injury. The investigation of TNXA-PS1 might facilitate the development of novel targets for nerve injury therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Populations of Motor Thalamic Neurons Encode Action Initiation, Action Selection, and Movement Vigor</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6563?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motor thalamus (Mthal) comprises the ventral anterior, ventral lateral, and ventral medial thalamic nuclei in rodents. This subcortical hub receives input from the basal ganglia (BG), cerebellum, and reticular thalamus in addition to connecting reciprocally with motor cortical regions. Despite the central location of Mthal, the mechanisms by which it influences movement remain unclear. To determine its role in generating ballistic, goal-directed movement, we recorded single-unit Mthal activity as male rats performed a two-alternative forced-choice task. A large population of Mthal neurons increased their firing briefly near movement initiation and could be segregated into functional groups based on their behavioral correlates. The activity of &quot;initiation&quot; units was more tightly locked to instructional cues than movement onset, did not predict which direction the rat would move, and was anticorrelated with reaction time (RT). Conversely, the activity of &quot;execution&quot; units was more tightly locked to movement onset than instructional cues, predicted which direction the rat would move, and was anticorrelated with both RT and movement time. These results suggest that Mthal influences choice RT performance in two stages: short latency, nonspecific action initiation followed by action selection/invigoration. We discuss the implications of these results for models of motor control incorporating BG and cerebellar circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Motor thalamus (Mthal) is a central node linking subcortical and cortical motor circuits, though its precise role in motor control is unclear. Here, we define distinct populations of Mthal neurons that either encode movement initiation, or both action selection and movement vigor. These results have important implications for understanding how basal ganglia, cerebellar, and motor cortical signals are integrated. Such an understanding is critical to defining the pathophysiology of a range of BG- and cerebellum-linked movement disorders, as well as refining pharmacologic and neuromodulatory approaches to their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dysregulation of NAD+ Metabolism Induces a Schwann Cell Dedifferentiation Program</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6546?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Schwann cell (SC) is the major component of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) that provides metabolic and functional support for peripheral axons. The emerging roles of SC mitochondrial function for PNS development and axonal stability indicate the importance of SC metabolism in nerve function and in peripheral neuropathies associated with metabolic disorders. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is a crucial molecule in the regulation of cellular metabolism and redox homeostasis. Here, we investigated the roles of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; metabolism in SC functions &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by mutating NAMPT, the rate-limiting enzyme of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; biosynthesis, specifically in SCs. NAMPT SC knock-out male and female mice (NAMPT SCKO mice) had delayed SC maturation in development and developed hypomyelinating peripheral neuropathy without axon degeneration or decreased SC survival. JUN, a master regulator of SC dedifferentiation, is elevated in NAMPT SCKO SCs, suggesting that decreased NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels cause them to arrest at an immature stage. Nicotinic acid administration rescues the NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decline and reverses the SC maturation defect and the development of peripheral neuropathy, indicating the central role of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in PNS development. Upon nicotinic acid withdrawal in adulthood, NAMPT SCKO mice showed rapid and severe peripheral neuropathy and activation of ERK/MEK/JUN signaling, which in turn promotes SC dedifferentiation. These data demonstrate the importance of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; metabolism in SC maturation and nerve development and maintenance and suggest that altered SC NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; metabolism could underlie neuropathies associated with diabetes and aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we showed that Schwann cell differentiation status is critically dependent on NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis. Aberrant regulation of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; biosynthesis via NAMPT deletion results in a blockade of Schwann cell maturation during development and severe peripheral neuropathy without significant axon loss. The phenotype can be rescued by supplementation with nicotinic acid; however, withdrawal of nicotinic acid leads to Schwann cell dedifferentiation, myelination defects, and death. These results provide new therapeutic possibilities for peripheral neuropathies associated with NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decline during aging or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Acute Complement Inhibition Potentiates Neurorehabilitation and Enhances tPA-Mediated Neuroprotection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6527?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Because complement activation in the subacute or chronic phase after stroke was recently shown to stimulate neural plasticity, we investigated how complement activation and complement inhibition in the acute phase after murine stroke interacts with subsequent rehabilitation therapy to modulate neuroinflammation and neural remodeling. We additionally investigated how complement and complement inhibition interacts with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the other standard of care therapy for stroke, and a U.S. Food and Drug Administration preclinical requirement for translation of an experimental stroke therapy. CR2fH, an injury site-targeted inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway, significantly reduced infarct volume, hemorrhagic transformation, and mortality and significantly improved long-term motor and cognitive performance when administered 1.5 or 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion. CR2fH interrupted a poststroke inflammatory process and significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine release, microglial activation, and astrocytosis. Rehabilitation alone showed mild anti-inflammatory effects, including reduced complement activation, but only improved cognitive recovery. CR2fH combined with rehabilitation significantly potentiated cognitive and motor recovery compared with either intervention alone and was associated with higher growth factor release and enhanced rehabilitation-induced neuroblast migration and axonal remodeling. Similar outcomes were seen in adult, aged, and female mice. Using a microembolic model, CR2fH administered in combination with acute tPA therapy improved overall survival and enhanced the neuroprotective effects of tPA, extending the treatment window for tPA therapy. A human counterpart of CR2fH has been shown to be safe and nonimmunogenic in humans and we have demonstrated robust deposition of C3d, the CR2fH targeting epitope, in ischemic human brains after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Complement inhibition is a potential therapeutic approach for stroke, but it is not known how complement inhibition would interact with current standards of care. We show that, after murine ischemic stroke, rehabilitation alone induced mild anti-inflammatory effects and improved cognitive, but not motor recovery. However, brain-targeted and specific inhibition of the alternative complement pathway, when combined with rehabilitation, significantly potentiated cognitive and motor recovery compared with either intervention alone via mechanisms involving neuroregeneration and enhanced brain remodeling. Further, inhibiting the alternative pathway of complement significantly enhanced the neuroprotective effects of thrombolytic therapy and markedly expanded the therapeutic window for thrombolytic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Constitutive and Synaptic Activation of GIRK Channels Differentiates Mature and Newborn Dentate Granule Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6513?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6513?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sparse neural activity in the dentate gyrus is enforced by powerful networks of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons in combination with low intrinsic excitability of the principal neurons, the dentate granule cells (GCs). Although the cellular and circuit properties that dictate synaptic inhibition are well studied, less is known about mechanisms that confer low GC intrinsic excitability. Here we demonstrate that intact G protein-mediated signaling contributes to the characteristic low resting membrane potential that differentiates mature dentate GCs from CA1 pyramidal cells and developing adult-born GCs. In mature GCs from male and female mice, intact G protein signaling robustly reduces intrinsic excitability, whereas deletion of G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel 2 (GIRK2) increases excitability and blocks the effects of G protein signaling on intrinsic properties. Similarly, pharmacological manipulation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) or GIRK channels alters intrinsic excitability and GC spiking behavior. However, adult-born new GCs lack functional GIRK activity, with phasic and constitutive GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R-mediated GIRK signaling appearing after several weeks of maturation. Phasic activation is interneuron specific, arising primarily from nNOS-expressing interneurons rather than parvalbumin- or somatostatin-expressing interneurons. Together, these results demonstrate that G protein signaling contributes to the intrinsic excitability that differentiates mature and developing dentate GCs and further suggest that late maturation of GIRK channel activity is poised to convert early developmental functions of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor signaling into GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R-mediated inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The dentate gyrus exhibits sparse neural activity that is essential for the computational function of pattern separation. Sparse activity is ascribed to strong local inhibitory circuits in combination with low intrinsic excitability of the principal neurons, the granule cells. Here we show that constitutive activity of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs) underlies to the hallmark low resting membrane potential and input resistance of mature dentate neurons. Adult-born neurons initially lack functional GIRK channels, with constitutive and phasic GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated GIRK inhibition developing in tandem after several weeks of maturation. Our results reveal that GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;/GIRK activity is an important determinant of low excitability of mature dentate granule cells that may contribute to sparse DG activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Stimulation of the Prefrontal Cortex Reduces Intentions to Commit Aggression: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Stratified, Parallel-Group Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6505?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6505?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although prefrontal brain impairments are one of the best-replicated brain imaging findings in relation to aggression, little is known about the causal role of this brain region. This study tests whether stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) reduces the likelihood of engaging in aggressive acts, and the mechanism underlying this relationship. In a double-blind, stratified, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized trial, 81 human adults (36 males, 45 females) were randomly assigned to an active (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 39) or placebo (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 42) condition, and then followed up 1 d after the experiment session. Intentions to commit aggressive acts and behavioral aggression were assessed using hypothetical vignettes and a behavioral task, respectively. The secondary outcome was the perception of the moral wrongfulness of the aggressive acts. Compared with the sham controls, participants who received anodal stimulation reported being less likely to commit physical and sexual assault (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). They also judged aggressive acts as more morally wrong (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Perceptions of greater moral wrongfulness regarding the aggressive acts accounted for 31% of the total effect of tDCS on intentions to commit aggression. Results provide experimental evidence that increasing activity in the prefrontal cortex can reduce intentions to commit aggression and enhance perceptions of the moral wrongfulness of the aggressive acts. Findings shed light on the biological underpinnings of aggression and theoretically have the potential to inform future interventions for aggression and violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Aggressive behaviors pose significant public health risks. Understanding the etiology of aggression is paramount to violence reduction. Investigations of the neural basis of aggression have largely supported correlational, rather than causal, interpretations, and the mediating processes underlying the prefrontal–aggression relationship remain to be well elucidated. Through a double-blind, stratified, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized trial, this study tested whether upregulation of the prefrontal cortex reduces the likelihood of engaging in aggression. Results provide experimental evidence that increasing prefrontal cortical activity can reduce intent to commit aggressive acts. They also shed light on moral judgment as one mechanism that may link prefrontal deficits to aggression and, in theory, have the potential to inform future approaches toward reducing aggression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Oligodendroglia Are Particularly Vulnerable to Oxidative Damage after Neurotrauma In Vivo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6491?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Loss of function following injury to the CNS is worsened by secondary degeneration of neurons and glia surrounding the injury and is initiated by oxidative damage. However, it is not yet known which cellular populations and structures are most vulnerable to oxidative damage &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Using Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS), oxidative damage was semiquantified within cellular subpopulations and structures of optic nerve vulnerable to secondary degeneration, following a partial transection of the optic nerve in adult female PVG rats. Simultaneous assessment of cellular subpopulations and structures revealed oligodendroglia as the most vulnerable to DNA oxidation following injury. 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) was used to label cells that proliferated in the first 3 d after injury. Injury led to increases in DNA, protein, and lipid damage in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and mature oligodendrocytes at 3 d, regardless of proliferative state, associated with a decline in the numbers of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells at 7 d. O4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; preoligodendrocytes also exhibited increased lipid peroxidation. Interestingly, EdU&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mature oligodendrocytes derived after injury demonstrated increased early susceptibility to DNA damage and lipid peroxidation. However, EdU&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; mature oligodendrocytes with high 8-hydroxyguanosine immunoreactivity were more likely to be caspase3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. By day 28, newly derived mature oligodendrocytes had significantly reduced myelin regulatory factor gene mRNA, indicating that the myelination potential of these cells may be reduced. The proportion of caspase3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; oligodendrocytes remained higher in EdU&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; cells. Innovative use of NanoSIMS together with traditional immunohistochemistry and &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization have enabled the first demonstration of subpopulation specific oligodendroglial vulnerability to oxidative damage, due to secondary degeneration &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Injury to the CNS is characterized by oxidative damage in areas adjacent to the injury. However, the cellular subpopulations and structures most vulnerable to this damage remain to be elucidated. Here we use powerful NanoSIMS techniques to show increased oxidative damage in oligodendroglia and axons and to demonstrate that cells early in the oligodendroglial lineage are the most vulnerable to DNA oxidation. Further immunohistochemical and &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization investigation reveals that mature oligodendrocytes derived after injury are more vulnerable to oxidative damage than their counterparts existing at the time of injury and have reduced myelin regulatory factor gene mRNA, yet preexisting oligodendrocytes are more likely to die.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cellular Effects of Repetition Priming in the Aplysia Feeding Network Are Suppressed during a Task-Switch But Persist and Facilitate a Return to the Primed State</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6475?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6475?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many neural networks are multitasking and receive modulatory input, which configures activity. As a result, these networks can enter a relatively persistent state in which they are biased to generate one type of output as opposed to another. A question we address is as follows: what happens to this type of state when the network is forced to task-switch? We address this question in the feeding system of the mollusc &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;. This network generates ingestive and egestive motor programs. We focus on an identified neuron that is selectively active when programs are ingestive. Previous work has established that the increase in firing frequency observed during ingestive programs is at least partially mediated by an excitability increase. Here we identify the underlying cellular mechanism as the induction of a cAMP-dependent inward current. We ask how this current is impacted by the subsequent induction of egestive activity. Interestingly, we demonstrate that this task-switch does not eliminate the inward current but instead activates an outward current. The induction of the outward current obviously reduces the net inward current in the cell. This produces the decrease in excitability and firing frequency required for the task-switch. Importantly, however, the persistence of the inward current is not impacted. It remains present and coexists with the outward current. Consequently, when effects of egestive priming and the outward current dissipate, firing frequency and excitability remain above baseline levels. This presumably has important functional implications in that it will facilitate a return to ingestive activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Under physiological conditions, an animal generating a particular type of motor activity can be forced to at least briefly task-switch. In some circumstances, this involves the temporary induction of an &quot;antagonistic&quot; or incompatible motor program. For example, ingestion can be interrupted by a brief period of egestive activity. In this type of situation, it is often desirable for behavioral switching to occur rapidly and efficiently. In this report, we focus on a particular aspect of this type of task-switch. We determine how the priming that occurs when a multitasking network repeatedly generates one type of motor activity can be retained during the execution of an incompatible motor program.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Pain-Related Expectation and Prediction Error Signals in the Anterior Insula Are Not Related to Aversiveness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6461?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The anterior insula has repeatedly been linked to the experience of aversive stimuli, such as pain. Previously, we showed that the anterior insula is involved in the integration of pain intensity and its prior expectation. However, it is unclear whether this integration occurs by a pain-specific expectation or a more general expectation of an aversive event. To dissociate these possibilities, we conducted an experiment using painful stimuli and aversive pictures with three levels of aversiveness on human male volunteers. Stimuli were preceded by a probabilistic, combined modality and intensity cue in a full factorial design. Subjective ratings of pain intensity and skin conductance responses were best explained by a combination of actual pain intensity and expected pain intensity. In addition, using fMRI, we investigated the neuronal implementation of the integration of prior expectation and pain intensity. Similar to subjective ratings and autonomic responses, the dorsal anterior insula represented pain intensity and expectations. The ventral anterior insula additionally represented the absolute difference of the two terms (i.e., the prediction error). The posterior insula only represented pain intensity. Importantly, the pattern observed in the anterior insula was only present if the cued modality was correct (i.e., expect pain); in case of an incorrect modality cue (i.e., expect aversive picture), the ventral anterior insula simply represented pain intensity. The stimulus expectation and prediction error specificity in the ventral anterior insula indicates the integration of expectation with painful stimuli in this area. Importantly, this pattern cannot be explained by aversiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The anterior insula has been shown to integrate pain intensity and their expectation. However, it is unclear whether this integration is pain-specific or related more generally to an aversive event. To address this, we combined painful stimuli and aversive pictures with three levels of aversiveness. The ventral anterior insula represented pain intensity, expectation, and their absolute difference (i.e., the prediction error). Importantly, this pattern was only observed if the cued modality was correct. In case of an incorrect modality cue, this area simply represented as pain intensity. The stimulus expectation and prediction error specificity in the ventral anterior insula indicates the integration of expectation with painful stimuli in this area. Importantly, this pattern cannot be explained by aversiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A global loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP; encoded by the Fmr1 gene) leads to sensory dysfunction and intellectual disabilities. One underlying mechanism of these phenotypes is structural and functional deficits in synapses. Here, we determined the autonomous function of postsynaptic FMRP in circuit formation, synaptogenesis, and synaptic maturation. In normal cochlea nucleus, presynaptic auditory axons form large axosomatic endbulb synapses on cell bodies of postsynaptic bushy neurons. I&lt;i&gt;n ovo&lt;/i&gt; electroporation of drug-inducible Fmr1-shRNA constructs produced a mosaicism of FMRP expression in chicken (either sex) bushy neurons, leading to reduced FMRP levels in transfected, but not neighboring nontransfected, neurons. Structural analyses revealed that postsynaptic FMRP reduction led to smaller size and abnormal morphology of individual presynaptic endbulbs at both early and later developmental stages. We further examined whether FMRP reduction affects dendritic development, as a potential mechanism underlying defective endbulb formation. Normally, chicken bushy neurons grow extensive dendrites at early stages and retract these dendrites when endbulbs begin to form. Neurons transfected with Fmr1 shRNA exhibited a remarkable delay in branch retraction, failing to provide necessary somatic surface for timely formation and growth of large endbulbs. Patch-clamp recording verified functional consequences of dendritic and synaptic deficits on neurotransmission, showing smaller amplitudes and slower kinetics of spontaneous and evoked EPSCs. Together, these data demonstrate that proper levels of postsynaptic FMRP are required for timely maturation of somatodendritic morphology, a delay of which may affect synaptogenesis and thus contribute to long-lasting deficits of excitatory synapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) regulates a large variety of neuronal activities. A global loss of FMRP affects neural circuit development and synaptic function, leading to fragile X syndrome (FXS). Using temporally and spatially controlled genetic manipulations, this study provides the first &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; report that autonomous FMRP regulates multiple stages of dendritic development, and that selective reduction of postsynaptic FMRP leads to abnormal development of excitatory presynaptic terminals and compromised neurotransmission. These observations demonstrate secondary influence of developmentally transient deficits in neuronal morphology and connectivity to the development of long-lasting synaptic pathology in FXS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The BRAIN Initiative arose from a grand challenge to &quot;accelerate the development and application of new technologies that will enable researchers to produce dynamic pictures of the brain that show how individual brain cells and complex neural circuits interact at the speed of thought.&quot; The BRAIN Initiative is a public-private effort focused on the development and use of powerful tools for acquiring fundamental insights about how information processing occurs in the central nervous system (CNS). As the Initiative enters its fifth year, NIH has supported &amp;gt;500 principal investigators, who have answered the Initiative's challenge via hundreds of publications describing novel tools, methods, and discoveries that address the Initiative's seven scientific priorities. We describe scientific advances produced by individual laboratories, multi-investigator teams, and entire consortia that, over the coming decades, will produce more comprehensive and dynamic maps of the brain, deepen our understanding of how circuit activity can produce a rich tapestry of behaviors, and lay the foundation for understanding how its circuitry is disrupted in brain disorders. Much more work remains to bring this vision to fruition, and the National Institutes of Health continues to look to the diverse scientific community, from mathematics, to physics, chemistry, engineering, neuroethics, and neuroscience, to ensure that the greatest scientific benefit arises from this unique research Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Dynamic reshaping of functional brain networks during visual object recognition. (arXiv:1807.06398v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence shows that the modular organization of the human brain
allows for better and efficient cognitive performance. Many of these cognitive
functions are very fast and occur in subsecond time scale such as the visual
object recognition. Here, we investigate brain network modularity while
controlling stimuli meaningfulness and measuring participant reaction time. We
particularly raised two questions: i) does the dynamic brain network modularity
change during the recognition of meaningful and meaningless visual images? And
ii) is there a correlation between network modularity and the reaction time of
participants? To tackle these issues, we collected dense electroencephalography
(EEG, 256 channels) data from 20 healthy human subjects performing a cognitive
task consisting of naming meaningful (tools, animals) and meaningless
(scrambled) images. Functional brain networks in both categories were estimated
at subsecond time scale using the EEG source connectivity method. By using
multislice modularity algorithms, we tracked the reconfiguration of functional
networks during the recognition of both meaningful and meaningless images.
Results showed a difference in the module characteristics of both conditions in
term of integration (interactions between modules) and occurrence (probability
on average of any two brain regions to fall in the same module during the
task). Integration and occurrence were greater for meaningless than for
meaningful images. Our findings revealed also that the occurrence within the
right frontal regions and the left occipito-temporal can help to predict the
ability of the brain to rapidly recognize and name visual stimuli. We speculate
that these observations are applicable not only to other fast cognitive
functions but also to detect fast disconnections that can occur in some brain
disorders.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Penalized matrix decomposition for denoising, compression, and improved demixing of functional imaging data. (arXiv:1807.06203v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging has revolutionized systems neuroscience, providing the
ability to image large neural populations with single-cell resolution. The
resulting datasets are quite large, which has presented a barrier to routine
open sharing of this data, slowing progress in reproducible research. State of
the art methods for analyzing this data are based on non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF); these approaches solve a non-convex optimization problem,
and are effective when good initializations are available, but can break down
in low-SNR settings where common initialization approaches fail. Here we
introduce an approach to compressing and denoising functional imaging data. The
method is based on a spatially-localized penalized matrix decomposition (PMD)
of the data to separate (low-dimensional) signal from (temporally-uncorrelated)
noise. This approach can be applied in parallel on local spatial patches and is
therefore highly scalable, does not impose non-negativity constraints or
require stringent identifiability assumptions (leading to significantly more
robust results compared to NMF), and estimates all parameters directly from the
data, so no hand-tuning is required. We have applied the method to a wide range
of functional imaging data (including one-photon, two-photon, three-photon,
widefield, somatic, axonal, dendritic, calcium, and voltage imaging datasets):
in all cases, we observe ~2-4x increases in SNR and compression rates of
20-300x with minimal visible loss of signal, with no adjustment of
hyperparameters; this in turn facilitates the process of demixing the observed
activity into contributions from individual neurons. We focus on two
challenging applications: dendritic calcium imaging data and voltage imaging
data in the context of optogenetic stimulation. In both cases, we show that our
new approach leads to faster and much more robust extraction of activity from
the data.

	<description>Accumulating evidence indicates that the lysosomal Ragulator complex is essential for full activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Abnormal mTORC1 activation has been implicated in several developmental neurological disorders, including Angelman syndrome (AS), which is caused by maternal deficiency of the ubiquitin E3 ligase UBE3A. Here we report that Ube3a regulates mTORC1 signaling by targeting p18, a subunit of the Ragulator. Ube3a ubiquinates p18, resulting in its proteasomal degradation, and Ube3a deficiency in the hippocampus of AS mice induces increased lysosomal localization of p18 and other members of the Ragulator-Rag complex, and increased mTORC1 activity. P18 knockdown in hippocampal CA1 neurons of AS mice reduces elevated mTORC1 activity and improves dendritic spine maturation, long-term potentiation (LTP), as well as learning performance. Our results indicate that Ube3a-mediated regulation of p18 and subsequent mTORC1 signaling is critical for typical synaptic plasticity, dendritic spine development, and learning and memory.</description>

	<description>Human vestibular sensory epithelia in explant culture were incubated in gentamicin to ablate hair cells. Subsequent transduction of supporting cells with &lt;i&gt;ATOH1&lt;/i&gt; using an Ad-2 viral vector resulted in generation of highly significant numbers of cells expressing the hair cell marker protein myosin VIIa. Cells expressing myosin VIIa were also generated after blocking the Notch signalling pathway with TAPI-1 but less efficiently. Transcriptomic analysis following &lt;i&gt;ATOH1&lt;/i&gt; transduction confirmed up-regulation of 335 putative hair cell marker genes, including several downstream targets of &lt;i&gt;ATOH1&lt;/i&gt;. Morphological analysis revealed numerous cells bearing dense clusters of microvilli at the apical surfaces which showed some hair cell-like characteristics confirming a degree of conversion of supporting cells. However, no cells bore organised hair bundles and several expected hair cell markers genes were not expressed suggesting incomplete differentiation. Nevertheless, the results show a potential to induce conversion of supporting cells in the vestibular sensory tissues of humans.</description>

	<description>The heterochromatin spreading reaction is a central contributor to the formation of gene-repressive structures, which are re-established with high positional precision, or fidelity, following replication. How the spreading reaction contributes to this fidelity is not clear. To resolve the origins of stable inheritance of repression, we probed the intrinsic character of spreading events in fission yeast using a system that quantitatively describes the spreading reaction in live single cells. We show that spreading triggered by noncoding RNA-nucleated elements is stochastic, multimodal, and fluctuates dynamically across time. This lack of stability correlates with high histone turnover. At the mating type locus, this unstable behavior is restrained by an accessory &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;acting element &lt;i&gt;REIII&lt;/i&gt;, which represses histone turnover. Further, &lt;i&gt;REIII &lt;/i&gt;safeguards epigenetic memory against environmental perturbations. Our results suggest that the most prevalent type of spreading, driven by noncoding RNA-nucleators, is epigenetically unstable and requires collaboration with accessory elements to achieve high fidelity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Efficient propagation of misfolded tau between individual neurons occurs in absence of degeneration</title>

	<description>In Alzheimer's disease, misfolded tau protein propagates through the brain in a prion-like manner along connected circuits. Tauopathy correlates with significant neuronal death, but the links between tau aggregation, propagation, neuronal dysfunction and death remain poorly understood, and the direct functional consequences for the neuron containing the tau aggregates are unclear. Here, by monitoring individual neurons within a minimal circuit, we demonstrate that misfolded tau efficiently spreads from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons. Within postsynaptic cells, tau aggregates initially in distal axons, while proximal axons remain free of tau pathology. In the presence of tau aggregates neurons display axonal transport deficits, but remain viable and electrically competent. This shows that misfolded tau species are not immediately toxic to neurons, and suggests that propagation of misfolded tau is an early event in disease, occurring prior to neuronal dysfunction and cell death.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A quantitative physical model of the TMS-induced discharge artifacts in EEG</title>

The combination of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) with Electroencephalography (EEG) exposes the brain’s global response to localized and abrupt stimulations. However, large electric artifacts are induced in the EEG by the TMS, obscuring crucial stages of the brain’s response. Artifact removal is commonly performed by data processing techniques. However, an experimentally verified physical model for the origin and structure of the TMS-induced discharge artifacts, by which these methods can be justified or evaluated, is still lacking. We re-examine the known contribution of the skin in creating the artifacts, and outline a detailed model for the relaxation of the charge accumulated at the electrode-gel-skin interface due to the TMS pulse. We then experimentally validate implications set forth by the model. We find that the artifacts decay like a power law in time rather than the commonly assumed exponential. In fact, the skin creates a power-law decay of order 1 at each electrode, which is turned into a power law of order 2 by the reference electrode. We suggest an artifact removal method based on the model which can be applied from times after the pulse as short as 2 milliseconds onwards to expose the full EEG from the brain. The method can separate the capacitive discharge artifacts from those resulting from cranial muscle activation, demonstrating that the capacitive effect dominates at short times. Overall, our insight into the physical process allows us to accurately access TMS-evoked EEG responses that directly follow the TMS pulse, possibly opening new opportunities in TMS-EEG research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EXQCGpRf8hI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Two Sides of the Same Coin: Distinct Sub-Bands in the Alpha Rhythm Reflect Facilitation and Suppression Mechanisms during Auditory Anticipatory Attention</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Anticipatory attention results in enhanced response to task-relevant stimulus, and reduced processing of unattended input, suggesting the deployment of distinct facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms. Alpha oscillations are a suitable candidate for supporting these mechanisms. We aimed to examine the role of alpha oscillations, with a special focus on peak frequencies, in facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms during auditory anticipation, within the auditory and visual regions. MEG data were collected from fourteen healthy young human adults (8 female) performing an auditory task in which spatial attention to sounds was manipulated by visual cues, either informative or not of the target side. By incorporating uninformative cues, we could delineate facilitating and suppressive mechanisms. During anticipation of a visually-cued auditory target, we observed a decrease in alpha power around 9Hz in the auditory cortices; and an increase around 13 Hz in the visual regions. Only this power increase in high alpha significantly correlated with behavior. Importantly, within the right auditory cortex, we showed a larger increase in high alpha power when attending an ipsilateral sound; and a stronger decrease in low alpha power when attending a contralateral sound. In summary, we found facilitatory and suppressive attentional mechanisms with distinct timing in task-relevant and task-irrelevant brain areas, differentially correlated to behavior and supported by distinct alpha sub-bands. We provide new insight into the role of the alpha peak-frequency by showing that anticipatory attention is supported by distinct facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms, mediated in different low and high sub-bands of the alpha rhythm, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We investigated the role of alpha oscillations, with a special focus on peak frequencies, in facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms during anticipation, using MEG data collected during an auditory spatial attention task. We show, during anticipation of a visually-cued auditory target, a decrease in alpha power around 9Hz in the auditory cortices, simultaneous to an increase around 13 Hz in in the visual regions, the latter significantly correlated with behavioral performances. Within the right auditory cortex, we show a larger increase in high alpha when attending an ipsilateral sound; and a stronger decrease in low alpha when attending a contralateral sound. Therefore, anticipatory attention would be supported by distinct facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms, mediated in different low and high alpha sub-bands, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Estradiol Drives the Anorexigenic Activity of Proopiomelanocortin Neurons in Female Mice</title>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0103-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Energy balance is regulated by anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. POMC neurons make extensive projections and are thought to release both amino acid and peptide neurotransmitters. However, whether they communicate directly with NPY/AgRP neurons is debated. Initially, using single cell RT-PCR, we determined that mouse POMC&lt;sup&gt;eGFP&lt;/sup&gt; neurons express &lt;i&gt;Slc17a6&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Slc18a2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vmat2&lt;/i&gt;), but not &lt;i&gt;Slc31a1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vgat&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA, suggesting glutamate and non-canonical GABA release. Quantitative RT-PCR of POMC&lt;sup&gt;eGFP&lt;/sup&gt; cells revealed that &lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Vmat2&lt;/i&gt; expression was significantly increased in E2- vs. oil-treated, ovariectomized (OVX) female mice. Since 17β-estradiol (E2) is anorexigenic, we hypothesized that an underlying mechanism was enhancement of POMC signaling. Therefore, we optogenetically stimulated POMC neurons in hypothalamic slices to examine evoked release of neurotransmitters onto NPY/AgRP neurons. Using brief light pulses we primarily observed glutamatergic currents and, based on the paired pulse ratio, determined that release probability was higher in E2- vs oil-treated, OVX female, congruent with increased &lt;i&gt;Vlgut2&lt;/i&gt; expression. Moreover, bath perfusion of the Gq-coupled membrane estrogen receptor agonist STX recapitulated the effects of E2 treatment. In addition, high frequency (20 Hz) stimulation generated a slow outward current that reversed near E&lt;sub&gt;k+&lt;/sub&gt; and was antagonized by naloxone, indicative of β-endorphin release. Furthermore, individual NPY/AgRP neurons were found to express &lt;i&gt;Oprm1,&lt;/i&gt; the transcript for μ-opioid receptor, and DAMGO, a selective agonist, elicited an outward current. Therefore, POMC excitability and neurotransmission are enhanced by E2, which would facilitate decreased food consumption through marked inhibition of NPY/AgRP neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus sense the energy state of an animal and regulate satiety to maintain homeostasis. Neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons also participate in energy balance, but instead drive hunger. Disruptions in this circuit can promote the development of obesity, which frequently occurs during menopause due to the loss of estrogens. The primary female sex hormone, 17β-estradiol (E2) exerts an anorexigenic effect, decreasing food intake and increasing activity. These behavioral changes are mediated, in part, through inhibition of NPY/AgRP and potentiation of POMC signaling. For the first time we report that POMC neurons provide direct input to NPY/AgRP neurons primarily through glutamate and β-endorphin release. Furthermore, E2 enhances POMC neurotransmission to inhibit NPY/AgRP neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Functional Connectivity of Chronic Cocaine Use Reveals Progressive Neuroadaptations in Neocortical, Striatal and Limbic Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0081-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging studies indicate that chronic cocaine users display altered functional connectivity between prefrontal cortical, thalamic, striatal, and limbic regions; however, the use of cross-sectional designs in these studies precludes measuring baseline brain activity prior to cocaine use. Animal studies can circumvent this limitation by comparing functional connectivity between baseline and various time points after chronic cocaine use. In the present study, adult male Long-Evans rats were trained to self-administer cocaine intravenously for 6-hour daily sessions over 14 consecutive days. Two additional groups serving as controls underwent sucrose self-administration or exposure to the test chambers alone. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted before self-administration and after 1 and 14 days of abstinence (1d and 14d Abs). At 1d Abs from cocaine, there was increased clustering coefficient in brain areas involved in reward seeking, learning, memory, and autonomic and affective processing, including amygdala, hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus and thalamus. Similar changes in clustering coefficient after 1d Abs from sucrose were evident in predominantly thalamic brain regions. Notably, there were no changes in strength of functional connectivity at 1d or 14d after either cocaine or sucrose self-administration. The results suggest that cocaine and sucrose can change the arrangement of functional connectivity of brain regions involved in cognition and emotion, but that these changes dissipate across the early stages of abstinence. The study also emphasizes the importance of including baseline measures in longitudinal functional neuroimaging designs seeking to assess functional connectivity in the context of substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Although human neuroimaging studies have been invaluable in understanding the relationship between cocaine use and brain functional connectivity, they inherently lack pre-drug baseline information important to establish how cocaine use alters regional interactions. Coupling neuroimaging with rodent models of cocaine self-administration circumvents this issue by controlling variables that can confound human studies and providing pre-drug baseline information. Using such an approach, this study reveals that after cocaine use, functional connectivity patterns change as a function of abstinence duration and that these changes are observed in networks supporting reward and emotion-related cognition and behavior. These findings highlight the importance of using multiple timepoints in preclinical models of substance use to assess effects on functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Estradiol Increases Glutamate and GABA Neurotransmission into GnRH Neurons via Retrograde NO-Signaling in Proestrous Mice during the Positive Estradiol Feedback Period</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Surge release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) is essential in the activation of pituitary gonadal unit at proestrus afternoon preceded by the rise of serum 17β-estradiol level during positive feedback period. Here we describe a mechanism of positive estradiol feedback regulation acting directly on GnRH-GFP neurons of mice. Whole cell clamp and loose patch recordings revealed that a high physiological dose of estradiol (200 pM), significantly increased firing rate at proestrus afternoon. The mPSC frequency at proestrus afternoon also increased, whereas decreased it at metestrus afternoon, and had no effect at proestrus morning. Inhibition of the estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), intracellular blockade of the Src kinase and PI3K and scavenge of nitric oxide inside GnRH neurons prevented the facilitatory estradiol effect indicating involvement of the ERβ/Src/PI3K/Akt/nNOS pathway in this fast, direct stimulatory effect. Immunohistochemistry localized soluble guanylate cyclase, the main nitric oxide receptor, in both glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals innervating GnRH neurons. Accordingly, estradiol facilitated neurotransmissions to GnRH neurons via both GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-R and glutamate/AMPA/kainate-R. These results indicate that estradiol acts directly on GnRH neurons via the ERβ/Akt/nNOS pathway at proestrus afternoon generating nitric oxide that retrogradely accelerates GABA and glutamate release from the presynaptic terminals contacting GnRH neurons. The newly explored mechanism might contribute to the regulation of the GnRH surge, a fundamental prerequisite of the ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; One of the major reasons of infertility is the failure in ovulation. Therefore, understanding of the neuronal processes resulting in proper ovulation is indispensable. Although hypothalamic GnRH neurons are regarded the master-neurons orchestrating reproduction, most of the relevant papers have suggested so far, that the estradiol positive feedback (indispensable for ovulation) acts in these neurons mostly indirectly, via hypothalamic nuclei free of GnRH neurons. Now we have presented strong evidence that estradiol exerts fast direct stimulatory action in GnRH neurons during the positive feedback, by activating retrograde nitric-oxide signaling to accelerate excitatory synaptic inputs to GnRH neurons. In addition, we suggest a putative mechanism, whereby indirect and direct actions of estradiol can work in concert regulating GnRH neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Characterization of Tissue Plasminogen Activator Expression and Trafficking in the Adult Murine Brain</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is an immediate-early gene important for regulating physiological processes like synaptic plasticity and neurovascular coupling. It has also been implicated in several pathological processes including blood-brain barrier permeability, seizure progression, and stroke. These varied reports suggest that tPA is a pleiotropic mediator whose actions are highly compartmentalized in space and time. The specific localization of tPA, therefore, can provide useful information about its function. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to provide a detailed characterization of tPA’s regional, cellular, and subcellular localization in the brain. To achieve this, two new transgenic mouse lines were utilized: (1) a PlatβGAL reporter mouse, which houses the β-galactosidase gene in the tPA locus and (2) a tPA&lt;sup&gt;BAC&lt;/sup&gt;-Cerulean mouse, which has a cerulean-fluorescent protein fused in-frame to the tPA C-terminus. Using these two transgenic reporters, we show that while tPA is expressed throughout most regions of the adult murine brain, it appears to be preferentially targeted to fiber tracts in the limbic system. In the hippocampus, confocal microscopy revealed tPA-Cerulean (tPA-Cer) puncta localized to giant mossy fiber boutons and astrocytes in stratum lucidum. With amplification of the tPA-Cer signal, somatically localized tPA was also observed in the stratum oriens/alveus layer of both CA1 and CA3 subfields. Co-immunostaining of tPA-Cer and interneuronal markers indicates that these tPA-positive cell bodies belong to a subclass of somatostatin/oriens-lacunosum moleculare interneurons. Together, these data imply that tPA’s localization is differentially regulated, suggesting that its neuromodulatory effects may be compartmentalized and specialized to cell-type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The serine protease tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been shown to modulate numerous neurologic processes including synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration. Many of the functional conclusions drawn about tPA activity, however, have not been affirmed by high-resolution, imaging analysis of tPA localization. To address these shortcomings, we used two new transgenic reporter mice to provide a detailed characterization of tPA expression in the adult murine brain. A comparison of these reporter mice demonstrates a differential expression pattern between the sites of tPA synthesis and its targeted localization in the hippocampus, amygdala, and basal ganglia. Moreover, colocalization and co-expression analysis reveals that tPA is primarily trafficked to pre-synaptic structures and that it’s predominant somatic and/or axonal localization is cell-type specific.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Weeds, which have been the bane of agriculture since the beginning of civilization, are managed manually, mechanically, and, more recently, by chemicals. However, chemical control options are rapidly shrinking due to the recent rise in the number of herbicide-resistant weeds in crop fields, with few alternatives on the horizon. Therefore,...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/4YuK95gA_eU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>N-acyl amino acids (NAAs) are a structurally diverse class of bioactive signaling lipids whose endogenous functions have largely remained uncharacterized. To clarify the physiologic roles of NAAs, we generated mice deficient in the circulating enzyme peptidase M20 domain-containing 1 (PM20D1). Global PM20D1-KO mice have dramatically reduced NAA hydrolase/synthase activities in...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/dQppU1t_mvc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Exosomes, abundant in blood, deliver various molecules to recipient cells. Endothelial cells are directly exposed to circulating substances. However, how endothelial cells respond to serum exosomes (SExos) and the implications in diabetes-associated vasculopathy have never been explored. In the present study, we showed that SExos from diabetic db/db mice (db/db...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/4mTKGQEjA6s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal and glial cells release diverse proteoglycans and glycoproteins,
which aggregate in the extracellular space and form the extracellular matrix
(ECM) that may in turn regulate major cellular functions. Brain cells also
release extracellular proteases that may degrade the ECM, and both synthesis
and degradation of ECM are activity-dependent. In this study we introduce a
mathematical model describing population dynamics of neurons interacting with
ECM molecules over extended timescales. It is demonstrated that depending on
the prevalent biophysical mechanism of ECM-neuronal interactions, different
dynamical regimes of ECM activity can be observed, including bistable states
with stable stationary levels of ECM molecule concentration, spontaneous ECM
oscillations, and coexistence of ECM oscillations and a stationary state,
allowing dynamical switches between activity regimes.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: True Contextuality Beats Direct Influences in Human Decision Making. (arXiv:1807.05684v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In quantum physics there are well-known situations when measurements of the
same property in different contexts (under different conditions) have the same
probability distribution, but cannot be represented by one and the same random
variable. Such systems of random variables are called contextual. More
generally, true contextuality is observed when different contexts force
measurements of the same property (in psychology, responses to the same
question) to be more dissimilar random variables than warranted by the
difference of their distributions. The difference in distributions is itself a
form of context-dependence, but of another nature: it is attributable to direct
causal influences exerted by contexts upon the random variables. We present a
series of crowdsourcing experiments that reveal true contextuality in human
decision making. Their analysis is based on the Contextuality-by-Default (CbD)
theory, one that allows one to separate true contextuality from direct
influences in the overall context-dependence. The design of our experiments is
an elaboration of one introduced in the &quot;Snow Queen&quot; experiment (Decision 5,
193-204, 2018), where contextuality was for the first time demonstrated
unequivocally. The CbD analysis of many previous attempts to demonstrate
contextuality in human judgments shows that they were unsuccessful because
direct influences in them were all one needed to account for
context-dependence.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human-machine interactions are being increasingly explored to create
alternative ways of communication and to improve our daily life. Based on a
classification of the user's intention from the user's underlying neural
activity, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct interactions with the
external environment while bypassing the traditional effector of the
musculoskeletal system. Despite the enormous potential of BCIs, there are still
a number of challenges that limit their societal impact, ranging from the
correct decoding of a human's thoughts, to the application of effective
learning strategies. Despite several important engineering advances, the basic
neuroscience behind these challenges remains poorly explored. Indeed, BCIs
involve complex dynamic changes related to neural plasticity at a diverse range
of spatiotemporal scales. One promising antidote to this complexity lies in
network science, which provides a natural language in which to model the
organizational principles of brain architecture and function as manifest in its
interconnectivity. Here, we briefly review the main limitations currently
affecting BCIs, and we offer our perspective on how they can be addressed by
means of network theoretic approaches. We posit that the emerging field of
network neuroscience will prove to be an effective tool to unlock human-machine
interactions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Towards Modeling the Interaction of Spatial-Associative Neural Network Representations for Multisensory Perception. (arXiv:1807.05222v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our daily perceptual experience is driven by different neural mechanisms that
yield multisensory interaction as the interplay between exogenous stimuli and
endogenous expectations. While the interaction of multisensory cues according
to their spatiotemporal properties and the formation of multisensory
feature-based representations have been widely studied, the interaction of
spatial-associative neural representations has received considerably less
attention. In this paper, we propose a neural network architecture that models
the interaction of spatial-associative representations to perform causal
inference of audiovisual stimuli. We investigate the spatial alignment of
exogenous audiovisual stimuli modulated by associative congruence. In the
spatial layer, topographically arranged networks account for the interaction of
audiovisual input in terms of population codes. In the associative layer,
congruent audiovisual representations are obtained via the experience-driven
development of feature-based associations. Levels of congruency are obtained as
a by-product of the neurodynamics of self-organizing networks, where the amount
of neural activation triggered by the input can be expressed via a nonlinear
distance function. Our novel proposal is that activity-driven levels of
congruency can be used as top-down modulatory projections to spatially
distributed representations of sensory input, e.g. semantically related
audiovisual pairs will yield a higher level of integration than unrelated
pairs. Furthermore, levels of neural response in unimodal layers may be seen as
sensory reliability for the dynamic weighting of crossmodal cues. We describe a
series of planned experiments to validate our model in the tasks of
multisensory interaction on the basis of semantic congruence and unimodal cue
reliability.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Parsimonious Dynamical Model for Structural Learning in the Human Brain. (arXiv:1807.05214v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is capable of diverse feats of intelligence. A particularly
salient example is the ability to deduce structure from time-varying auditory
and visual stimuli, enabling humans to master the rules of language and to
build rich expectations of their physical environment. The broad relevance of
this ability for human cognition motivates the need for a first-principles
model explicating putative mechanisms. Here we propose a general framework for
structural learning in the brain, composed of an evolving, high-dimensional
dynamical system driven by external stimuli or internal processes. We
operationalize the scenario in which humans learn the rules that generate a
sequence of stimuli, rather than the exemplar stimuli themselves. We model
external stimuli as seemingly disordered chaotic time series generated by
complex dynamical systems; the underlying structure being deduced is then that
of the corresponding chaotic attractor. This approach allows us to demonstrate
and theoretically explain the emergence of five distinct phenomena reminiscent
of cognitive functions: (i) learning the structure of a chaotic system purely
from time series, (ii) generating new streams of stimuli from a chaotic system,
(iii) switching stream generation among multiple learned chaotic systems,
either spontaneously or in response to external perturbations, (iv) inferring
missing data from sparse observations of the chaotic system, and (v)
deciphering superimposed input from different chaotic systems. Numerically, we
show that these phenomena emerge naturally from a recurrent neural network of
Erdos-Renyi topology in which the synaptic strengths adapt in a Hebbian-like
manner. Broadly, our work blends chaotic theory and artificial neural networks
to answer the long standing question of how neural systems can learn the
structure underlying temporal sequences of stimuli.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Adaptation to constant light requires Fic-mediated AMPylation of BiP to protect against reversible photoreceptor degeneration</title>

	<description>In response to environmental, developmental, and pathological stressors, cells engage homeostatic pathways to maintain their function. Among these pathways, the Unfolded Protein Response protects cells from the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Depending on ER stress levels, the ER-resident Fic protein catalyzes AMPylation or de-AMPylation of BiP, the major ER chaperone and regulator of the Unfolded Protein Response. This work elucidates the importance of the reversible AMPylation of BiP in maintaining the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;visual system in response to stress. After 72 hours of constant light, photoreceptors of &lt;i&gt;fic&lt;/i&gt;-null and AMPylation-resistant &lt;i&gt;BiP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;T366A&lt;/sup&gt; mutants, but not wild-type flies, display loss of synaptic function, disintegration of rhabdomeres, and excessive activation of ER stress reporters. Strikingly, this phenotype is reversible: photoreceptors regain their structure and function within 72 hours once returned to a standard light:dark cycle. These findings show that Fic-mediated AMPylation of BiP is required for neurons to adapt to transient stress demands.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: KCNE1 tunes the sensitivity of KV7.1 to polyunsaturated fatty acids by moving turret residues close to the binding site</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37257</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37257</link>
	<description>The voltage-gated potassium channel K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;7.1 and the auxiliary subunit KCNE1 together form the cardiac I&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt; channel, which is a proposed target for future anti-arrhythmic drugs. We previously showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) activate K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;7.1 via an electrostatic mechanism. The activating effect was abolished when K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;7.1 was co-expressed with KCNE1, as KCNE1 renders PUFAs ineffective by promoting PUFA protonation. PUFA protonation reduces the potential of PUFAs as anti-arrhythmic compounds. It is unknown how KCNE1 promotes PUFA protonation. Here, we found that neutralization of negatively charged residues in the S5-P-helix loop of K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;7.1 restored PUFA effects on K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;7.1 co-expressed with KCNE1 in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes. We propose that KCNE1 moves the S5-P-helix loop of K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;7.1 towards the PUFA binding site, which indirectly causes PUFA protonation, thereby reducing the effect of PUFAs on K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;7.1. This mechanistic understanding of how KCNE1 alters K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;7.1 pharmacology is essential for development of drugs targeting the I&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt; channel.</description>

	<description>The human gut microbiota impacts host metabolism and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of obesity and metabolic syndromes. However, defining the roles of specific microbial activities and metabolites on host phenotypes has proven challenging due to the complexity of the microbiome-host ecosystem. Here, we identify strains from the abundant gut bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes that display selective bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Using isogenic strains of wild-type and BSH-deleted &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron&lt;/i&gt;, we selectively modulated the levels of the bile acid tauro-b-muricholic acid in monocolonized gnotobiotic mice. &lt;i&gt;B. thetaiotaomicron&lt;/i&gt; BSH mutant-colonized mice displayed altered metabolism, including reduced weight gain and respiratory exchange ratios, as well as transcriptional changes in metabolic, circadian rhythm, and immune pathways in the gut and liver. Our results demonstrate that metabolites generated by a single microbial gene and enzymatic activity can profoundly alter host metabolism and gene expression at local and organism-level scales.</description>

	<description>Understanding how patterning influences cell behaviors to generate three dimensional morphologies is a central goal of developmental biology. Additionally, comparing these regulatory mechanisms among morphologically diverse tissues allows for rigorous testing of evolutionary hypotheses. Zebrafish skin is endowed with a coat of precisely patterned bony scales. We use &lt;i&gt;in-toto &lt;/i&gt;live imaging during scale development and manipulations of cell signaling activity to elucidate core features of scale patterning and morphogenesis. These analyses show that scale development requires the concerted activity of Wnt/β-catenin, Ectodysplasin (Eda) and Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling. This regulatory module coordinates Hedgehog (HH) dependent collective cell migration during epidermal invagination, a cell behavior not previously implicated in skin appendage morphogenesis. Our analyses demonstrate the utility of zebrafish scale development as a tractable system in which to elucidate mechanisms of developmental patterning and morphogenesis, and suggest a single, ancient origin of skin appendage patterning mechanisms in vertebrates.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36833</link>
	<description>Nitric oxide (NO) is released into the air by NO-producing organisms; however, it is unclear if animals utilize NO as a sensory cue. We show that &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;avoids &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa &lt;/i&gt;(PA14) in part by detecting PA14-produced NO. PA14 mutants deficient for NO production fail to elicit avoidance and NO donors repel worms. PA14 and NO avoidance are mediated by a chemosensory neuron (ASJ) and these responses require receptor guanylate cyclases and cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels. ASJ exhibits calcium increases at both the onset and removal of NO. These NO-evoked ON and OFF calcium transients are affected by a redox sensing protein, TRX-1/thioredoxin. TRX-1's trans-nitrosylation activity inhibits the ON transient whereas TRX-1's de-nitrosylation activity promotes the OFF transient. Thus, &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;exploits bacterially produced NO as a cue to mediate avoidance and TRX-1 endows ASJ with a bi-phasic response to NO exposure.</description>

	<description>Endophytic insects provide the textbook examples of herbivores that manipulate their host plant's physiology, putatively altering source/sink relationships by transferring cytokinins (CK) to create 'green islands' that increase the nutritional value of infested tissues. However, unambiguous demonstrations of CK transfer are lacking. Here we show that feeding by the free-living herbivore &lt;i&gt;Tupiocoris notatus &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana attenuata&lt;/i&gt; is characterized by stable nutrient levels, increased CK levels and alterations in CK-related transcript levels in attacked leaves, in striking similarity to endophytic insects. Using &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-isotope labeling, we demonstrate that the CK &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-isopentenyladenine (IP) is transferred from insects to plants via their oral secretions. In the field, &lt;i&gt;T. notatus&lt;/i&gt; preferentially attacks leaves with transgenically increased CK levels; plants with abrogated CK-perception are less tolerant of &lt;i&gt;T. notatus&lt;/i&gt; feeding damage. We infer that this free-living insect uses CKs to manipulate source/sink relationships to increase food quality and minimize the fitness consequences of its feeding.</description>

	<description>The causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, &lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/i&gt;, delivers more than 330 virulent effectors to its host to establish an intracellular membrane-bound organelle called the &lt;i&gt;Legionella&lt;/i&gt; containing vacuole. Among the army of &lt;i&gt;Legionella&lt;/i&gt; effectors, SidC and its paralog SdcA have been identified as novel bacterial ubiquitin (Ub) E3 ligases. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of SidC/SdcA as Ub ligases, we determined the crystal structures of a binary complex of the N-terminal catalytic SNL domain of SdcA with its cognate E2 UbcH5C and a ternary complex consisting of the SNL domain of SidC with the Ub-linked E2 UbcH7. These two structures reveal the molecular determinants governing the Ub transfer cascade catalyzed by SidC. Together, our data support a common mechanism in the Ub transfer cascade in which the donor Ub is immobilized with its C-terminal tail locked in an extended conformation, priming the donor Ub for catalysis.</description>

	<description>Abnormalities in nucleic acid processing are associated with the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations in &lt;i&gt;Matrin 3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;MATR3&lt;/i&gt;), a poorly understood DNA- and RNA-binding protein, cause familial ALS/FTD, and MATR3 pathology is a feature of sporadic disease, suggesting that MATR3 dysfunction is integrally linked to ALS pathogenesis. Using a rat primary neuron model to assess MATR3-mediated toxicity, we noted that neurons were bidirectionally vulnerable to MATR3 levels, with pathogenic MATR3 mutants displaying enhanced toxicity. MATR3’s zinc finger domains partially modulated toxicity, but elimination of its RNA recognition motifs had no effect on survival, instead facilitating its self-assembly into liquid-like droplets. In contrast to other RNA-binding proteins associated with ALS, cytoplasmic MATR3 redistribution mitigated neurodegeneration, suggesting that nuclear MATR3 mediates toxicity. Our findings offer a foundation for understanding MATR3-related neurodegeneration and how nucleic acid binding functions, localization, and pathogenic mutations drive sporadic and familial disease.</description>

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) inhibit expression of target genes by binding to their RNA transcripts. It has been recently shown that RNA transcripts targeted by the same miRNA could “compete” for the miRNA molecules and thereby indirectly regulate each other. Experimental evidence has suggested that the aberration of such miRNA-mediated interaction between RNAs—called competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interaction—can play important roles in tumorigenesis. Given the difficulty of deciphering context-specific miRNA binding, and the existence of various gene regulatory factors such as DNA methylation and copy number alteration, inferring context-specific ceRNA interactions accurately is a computationally challenging task. Here we propose a computational method called Cancerin to identify cancer-associated ceRNA interactions. Cancerin incorporates DNA methylation, copy number alteration, gene and miRNA expression datasets to construct cancer-specific ceRNA networks. We applied Cancerin to three cancer datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Our results indicated that ceRNAs were enriched with cancer-related genes, and ceRNA modules in the inferred ceRNA networks were involved in cancer-associated biological processes. Using LINCS-L1000 shRNA-mediated gene knockdown experiment in breast cancer cell line to assess accuracy, Cancerin was able to predict expression outcome of ceRNA genes with high accuracy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/blL43-YkQ6E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Interaction of the human erythrocyte Band 3 anion exchanger 1 (AE1, SLC4A1) with lipids and glycophorin A: Molecular organization of the Wright (Wr) blood group antigen</title>

The Band 3 (AE1, SLC4A1) membrane protein is found in red blood cells and in kidney where it functions as an electro-neutral chloride/bicarbonate exchanger. In this study, we have used molecular dynamics simulations to provide the first realistic model of the dimeric membrane domain of human Band 3 in an asymmetric lipid bilayer containing a full complement of phospholipids, including phosphatidylinositol 4,5–bisphosphate (PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and cholesterol, and its partner membrane protein Glycophorin A (GPA). The simulations show that the annular layer in the inner leaflet surrounding Band 3 was enriched in phosphatidylserine and PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. Cholesterol was also enriched around Band 3 but also at the dimer interface. The interaction of these lipids with specific sites on Band 3 may play a role in the folding and function of this anion transport membrane protein. GPA associates with Band 3 to form the Wright (Wr) blood group antigen, an interaction that involves an ionic bond between Glu658 in Band 3 and Arg61 in GPA. We were able to recreate this complex by performing simulations to allow the dimeric transmembrane portion of GPA to interact with Band 3 in a model membrane. Large-scale simulations showed that the GPA dimer can bridge Band 3 dimers resulting in the dynamic formation of long strands of alternating Band 3 and GPA dimers.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Kfh8ScEBncs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Microheterogeneity-induced conduction slowing and wavefront collisions govern macroscopic conduction behavior: A computational and experimental study</title>

The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias is known to be associated with tissue heterogeneities including fibrosis. However, the impact of microscopic structural heterogeneities on conduction in excitable tissues remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how acellular microheterogeneities affect macroscopic conduction under conditions of normal and reduced excitability by utilizing a novel platform of paired &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; studies to examine the mechanisms of conduction. Regular patterns of nonconductive micro-obstacles were created in confluent monolayers of the previously described engineered-excitable Ex293 cell line. Increasing the relative ratio of obstacle size to intra-obstacle strand width resulted in significant conduction slowing up to 23.6% and a significant increase in wavefront curvature anisotropy, a measure of spatial variation in wavefront shape. Changes in bulk electrical conductivity and in path tortuosity were insufficient to explain these observed macroscopic changes. Rather, microscale behaviors including local conduction slowing due to microscale branching, and conduction acceleration due to wavefront merging were shown to contribute to macroscopic phenomena. Conditions of reduced excitability led to further conduction slowing and a reversal of wavefront curvature anisotropy due to spatially non-uniform effects on microscopic slowing and acceleration. This unique experimental and computation platform provided critical mechanistic insights in the impact of microscopic heterogeneities on macroscopic conduction, pertinent to settings of fibrotic heart disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-2oVZ0teIoQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Quantification of Total and Mutant Huntingtin Protein Levels in Biospecimens Using a Novel alphaLISA Assay</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The neurodegenerative Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) amplification in the huntingtin protein (HTT). Currently there is no effective therapy available for HD; however, several efforts are directed to develop and optimize HTT lowering methods to improve HD phenotypes. To validate these approaches, there is an immediate need for reliable, sensitive and easily accessible methods to quantify HTT expression. Using the AlphaLISA platform we developed two novel sensitive and robust assays for quantification of HTT in biological samples using commercially available antibodies. The first, a polyQ independent assay, measures the total pool of HTT; whilst the second, a polyQ dependent assay, preferentially detects the mutant form of HTT. Using purified HTT protein standards and brain homogenates from an HD mouse model, we determine a lower limit of quantification of 1 and 3 pM and optimal reproducibility with CV values lower than 7% for intra- and 20% for inter-assay. In addition, we used the assays to quantify HTT in neural stem cells generated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in human brain tissue lysates. Finally, we could detect changes in HTT levels in a mouse model where mutant HTT was conditionally deleted in neural tissue, verifying the potential to monitor the outcome of HTT lowering strategies. This analytical platform is ideal for high-throughput screens and thus has an added value for the HD community as a tool to optimize novel therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating HTT protein levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The HTT lowering approaches are widely investigated as possible therapies for HD. to support these strategies, there is a high need for reproducible and sensitive assays able to quantify HTT protein. In this study we describe two robust and sensitive assays based on the AlphaLISA platform, which are able to measure either the pool of wild-type and mutant HTT, polyQ independent assay, or preferentially mutant HTT, polyQ dependent assay, in biological samples. These assays constitute a very valuable tool for HD research as they apply readily accessible antibodies and have a simple implementation. Furthermore, the HTT AlphaLISA assays are suitable for use in high throughput studies and potentially could be multiplexed to monitor simultaneously different forms of HTT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Individual Differences in Motor Noise and Adaptation Rate Are Optimally Related</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0170-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Individual variations in motor adaptation rate were recently shown to correlate with movement variability or &quot;motor noise&quot; in a forcefield adaptation task. However, this finding could not be replicated in a meta-analysis of adaptation experiments. Possibly, this inconsistency stems from noise being composed of distinct components which relate to adaptation rate in different ways. Indeed, previous modeling and electrophysiological studies have suggested that motor noise can be factored into planning noise, originating from the brain, and execution noise, stemming from the periphery. Were the motor system optimally tuned to these noise sources, planning noise would correlate positively with adaptation rate and execution noise would correlate negatively with adaptation rate, a phenomenon familiar in Kalman filters. To test this prediction, we performed a visuomotor adaptation experiment in 69 subjects. Using a novel Bayesian fitting procedure, we succeeded in applying the well-established state-space model of adaptation to individual data. We found that adaptation rate correlates positively with planning noise (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;  =  0.44; 95%HDI=[0.27 0.59]) and negatively with execution noise (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = -0.39; 95%HDI=[-0.50 -0.30]). In addition, the steady-state Kalman gain calculated from planning and execution noise correlated positively with adaptation rate (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.54; 95%HDI = [0.38 0.66]). These results suggest that motor adaptation is tuned to approximate optimal learning, consistent with the &quot;optimal control&quot; framework that has been used to explain motor control. Since motor adaptation is thought to be a largely cerebellar process, the results further suggest the sensitivity of the cerebellum to both planning noise and execution noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Our study shows that the adaptation rate is optimally tuned to planning noise and execution noise across individuals. This suggests that motor adaptation is tuned to approximate optimal learning, consistent with &quot;optimal control&quot; approaches to understanding the motor system. In addition, our results imply sensitivity of the cerebellum to both planning noise and execution noise, an idea not previously considered. Finally, our Bayesian statistical approach represents a powerful, novel method for fitting the well-established state-space models that could have an influence on the methodology of the field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Heterogeneous inputs to central pattern generators can shape insect gaits. (arXiv:1807.05142v1 [math.DS])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05142</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05142</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In our previous work, we studied an interconnected bursting neuron model for
insect locomotion, and its corresponding phase oscillator model, which at high
speed can generate stable tripod gaits with three legs off the ground
simultaneously in swing, and at low speed can generate stable tetrapod gaits
with two legs off the ground simultaneously in swing. However, at low speed
several other stable locomotion patterns, that are not typically observed as
insect gaits, may coexist. In the present paper, by adding heterogeneous
external input to each oscillator, we modify the bursting neuron model so that
its corresponding phase oscillator model produces only one stable gait at each
speed, specifically: a unique stable tetrapod gait at low speed, a unique
stable tripod gait at high speed, and a unique branch of stable transition
gaits connecting them. This suggests that control signals originating in the
brain and central nervous system can modify gait patterns.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Local learning rules to attenuate forgetting in neural networks. (arXiv:1807.05097v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05097</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05097</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hebbian synaptic plasticity inevitably leads to interference and forgetting
when different, overlapping memory patterns are sequentially stored in the same
network. Recent work on artificial neural networks shows that an
information-geometric approach can be used to protect important weights to slow
down forgetting. This strategy however is biologically implausible as it
requires knowledge of the history of previously learned patterns. In this work,
we show that a purely local weight consolidation mechanism, based on estimating
energy landscape curvatures from locally available statistics, prevents pattern
interference. Exploring a local calculation of energy curvature in the
sparse-coding limit, we demonstrate that curvature-aware learning rules reduce
forgetting in the Hopfield network. We further show that this method connects
information-geometric global learning rules based on the Fisher information to
local spike-dependent rules accessible to biological neural networks. We
conjecture that, if combined with other learning procedures, it could provide a
building-block for content-aware learning strategies that use only quantities
computable in biological neural networks to attenuate pattern interference and
catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, this work clarifies how global
information-geometric structure in a learning problem can be exposed in local
model statistics, building a deeper theoretical connection between the
statistics of single units in a network, and the global structure of the
collective learning space.

Despite this, various lines of research have provided insights in properties of adult human synapses and their plasticity both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, with some unexpected surprises. We first discuss the experimental approaches to study activity-dependent plasticity of adult human synapses, and then highlight rules and mechanisms of Hebbian spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) found in these synapses. Finally, we conclude with thoughts on how these synaptic principles can underlie human learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: miRAW: A deep learning-based approach to predict microRNA targets by analyzing whole microRNA transcripts</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006185</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Albert Pla, Xiangfu Zhong, Simon Rayner&lt;/p&gt;

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to partially complementary regions within the 3’UTR of their target genes. Computational methods play an important role in target prediction and assume that the miRNA “seed region” (nt 2 to 8) is required for functional targeting, but typically only identify ∼80% of known bindings. Recent studies have highlighted a role for the entire miRNA, suggesting that a more flexible methodology is needed. We present a novel approach for miRNA target prediction based on Deep Learning (DL) which, rather than incorporating any knowledge (such as seed regions), investigates the entire miRNA and 3’TR mRNA nucleotides to learn a uninhibited set of feature descriptors related to the targeting process. We collected more than 150,000 experimentally validated homo sapiens miRNA:gene targets and cross referenced them with different CLIP-Seq, CLASH and iPAR-CLIP datasets to obtain ∼20,000 validated miRNA:gene exact target sites. Using this data, we implemented and trained a deep neural network—composed of autoencoders and a feed-forward network—able to automatically learn features describing miRNA-mRNA interactions and assess functionality. Predictions were then refined using information such as site location or site accessibility energy. In a comparison using independent datasets, our DL approach consistently outperformed existing prediction methods, recognizing the seed region as a common feature in the targeting process, but also identifying the role of pairings outside this region. Thermodynamic analysis also suggests that site accessibility plays a role in targeting but that it cannot be used as a sole indicator for functionality.

	<title>RSS PAP: Selective Effects of the Loss of NMDA or mGluR5 Receptors in the Reward System on Adaptive Decision-Making</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Selecting the most advantageous actions in a changing environment is a central feature of adaptive behavior. The midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons along with the major targets of their projections, including dopaminoceptive neurons in the frontal cortex and basal ganglia, play a key role in this process. Here, we investigate the consequences of a selective genetic disruption of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGluR5) receptors in the DA system on adaptive choice behavior, in mice. We tested the effects of the mutation on performance in the probabilistic reinforcement learning and probability discounting tasks. In case of the probabilistic choice, both the loss of NMDA receptors in dopaminergic neurons or loss mGluR5 receptors in D1 receptor-expressing dopaminoceptive neurons reduced the probability of selecting the more rewarded alternative and lowered the likelihood of returning to the previously rewarded alternative (win-stay). When observed behavior was fitted to reinforcement learning models, we found that these two mutations were associated with reduced effect of expected outcome on choice, i.e. more random choices. None of the mutations affected probability discounting, which indicates that all animals had normal ability to assess probability. However, in both behavioral tasks animals with targeted loss of NMDA receptors in dopaminergic neurons or mGluR5 receptors in D1 neurons were significantly slower to perform choices. In conclusion, these results show that glutamate receptor-dependent signaling in the DA system is essential for the speed and accuracy of choices, but at the same time probably not critical for correct estimation of probable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We investigated the role of glutamate signaling in the brain’s reward system in adaptive decision-making. We used genetically modified mice with disruption of glutamate signaling, that was caused by deletion of glutamate receptors in dopamine-producing and dopamine-sensitive neurons. When mutant mice were offered a choice between two alternatives with varying chances of being rewarded, the mutations decreased the probability of selecting the more often rewarded alternative, and the likelihood of repeating previously rewarded choice. Moreover, mutant animals were much slower in performing choices. Our results show that when glutamate signaling in the reward system is disrupted, it causes an impairment in decision-making, by increasing randomness and reducing the speed of decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Conflicted between Goal-Directed and Habitual Control - an fMRI Investigation</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;&quot;Slips of action&quot; occur in everyday life when we momentarily lose sight of a goal (for example when in a rush or distracted). Associative models propose that these habitual responses can be activated via a direct stimulus-response mechanism, regardless of the current hedonic value of the outcome. The slips-of-action task (SOAT) has been extensively used in both healthy and pathological populations to measure habit tendencies – the likelihood of making erroneous responses for devalued outcomes. Inspection of behavioral performance does not reveal, however, whether the impairments were due to impaired goal-directed control or aberrantly strong habit formation. In the current study we used functional MRI while human participants performed both the instrumental training and SOAT test phases, to elucidate the relative contributions of these mechanisms to performance on the SOAT. On trials in which conflict arises between competing goal-directed and habitual responses we observed increased activation across areas including the anterior cingulate cortex, paracingulate gyrus, lateral OFC, insula and inferior frontal gyrus. Responding for devalued outcomes was related to increased activation in the premotor cortex and cerebellum – implicating these regions in habitual responding. Increased activation in the caudate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontal pole during training was associated with better performance during the test phase, indicative of goal-directed action control. These results endorse interpretation of the SOAT in terms of competing goal-directed and habitual mechanisms and highlight that cognitive control processes present an additional bottleneck for successful performance on this task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Imagine that you step in the car intending to drive to your new office but distracted, end up driving the route to your old office instead. We are all familiar with the feeling that results from inadvertently carrying out a previously valid behavior, even if we no longer desire the consequence. In the current study we examined how the brain reacts to cues that signal a previously rewarded response whose outcome value has now changed. We were also able to identify the brain regions that were activated when participants made an erroneous (habitual) response under time-pressure. These results give us a richer sense of how the brain acts to control behavior when goal-directed processes are otherwise engaged.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Predicting Task and Subject Differences with Functional Connectivity and BOLD Variability. (arXiv:1807.04745v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04745</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found that functional connectivity (FC) can accurately
predict the identity of a subject performing a task and the type of task being
performed. We replicate these results using a large dataset collected at the
OSU Center for Cognitive and Behavioral Brain Imaging. We also introduce a
novel perspective on task and subject identity prediction: BOLD Variability
(BV). Conceptually, BV is a region-specific measure based on the variance
within each brain region. BV is simple to compute, interpret, and visualize. We
show that both FC and BV are predictive of task and subject, even across
scanning sessions separated by multiple years. Subject differences rather than
task differences account for the majority of changes in BV and FC. Similar to
results in FC, we show that BV is reduced during cognitive tasks relative to
rest.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental understanding of the network architecture of the brain is
necessary for the further development of theories explicating circuit function.
Perhaps as a derivative of its initial application to abstract informational
systems, network science provides many methods and summary statistics that
address the network's topological characteristics with little or no thought to
its physical instantiation. Recent progress has capitalized on quantitative
tools from network science to parsimoniously describe and predict neural
activity and connectivity across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Yet, for
embedded systems, physical laws can directly constrain processes of network
growth, development, and function, and an appreciation of those physical laws
is therefore critical to an understanding of the system. Recent evidence
demonstrates that the constraints imposed by the physical shape of the brain,
and by the mechanical forces at play in its development, have marked effects on
the observed network topology and function. Here, we review the rules imposed
by space on the development of neural networks and show that these rules give
rise to a specific set of complex topologies. We present evidence that these
fundamental wiring rules affect the repertoire of neural dynamics that can
emerge from the system, and thereby inform our understanding of network
dysfunction in disease. We also discuss several computational tools,
mathematical models, and algorithms that have proven useful in delineating the
effects of spatial embedding on a given networked system and are important
considerations for addressing future problems in network neuroscience. Finally,
we outline several open questions regarding the network architectures that
support circuit function, the answers to which will require a thorough and
honest appraisal of the role of physical space in brain network anatomy and
physiology.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Elements of Consciousness and Cognition. Biology, Mathematic, Physics and Panpsychism: an Information Topology Perspective. (arXiv:1807.04520v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This review presents recent and older results on elementary quantitative and
qualitative aspects of consciousness and cognition and tackles the question
&quot;What is consciousness?&quot; conjointly from biological, neuroscience-cognitive,
physical and mathematical points of view. It proposes to unify various results
and theories by means of information topology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chapter presents the postulates and results on elementary
perception at various organizational scales of the nervous system and proposes
the hypothesis of an electrodynamic intrinsic nature of consciousness which is
sustained by an analogical code. It underlines the diversity of the learning
mechanisms that sustain the dynamics of perception and consciousness, including
adaptive and homeostatic processes on multiple scales.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second chapter investigates the logical aspects of cognition and
consciousness and proposes an axiomatization based on measure and probability
theory. Topos and constructive logic are presented as providing an intrinsic
probabilistic logic, with the long-term aim of avoiding the paradoxical
decomposition induced by the Axiom of Choice. We sketch an elementary procedure
allowing an expression of the information of a mathematical formula a la Godel.
We then present the formalism of information topology and propose that it
provides a preliminary basis for synthesizing the main models of cognition and
consciousness within a formal Gestalt theory. Information topology establishes
a characterization of information theory functions, allowing for a precise
expression of information structures and patterns. It provides a quantification
of the structure of statistical interactions and their expression in terms of
statistical physics and machine learning. Notably, those topological methods
allow conciliation of some of the main theories of consciousness.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Analyzing P300 Distractors for Target Reconstruction. (arXiv:1807.04334v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04334</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04334</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;P300-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are often trained per-user and
per-application space. Training such models requires ground truth knowledge of
target and non-target stimulus categories during model training, which imparts
bias into the model. Additionally, not all non-targets are created equal; some
may contain visual features that resemble targets or may otherwise be visually
salient. Current research has indicated that non-target distractors may elicit
attenuated P300 responses based on the perceptual similarity of these
distractors to the target category. To minimize this bias, and enable a more
nuanced analysis, we use a generalized BCI approach that is fit to neither user
nor task. We do not seek to improve the overall accuracy of the BCI with our
generalized approach; we instead demonstrate the utility of our approach for
identifying target-related image features. When combined with other intelligent
agents, such as computer vision systems, the performance of the generalized
model equals that of the user-specific models, without any user specific data.

	<description>Sequential sampling models have provided a dominant theoretical framework guiding computational and neurophysiological investigations of perceptual decision-making. While these models share the basic principle that decisions are formed by accumulating sensory evidence to a bound, they come in many forms that can make similar predictions of choice behaviour despite invoking fundamentally different mechanisms. The identification of neural signals that reflect some of the core computations underpinning decision formation offers new avenues for empirically testing and refining key model assumptions.</description>

	<description>The central nervous system is not a static, hard-wired organ. Examples of neuroplasticity, whether at the level of the synapse, the cell, or within and between circuits, can be found during development, throughout the progression of disease, or after injury. One essential component of the molecular, anatomical, and functional changes associated with neuroplasticity is the spinal interneuron (SpIN). Here, we draw on recent multidisciplinary studies to identify and interrogate subsets of SpINs and their roles in locomotor and respiratory circuits.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modelling how responsiveness to interferon improves interferon-free treatment of hepatitis C virus infection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006335</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/-YZvCWuoO10/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Vishnu Venugopal, Pranesh Padmanabhan, Rubesh Raja, Narendra M. Dixit&lt;/p&gt;

Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for hepatitis C treatment tend to fare better in individuals who are also likely to respond well to interferon-alpha (IFN), a surprising correlation given that DAAs target specific viral proteins whereas IFN triggers a generic antiviral immune response. Here, we posit a causal relationship between IFN-responsiveness and DAA treatment outcome. IFN-responsiveness restricts viral replication, which would prevent the growth of viral variants resistant to DAAs and improve treatment outcome. To test this hypothesis, we developed a multiscale mathematical model integrating IFN-responsiveness at the cellular level, viral kinetics and evolution leading to drug resistance at the individual level, and treatment outcome at the population level. Model predictions quantitatively captured data from over 50 clinical trials demonstrating poorer response to DAAs in previous non-responders to IFN than treatment-naïve individuals, presenting strong evidence supporting the hypothesis. Model predictions additionally described several unexplained clinical observations, viz., the percentages of infected individuals who 1) spontaneously clear HCV, 2) get chronically infected but respond to IFN-based therapy, and 3) fail IFN-based therapy but respond to DAA-based therapy, resulting in a comprehensive understanding of HCV infection and treatment. An implication of the causal relationship is that failure of DAA-based treatments may be averted by adding IFN, a strategy of potential use in settings with limited access to DAAs. A second, wider implication is that individuals with greater IFN-responsiveness would require shorter DAA-based treatment durations, presenting a basis and a promising population for response-guided therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-YZvCWuoO10&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Many animals depend on descending information from the brain for the initiation and proper execution of locomotion. Interestingly, after injury and the loss of such inputs, locomotor function can sometimes be regained without the regrowth of central connections. In the medicinal leech, &lt;i&gt;Hirudo verbana&lt;/i&gt;, we have shown that crawling reemerges after removal of descending inputs. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying this return of locomotion by asking if central pattern generators (CPGs) in crawl-recovered leeches are sufficient to produce crawl-specific intersegmental coordination. From recovered animals, we treated isolated chains of ganglia with dopamine to activate the crawl CPGs (one crawl CPG per ganglion) and observed fictive crawl-like bursting in the dorsal-longitudinal-excitor motoneuron (DE-3), an established crawl-monitor neuron. However, these preparations did not exhibit crawl-specific coordination across the CPGs. Although the crawl CPGs always generated bidirectional activation of adjacent CPGs, we never observed crawl-appropriate intersegmental phase delays. Because central circuits alone were unable to organize crawl-specific coordination, we tested the coordinating role of the peripheral nervous system. In transected leeches normally destined for recovery, we removed afferent information to the anterior-most (lead) ganglion located below the nerve-cord transection site. In these dually treated animals, overt crawling was greatly delayed or prevented. After filling the peripheral nerves with Neurobiotin tracer distal to the nerve-root lesion, we found a perfect correlation between regrowth of peripheral neuronal fibers and crawl recovery. Our study establishes that during recovery after injury, crawl-specific intersegmental coordination switches to a new dependence on afferent information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of learning and behavior relies on the use of invasive techniques, which necessitate the use of animal models. However, when different species learn the same task, to what degree are they actually producing the same behavior and engaging homologous neural circuitry? This question has received virtually no recent attention, even as the most powerful new methodologies for measuring and perturbing the nervous system have become increasingly dependent on the use of murine species. Here, we test humans, rats, monkeys, and an evolutionarily intermediate species, tree shrews, on a three alternative, forced choice, visual contrast discrimination task. As anticipated, learning rate, peak performance, and transfer across contrasts was lower in the rat compared to the other species. More interestingly, rats exhibited two major behavioral peculiarities: while monkeys and tree shrews based their choices largely on visual information, rats tended to base their choices on past reward history. Furthermore, as the task became more difficult, rats largely disengaged from the visual stimulus, reverting to innate spatial predispositions in order to collect rewards near chance probability. Our findings highlight the limitation of muridae as models for translational research, at least in the area of visually based decision making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders often manifest in genetically susceptible individuals after psychosocial stress, but the mechanisms underlying these gene-environment interactions are largely unknown. We used the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) mouse model to study resilience and susceptibility to chronic psychosocial stress. We identified a strong genetic background effect in CSDS-induced social avoidance (SA) using four inbred mouse strains: 69% of C57BL/6NCrl (B6), 23% of BALB/cAnNCrl, 19% of 129S2/SvPasCrl, and 5% of DBA/2NCrl (D2) mice were stress resilient. Furthermore, different inbred mouse strains responded differently to stress, suggesting they use distinct coping strategies. To identify biological pathways affected by CSDS, we used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of three brain regions of two strains, B6 and D2: medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), ventral hippocampus (vHPC), and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). We discovered overrepresentation of oligodendrocyte (OLG)-related genes in the differentially expressed gene population. Because OLGs myelinate axons, we measured myelin thickness and found significant region and strain-specific differences. For example, in resilient D2 mice, mPFC axons had thinner myelin than controls, whereas susceptible B6 mice had thinner myelin than controls in the vHPC. Neither myelin-related gene expression in several other regions nor corpus callosum thickness differed between stressed and control animals. Our unbiased gene expression experiment suggests that myelin plasticity is a substantial response to chronic psychosocial stress, varies across brain regions, and is genetically controlled. Identification of genetic regulators of the myelin response will provide mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of stress-related diseases, such as anxiety disorders, a critical step in developing targeted therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Synaptic Mechanisms for Bandwidth Tuning in Awake Mouse Primary Auditory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy165</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy165/5052731?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Spatial size tuning in the visual cortex has been considered as an important neuronal functional property for sensory perception. However, an analogous mechanism in the auditory system has remained controversial. In the present study, cell-attached recordings in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake mice revealed that excitatory neurons can be categorized into three types according to their bandwidth tuning profiles in response to band-passed noise (BPN) stimuli: nonmonotonic (NM), flat, and monotonic, with the latter two considered as non-tuned for bandwidth. The prevalence of bandwidth-tuned (i.e., NM) neurons increases significantly from layer 4 to layer 2/3. With sequential cell-attached and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from the same neurons, we found that the bandwidth preference of excitatory neurons is largely determined by the excitatory synaptic input they receive, and that the bandwidth selectivity is further enhanced by flatly tuned inhibition observed in all cells. The latter can be attributed at least partially to the flat tuning of parvalbumin inhibitory neurons. The tuning of auditory cortical neurons for bandwidth of BPN may contribute to the processing of complex sounds.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Heritability of Regional Brain Volumes in Large-Scale Neuroimaging and Genetic Studies</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain genetics is an active research area. The degree to which genetic variants impact variations in brain structure and function remains largely unknown. We examined the heritability of regional brain volumes (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; ~ 100) captured by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in UK Biobank (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 9000). We found that regional brain volumes are highly heritable in this study population and common genetic variants can explain up to 80% of their variabilities (median heritability 34.8%). We observed omnigenic impact across the genome and examined the enrichment of SNPs in active chromatin regions. Principal components derived from regional volume data are also highly heritable, but the amount of variance in brain volume explained by the component did not seem to be related to its heritability. Heritability estimates vary substantially across large-scale functional networks, exhibit a symmetric pattern across left and right hemispheres, and are consistent in females and males (correlation = 0.638). We repeated the main analysis in Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 1100), Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 600), and Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 500) datasets, which demonstrated that more stable estimates can be obtained from the UK Biobank.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Audio-Tactile and Peripersonal Space Processing Around the Trunk in Human Parietal and Temporal Cortex: An Intracranial EEG Study</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Interactions with the environment happen within one’s peripersonal space (PPS)—the space surrounding the body. Studies in monkeys and humans have highlighted a multisensory distributed cortical network representing the PPS. However, knowledge about the temporal dynamics of PPS processing around the trunk is lacking. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in humans while administering tactile stimulation (T), approaching auditory stimuli (A), and the 2 combined (AT). To map PPS, tactile stimulation was delivered when the sound was far, intermediate, or close to the body. The 19% of the electrodes showed AT multisensory integration. Among those, 30% showed a PPS effect, a modulation of the response as a function of the distance between the sound and body. AT multisensory integration and PPS effects had similar spatiotemporal characteristics, with an early response (~50 ms) in the insular cortex, and later responses (~200 ms) in precentral and postcentral gyri. Superior temporal cortex showed a different response pattern with AT multisensory integration at ~100 ms without a PPS effect. These results, represent the first iEEG delineation of PPS processing in humans and show that PPS and multisensory integration happen at similar neural sites and time periods, suggesting that PPS representation is based on a spatial modulation of multisensory integration.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Anterior Thalamic Excitation and Feedforward Inhibition of Presubicular Neurons Projecting to Medial Entorhinal Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The presubiculum contains head direction cells that are crucial for spatial orientation. Here, we examined the connectivity and strengths of thalamic inputs to presubicular layer 3 neurons projecting to the medial entorhinal cortex in the mouse. We recorded pairs of projection neurons and interneurons while optogenetically stimulating afferent fibers from the anterior thalamic nuclei. Thalamic input differentially affects presubicular neurons: layer 3 pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing interneurons are directly and monosynaptically activated, with depressing dynamics, whereas somatostatin-expressing interneurons are indirectly excited, during repetitive anterior thalamic nuclei activity. This arrangement ensures that the thalamic excitation of layer 3 cells is often followed by disynaptic inhibition. Feedforward inhibition is largely mediated by parvalbumin interneurons, which have a high probability of connection to presubicular pyramidal cells, and it may enforce temporally precise head direction tuning during head turns. Our data point to the potential contribution of presubicular microcircuits for fine-tuning thalamic head direction signals transmitted to medial entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How microcircuits participate in shaping neural inputs is crucial to understanding information processing in the brain. Here, we show how the presubiculum may process thalamic head directional information before transmitting it to the medial entorhinal cortex. Synaptic inputs from the anterior thalamic nuclei excite layer 3 pyramidal cells and parvalbumin interneurons, which mediate disynaptic feedforward inhibition. Somatostatin interneurons are excited indirectly. Presubicular circuits may switch between two regimens depending on the angular velocity of head movements. During immobility, somatostatin-pyramidal cell interactions could support maintained head directional firing with attractor-like dynamics. During rapid head turns, in contrast, parvalbumin-mediated feedforward inhibition may act to tune the head direction signal transmitted to medial entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In language production, humans are confronted with considerable word selection demands. Often, we must select a word from among similar, acceptable, and competing alternative words to construct a sentence that conveys an intended meaning. In recent years, the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) has been identified as being critical to this ability. Despite a recent emphasis on network approaches to understanding language, how the LIFG interacts with the brain's complex networks to facilitate controlled language performance remains unknown. Here, we take a novel approach to understanding word selection as a network control process in the brain. Using an anatomical brain network derived from high-resolution diffusion spectrum imaging, we computed network controllability underlying the site of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the LIFG between administrations of language tasks that vary in response (cognitive control) demands: open-response tasks (word generation) versus closed response tasks (number naming). We found that a statistic that quantifies the LIFG's theoretically predicted control of communication across modules in the human connectome explains TMS-induced changes in open-response language task performance only. Moreover, we found that a statistic that quantifies the LIFG's theoretically predicted control of difficult-to-reach states explains vulnerability to TMS in the closed-ended (but not open-ended) response task. These findings establish a link among network controllability, cognitive function, and TMS effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work illustrates that network control statistics applied to anatomical connectivity data demonstrate relationships with cognitive variability during controlled language tasks and TMS effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: {alpha}2{delta}-1 Is Essential for Sympathetic Output and NMDA Receptor Activity Potentiated by Angiotensin II in the Hypothalamus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Both the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system are critically involved in hypertension development. Although angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulates hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) neurons to increase sympathetic vasomotor tone, the molecular mechanism mediating this action remains unclear. The glutamate NMDAR in the PVN controls sympathetic outflow in hypertension. In this study, we determined the interaction between α2-1 (encoded by &lt;i&gt;Cacna2d1&lt;/i&gt;), commonly known as a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel subunit, and NMDARs in the hypothalamus and its role in Ang II-induced synaptic NMDAR activity in PVN presympathetic neurons. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that α2-1 interacted with the NMDAR in the hypothalamus of male rats and humans (both sexes). Ang II increased the prevalence of synaptic α2-1–NMDAR complexes in the hypothalamus. Also, Ang II increased presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity via AT1 receptors, and such effects were abolished either by treatment with pregabalin, an inhibitory α2-1 ligand, or by interrupting the α2-1–NMDAR interaction with an α2-1 C terminus-interfering peptide. In &lt;i&gt;Cacna2d1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice (both sexes), Ang II failed to affect the presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity of PVN neurons. In addition, the α2-1 C terminus-interfering peptide blocked the sympathoexcitatory response to microinjection of Ang II into the PVN. Our findings indicate that Ang II augments sympathetic vasomotor tone and excitatory glutamatergic input to PVN presympathetic neurons by stimulating α2-1-bound NMDARs at synapses. This information extends our understanding of the molecular basis for the interaction between the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems and suggests new strategies for treating neurogenic hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although both the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system are closely involved in hypertension development, the molecular mechanisms mediating this involvement remain unclear. We showed that α2-1, previously known as a calcium channel subunit, interacts with NMDARs in the hypothalamus of rodents and humans. Angiotensin II (Ang II) increases the synaptic expression level of α2-1–NMDAR complexes. Furthermore, inhibiting α2-1, interrupting the α2-1–NMDAR interaction, or deleting α2-1 abolishes the potentiating effects of Ang II on presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity in the hypothalamus. In addition, the sympathoexcitatory response to Ang II depends on α2-1-bound NMDARs. Thus, α2-1–NMDAR complexes in the hypothalamus serve as an important molecular substrate for the interaction between the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system. This evidence suggests that α2-1 may be a useful target for the treatment neurogenic hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This process, called arealization, depends on the graded expression of transcription factors in neocortical progenitors and postmitotic neurons prenatally, and on external activity-dependent cues driven by thalamocortical axons during postnatal stages. Thalamic inputs are guided within an intrinsically determined genetic framework to selectively target and innervate layer 4 (L4) cortical neurons in a somatotopic manner. L4 spiny stellate neurons are excitatory locally projecting neurons, which undergo a drastic dendrite remodeling during the first postnatal week and represent the principal sensory gateway to the neocortex. In this review, we will discuss the way intrinsic cortical gene regulation and extrinsic activity-dependent inputs instruct the cellular reorganization of L4 spiny stellate neurons, necessary for proper formation of the barrel cortex during the development of primary somatosensory maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Computer modelling of connectivity change suggests epileptogenesis mechanisms in idiopathic generalised epilepsy. (arXiv:1807.03696v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03696</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03696</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) typically have normal
conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hence diagnosis based on MRI is
challenging. Anatomical abnormalities underlying brain dysfunctions in IGE are
unclear and their relation to the pathomechanisms of epileptogenesis is poorly
understood. In this study, we applied connectometry, an advanced quantitative
neuroimaging technique for investigating localised changes in white-matter
tissues in vivo. Analysing white matter structures of 32 subjects we
incorporated our in vivo findings in a computational model of seizure dynamics
to suggest a plausible mechanism of epileptogenesis. Patients with IGE have
significant bilateral alterations in major white-matter fascicles. In cingulum,
fornix, and superior longitudinal fasciculus, tract integrity is compromised,
whereas in specific parts of tracts between thalamus and the precentral gyrus,
tract integrity is enhanced in patients. Incorporating these alterations in a
classification framework, we found that patients and controls are linearly
separable with 81.3% accuracy and 83.3% sensitivity. The computational model,
informed with the findings on the tract abnormalities, specifically highlighted
the importance of enhanced cortico-reticular connections along with impaired
cortico-cortical connections in inducing pathological seizure-like dynamics. We
emphasise taking directionality of brain connectivity into consideration
towards understanding the pathological mechanisms; this is possible by
combining neuroimaging and computational modelling. Our imaging evidence of
structural alterations in IGEs may be applied as non-invasive diagnostic
biomarker. We suggest that impaired connectivity from cortical regions to the
thalamic reticular nucleus offers a therapeutic target for selectively
modifying the brain circuit to reverse the mechanisms leading to
epileptogenesis.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Information-theoretic analysis of realistic odor plumes: What cues are useful for determining location?</title>

Many species rely on olfaction to navigate towards food sources or mates. Olfactory navigation is a challenging task since odor environments are typically turbulent. While time-averaged odor concentration varies smoothly with the distance to the source, instaneous concentrations are intermittent and obtaining stable averages takes longer than the typical intervals between animals’ navigation decisions. How to effectively sample from the odor distribution to determine sampling location is the focus on this article. To investigate which sampling strategies are most informative about the location of an odor source, we recorded three naturalistic stimuli with planar lased-induced fluorescence and used an information-theoretic approach to quantify the information that different sampling strategies provide about sampling location. Specifically, we compared multiple sampling strategies based on a fixed number of coding bits for encoding the olfactory stimulus. When the coding bits were all allocated to representing odor concentration at a single sensor, information rapidly saturated. Using the same number of coding bits in two sensors provides more information, as does coding multiple samples at different times. When accumulating multiple samples at a fixed location, the temporal sequence does not yield a large amount of information and can be averaged with minimal loss. Furthermore, we show that histogram-equalization is not the most efficient way to use coding bits when using the olfactory sample to determine location.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zIMMO9rrGJQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Phase-lags in large scale brain synchronization: Methodological considerations and in-silico analysis</title>

Architecture of phase relationships among neural oscillations is central for their functional significance but has remained theoretically poorly understood. We use phenomenological model of delay-coupled oscillators with increasing degree of topological complexity to identify underlying principles by which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain governs the phase lags between oscillatory activity at distant regions. Phase relations and their regions of stability are derived and numerically confirmed for two oscillators and for networks with randomly distributed or clustered bimodal delays, as a first approximation for the brain structural connectivity. Besides in-phase, clustered delays can induce anti-phase synchronization for certain frequencies, while the sign of the lags is determined by the natural frequencies and by the inhomogeneous network interactions. For in-phase synchronization faster oscillators always phase lead, while stronger connected nodes lag behind the weaker during frequency depression, which consistently arises for in-silico results. If nodes are in anti-phase regime, then a distance &lt;i&gt;π&lt;/i&gt; is added to the in-phase trends. The statistics of the phases is calculated from the phase locking values (PLV), as in many empirical studies, and we scrutinize the method’s impact. The choice of surrogates do not affects the mean of the observed phase lags, but higher significance levels that are generated by some surrogates, cause decreased variance and might fail to detect the generally weaker coherence of the interhemispheric links. These links are also affected by the non-stationary and intermittent synchronization, which causes multimodal phase lags that can be misleading if averaged. Taken together, the results describe quantitatively the impact of the spatio-temporal connectivity of the brain to the synchronization patterns between brain regions, and to uncover mechanisms through which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain renders phases to be distributed around 0 and &lt;i&gt;π&lt;/i&gt;.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Examining the Reversibility of Long-Term Behavioral Disruptions in Progeny of Maternal SSRI Exposure</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0120-18.2018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Serotonergic dysregulation is implicated in numerous psychiatric disorders. Serotonin plays widespread trophic roles during neurodevelopment; thus perturbations to this system during development may increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Epidemiological studies have examined association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment during pregnancy and increased autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring. It is unclear from these studies whether ASD susceptibility is purely related to maternal psychiatric diagnosis, or if treatment poses additional risk. We sought to determine whether maternal SSRI treatment alone or in combination with genetically vulnerable background was sufficient to induce offspring behavior disruptions relevant to ASD. We exposed C57BL/6J or &lt;i&gt;Celf6&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mouse dams to fluoxetine (FLX) during different periods of gestation and lactation and characterized offspring on tasks assessing social communicative interaction and repetitive behavior patterns including sensory sensitivities. We demonstrate robust reductions in pup ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and alterations in social hierarchy behaviors, as well as perseverative behaviors and tactile hypersensitivity. &lt;i&gt;Celf6&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice demonstrate social communicative deficits and perseverative behaviors, without further interaction with FLX. FLX re-exposure in adulthood ameliorates the tactile hypersensitivity yet exacerbates the dominance phenotype. This suggests acute deficiencies in serotonin levels likely underlie the abnormal responses to sensory stimuli, while the social alterations are instead due to altered development of social circuits. These findings indicate maternal FLX treatment, independent of maternal stress, can induce behavioral disruptions in mammalian offspring, thus contributing to our understanding of the developmental role of the serotonin system and the possible risks to offspring of SSRI treatment during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synchronization of finite spike sequences is the way two brain regions
compare their content and extract the most suitable sequence. This is the core
of the linguistic comparison between a word and a previous one retrieved by
memory. Classifying the information content of neural spike trains, an
uncertainty relation emerges between the bit size of a word and its duration.
This uncertainty affects the task of synchronizing spike trains of different
duration representing different words, entailing the occurrence of entangled
sequences, so that word comparison amounts to a measurement based quantum
computation. Entanglement explains the inverse Bayes inference that connects
different words in a linguistic search. The behaviour here discussed provides
an explanation for other reported evidences of quantum effects in human
cognitive processes lacking a plausible framework, since either no assignment
of an appropriate quantum constant had been associated, or speculating on
microscopic processes dependent on Planck's constant resulted in unrealistic
de-coherence times.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fiber photometry permits monitoring fluorescent indicators of neural activity
in behaving animals. Optical fibers are typically used to excite and collect
fluorescence from genetically-encoded calcium indicators expressed by a subset
of neurons in a circuit of interest. However, a quantitative understanding of
the brain volumes from which signal is collected and how this depends on the
properties of the optical fibers are lacking. Here we analytically model and
experimentally measure the light emission and collection fields for optical
fibers in solution and scattering tissue, providing a comprehensive
characterization of fibers commonly employed for fiber photometry. Since
photometry signals depend on both excitation and collection efficiency, a
combined confocal/2-photon microscope was developed to evaluate these
parameters independently. We find that the 80% of the effective signal arises
from a 10^5-10^6 um3 volume extending ~200 um from the fiber face, and thus

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The permutation test is known as the exact test procedure in statistics.
However, often it is not exact in practice and only an approximate method since
only a small fraction of every possible permutation is generated. Even for a
small sample size, it often requires to generate tens of thousands
permutations, which can be a serious computational bottleneck. In this paper,
we propose a novel combinatorial inference procedure that enumerates all
possible permutations combinatorially without any resampling. The proposed
method is validated against the standard permutation test in simulation studies
with the ground truth. The method is further applied in twin DTI study in
determining the genetic contribution of the minimum spanning tree of the
structural brain connectivity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: An ALE meta-analytic comparison of verbal working memory tasks. (arXiv:1807.02755v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02755</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02755</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The n-back and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) are
commonly used verbal working memory tasks that have partially overlapping uses
in clinical and experimental psychology. We performed three activation
likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses, comparing two load levels of the
n-back task (2-back, 3-back) to the PASAT and to each-other. These analyses
aimed to determine the involvement of cognitive and emotional brain regions for
these tasks. Results: We observed higher overall likelihood of activation the
frontal eye fields in the 3-back. The PASAT exhibited higher overall activation
in the bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMA), left supramarginal gyrus, and
left superior parietal lobule. Furthermore, the 3-back exhibited higher
activation in the right SMA, and anterior mid-cingulate cortex versus the
2-back, and the PASAT exhibited higher activation in a cluster near the right
premotor area versus the 2-back. A laterality effect was observed in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the PASAT (left) and 3-back(right).
These data suggest greater activation of regions traditionally associated with
the phonological loop during the PASAT, compared to the 2- and 3-back tasks.
Furthermore, individual ALE analyses suggest involvement of emotional
processing and salience network regions (insula, cingulate) in addition to the
well-established verbal working memory regions (Broca's region, bilateral SMA,
premotor, posterior parietal cortices) in all 3 tasks. Conclusions: Here we
identify regions activated by the PASAT, which has not been meta-analytically
reviewed prior to this study. Using ALE meta-analysis, we have also identified
meaningful differences in activation associated with specific cognitive and
emotional aspects of verbal working memory during these tasks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A convex code is a binary code generated by the pattern of intersections of a
collection of open convex sets in some Euclidean space. Convex codes are
relevant to neuroscience as they arise from the activity of neurons that have
convex receptive fields. In this paper, we use algebraic methods to determine
if a code is convex. Specifically, we use the neural ideal of a code, which is
a generalization of the Stanley-Reisner ideal. Using the neural ideal together
with its standard generating set, the canonical form, we provide algebraic
signatures of certain families of codes that are non-convex. We connect these
signatures to the precise conditions on the arrangement of sets that prevent
the codes from being convex. Finally, we also provide algebraic signatures for
some families of codes that are convex, including the class of
intersection-complete codes. These results allow us to detect convexity and
non-convexity in a variety of situations, and point to some interesting open
questions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Gradient Hyperalignment for multi-subject fMRI data alignment. (arXiv:1807.02612v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-subject fMRI data analysis is an interesting and challenging problem in
human brain decoding studies. The inherent anatomical and functional
variability across subjects make it necessary to do both anatomical and
functional alignment before classification analysis. Besides, when it comes to
big data, time complexity becomes a problem that cannot be ignored. This paper
proposes Gradient Hyperalignment (Gradient-HA) as a gradient-based functional
alignment method that is suitable for multi-subject fMRI datasets with large
amounts of samples and voxels. The advantage of Gradient-HA is that it can
solve independence and high dimension problems by using Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) and Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA). Validation using
multi-classification tasks on big data demonstrates that Gradient-HA method has
less time complexity and better or comparable performance compared with other
state-of-the-art functional alignment methods.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: NMDA Receptor-Mediated Motor Cortex Plasticity After 20 Hz Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been shown to modulate neural oscillations and excitability levels in the primary motor cortex (M1). These effects can last for more than an hour and an involvement of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;-methyl-&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) mediated synaptic plasticity has been suggested. However, to date the cortical mechanisms underlying tACS after-effects have not been explored. Here, we applied 20 Hz beta tACS to M1 while participants received either the NMDAR antagonist dextromethorphan or a placebo and the effects on cortical beta oscillations and excitability were explored. When a placebo medication was administered, beta tACS was found to increase cortical excitability and beta oscillations for at least 60 min, whereas when dextromethorphan was administered, these effects were completely abolished. These results provide the first direct evidence that tACS can induce NMDAR-mediated plasticity in the motor cortex, which contributes to our understanding of tACS-induced influences on human motor cortex physiology.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Microglia: An Intrinsic Component of the Proliferative Zones in the Fetal Rhesus Monkey (Macaca mulatta) Cerebral Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Microglial cells are increasingly recognized as modulators of brain development. We previously showed that microglia colonize the cortical proliferative zones in the prenatal brain and regulate the number of precursor cells through phagocytosis. To better define cellular interactions between microglia and proliferative cells, we performed lentiviral vector-mediated intraventricular gene transfer to induce enhanced green fluorescent protein expression in fetal cerebrocortical cells. Tissues were collected and counterstained with cell-specific markers to label microglial cells and identify other cortical cell types. We found that microglial cells intimately interact with the radial glial scaffold and make extensive contacts with neural precursor cells throughout the proliferative zones, particularly in the rhesus monkey fetus when compared to rodents. We also identify a subtype of microglia, which we term ‘periventricular microglia’, that interact closely with mitotic precursor cells in the ventricular zone. Our data suggest that microglia are structural modulators that facilitate remodeling of the proliferative zones as precursor cells migrate away from the ventricle and may facilitate the delamination of precursor cells. Taken together, these results indicate that microglial cells are an integral component of cortical proliferative zones and contribute to the interactive milieu in which cortical precursor cells function.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Sleep plays an important role in the consolidation of recent memories. However, the cellular and synaptic mechanisms of consolidation during sleep remain poorly understood. In this study, using a realistic computational model of the thalamocortical network, we tested the role of Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep in memory consolidation. We found that sleep spindles (the hallmark of N2 stage sleep) and slow oscillations (the hallmark of N3 stage sleep) both promote replay of the spike sequences learned in the awake state and replay was localized at the trained network locations. Memory performance improved after a period of NREM sleep but not after the same time period in awake. When multiple memories were trained, the local nature of the spike sequence replay during spindles allowed replay of the distinct memory traces independently, while slow oscillations promoted competition that could prevent replay of the weak memories in a presence of the stronger memory traces. This could lead to extinction of the weak memories unless when sleep spindles (N2 sleep) preceded slow oscillations (N3 sleep), as observed during the natural sleep cycle. Our study presents a mechanistic explanation for the role of sleep rhythms in memory consolidation and proposes a testable hypothesis how the natural structure of sleep stages provides an optimal environment to consolidate memories.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jzS-ldh1Muw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The importance of mechanical constraints for proper polarization and psuedo-cleavage furrow generation in the early &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryo</title>

Intracellular polarization, where a cell specifies a spatial axis by segregation of specific factors, is a fundamental biological process. In the early embryo of the nematode worm &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)&lt;/i&gt;, polarization is often accompanied by deformations of the cortex, a highly contractile structure consisting of actin filaments cross-linked by the motor protein myosin (actomyosin). It has been suggested that the eggshell surrounding the early embryo plays a role in polarization although its function is not understood. Here we develop a mathematical model which couples a reaction-diffusion model of actomyosin dynamics with a phase field model of the cell cortex to implicitly track cell shape changes in the early &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; embryo. We investigate the potential rigidity effect of the geometric constraint imposed by the presence and size of the eggshell on polarization dynamics. Our model suggests that the geometric constraint of the eggshell is essential for proper polarization and the size of the eggshell also affects the dynamics of polarization. Therefore, we conclude that geometric constraint on a cell might affect the dynamics of a biochemical process.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S0GKlDO6sm0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006292</guid>

Neurons process and convey information by transforming barrages of synaptic inputs into spiking activity. Synaptic inhibition typically suppresses the output firing activity of a neuron, and is commonly classified as having a &lt;i&gt;subtractive&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;divisive&lt;/i&gt; effect on a neuron’s output firing activity. Subtractive inhibition can narrow the range of inputs that evoke spiking activity by eliminating responses to non-preferred inputs. Divisive inhibition is a form of gain control: it modifies firing rates while preserving the range of inputs that evoke firing activity. Since these two “modes” of inhibition have distinct impacts on neural coding, it is important to understand the biophysical mechanisms that distinguish these response profiles. In this study, we use simulations and mathematical analysis of a neuron model to find the specific conditions (parameter sets) for which inhibitory inputs have subtractive or divisive effects. Significantly, we identify a novel role for the A-type Potassium current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;). In our model, this fast-activating, slowly-inactivating outward current acts as a switch between subtractive and divisive inhibition. In particular, if &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is strong (large maximal conductance) and fast (activates on a time-scale similar to spike initiation), then inhibition has a subtractive effect on neural firing. In contrast, if &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is weak or insufficiently fast-activating, then inhibition has a divisive effect on neural firing. We explain these findings using dynamical systems methods (plane analysis and fast-slow dissection) to define how a spike threshold condition depends on synaptic inputs and &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Our findings suggest that neurons can “self-regulate” the gain control effects of inhibition via combinations of synaptic plasticity and/or modulation of the conductance and kinetics of A-type Potassium channels. This novel role for &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; would add flexibility to neurons and networks, and may relate to recent observations of divisive inhibitory effects on neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FDIMHtgjtOc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of learning and behavior relies on the use of invasive techniques, which necessitate the use of animal models. However when different species learn the same task, to what degree are they actually producing the same behavior and engaging homologous neural circuitry? This question has received virtually no recent attention, even as the most powerful new methodologies for measuring and perturbing the nervous system have become increasingly dependent on the use of murine species. Here we test Humans, Rats, Monkeys, and an evolutionarily intermediate species, Tree Shrews, on a three alternative, forced choice, visual contrast discrimination task. As anticipated, learning rate, peak performance and transfer across contrasts was lower in the rat compared to the other species. More interestingly, Rats exhibited two major behavioral peculiarities: While Monkeys and Tree Shrews based their choices largely on visual information, Rats tended to base their choices on past reward history. Furthermore, as the task became more difficult, Rats largely disengaged from the visual stimulus, reverting to innate spatial predispositions in order to collect rewards near chance probability. Our findings highlight the limitation of muridae as models for translational research, at least in the area of visually based decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Research into the biology of cognition and behavior increasingly relies on studies performed in murine species (mice and rats). This is due to the explosion of powerful new, murine specific, genetic tools allowing for unprecedented control in imaging and manipulation of neural circuit elements. Lacking, are concomitant comparative behavioral studies necessary toward translating these exciting results to other species, particularly humans. We show here that, unlike primates, muridae incorporate species-specific predispositions and bias into their behavioral strategy toward the solution of a simple visual task, and are therefore engaging specific circuits not used by primates during task performance. This contradicts the long held idea that learning abolishes species-specific predispositions, and highlights the importance of comparative behavioral studies in translational neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Age-dependent Pavlovian biases influence motor decision-making</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006304</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiuli Chen, Robb B. Rutledge, Harriet R. Brown, Raymond J. Dolan, Sven Bestmann, Joseph M. Galea&lt;/p&gt;

Motor decision-making is an essential component of everyday life which requires weighing potential rewards and punishments against the probability of successfully executing an action. To achieve this, humans rely on two key mechanisms; a flexible, instrumental, value-dependent process and a hardwired, Pavlovian, value-independent process. In economic decision-making, age-related decline in risk taking is explained by reduced Pavlovian biases that promote action toward reward. Although healthy ageing has also been associated with decreased risk-taking in motor decision-making, it is currently unknown whether this is a result of changes in Pavlovian biases, instrumental processes or a combination of both. Using a newly established approach-avoidance computational model together with a novel app-based motor decision-making task, we measured sensitivity to reward and punishment when participants (n = 26,532) made a ‘go/no-go’ motor gamble based on their perceived ability to execute a complex action. We show that motor decision-making can be better explained by a model with both instrumental and Pavlovian parameters, and reveal age-related changes across punishment- and reward-based instrumental and Pavlovian processes. However, the most striking effect of ageing was a decrease in Pavlovian attraction towards rewards, which was associated with a reduction in optimality of choice behaviour. In a subset of participants who also played an independent economic decision-making task (n = 17,220), we found similar decision-making tendencies for motor and economic domains across a majority of age groups. Pavlovian biases, therefore, play an important role in not only explaining motor decision-making behaviour but also the changes which occur through normal ageing. This provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms which shape motor decision-making across the lifespan.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7I9gI6jfrH8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Temporally ordered multi-neuron patterns likely encode information in the brain. We introduce an unsupervised method, SPOTDisClust (Spike Pattern Optimal Transport Dissimilarity Clustering), for their detection from high-dimensional neural ensembles. SPOTDisClust measures similarity between two ensemble spike patterns by determining the minimum transport cost of transforming their corresponding normalized cross-correlation matrices into each other (SPOTDis). Then, it performs density-based clustering based on the resulting inter-pattern dissimilarity matrix. SPOTDisClust does not require binning and can detect complex patterns (beyond sequential activation) even when high levels of out-of-pattern “noise” spiking are present. Our method handles efficiently the additional information from increasingly large neuronal ensembles and can detect a number of patterns that far exceeds the number of recorded neurons. In an application to neural ensemble data from macaque monkey V1 cortex, SPOTDisClust can identify different moving stimulus directions on the sole basis of temporal spiking patterns.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ve-KmnATpsw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In experimental assays of angiogenesis in three-dimensional fibrin matrices, a temporary scaffold formed during wound healing, the type and composition of fibrin impacts the level of sprouting. More sprouts form on high molecular weight (HMW) than on low molecular weight (LMW) fibrin. It is unclear what mechanisms regulate the number and the positions of the vascular-like structures in cell cultures. To address this question, we propose a mechanistic simulation model of endothelial cell migration and fibrin proteolysis by the plasmin system. The model is a hybrid, cell-based and continuum, computational model based on the cellular Potts model and sets of partial-differential equations. Based on the model results, we propose that a positive feedback mechanism between uPAR, plasmin and transforming growth factor &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1 (TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1) selects cells in the monolayer for matrix invasion. Invading cells releases TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1 from the extracellular matrix through plasmin-mediated fibrin degradation. The activated TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1 further stimulates fibrin degradation and keeps proteolysis active as the sprout invades the fibrin matrix. The binding capacity for TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1 of LMW is reduced relative to that of HMW. This leads to reduced activation of proteolysis and, consequently, reduced cell ingrowth in LMW fibrin compared to HMW fibrin. Thus our model predicts that endothelial cells in LMW fibrin matrices compared to HMW matrices show reduced sprouting due to a lower bio-availability of TGF&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dJeJLhtrNNo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Subgraphs of functional brain networks identify dynamical constraints of cognitive control</title>

Brain anatomy and physiology support the human ability to navigate a complex space of perceptions and actions. To maneuver across an ever-changing landscape of mental states, the brain invokes cognitive control—a set of dynamic processes that engage and disengage different groups of brain regions to modulate attention, switch between tasks, and inhibit prepotent responses. Current theory posits that correlated and anticorrelated brain activity may signify cooperative and competitive interactions between brain areas that subserve adaptive behavior. In this study, we use a quantitative approach to identify distinct topological motifs of functional interactions and examine how their expression relates to cognitive control processes and behavior. In particular, we acquire fMRI BOLD signal in twenty-eight healthy subjects as they perform two cognitive control tasks—a Stroop interference task and a local-global perception switching task using Navon figures—each with low and high cognitive control demand conditions. Based on these data, we construct dynamic functional brain networks and use a parts-based, network decomposition technique called non-negative matrix factorization to identify putative cognitive control subgraphs whose temporal expression captures distributed network structures involved in different phases of cooperative and competitive control processes. Our results demonstrate that temporal expression of the subgraphs fluctuate alongside changes in cognitive demand and are associated with individual differences in task performance. These findings offer insight into how coordinated changes in the cooperative and competitive roles of cognitive systems map trajectories between cognitively demanding brain states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XzG9sFK-qtk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Organization of Neural Population Code in Mouse Visual System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0414-17.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mammalian visual system consists of several anatomically distinct areas, layers, and cell types. To understand the role of these subpopulations in visual information processing, we analyzed neural signals recorded from excitatory neurons from various anatomical and functional structures. For each of 186 mice, one of six genetically tagged cell-types and one of six visual areas were targeted while the mouse was passively viewing various visual stimuli. We trained linear classifiers to decode one of six visual stimulus categories with distinct spatiotemporal structures from the population neural activity. We found that neurons in both the primary visual cortex and secondary visual areas show varying degrees of stimulus-specific decodability, and neurons in superficial layers tend to be more informative about the stimulus categories. Additional decoding analyses of directional motion were consistent with these findings. We observed synergy in the population code of direction in several visual areas suggesting area-specific organization of information representation across neurons. These differences in decoding capacities shed light on the specialized organization of neural information processing across anatomically distinct subpopulations, and further establish the mouse as a model for understanding visual perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This analysis is one of the first of the Allen Brain Observatory’s visual cortex dataset. The mouse has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to primates and carnivorous species as a model for studying visual perception. Mice offer the benefit of large-scale, high-throughput experiments and sophisticated genetic tools useful to investigating highly specific components of visual perception. Preliminary work in identifying the functional organization of mouse extrastriate areas has focused on single neurons and lacks analysis at the population level. Our population decoding analysis contributes novel evidence about the role of many distinct areas and layers of the mouse visual cortex in visual information processing to further establish the mouse as a viable model for future visual system research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Bidirectional Control of Risk-Seeking Behavior by the Basolateral Amygdala</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Decision-making under risk entails the possibility of simultaneously receiving positive (reward) and negative (punishment) stimuli. To learn in this context, one must integrate conflicting information related to the magnitude of reward and the probability of punishment. Long-term inactivation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) disrupts this process and increases risky behavior. In a recent study published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, Orisini et al., (2017) showed that briefly inhibiting the basolateral amygdala (BLA) may result in increased or decreased risk-taking behavior, depending on the phase of the decision process in which BLA activity is disrupted. Here we discuss the results and propose future experiments that could improve our understanding of how the BLA contributes to adaptive learning under risk and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: G9a/GLP Complex Acts as a Bidirectional Switch to Regulate Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor-Dependent Plasticity in Hippocampal CA1 Pyramidal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy161</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy161/5049853?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) is conventionally considered to be solely dependent on local protein synthesis. Given the impact of epigenetics on memory, the intriguing question is whether epigenetic regulation influences mGluR-LTD as well. G9a/GLP histone lysine methyltransferase complex is crucial for brain development and goal-directed learning as well as for drug-addiction. In this study, we analyzed whether the epigenetic regulation by G9a/GLP complex affects mGluR-LTD in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons of 5–7 weeks old male Wistar rats. In hippocampal slices with intact CA1 dendritic regions, inhibition of G9a/GLP activity abolished mGluR-LTD. The inhibition of this complex upregulated the expression of plasticity proteins like PKMζ, which mediated the prevention of mGluR-LTD expression by regulating the NSF-GluA2-mediated trafficking of AMPA receptors towards the postsynaptic site. G9a/GLP inhibition during the induction of mGluR-LTD also downregulated the protein levels of phosphorylated-GluA2 and Arc. Interestingly, G9a/GLP inhibition could not impede the mGluR-LTD when the cell-body was severed. Our study highlights the role of G9a/GLP complex in intact neuronal network as a bidirectional switch; when turned on, it facilitates the expression of mGluR-LTD, and when turned off, it promotes the expression of long-term potentiation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cortical Neuron Migration and Dendrite Morphology are Regulated by Carboxypeptidase E</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Higher brain function relies on proper development of the cerebral cortex, including correct positioning of neurons and dendrite morphology. Disruptions in these processes may result in various neurocognitive disorders. Mutations in the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CPE&lt;/span&gt; gene, which encodes carboxypeptidase E (CPE), have been linked to depression and intellectual disability. However, it remains unclear whether CPE is involved in early brain development and in turn contributes to the pathophysiology of neurocognitive disorders. Here, we investigate the effects of CPE knockdown on early brain development and explore the functional significance of the interaction between CPE and its binding partner p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt;. We demonstrate that CPE is required for cortical neuron migration and dendrite arborization. Furthermore, we show that expression of CPE-C10 redistributes p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt; from the centrosome and that disruption of CPE interaction with p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt; leads to abnormal neuronal migration and dendrite morphology, suggesting that a complex between CPE and p150&lt;sup&gt;Glued&lt;/sup&gt; is necessary for proper neurodevelopment.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Elucidating axonal and dendritic projection patterns of individual neurons is a key for understanding the cytoarchitecture of neural circuits in the brain. This requires genetic approaches to achieve Golgi-like sparse labeling of desired types of neurons. Here, we explored a novel strategy of stochastic gene activation with regulated sparseness (STARS), in which the stochastic choice between 2 competing Cre-&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;lox&lt;/span&gt; recombination events is controlled by varying the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;lox&lt;/span&gt; efficiency and cassette length. In a created STARS transgenic mouse crossed with various Cre driver lines, sparse neuronal labeling with a relatively uniform level of sparseness was achieved across different brain regions and cell types in both central and peripheral nervous systems. Tracing of individual type II peripheral auditory fibers revealed for the first time that they undergo experience-dependent developmental refinement, which is impaired by attenuating external sound input. Our results suggest that STARS strategy can be applied for circuit mapping and sparse gene manipulation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Basis of Sensorimotor Plasticity in Speech Motor Adaptation</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;When we speak, we get correlated sensory feedback from speech sounds and from the muscles and soft tissues of the vocal tract. Here we dissociate the contributions of auditory and somatosensory feedback to identify brain networks that underlie the somatic contribution to speech motor learning. The technique uses a robotic device that selectively alters somatosensory inputs in combination with resting-state fMRI scans that reveal learning-related changes in functional connectivity. A partial correlation analysis is used to identify connectivity changes that are not explained by the time course of activity in any other learning-related areas. This analysis revealed changes related to behavioral improvements in movement and separately, to changes in auditory perception: Speech motor adaptation itself was associated with connectivity changes that were primarily in non-motor areas of brain, specifically, to a strengthening of connectivity between auditory and somatosensory cortex and between presupplementary motor area and the inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, connectively changes associated with alterations to auditory perception were restricted to speech motor areas, specifically, primary motor cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. Overall, our findings show that during adaptation, somatosensory inputs result in a broad range of changes in connectivity in areas associated with speech motor control and learning.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neuronal Mechanisms Recording the Stream of Consciousness–A Reappraisal of Wilder Penfield’s (1891–1976) Concept of Experiential Phenomena Elicited by Electrical Stimulation of the Human Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Research on memory has been a major focus in the neurosciences over the past decades. An important advance was achieved by Wilder Penfield at the Montreal Neurological Institute, who reported from the 1930s to the 1950s about experiential phenomena induced by electrical brain stimulation in humans, implying neuronal causation of memory. Since then, neuroscientists have addressed the topic of memory from a range of subdisciplines; however, these reports by Penfield and his group as well as those on patient H. M. by Brenda Milner at the same institution continue to be referenced as groundbreaking. Further experimental work by Nobel laureates Eric Kandel and John O’Keefe, as well as by Edvard and May-Britt Moser related Penfield’s patient documentation to experiential phenomena. However, our reassessment of Penfield’s original patient documentation questions the stance that he had uncovered the “storehouse of memories.” Human memory must be regarded more as context sensitive and as representative of an active reconstructive process, than as a simple recording of events. Hence, strategies aiming at naturalizing all phenomena of mind (including memory) to cellular and molecular mechanisms cannot convincingly refer to Penfield’s electrophysiological studies alone as evidence that memories are solely caused by neuronal firing patterns.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

At excitatory synapses, activation of NMDA receptors by glutamate leads to calcium influx triggering intracellular pathways that promote the trafficking of AMPA receptors to the post-synaptic membrane and actin remodeling. New evidence shows that Wnt secreted proteins, known for their role in synapse development, are essential for early stages of long-term potentiation, a form of plasticity that increases synaptic strength. Here, we review recent progress in this area and the significance of Wnt signaling to synaptic plasticity in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>A key component of current theories of brain structure and function is the layer-specific origin of structural connections of the cerebral cortex. This fundamental connectional feature pertains to different mammalian cortices, and recent neuroimaging advancements have started to pave the way for its function-based mapping in humans. Here, we propose a framework that systematically explains the characteristic layer-specific origin of structural connections and its graded variation across the cortical sheet and across mammalian species.</description>
