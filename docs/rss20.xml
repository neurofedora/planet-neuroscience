	<title>Annals of Neurology: Characterization of the GABRB2 associated neurodevelopmental disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25985</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25985?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
We aimed to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and functional consequences associated with variants in the gene GABRB2, coding for the GABAA receptor subunit β2.


Methods
We recruited and systematically evaluated 25 individuals with variants in GABRB2, 17 of whom are newly described and 8 previously reported with additional clinical data. Functional analysis was performed using a Xenopus laevis oocyte model system.


Results
Our cohort of 25 individuals from 22 families with variants in GABRB2 demonstrated a range of epilepsy phenotypes from genetic generalized epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Fifty‐eight percent of individuals had pharmaco‐resistant epilepsy; response to medications targeting the GABAergic pathway was inconsistent. Developmental disability (present in 84%) ranged from mild intellectual disability to severe global disability; movement disorders (present in 44%) included choreoathetosis, dystonia and ataxia. Disease‐associated variants cluster in the extracellular N‐terminus and transmembrane domains 1–3, with more severe phenotypes seen in association with variants in transmembrane domains 1 and 2 and the allosteric binding site between transmembrane domains 2 and 3. Functional analysis of 4 variants in transmembrane domains 1 or 2 (p.Ile246Thr, p.Pro252Leu, p.Ile288Ser, p.Val282Ala) revealed strongly reduced amplitudes of GABA‐evoked anionic currents.


Interpretation
GABRB2‐related epilepsy ranges broadly in severity from genetic generalized epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. Developmental disability and movement disorder are key features. The phenotypic spectrum is comparable to other GABAA receptor‐encoding genes. Phenotypic severity varied by protein domain. Experimental evidence supports loss of GABA‐ergic inhibition as the mechanism underlying GABRB2‐associated neurodevelopmental disorders.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we investigate the usage of machine learning for interpreting
measured sensor values in sensor modules. In particular we analyze the
potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) on low-cost micro-controllers
with a few kilobytes of memory to semantically enrich data captured by sensors.
The focus is on classifying temporal data series with a high level of
reliability. Design and implementation of ANNs are analyzed considering Feed
Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We
validate the developed ANNs in a case study of optical hand gesture recognition
on an 8-bit micro-controller. The best reliability was found for an FFNN with
two layers and 1493 parameters requiring an execution time of 36 ms. We propose
a workflow to develop ANNs for embedded devices.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based inference on battery-powered devices
can be made more energy-efficient by restricting the synaptic weights to be
binary, hence eliminating the need to perform multiplications. An alternative,
emerging, approach relies on the use of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs),
biologically inspired, dynamic, event-driven models that enhance energy
efficiency via the use of binary, sparse, activations. In this paper, an SNN
model is introduced that combines the benefits of temporally sparse binary
activations and of binary weights. Two learning rules are derived, the first
based on the combination of straight-through and surrogate gradient techniques,
and the second based on a Bayesian paradigm. Experiments validate the
performance loss with respect to full-precision implementations, and
demonstrate the advantage of the Bayesian paradigm in terms of accuracy and
calibration.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tangled Program Graph (TPG) is a reinforcement learning technique based on
genetic programming concepts. On state-of-the-art learning environments, TPGs
have been shown to offer comparable competence with Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs), for a fraction of their computational and storage cost. This lightness
of TPGs, both for training and inference, makes them an interesting model to
implement Artificial Intelligences (AIs) on embedded systems with limited
computational and storage resources. In this paper, we introduce the Gegelati
library for TPGs. Besides introducing the general concepts and features of the
library, two main contributions are detailed in the paper: 1/ The
parallelization of the deterministic training process of TPGs, for supporting
heterogeneous Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chips (MPSoCs). 2/ The support for
customizable instruction sets and data types within the genetically evolved
programs of the TPG model. The scalability of the parallel training process is
demonstrated through experiments on architectures ranging from a high-end
24-core processor to a low-power heterogeneous MPSoC. The impact of
customizable instructions on the outcome of a training process is demonstrated
on a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning environment. CCS Concepts:
$\bullet$ Computer systems organization $\rightarrow$ Embedded systems;
$\bullet$ Computing methodologies $\rightarrow$ Machine learning.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this short note, we describe our submission to the NeurIPS 2020 BBO
challenge. Motivated by the fact that different optimizers work well on
different problems, our approach \emph{switches} between different
optimizers.\footnote{Switching between algorithms also relates to work on
\emph{chaining} or \emph{algorithm schedules}.} Since the team names on the
competition's leaderboard were randomly generated &quot;alliteration nicknames&quot;,
consisting of an adjective and an animal with the same initial letter, we
called our approach the \emph{Switching Squirrel}, or here, short,
\emph{Squirrel}. Our reference implementation of Squirrel is available at
\url{https://github.com/automl/Squirrel-Optimizer-BBO-NeurIPS20-automlorg}.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To handle different types of Many-Objective Optimization Problems (MaOPs),
Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MaOEAs) need to simultaneously maintain
convergence and population diversity in the high-dimensional objective space.
In order to balance the relationship between diversity and convergence, we
introduce a Kernel Matrix and probability model called Determinantal Point
Processes (DPPs). Our Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm with Determinantal
Point Processes (MaOEADPPs) is presented and compared with several
state-of-the-art algorithms on various types of MaOPs \textcolor{blue}{with
different numbers of objectives}. The experimental results demonstrate that
MaOEADPPs is competitive.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain is composed of electrically excitable neuronal networks regulated
by the activity of voltage-gated ion channels. Further portraying the molecular
composition of the brain, however, will not reveal anything remotely
reminiscent of a feeling, a sensation or a conscious experience. In classical
physics, addressing the mind-brain problem is a formidable task because no
physical mechanism is able to explain how the brain generates the unobservable,
inner psychological world of conscious experiences and how in turn those
conscious experiences steer the underlying brain processes toward desired
behavior. Yet, this setback does not establish that consciousness is
non-physical. Modern quantum physics affirms the interplay between two types of
physical entities in Hilbert space: unobservable quantum states, which are
vectors describing what exists in the physical world, and quantum observables,
which are operators describing what can be observed in quantum measurements.
Quantum no-go theorems further provide a framework for studying quantum brain
dynamics, which has to be governed by a physically admissible Hamiltonian.
Comprising consciousness of unobservable quantum information integrated in
quantum brain states explains the origin of the inner privacy of conscious
experiences and revisits the dynamic timescale of conscious processes to
picosecond conformational transitions of neural biomolecules. The observable
brain is then an objective construction created from classical bits of
information, which are bound by Holevo's theorem, and obtained through the
measurement of quantum brain observables. Thus, quantum information theory
clarifies the distinction between the unobservable mind and the observable
brain, and supports a solid physical foundation for consciousness research.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Joint analysis of structural connectivity and cortical surface features: correlates with mild traumatic brain injury. (arXiv:2012.03671v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03671</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03671</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a complex syndrome that affects up to
600 per 100,000 individuals, with a particular concentration among military
personnel. About half of all mTBI patients experience a diverse array of
chronic symptoms which persist long after the acute injury. Hence, there is an
urgent need for better understanding of the white matter and gray matter
pathologies associated with mTBI to map which specific brain systems are
impacted and identify courses of intervention. Previous works have linked mTBI
to disruptions in white matter pathways and cortical surface abnormalities.
Herein, we examine these hypothesized links in an exploratory study of joint
structural connectivity and cortical surface changes associated with mTBI and
its chronic symptoms. Briefly, we consider a cohort of 12 mTBI and 26 control
subjects. A set of 588 cortical surface metrics and 4,753 structural
connectivity metrics were extracted from cortical surface regions and diffusion
weighted magnetic resonance imaging in each subject. Principal component
analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of each metric set. We
then applied independent component analysis (ICA) both to each PCA space
individually and together in a joint ICA approach. We identified a stable
independent component across the connectivity-only and joint ICAs which
presented significant group differences in subject loadings (p&amp;lt;0.05,
corrected). Additionally, we found that two mTBI symptoms, slowed thinking and
forgetfulness, were significantly correlated (p&amp;lt;0.05, corrected) with mTBI
subject loadings in a surface-only ICA. These surface-only loadings captured an
increase in bilateral cortical thickness.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning on tree data has been mostly focused on trees as input. Much
less research has investigates trees as output, like in molecule optimization
for drug discovery or hint generation for intelligent tutoring systems. In this
work, we propose a novel autoencoder approach, called recursive tree grammar
autoencoder (RTG-AE), which encodes trees via a bottom-up parser and decodes
trees via a tree grammar, both controlled by neural networks that minimize the
variational autoencoder loss. The resulting encoding and decoding functions can
then be employed in subsequent tasks, such as optimization and time series
prediction. RTG-AE combines variational autoencoders, grammatical knowledge,
and recursive processing. Our key message is that this combination improves
performance compared to only combining two of these three components. In
particular, we show experimentally that our proposed method improves the
autoencoding error, training time, and optimization score on four benchmark
datasets compared to baselines from the literature.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16262</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In today's clinical practice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely
accelerated through subsampling of the associated Fourier domain. Currently,
the construction of these subsampling strategies - known as experimental design
- relies primarily on heuristics. We propose to learn experimental design
strategies for accelerated MRI with policy gradient methods. Unexpectedly, our
experiments show that a simple greedy approximation of the objective leads to
solutions nearly on-par with the more general non-greedy approach. We offer a
partial explanation for this phenomenon rooted in greater variance in the
non-greedy objective's gradient estimates, and experimentally verify that this
variance hampers non-greedy models in adapting their policies to individual MR
images. We empirically show that this adaptivity is key to improving
subsampling designs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a new class of time-continuous recurrent neural network models.
Instead of declaring a learning system's dynamics by implicit nonlinearities,
we construct networks of linear first-order dynamical systems modulated via
nonlinear interlinked gates. The resulting models represent dynamical systems
with varying (i.e., liquid) time-constants coupled to their hidden state, with
outputs being computed by numerical differential equation solvers. These neural
networks exhibit stable and bounded behavior, yield superior expressivity
within the family of neural ordinary differential equations, and give rise to
improved performance on time-series prediction tasks. To demonstrate these
properties, we first take a theoretical approach to find bounds over their
dynamics and compute their expressive power by the trajectory length measure in
latent trajectory space. We then conduct a series of time-series prediction
experiments to manifest the approximation capability of Liquid Time-Constant
Networks (LTCs) compared to classical and modern RNNs. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/raminmh/liquid_time_constant_networks

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Analogy is core to human cognition. It allows us to solve problems based on
prior experience, it governs the way we conceptualize new information, and it
even influences our visual perception. The importance of analogy to humans has
made it an active area of research in the broader field of artificial
intelligence, resulting in data-efficient models that learn and reason in
human-like ways. While cognitive perspectives of analogy and deep learning have
generally been studied independently of one another, the integration of the two
lines of research is a promising step towards more robust and efficient
learning techniques. As part of a growing body of research on such an
integration, we introduce the Analogical Matching Network: a neural
architecture that learns to produce analogies between structured, symbolic
representations that are largely consistent with the principles of

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Feed-forward and noise-tolerant detection of feature homogeneity in spiking networks with a latency code. (arXiv:1806.03881v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In studies of the visual system as well as in computer vision, the focus is
often on contrast edges. However, the primate visual system contains a large
number of cells that are insensitive to spatial contrast and, instead, respond
to uniform homogeneous illumination of their visual field. The purpose of this
information remains unclear. Here, we propose a mechanism that detects feature
homogeneity in visual areas, based on latency coding and spike time
coincidence, in a purely feed-forward and therefore rapid manner. We
demonstrate how homogeneity information can interact with information on
contrast edges to potentially support rapid image segmentation. Furthermore, we
analyze how neuronal crosstalk (noise) affects the mechanism's performance. We
show that the detrimental effects of crosstalk can be partly mitigated through
delayed feed-forward inhibition that shapes bi-phasic post-synaptic events. The
delay of the feed-forward inhibition allows effectively controlling the size of
the temporal integration window and, thereby, the coincidence threshold. The
proposed model is based on single-spike latency codes in a purely feed-forward
architecture that supports low-latency processing, making it an attractive
scheme of computation in spiking neuronal networks where rapid responses and
low spike counts are desired.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Neuronal Correlates of Cognitive Control Are Altered in Women With Endometriosis and Chronic Pelvic Pain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.593581</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.593581</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Endometriosis is a debilitating women's health condition and is the most common cause of chronic pelvic pain. Impaired cognitive control is common in chronic pain conditions, however, it has not yet been investigated in endometriosis. The aim of this study was to explore the neuronal correlates of cognitive control in women with endometriosis. Using a cross-sectional study design with data collected at a single time-point, event-related potentials were elicited during a cued continuous performance test from 20 women with endometriosis (mean age = 28.5 ± 5.2 years) and 20 age- and gender-matched controls (mean age = 28.5 ± 5.2 years). Event-related potential components were extracted and P3 component amplitudes were derived with temporal principal components analysis. Behavioral and ERP outcomes were compared between groups and subjective pain severity was correlated with ERP component amplitudes. No significant behavioral differences were seen in task performance between the groups (all p &amp;gt; 0.094). Target P3b (all p &amp;lt; 0.034) and SW (all p &amp;lt; 0.040), and non-target early P3a (eP3a; all p &amp;lt; 0.023) and late P3a (lP3a; all p &amp;lt; 0.035) amplitudes were smaller for the endometriosis compared to the healthy control group. Lower non-target eP3a (p &amp;lt; 0.001), lP3a (p = 0.013), and SW (p = 0.019) amplitudes were correlated with higher pain severity scores. Findings suggest that endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain is linked to alterations in stimulus-response processing and inhibitory control networks, but not impaired behavioral performance, due to compensatory neuroplastic changes in overlapping cognitive control and pain networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Accumulation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Glycerophospholipids and Sphingolipids in Cognitively Healthy Participants With Alzheimer’s Biomarkers Precedes Lipolysis in the Dementia Stage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.611393</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Insight into lipids’ roles in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiology is limited because brain membrane lipids have not been characterized in cognitively healthy (CH) individuals. Since age is a significant risk factor of AD, we hypothesize that aging renders the amyloid precursor protein (APP) more susceptible to abnormal processing because of deteriorating membrane lipids. To reflect brain membranes, we studied their lipid components in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain-derived CSF nanoparticle membranes. Based on CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;/Tau levels established biomarkers of AD, we define a subset of CH participants with normal Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;/Tau (CH-NAT) and another group with abnormal or pathological Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;/Tau (CH-PAT). We report that glycerophospholipids are differentially metabolized in the CSF supernatant fluid and nanoparticle membrane fractions from CH-NAT, CH-PAT, and AD participants. Phosphatidylcholine molecular species from the supernatant fraction of CH-PAT were higher than in the CH-NAT and AD participants. Sphingomyelin levels in the supernatant fraction were lower in the CH-PAT and AD than in the CH-NAT group. The decrease in sphingomyelin corresponded with an increase in ceramide and dihydroceramide and an increase in the ceramide to sphingomyelin ratio in AD. In contrast to the supernatant fraction, sphingomyelin is higher in the nanoparticle fraction from the CH-PAT group, accompanied by lower ceramide and dihydroceramide and a decrease in the ratio of ceramide to sphingomyelin in CH-PAT compared with CH-NAT. On investigating the mechanism for the lipid changes in AD, we observed that phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) activity was higher in the AD group than the CH groups. Paradoxically, acid and neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase) activities were lower in AD compared to the CH groups. Considering external influences on lipids, the clinical groups did not differ in their fasting blood lipids or dietary lipids, consistent with the CSF lipid changes originating from brain pathophysiology. The lipid accumulation in a prodromal AD biomarker positive stage identifies perturbation of lipid metabolism and disturbances in APP/Amyloid beta (Aβ) as early events in AD pathophysiology. Our results identify increased lipid turnover in CH participants with AD biomarkers, switching to a predominantly lipolytic state in dementia. This knowledge may be useful for targeting and testing new AD treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural and Genetic Bases for Human Ability Traits</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.609170</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The judgement of human ability is ubiquitous, from school admissions to job performance reviews. The exact make-up of ability traits, however, is often narrowly defined and lacks a comprehensive basis. We attempt to simplify the spectrum of human ability, similar to how five personality traits are widely believed to describe most personalities. Finding such a basis for human ability would be invaluable since neuropsychiatric disease diagnoses and symptom severity are commonly related to such differences in performance. Here, we identified four underlying ability traits within the National Institutes of Health Toolbox normative data (n = 1, 369): (1) Motor-endurance, (2) Emotional processing, (3) Executive and cognitive function, and (4) Social interaction. We used the Human Connectome Project young adult dataset (n = 778) to show that Motor-endurance and Executive and cognitive function were reliably associated with specific brain functional networks (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.305 ± 0.021), and the biological nature of these ability traits was also shown by calculating their heritability (31 and 49%, respectively) from twin data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Emotional Reactivity and Regulation in Preschool-Age Children Who Do and Do Not Stutter: Evidence From Autonomic Nervous System Measures</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.600790</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.600790</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: This experimental cross-sectional research study examined the emotional reactivity and emotion regulation in preschool-age children who do (CWS) and do not stutter (CWNS) by assessing their psychophysiological response during rest and while viewing pictures from the International Affective Picture System (Lang et al., 2008).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Participants were 18 CWS (16 boys and two girls; mean age 4 years, 5 months) and 18 age- and gender-matched CWNS. Participants' psychophysiological responses were measured during two baselines and two picture viewing conditions. Skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate were measured to assess emotional reactivity. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was measured to assess emotional regulation. Participants' shyness and executive function were assessed via parent report and considered for their effects on participants' psychophysiological responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: First, CWNS and CWS did not differ in their initial baseline SCL, heart rate, or RSA, but all participants had higher SCL and lower RSA in the second baseline, subsequent to the first challenge condition, compared to the first baseline. Second, during the challenge conditions, CWS did not differ from CWNS in their SCL, but showed a significantly higher heart rate than CWNS. Third, CWS exhibited a significantly lower RSA during the challenge conditions compared to CWNS. Lastly, the temperamental quality of shyness was associated with preschool-age children's SCL, such that participants who were rated higher in shyness had a higher SCL during the challenge conditions. Participants' executive function had a marginally significant effect on the RSA, such that the participants who had higher executive function composite scores exhibited lower RSA during the challenge conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings suggest that CWS and CWNS did not differ in their emotional reactivity and emotional regulation abilities at rest. During challenge conditions, however, CWS tended to be more emotionally reactive, as indicated by a higher heart rate, and also employed more emotional regulation, indexed by a greater decrease in RSA, compared to CWNS. Preschool-age children's behavior is largely dominated by reactivity, but there is the emergence of regulation, which can help children adjust to various contextual demands. For CWS who are more emotionally reactive, regulatory skills may be particularly critical to their prognosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Electroencephalogram Access for Emotion Recognition Based on a Deep Hybrid Network</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the human-computer interaction (HCI), electroencephalogram (EEG) access for automatic emotion recognition is an effective way for robot brains to perceive human behavior. In order to improve the accuracy of the emotion recognition, a method of EEG access for emotion recognition based on a deep hybrid network was proposed in this paper. Firstly, the collected EEG was decomposed into four frequency band signals, and the multiscale sample entropy (MSE) features of each frequency band were extracted. Secondly, the constructed 3D MSE feature matrices were fed into a deep hybrid network for autonomous learning. The deep hybrid network was composed of a continuous convolutional neural network (CNN) and hidden Markov models (HMMs). Lastly, HMMs trained with multiple observation sequences were used to replace the artificial neural network classifier in the CNN, and the emotion recognition task was completed by HMM classifiers. The proposed method was applied to the DEAP dataset for emotion recognition experiments, and the average accuracy could achieve 79.77% on arousal, 83.09% on valence, and 81.83% on dominance. Compared with the latest related methods, the accuracy was improved by 0.99% on valence and 14.58% on dominance, which verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation of Anterior Cingulate Cortex Modulates Subcortical Brain Regions Resulting in Cognitive Enhancement</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been widely utilized in research settings and modulates brain activity. The application of anodal tDCS on the prefrontal cortex has indicated improvement in cognitive functioning. The cingulate cortex, situated in the medial aspect of the prefrontal cortex, has been identified as a core region performing cognitive functions. Most of the previous studies investigating the impact of stimulation on the prefrontal cortex stimulated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), however, the impact of stimulation on cingulate has not been explored. The current study investigates the effect of stimulation on the resting-state functional connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex with other regions of the brain and changes in behavioral results in a color-word Stroop task, which has repeatedly elicited activation in different regions of the cingulate. Twenty subjects were randomly assigned to the experimental and sham group, and their medial prefrontal area was stimulated using MRI compatible tDCS. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and cognitive Stroop task were monitored before, during, and after the stimulation. Neuroimaging results indicated a significant decrease in resting-state functional connectivity in the experimental group during and after stimulation as compared to before stimulation in two clusters including right insular cortex, right central operculum cortex, right frontal operculum cortex and right planum polare with the left anterior cingulate cortex (L-ACC) selected as the seed. The behavioral results indicated a significant decrease in reaction time (RT) following stimulation in the experimental group compared to the sham group. Moreover, the change in functional connectivity in subcortical regions with L-ACC as the seed and change in RT was positively correlated. The results demonstrated that ACC has a close functional relationship with the subcortical regions, and stimulation of ACC can modulate these connections, which subsequently improves behavioral performance, thus, providing another potential target of stimulation for cognitive enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04318522.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Comparing Theories for the Maintenance of Late LTP and Long-Term Memory: Computational Analysis of the Roles of Kinase Feedback Pathways and Synaptic Reactivation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.569349</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental neuroscience question is how memories are maintained from days to a lifetime, given turnover of proteins that underlie expression of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) or “tag” synapses as eligible for LTP. A likely solution relies on synaptic positive feedback loops, prominently including persistent activation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) and self-activated synthesis of protein kinase M ζ (PKMζ). Data also suggest positive feedback based on recurrent synaptic reactivation within neuron assemblies, or engrams, is necessary to maintain memories. The relative importance of these mechanisms is controversial. To explore the likelihood that each mechanism is necessary or sufficient to maintain memory, we simulated maintenance of LTP with a simplified model incorporating persistent kinase activation, synaptic tagging, and preferential reactivation of strong synapses, and analyzed implications of recent data. We simulated three model variants, each maintaining LTP with one feedback loop: autonomous, self-activated PKMζ synthesis (model variant I); self-activated CamKII (model variant II); and recurrent reactivation of strengthened synapses (model variant III). Variant I predicts that, for successful maintenance of LTP, either 1) PKMζ contributes to synaptic tagging, or 2) a low constitutive tag level persists during maintenance independent of PKMζ, or 3) maintenance of LTP is independent of tagging. Variant II maintains LTP and suggests persistent CaMKII activation could maintain PKMζ activity, a feedforward interaction not previously considered. However, we note data challenging the CaMKII feedback loop. In Variant III synaptic reactivation drives, and thus predicts, recurrent or persistent activation of CamKII and other necessary kinases, plausibly contributing to persistent elevation of PKMζ levels. Reactivation is thus predicted to sustain recurrent rounds of synaptic tagging and incorporation of plasticity-related proteins. We also suggest (model variant IV) that synaptic reactivation and autonomous kinase activation could synergistically maintain LTP. We propose experiments that could discriminate these maintenance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Electrophysiological Profile Remodeling via Selective Suppression of Voltage-Gated Currents by CLN1/PPT1 Overexpression in Human Neuronal-Like Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.569598</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;CLN1 disease (OMIM #256730) is an inherited neurological disorder of early childhood with epileptic seizures and premature death. It is associated with mutations in CLN1 coding for Palmitoyl-Protein Thioesterase 1 (PPT1), a lysosomal enzyme which affects the recycling and degradation of lipid-modified (S-acylated) proteins by removing palmitate residues. Transcriptomic evidence from a neuronal-like cellular model derived from differentiated SH-SY5Y cells disclosed the potential negative roles of CLN1 overexpression, affecting the elongation of neuronal processes and the expression of selected proteins of the synaptic region. Bioinformatic inquiries of transcriptomic data pinpointed a dysregulated expression of several genes coding for proteins related to voltage-gated ion channels, including subunits of calcium and potassium channels (VGCC and VGKC). In SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing CLN1 (SH-CLN1 cells), the resting potential and the membrane conductance in the range of voltages close to the resting potential were not affected. However, patch-clamp recordings indicated a reduction of Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; currents through VGCC of SH-CLN1 cells; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging revealed reduced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx in the same cellular setting. The results of the biochemical and morphological investigations of CACNA2D2/α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-2, an accessory subunit of VGCC, were in accordance with the downregulation of the corresponding gene and consistent with the hypothesis that a lower number of functional channels may reach the plasma membrane. The combined use of 4-AP and NS-1643, two drugs with opposing effects on K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;11 and K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;12 subfamilies of VGKC coded by the KCNH gene family, provides evidence for reduced functional K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;12 channels in SH-CLN1 cells, consistent with transcriptomic data indicating the downregulation of KCNH4. The lack of compelling evidence supporting the palmitoylation of many ion channels subunits investigated in this study stimulates inquiries about the role of PPT1 in the trafficking of channels to the plasma membrane. Altogether, these results indicate a reduction of functional voltage-gated ion channels in response to CLN1/PPT1 overexpression in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and provide new insights into the altered neuronal excitability which may underlie the severe epileptic phenotype of CLN1 disease. It remains to be shown if remodeling of such functional channels on plasma membrane can occur as a downstream effect of CLN1 disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Systematic and Comprehensive Automated Ventricle Segmentation on Ventricle Images of the Elderly Patients: A Retrospective Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.618538</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.618538</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background and Objective: Ventricle volume is closely related to hydrocephalus, brain atrophy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's syndrome, and other diseases. To accurately measure the volume of the ventricles for elderly patients, we use deep learning to establish a systematic and comprehensive automated ventricle segmentation framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The study participation included 20 normal elderly people, 20 patients with cerebral atrophy, 64 patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus, and 51 patients with acquired hydrocephalus. Second, get their imaging data through the picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) system. Then use ITK software to manually label participants' ventricular structures. Finally, extract imaging features through machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: This automated ventricle segmentation method can be applied not only to CT and MRI images but also to images with different scan slice thicknesses. More importantly, it produces excellent segmentation results (Dice &amp;gt; 0.9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This automated ventricle segmentation method has wide applicability and clinical practicability. It can help clinicians find early disease, diagnose disease, understand the patient's disease progression, and evaluate the patient's treatment effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Brain NAD Is Associated With ATP Energy Production and Membrane Phospholipid Turnover in Humans</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain requires a large amount of energy, mostly derived from the metabolism of glucose, which decreases substantially with age and neurological diseases. While mounting evidence in model organisms illustrates the central role of brain nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) for maintaining energy homeostasis, similar data are sparse in humans. This study explores the correlations between brain NAD, energy production and membrane phospholipid metabolism by 31-phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-MRS) across 50 healthy participants including a young (mean age 27.1-year-old) and middle-aged (mean age 56.4-year-old) group. The analysis revealed that brain NAD level and NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/NADH redox ratio were positively associated with ATP level and the rate of energy production, respectively. Moreover, a metabolic network linking NAD with membrane phospholipid metabolism, energy production, and aging was identified. An inverted trend between age and NAD level was detected. These results pave the way for the use of &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-MRS as a powerful non-invasive tool to support the development of new therapeutic interventions targeting NAD associated phospho-metabolic pathways in brain aging and neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Senescent Cell-Secreted Netrin-1 Modulates Aging-Related Disorders by Recruiting Sympathetic Fibers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.507140</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cellular senescence is implicated in several lines of aging-related disorders. However, the potential molecular mechanisms by which cellular senescence modulates age-related pathologies remain largely unexplored. Herein, we report that the density of sympathetic fibers (SFs) is significantly elevated in naturally aged mouse tissues and human colon adenoma tissues compared to the SFs densities in the corresponding young mouse tissues and human non-lesion colon tissues. A dorsal root ganglion (DRG)-human diploid fibroblast coculture assay revealed that senescent cells promote the outgrowth of SFs, indicating that the senescent cells induce recruitment of SFs in vitro. Additionally, subcutaneous transplantation of 2BS fibroblasts in nude mice shows that transplanted senescent 2BS fibroblasts promote SFs infiltration. Intra-articular senolytic molecular injection can reduce SFs density and inhibit SFs infiltration caused by senescent cells in osteoarthritis (OA), suggesting senescent cells promote the infiltration of SFs in vivo in aged tissues. Notably, the elevated level of SFs contributes to impaired cognitive function in naturally aged mice, which can be reversed by treatment with propranolol hydrochloride, a non-selective β receptor blocker that inhibits sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) by blocking non-selective β receptors. Additionally, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced sympathectomy improved hepatic sympathetic overactivity mediated hepatic steatosis in high fat diet (HFD)-fed APOE knockout mice (APOE&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice) by reducing hepatic SNA. Taken together, this study concludes that senescent cell-secreted netrin-1 mediated SFs outgrowth and infiltration, which contributes to aging-related disorders, suggesting that clearing senescent cells or inhibiting SNA is a promising therapeutic strategy for improving sympathetic nervous system (SNS) hyperactivity-induced aging-related pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Time from I.V. Thrombolysis to Thrombectomy and Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25978</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25978?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Whether the time from intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) to endovascular treatment (EVT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke has an effect on the functional outcome is unknown.


Methods
The Endovascular Treatment in Ischemic Stroke (ETIS) registry is an ongoing, prospective, multicenter, observational study that perform EVT in France. Data were analyzed from patients treated by IVT and EVT between October 2013 and December 2018 in 6 comprehensive stroke centers. In the primary analysis, we assessed the association of time from IVT administration to start of EVT with functional outcome (measured with the modified Rankin Scale [mRS]), by means of ordinal logistic regression. Secondary end points included angiographic and safety outcomes.


Results
We analyzed 1,986 patients with acute ischemic stroke due to anterior circulation large vessel occlusion who underwent IVT and EVT. An increased IVT to start of EVT time was associated with a worse functional outcome at 90 days (mRS = 0–2, adjusted odds ratio [OR] per 30 minutes increase in time = 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.86–0.96; mRS = 0–1, adjusted OR per 30 minutes increase in time = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.84–0.94), a lower chance of modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) grade 2b to 3 reperfusion (adjusted OR per 30 minutes increase in time = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.87–0.98), and an increased probability of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (adjusted OR per 30 minutes increase in time = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.99–1.18).


Interpretation
These findings provide a basis for further studies to determine if the functional outcome of patients with stroke can be greatly improved by optimizing IVT to EVT times. ANN NEUROL 2020</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: EIF2AK2 Missense Variants Associated with Early Onset Generalized Dystonia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25973</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25973?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The study was undertaken to identify a monogenic cause of early onset, generalized dystonia.


Methods
Methods consisted of genome‐wide linkage analysis, exome and Sanger sequencing, clinical neurological examination, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and protein expression studies in skin fibroblasts from patients.


Results
We identified a heterozygous variant, c.388G&amp;gt;A, p.Gly130Arg, in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 2 (EIF2AK2) gene, segregating with early onset isolated generalized dystonia in 5 patients of a Taiwanese family. EIF2AK2 sequencing in 191 unrelated patients with unexplained dystonia yielded 2 unrelated Caucasian patients with an identical heterozygous c.388G&amp;gt;A, p.Gly130Arg variant, occurring de novo in one case, another patient carrying a different heterozygous variant, c.413G&amp;gt;C, p.Gly138Ala, and one last patient, born from consanguineous parents, carrying a third, homozygous variant c.95A&amp;gt;C, p.Asn32Thr. These 3 missense variants are absent from gnomAD, and are located in functional domains of the encoded protein. In 3 patients, additional neurological manifestations were present, including intellectual disability and spasticity. EIF2AK2 encodes a kinase (protein kinase R [PKR]) that phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), which orchestrates the cellular stress response. Our expression studies showed abnormally enhanced activation of the cellular stress response, monitored by PKR‐mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α, in fibroblasts from patients with EIF2AK2 variants. Intriguingly, PKR can also be regulated by PRKRA (protein interferon‐inducible double‐stranded RNA‐dependent protein kinase activator A), the product of another gene causing monogenic dystonia.


Interpretation
We identified EIF2AK2 variants implicated in early onset generalized dystonia, which can be dominantly or recessively inherited, or occur de novo. Our findings provide direct evidence for a key role of a dysfunctional eIF2α pathway in the pathogenesis of dystonia. ANN NEUROL 2020</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: The relationship between hippocampal subfield volumes and autobiographical memory persistence</title>

	<description>Abstract
Structural integrity of the human hippocampus is widely acknowledged to be necessary for the successful encoding and retrieval of autobiographical memories. However, evidence for an association between hippocampal volume and the ability to recall such memories in healthy individuals is mixed. Here we examined this issue further by combining two approaches. First, we focused on the anatomically distinct subregions of the hippocampus where more nuanced associations may be expressed compared to considering the whole hippocampal volume. A manual segmentation protocol of hippocampal subregions allowed us to separately calculate the volumes of the dentate gyrus/CA4, CA3/2, CA1, subiculum, pre/parasubiculum and uncus. Second, a critical feature of autobiographical memories is that they can span long time periods, and so we sought to consider how memory details persist over time by conducting a longitudinal study whereby participants had to recall the same autobiographical memories on two visits spaced 8 months apart. Overall, we found that there was no difference in the total number of internal (episodic) details produced at Visits 1 and 2. However, further probing of detail subcategories revealed that specifically the amount of subjective thoughts and emotions included during recall had declined significantly by the second visit. We also observed a strong correlation between left pre/parasubiculum volume and the amount of autobiographical memory internal details produced over time. This positive relationship was evident for particular facets of the memories, with remembered events, perceptual observations and thoughts and emotions benefitting from greater volume of the left pre/parasubiculum. These preliminary findings expand upon existing functional neuroimaging evidence by highlighting a potential link between left pre/parasubiculum volume and autobiographical memory. A larger pre/parasubiculum appears not only to protect against memory decay, but may possibly enhance memory persistence, inviting further scrutiny of the role of this brain region in remote autobiographical memory retrieval.</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Hippocampal neurogenesis and memory in adolescence following intrauterine growth restriction</title>

	<description>Abstract
Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with hippocampal alterations that can increase the risk of short‐term memory impairments later in life. Despite the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in learning and memory, research into the long‐lasting impact of IUGR on these processes is limited. We aimed to determine the effects of IUGR on neuronal proliferation, differentiation and morphology, and on memory function at adolescent equivalent age. At embryonic day (E) 18 (term ∼E22), placental insufficiency was induced in pregnant Wistar rats via bilateral uterine vessel ligation to generate IUGR offspring (n = 10); control offspring (n = 11) were generated via sham surgery. From postnatal day (P) 36–44, spontaneous location recognition (SLR), novel object location and recognition (NOL, NOR), and open field tests were performed. Brains were collected at P45 to assess neurogenesis (immunohistochemistry), dendritic morphology (Golgi staining), and brain‐derived neurotrophic factor expression (BDNF; Western blot analysis). In IUGR versus control rats there was no difference in object preference in the NOL or NOR, the similar and dissimilar condition of the SLR task, or in locomotion and anxiety‐like behavior in the open field. There was a significant increase in the linear density of immature neurons (DCX+) in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG), but no difference in the linear density of proliferating cells (Ki67+) in the SGZ, nor in areal density of mature neurons (NeuN+) or microglia (Iba‐1+) in the DG in IUGR rats compared to controls. Dendritic morphology of dentate granule cells did not differ between groups. Protein expression of the BDNF precursor (pro‐BDNF), but not mature BDNF, was increased in the hippocampus of IUGR compared with control rats. These findings highlight that while the long‐lasting prenatal hypoxic environment may impact brain development, it may not impact hippocampal‐dependent learning and memory in adolescence.</description>

	<description>Anxiety commonly co‐occurs with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Both of them are closely related to stress. However, the shared neurobiological substrates and therapeutic targets remain unclear. Here we report an amelioration of both anxiety and OCD via the histamine presynaptic H3 heteroreceptor on glutamatergic afferent terminals from the prelimbic prefrontal cortex...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/T-M7ED9QFSU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>The stereotyped dimensions of animal bodies and their component parts result from tight constraints on growth. Yet, the mechanisms that stop growth when organs reach the right size are unknown. Growth of the Drosophila wing—a classic paradigm—is governed by two morphogens, Decapentaplegic (Dpp, a BMP) and Wingless (Wg, a Wnt)....&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/3vl2xmrpA_s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Polyphosphate is a linear chain of phosphate residues and is present in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. Pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis accumulate polyphosphate, and reduced expression of the polyphosphate kinase that synthesizes polyphosphate decreases their survival. How polyphosphate potentiates pathogenicity is poorly understood.

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The brain of the African wild dog. II. The olfactory system&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b06e2ab9-d3db-45ad-ade8-a31237cf63dd/cne25007-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 reveals the glomeruli in the main olfactory bulb of the brain of the African wild dog. Stereological estimates of the numbers of glomeruli reveal that the African wild dog has up to 1700 glomeruli. Scale bar = 250 μm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing a range of neuroanatomical stains, we detail the organization of the main and accessory olfactory systems of the African wild dog. The organization of both these systems follows that typically observed in mammals, but variations of interest were noted. Within the main olfactory bulb, the size of the glomeruli, at approximately 350 μm in diameter, are on the larger end of the range observed across mammals. In addition, we estimate that approximately 3,500 glomeruli are present in each main olfactory bulb. This larger main olfactory bulb glomerular size and number of glomeruli indicates that enhanced peripheral processing of a broad range of odorants is occurring in the main olfactory bulb of the African wild dog. Within the accessory olfactory bulb, the glomeruli did not appear distinct, rather forming a homogenous syncytia‐like arrangement as seen in the domestic dog. In addition, the laminar organization of the deeper layers of the accessory olfactory bulb was indistinct, perhaps as a consequence of the altered architecture of the glomeruli. This arrangement of glomeruli indicates that rather than parcellating the processing of semiochemicals peripherally, these odorants may be processed in a more nuanced and combinatorial manner in the periphery, allowing for more rapid and precise behavioral responses as required in the highly social group structure observed in the African wild dog. While having a similar organization to that of other mammals, the olfactory system of the African wild dog has certain features that appear to correlate to their environmental niche.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Lateral view of the brain of the African wild dog showing the location of the various visual cortical areas and regions identified anatomically in the current study. We could identify the four occipital visual areas 17, 18, 19 and 21, as well as suprasylvian, parietal and temporal regions likely comprised of multiple cortical areas. Scale bar = 1 cm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variegated pelage and social complexity of the African wild dog (&lt;i&gt;Lycaon pictus&lt;/i&gt;) hint at the possibility of specializations of the visual system. Here, using a range of architectural and immunohistochemical stains, we describe the systems‐level organization of the image‐forming, nonimage forming, oculomotor, and accessory optic, vision‐associated systems in the brain of one representative individual of the African wild dog. For all of these systems, the organization, in terms of location, parcellation and topology (internal and external), is very similar to that reported in other carnivores. The image‐forming visual system consists of the superior colliculus, visual dorsal thalamus (dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, pulvinar and lateral posterior nucleus) and visual cortex (occipital, parietal, suprasylvian, temporal and splenial visual regions). The nonimage forming visual system comprises the suprachiasmatic nucleus, ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, pretectal nuclear complex and the Edinger–Westphal nucleus. The oculomotor system incorporates the oculomotor, trochlear and abducens cranial nerve nuclei as well as the parabigeminal nucleus, while the accessory optic system includes the dorsal, lateral and medial terminal nuclei. The extent of similarity to other carnivores in the systems‐level organization of these systems indicates that the manner in which these systems process visual information is likely to be consistent with that found, for example, in the well‐studied domestic cat. It would appear that the sociality of the African wild dog is dependent upon the processing of information extracted from the visual system in the higher‐order cognitive and affective neural systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Photograph of the lateral surface of the African wild dog brain. The African wild dog has a relatively large brain, but this appears to be related to a reduction in body mass during its evolutionary history, rather than an increase in brain mass in response to a complex social environment. In this image dorsal is to the top and rostral toward the left. Scale bar = 1 cm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The African wild dog is endemic to sub‐Saharan Africa and belongs to the family Canidae which includes domestic dogs and their closest relatives (i.e., wolves, coyotes, jackals, dingoes, and foxes). The African wild dog is known for its highly social behavior, co‐ordinated pack predation, and striking vocal repertoire, but little is known about its brain and whether it differs in any significant way from that of other canids. We employed gross anatomical observation, magnetic resonance imaging, and classical neuroanatomical staining to provide a broad overview of the structure of the African wild dog brain. Our results reveal a mean brain mass of 154.08 g, with an encephalization quotient of 1.73, indicating that the African wild dog has a relatively large brain size. Analysis of the various structures that comprise their brains and their topological inter‐relationships, as well as the areas and volumes of the corpus callosum, ventricular system, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum and the gyrification index, all reveal that the African wild dog brain is, in general, similar to that of other mammals, and very similar to that of other carnivorans. While at this level of analysis we do not find any striking specializations within the brain of the African wild dog, apart from a relatively large brain size, the observations made indicate that more detailed analyses of specific neural systems, particularly those involved in sensorimotor processing, sociality or cognition, may reveal features that are either unique to this species or shared among the Canidae to the exclusion of other Carnivora.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;1,142 ganglion cells from 26 Golgi‐impregnated rabbit retinas were analyzed morphometrically and classified according to cell body size, dendritic field size, and dendritic branching pattern, based upon camera lucida drawings, and level of dendritic stratification, with reference to overlapping starburst amacrine and fiducial ganglion cells. 91 morphologies were characterized, distributed in four classes, composed of more than 60 types.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) convey visual signals to 50 regions of the brain. For reasons of interest and convenience, they constitute an excellent system for the study of brain structure and function. There is general agreement that, absent a complete “parts list,” understanding how the nervous system processes information will remain an elusive goal. Recent studies indicate that there are 30–50 types of ganglion cell in mouse retina, whereas only a few years ago it was still written that mice and the more visually oriented lagomorphs had less than 20 types of RGC. More than 30 years ago, I estimated that rabbits have about 40 types of RGC. The present study indicates that this number is much too low. I have employed the old but powerful method of Golgi‐impregnation to rabbit retina, studying the range of component neurons in this already well‐studied retinal system. Close quantitative and qualitative analyses of 1,142 RGCs in 26 retinas take into account cell body and dendritic field size, level(s) of dendritic stratification in the retina's inner plexiform layer, and details of dendritic branching. Ninety‐one morphologies are recognized. Of these, at least 32 can be correlated with physiologically studied RGCs, dye‐injected for morphological analysis. It is unlikely that rabbits have 91 types of RGC, but is argued here that this number lies between 60 and 70. The present study provides a “yardstick” for measuring the output of future molecular studies that may be more definitive in fixing the number of RGC types in rabbit retina.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for parvalbumin reveals the various nuclei of the superior olivary complex and trapezoid body within the brain of the African wild dog. We could identify the medial and lateral superior olivary nuclei, the superior, medioventral, and lateroventral periolivary nuclei, the nucleus of the trapezoid body (Tz), and the fiber bundles forming the trapezoid body (tz). Scale bar = 1 mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large external pinnae and extensive vocal repertoire of the African wild dog (&lt;i&gt;Lycaon pictus&lt;/i&gt;) has led to the assumption that the auditory system of this unique canid may be specialized. Here, using cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, and a range of immunohistochemical stains, we describe the systems‐level anatomy of the auditory system of the African wild dog. We observed the cochlear nuclear complex, superior olivary nuclear complex, lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body, and auditory cortex all being in their expected locations, and exhibiting the standard subdivisions of this system. While located in the ectosylvian gyri, the auditory cortex includes several areas, resembling the parcellation observed in cats and ferrets, although not all of the auditory areas known from these species could be identified in the African wild dog. These observations suggest that, broadly speaking, the systems‐level anatomy of the auditory system, and by extension the processing of auditory information, within the brain of the African wild dog closely resembles that observed in other carnivores. Our findings indicate that it is likely that the extraction of the semantic content of the vocalizations of African wild dogs, and the behaviors generated, occurs beyond the classically defined auditory system, in limbic or association neocortical regions involved in cognitive functions. Thus, to obtain a deeper understanding of how auditory stimuli are processed, and how communication is achieved, in the African wild dog compared to other canids, cortical regions beyond the primary sensory areas will need to be examined in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Comparative studies on canid cognition have revealed tantalizing evidence for some restructuring in the canine brain. Using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, we compared the degree of cortical folding in wild and domestic canids. We demonstrate that this parameter is largely consistent across canid species although regional differences in gyrification exist.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 15 years, research on canid cognition has revealed that domestic dogs possess a surprising array of complex sociocognitive skills pointing to the possibility that the domestication process might have uniquely altered their brains; however, we know very little about how evolutionary processes (natural or artificial) might have modified underlying neural structure to support species‐specific behaviors. Evaluating the degree of cortical folding (i.e., gyrification) within canids may prove useful, as this parameter is linked to functional variation of the cerebral cortex. Using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the impact of domestication on the canine cortical surface, we compared the gyrification index (GI) in 19 carnivore species, including six wild canid and 13 domestic dog individuals. We also explored correlations between global and local GI with brain mass, cortical thickness, white and gray matter volume and surface area. Our results indicated that GI values for domestic dogs are largely consistent with what would be expected for a canid of their given brain mass, although more variable than that observed in wild canids. We also found that GI in canids is positively correlated with cortical surface area, cortical thickness and total cortical gray matter volumes. While we found no evidence of global differences in GI between domestic and wild canids, certain regional differences in gyrification were observed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We comprehensively characterized 5‐HT‐immunoreactive (‐ir) innervation throughout the brain of &lt;i&gt;Porichthys notatus&lt;/i&gt;, plainfin midshipman fish, including well‐delineated vocal and auditory nuclei. We report neuroanatomical heterogeneity in populations of the serotonergic raphe nuclei of the brainstem reticular formation, with three discrete subregions in the superior raphe, an intermediate 5‐HT‐ir cell cluster, and an extensive inferior raphe population. This comprehensive atlas offers new insights into the organization of 5‐HT nuclei in teleosts and provides neuroanatomical evidence for serotonin as a modulator of vocal‐acoustic circuitry and behavior in midshipman fish, consistent with findings in vocal tetrapods.

&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5‐HT) is a modulator of neural circuitry underlying motor patterning, homeostatic control, and social behavior. While previous studies have described 5‐HT distribution in various teleosts, serotonergic raphe subgroups in fish are not well defined and therefore remain problematic for cross‐species comparisons. Here we used the plainfin midshipman fish, &lt;i&gt;Porichthys notatus&lt;/i&gt;, a well‐studied model for investigating the neural and hormonal mechanisms of vertebrate vocal‐acoustic communication, to redefine raphe subgroups based on both stringent neuroanatomical landmarks as well as quantitative cell measurements. In addition, we comprehensively characterized 5‐HT‐immunoreactive (‐ir) innervation throughout the brain, including well‐delineated vocal and auditory nuclei. We report neuroanatomical heterogeneity in populations of the serotonergic raphe nuclei of the brainstem reticular formation, with three discrete subregions in the superior raphe, an intermediate 5‐HT‐ir cell cluster, and an extensive inferior raphe population. 5‐HT‐ir neurons were also observed within the vocal motor nucleus (VMN), forming putative contacts on those cells. In addition, three major 5‐HT‐ir cell groups were identified in the hypothalamus and one group in the pretectum. Significant 5‐HT‐ir innervation was found in components of the vocal pattern generator and cranial motor nuclei. All vocal midbrain nuclei showed considerable 5‐HT‐ir innervation, as did thalamic and hindbrain auditory and lateral line areas and vocal‐acoustic integration sites in the preoptic area and ventral telencephalon. This comprehensive atlas offers new insights into the organization of 5‐HT nuclei in teleosts and provides neuroanatomical evidence for serotonin as a modulator of vocal‐acoustic circuitry and behavior in midshipman fish, consistent with findings in vocal tetrapods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Three‐dimensional reconstruction of a &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt; brain based on immunohistochemical staining and fluorescent tracing. We provide a detailed atlas of the &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt; brain including 33 brain neuropils and 30 fiber tracts. We further focus on the description of the major optical tracts/commissures and their projections in the central brain.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt; ants are known for their outstanding navigational abilities. They return to their inconspicuous nest after far‐reaching foraging trips using path integration, and whenever available, learn and memorize visual features of panoramic sceneries. To achieve this, the ants combine directional visual information from celestial cues and panoramic scenes with distance information from an intrinsic odometer. The largely vision‐based navigation in &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt; requires sophisticated neuronal networks to process the broad repertoire of visual stimuli. Although &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt; ants have been subjected to many neuroethological studies, little is known about the general neuronal organization of their central brain and the visual pathways beyond major circuits. Here, we provide a comprehensive, three‐dimensional neuronal map of synapse‐rich neuropils in the brain of &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis nodus&lt;/i&gt; including major connecting fiber systems. In addition, we examined neuronal tracts underlying the processing of visual information in more detail. This study revealed a total of 33 brain neuropils and 30 neuronal fiber tracts including six distinct tracts between the optic lobes and the cerebrum. We also discuss the importance of comparative studies on insect brain architecture for a profound understanding of neuronal networks and their function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Microstructural changes in the middle brain.

Abstract
A recent randomized controlled trial in young patients with long‐term post‐concussion symptoms showed that a novel behavioral intervention “Get going After concussIoN” is superior to enhanced usual care in terms of symptom reduction. It is unknown whether these interventional effects are associated with microstructural brain changes. The aim of this study was to examine whether diffusion‐weighted MRI indices, which are sensitive to the interactions between cellular structures and water molecules' Brownian motion, respond differently to the interventions of the above‐mentioned trial and whether such differences correlate with the improvement of post‐concussion symptoms. Twenty‐three patients from the intervention group (mean age 22.8, 18 females) and 19 patients from the control group (enhanced usual care) (mean age 23.9, 14 females) were enrolled. The primary outcome measure was the mean kurtosis tensor, which is sensitive to the microscopic complexity of brain tissue. The mean kurtosis tensor was significantly increased in the intervention group (p = 0.003) in the corpus callosum but not in the thalamus (p = 0.78) and the hippocampus (p = 0.34). An increase in mean kurtosis tensor in the corpus callosum tended to be associated with a reduction in symptoms, but this association did not reach significance (p = 0.059). Changes in diffusion tensor imaging metrics did not differ between intervention groups and were not associated with symptoms. The current study found different diffusion‐weighted MRI responses from the microscopic cellular structures of the corpus callosum between patients receiving a novel behavioral intervention and patients receiving enhanced usual care. Correlations with improvement of post‐concussion symptoms were not evident.</description>

	<description>In similarly aged individuals, traumatic brain injury (TBI) induced more profound sleep alterations than Alzheimer's disease (AD), with incongruous inflammation. Altered sleep may be associated with deleterious pathological processes and unique pathological sleep pathways may exist in older individuals that incur TBI compared with similarly aged individuals that have AD.

Abstract
Elderly populations (≥65 years old) have the highest risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and/or obtaining a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Using translational mouse models, we investigated sleep disturbances and inflammation associated with normal aging, TBI and aging, and AD. We hypothesized that aging results in marked changes in sleep compared with adult mice, and that TBI and aging would result in sleep and inflammation levels similar to AD mice. We used female 16‐month‐old wild‐type (WT Aged) and 3xTg‐AD mice, as well as a 2‐month‐old reference group (WT Adult), to evaluate sleep changes. WT Aged mice received diffuse TBI by midline fluid percussion, and blood was collected from both WT Aged (pre‐ and post‐TBI) and 3xTg‐AD mice to evaluate inflammation. Cognitive behavior was tested, and tissue was collected for histology. Bayesian generalized additive and mixed‐effects models were used for analyses. Both normal aging and AD led to increases in sleep compared with adult mice. WT Aged mice with TBI slept substantially more, with fragmented shorter bouts, than they did pre‐TBI and compared with AD mice. However, differences between WT Aged and 3xTg‐AD mice in immune cell populations and plasma cytokine levels were incongruous, cognitive deficits were similar, and cumulative sleep was not predictive of inflammation or behavior for either group. Our results suggest that in similarly aged individuals, TBI immediately induces more profound sleep alterations than in AD, although both diseases likely include cognitive impairments. Unique pathological sleep pathways may exist in elderly individuals who incur TBI compared with similarly aged individuals who have AD, which may warrant disease‐specific treatments in clinical settings.</description>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is accompanied by an increased risk of epileptic seizures, but data with a detailed description of the competing causes are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We aimed to describe a cohort of patients with both MS and epileptic seizures in a retrospective, population-based study.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We included 59 out of 2285 MS patients who had at least one epileptic seizure. Out of them, 22 had seizures before the diagnosis of MS, whereas epileptic seizures occurred after MS diagnosis in 37 patients, resulting in a total prevalence of epileptic seizures in MS of 2.6%. Competing causes could be found in 50.8% (30/59) of all patients, with 40.9% (9/22) compared to 56.8% (21/37) of the MS patients with seizures before vs after MS diagnosis. The main alternative causes were traumatic brain injury and cerebral ischemia accounting for more than 30% of the patients, with no difference between the subgroups. 33.3% and 55.6% of MS patients with seizures before/after MS diagnosis had documented pathological EEG alterations. 
      &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A remarkable percentage of MS patients with epileptic seizures do have alternative competing causes at the time of the first seizure. A detailed diagnostic setup including patient history, EEG and MRI is recommended in the evaluation and choice for the best treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Acetylcholine Muscarinic Receptors in Ventral Hippocampus Modulate Stress-Induced Anxiety-Like Behaviors in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress exposure increases the risk of developing various neuropsychiatric illnesses. The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is central to affective and cognitive processing and displays a high density of acetylcholine (ACh) muscarinic receptors (mAChRs). However, the precise role of vHPC mAChRs in anxiety remains to be fully investigated. In this study, we found that chronic restraint stress (CRS) induced social avoidance and anxiety-like behaviors in mice and increased mAChR expression in the vHPC. CRS increased the vHPC ACh release in behaving mice. Moreover, CRS altered the synaptic activities and enhanced neuronal activity of the vHPC neurons. Using pharmacological and viral approaches, we showed that infusing the antagonist of mAChRs or decreasing their expression in the vHPC attenuated the anxiety-like behavior and rescued the social avoidance behaviors in mice probably due to suppression of vHPC neuronal activity and its excitatory synaptic transmission. Our results suggest that the changes of neuronal activity and synaptic transmission in the vHPC mediated by mAChRs may play an important role in stress-induced anxiety-like behavior, providing new insights into the pathological mechanism and potential pharmacological target for anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tau is a microtubule-associated protein (MAPT) that is highly expressed in neurons and implicated in several cellular processes. Tau misfolding and self-aggregation give rise to proteinaceous deposits known as neuro-fibrillary tangles. Tau tangles play a key role in the genesis of a group of diseases commonly referred to as tauopathies; notably, these aggregates start to form decades before any clinical symptoms manifest. Advanced imaging methodologies have clarified important structural and functional aspects of tau and could have a role as diagnostic tools in clinical research. In the present review, recent progresses in tau imaging will be discussed. We will focus mainly on super-resolution imaging methods and the development of near-infrared fluorescent probes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Preventing Neurodegeneration by Controlling Oxidative Stress: The Role of OXR1</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease, diabetic retinopathy, hyperoxia induced retinopathy, and neuronal damage resulting from ischemia are among the notable neurodegenerative diseases in which oxidative stress occurs shortly before the onset of neurodegeneration. A shared feature of these diseases is the depletion of OXR1 (oxidation resistance 1) gene products shortly before the onset of neurodegeneration. In animal models of these diseases, restoration of OXR1 has been shown to reduce or eliminate the deleterious effects of oxidative stress induced cell death, delay the onset of symptoms, and reduce overall severity. Moreover, increasing OXR1 expression in cells further increases oxidative stress resistance and delays onset of disease while showing no detectable side effects. Thus, restoring or increasing OXR1 function shows promise as a therapeutic for multiple neurodegenerative diseases. This review examines the role of OXR1 in oxidative stress resistance and its impact on neurodegenerative diseases. We describe the potential of OXR1 as a therapeutic in light of our current understanding of its function at the cellular and molecular level and propose a possible cascade of molecular events linked to OXR1’s regulatory functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Brain Functional Interaction of Acupuncture Effects in Diarrhea-Dominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.608688</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.608688</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine treatment that has widely been used to modulate gastrointestinal dysfunction caused by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and to alleviate the resulting pain. Recent studies have shown that gastrointestinal dysfunction caused by IBS is associated with dysregulation of the brain's central and peripheral nervous system, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) helps explore functional abnormality of the brain. However, previous studies rarely used fMRI to study the correlations between brain functional connection, interaction, or segregation (e.g., network degree and clustering coefficient) and acupuncture stimulation in IBS. To bridge this knowledge gap, we study the changed brain functional connection, interaction, and segregation before and after acupuncture stimulation for diarrhea-dominant IBS (IBS-D) with the help of complex network methods based on fMRI. Our results indicate that the abnormal functional connections (FCs) in the right hippocampus, right superior occipital gyrus, left lingual gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, and the cerebellum, and abnormal network degree in right middle occipital gyrus, where normal controls are significantly different from IBS-D patients, are improved after acupuncture stimulation. These changed FCs and the network degree before and after acupuncture stimulation have significant correlations with the changed clinical information including IBS symptom severity score (r = −0.54, p = 0.0065) and IBS quality of life (r = 0.426, p = 0.038). We conclude that the changes of the brain functional connection, interaction, and segregation in the hippocampus, middle and superior occipital gyrus, cerebellum, and the lingual gyrus may be related to acupuncture stimulation. The abnormal functional connection, interaction, and segregation in IBS-D may be improved after acupuncture stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Transcriptional, Behavioral and Biochemical Profiling in the 3xTg-AD Mouse Model Reveals a Specific Signature of Amyloid Deposition and Functional Decline in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.602642</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.602642</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related degenerative decline is associated to the presence of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque lesions and neuro fibrillary tangles (NFT). However, the precise molecular mechanisms linking Aβ deposition and neurological decline are still unclear. Here we combine genome-wide transcriptional profiling of the insular cortex of 3xTg-AD mice and control littermates from early through to late adulthood (2–14 months of age), with behavioral and biochemical profiling in the same animals to identify transcriptional determinants of functional decline specifically associated to build-up of Aβ deposits. Differential expression analysis revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the cortex long before observed onset of behavioral symptoms in this model. Using behavioral and biochemical data derived from the same mice and samples, we found that down but not up-regulated DEGs show a stronger average association with learning performance than random background genes in control not seen in AD mice. Conversely, these same genes were found to have a stronger association with Aβ deposition than background genes in AD but not in control mice, thereby identifying these genes as potential intermediaries between abnormal Aβ/NFT deposition and functional decline. Using a complementary approach, gene ontology analysis revealed a highly significant enrichment of learning and memory, associative, memory, and cognitive functions only among down-regulated, but not up-regulated, DEGs. Our results demonstrate wider transcriptional changes triggered by the abnormal deposition of Aβ/NFT occurring well before behavioral decline and identify a distinct set of genes specifically associated to abnormal Aβ protein deposition and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Unraveling Early Signs of Navigational Impairment in APPswe/PS1dE9 Mice Using Morris Water Maze</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.568200</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mild behavioral deficits, which are part of normal aging, can be early indicators of an impending Alzheimer's disease. Using the APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, we utilized the Morris water maze spatial learning paradigm to systematically evaluate mild behavioral deficits that occur during the early stages of disease pathogenesis. Conventional behavioral analysis using this model indicates that spatial memory is intact at 2 months of age. In this study, we used an alternative method to analyze the behavior of mice, aiming to gain a better understanding of the nature of cognitive deficits by focusing on the unsuccessful trials during water maze learning rather than on the successful ones. APP/PS1 mice displayed a higher number of unsuccessful trials during the initial days of training, unlike their wild-type counterparts. However, with repeated trial and error, learning in APP/PS1 reached levels comparable to that of the wild-type mice during the later days of training. Individual APP/PS1 mice preferred a non-cognitive search strategy called circling, which led to abrupt learning transitions and an increased number of unsuccessful trials. These findings indicate the significance of subtle intermediate readouts as early indicators of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;To preliminarily explore subclinical brain alterations in an asymptomatic carotid vulnerable plaque group based on intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging through voxelwise comparison in the whole brain.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Forty-nine elderly participants underwent multi-b-value DWI, of whom 24 participants with asymptomatic carotid vulnerable plaques and &amp;lt;50% stenosis served as the test group, while the rest served as the healthy control group. After fitting the double-exponential model, slow ADC (Ds) and the fraction of fast ADC (f) values of the whole brain were obtained, which then were compared in a voxelwise manner by two-sample t-test. Multiple comparisons were corrected by the family-wise error (FWE) method with a corrected threshold of P &amp;lt; 0.05. Pearson correlations between IVIM parameters in altered brain regions and blood pressure, glucose, lipid, and homocysteine were calculated.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;For the test group, the Z-normalized Ds values were significantly higher in the left median cingulate and paracingulate gyrus (DCG.L), posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG. L), and left precuneus gyrus (PCUN.L) (cluster size = 156) and in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG.L), orbital middle frontal gyrus (ORBmid.L), and superior frontal gyrus (SFG.L) (cluster size = 165); the Z-normalized Ds values were significantly lower in the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG.R) and inferior temporal gyrus (ITG.R) (cluster size = 116); and the Z-normalized f-values were significantly lower in the MTG.R and ITG.R (cluster size = 85) (p &amp;lt; 0.05, FWE correction). LDL-C was negatively correlated with the Z-normalized Ds values in the DCG.L, PCG.L, and PCUN.L (r = 0.601, p = 0.002). LDL-C was positively correlated with the Z-normalized f-value in the MTG.R and ITG.R (r = 0.405, p = 0.05). Systolic blood pressure was positively correlated with the Z-normalized Ds values in the MFG.L, ORBmid.L, and SFG.L (r = 0.433, p = 0.035).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study was the first to detect subclinical brain alterations in asymptomatic carotid vulnerable plaque group through IVIM using whole-brain voxelwise comparisons, which were partially correlated with blood pressure and lipids. Thus, IVIM might be utilized as a noninvasive biomarker of microvascular and microstructural brain changes in the asymptomatic carotid vulnerable plaque group.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Exploiting Common Aspects of Obesity and Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an example of age-related dementia, and there are still no known preventive or curative measures for this disease. Obesity and associated metabolic changes are widely accepted as risk factors of age-related cognitive decline. Insulin is the prime mediator of metabolic homeostasis, which is impaired in obesity, and this impairment potentiates amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Obesity is also linked with functional and morphological alterations in brain mitochondria leading to brain insulin resistance (IR) and memory deficits associated with AD. Also, increased peripheral inflammation and oxidative stress due to obesity are the main drivers that increase an individual’s susceptibility to cognitive deficits, thus doubling the risk of AD. This enhanced risk of AD is alarming in the context of a rapidly increasing global incidence of obesity and overweight in the general population. In this review, we summarize the risk factors that link obesity with AD and emphasize the point that the treatment and management of obesity may also provide a way to prevent AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Glycosylation of CaV3.2 Channels Contributes to the Hyperalgesia in Peripheral Neuropathy of Type 1 Diabetes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.605312</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.605312</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our previous studies implicated glycosylation of the Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 isoform of T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (T-channels) in the development of Type 2 painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy (PDN). Here we investigated biophysical mechanisms underlying the modulation of recombinant Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 channel by de-glycosylation enzymes such as neuraminidase (NEU) and PNGase-F (PNG), as well as their behavioral and biochemical effects in painful PDN Type 1. In our in vitro study we used whole-cell recordings of current-voltage relationships to confirm that Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 current densities were decreased ~2-fold after de-glycosylation. Furthermore, de-glycosylation induced a significant depolarizing shift in the steady-state relationships for activation and inactivation while producing little effects on the kinetics of current deactivation and recovery from inactivation. PDN was induced in vivo by injections of streptozotocin (STZ) in adult female C57Bl/6j wild type (WT) mice, adult female Sprague Dawley rats and Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 knock-out (KO mice). Either NEU or vehicle (saline) were locally injected into the right hind paws or intrathecally. We found that injections of NEU, but not vehicle, completely reversed thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia in diabetic WT rats and mice. In contrast, NEU did not alter baseline thermal and mechanical sensitivity in the Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 KO mice which also failed to develop painful PDN. Finally, we used biochemical methods with gel-shift analysis to directly demonstrate that N-terminal fragments of native Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 channels in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are glycosylated in both healthy and diabetic animals. Our results demonstrate that in sensory neurons glycosylation-induced alterations in Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 channels in vivo directly enhance diabetic hyperalgesia, and that glycosylation inhibitors can be used to ameliorate painful symptoms in Type 1 diabetes. We expect that our studies may lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying painful PDN in an effort to facilitate the discovery of novel treatments for this intractable disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Roles of High Mobility Group Box 1 in Cerebral Ischemic Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.600280</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a ubiquitous nuclear protein that plays an important role in stabilizing nucleosomes and DNA repair. HMGB1 can be passively released from necrotic neurons or actively secreted by microglia, macrophages/monocytes, and neutrophils. Cerebral ischemia is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide, and its outcome depends on the number of neurons dying due to hypoxia in the ischemic area. HMGB1 contributes to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia via mediating neuroinflammatory responses to cerebral ischemic injury. Extracellular HMGB1 regulates many neuroinflammatory events by interacting with its different cell surface receptors, such as receptors for advanced glycation end products, toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, and TLR-4. Additionally, HMGB1 can be redox-modified, thus exerting specific cellular functions in the ischemic brain and has different roles in the acute and late stages of cerebral ischemic injury. However, the role of HMGB1 in cerebral ischemia is complex and remains unclear. Herein, we summarize and review the research on HMGB1 in cerebral ischemia, focusing especially on the role of HMGB1 in hypoxic ischemia in the immature brain and in white matter ischemic injury. We also outline the possible mechanisms of HMGB1 in cerebral ischemia and the main strategies to inhibit HMGB1 pertaining to its potential as a novel critical molecular target in cerebral ischemic injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Sevoflurane-Induced Neuroapoptosis in Rat Dentate Gyrus Is Activated by Autophagy Through NF-κB Signaling on the Late-Stage Progenitor Granule Cells</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms by which exposure of the late-stage progenitor cells to the anesthesia sevoflurane alters their differentiation are not known. We seek to query whether the effects of sevoflurane on late-stage progenitor cells might be regulated by apoptosis and/or autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;To address the short-term impact of sevoflurane exposure on granule cell differentiation, we used 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to identify the labeled late-stage progenitor granule cells. Male or female rats were exposed to 3% sevoflurane for 4 h when the labeled granule cells were 2 weeks old. Differentiation of the BrdU-labeled granule cells was quantified 4 and 7 days after exposure by double immunofluorescence. The expression of apoptosis and autophagy in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) was determined by western blot and immunofluorescence. Western blot for the expression of NF-κB was used to evaluate the mechanism. Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed to detect cognitive function in the rats on postnatal 28–33 days.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Exposure to sevoflurane decreased the differentiation of the BrdU-labeled late-stage progenitor granule cells, but increased the expression of caspase-3, autophagy, and phosphorylated-P65 in the hippocampus of juvenile rats and resulted in cognitive deficiency. These damaging effects of sevoflurane could be mitigated by inhibitors of autophagy, apoptosis, and NF-κB. The increased apoptosis could be alleviated by pretreatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA, and the increased autophagy and apoptosis could be reduced by pretreatment with NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7085.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that a single, prolonged sevoflurane exposure could impair the differentiation of late-stage progenitor granule cells in hippocampal DG and cause cognitive deficits possibly via apoptosis activated by autophagy through NF-κB signaling. Our results do not preclude the possibility that the affected differentiation and functional deficits may be caused by depletion of the progenitors pool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Altered White Matter and Layer VIb Neurons in Heterozygous Disc1 Mutant, a Mouse Model of Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.605029</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.605029</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increased white matter neuron density has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. However, the pathogenic features of these neurons are still largely unknown. Subplate neurons, the earliest generated neurons in the developing cortex have also been associated with schizophrenia and autism. The link between these neurons and mental disorders is also not well established. Since cortical layer VIb neurons are believed to be the remnant of subplate neurons in the adult rodent brain, in this study, we aimed to examine the cytoarchitecture of neurons in cortical layer VIb and the underlying white matter in heterozygous Disc1 mutant (Het) mice, a mouse model of schizophrenia. In the white matter, the number of NeuN-positive neurons was quite low in the external capsule; however, the density of these cells was found increased (54%) in Het mice compared with wildtype (WT) littermates. The density of PV-positive neurons was unchanged in the mutants. In the cortical layer VIb, the density of CTGF-positive neurons increased (21.5%) in Het mice, whereas the number of Cplx3-positive cells reduced (16.1%) in these mutants, compared with WT mice. Layer VIb neurons can be classified by their morphological characters. The morphology of Type I pyramidal neurons was comparable between genotypes while the dendritic length and complexity of Type II multipolar neurons were significantly reduced in Het mice. White matter neurons and layer VIb neurons receive synaptic inputs and modulate the process of sensory information and sleep/arousal pattern. Aberrances of these neurons in Disc1 mutants implies altered brain functions in these mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Importance of Veins for Neurosurgery as Landmarks Against Brain Shifting Phenomenon: An Anatomical and 3D-MPRAGE MR Reconstruction of Superficial Cortical Veins</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modern neurosurgery uses preoperative imaging daily. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the cortical anatomy and of the superficial veins helps the surgeons plan and perform neurosurgical procedures much more safely. The target is always to give the patient maximum benefit in terms of outcome and minimize intraoperative and postoperative complications. This study aims to develop a method for the combined representation of the cerebral cortex anatomy and the superficial cerebral veins, whose integration is beneficial in daily practice. Only those patients who underwent surgical procedures with craniotomy and a large opening of the dura mater were included in this study, for a total of 23 patients, 13 females (56.5%) and 10 males (43.5%). The average age was 50.1 years. We used a magnetic resonance tomograph Magnetom Vision® 1.5T (Siemens AG). Two sequences were applied: a strongly T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence to visualize cerebral anatomical structures, and a FLASH-2D-TOF angiography sequence to visualize the venous vessels on the cortical surface after the administration of a paramagnetic contrast agent. The two data sets were superimposed manually, co-registered in an interactive process, and merged to create a combined data set, segmented and visualized as a three-dimensional reconstruction. Furthermore, we present our method for visualizing superficial veins, which helps manage brain shift (BS). We also performed anatomical observations on the reconstructions. The reconstructions of the cortical and venous anatomy proved to be a valuable tool in surgical planning and positively influenced the surgical procedure. Due to the good correlation with the existing surgical site, this method should be validated on a larger cohort or in a multicentric study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Posterior Cingulate Cortex Network Predicts Alzheimer's Disease Progression</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of toxic misfolded proteins, which are believed to have propagated from disease-specific epicenters through their corresponding large-scale structural networks in the brain. Although previous cross-sectional studies have identified potential AD-associated epicenters and corresponding brain networks, it is unclear whether these networks are associated with disease progression. Hence, this study aims to identify the most vulnerable epicenters and corresponding large-scale structural networks involved in the early stages of AD and to evaluate its associations with multiple cognitive domains using longitudinal study design. Annual neuropsychological and MRI assessments were obtained from 23 patients with AD, 37 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 33 healthy controls (HC) for 3 years. Candidate epicenters were identified as regions with faster decline rate in the gray matter volume (GMV) in patients with MCI who progressed to AD as compared to those regions in patients without progression. These epicenters were then further used as pre-defined regions of interest to map the synchronized degeneration network (SDN) in HCs. Spatial similarity, network preference and clinical association analyses were used to evaluate the specific roles of the identified SDNs. Our results demonstrated that the hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) were the most vulnerable AD-associated epicenters. The corresponding PCC-SDN showed significant spatial association with the patterns of GMV atrophy rate in each patient group and the overlap of these patterns was more evident in the advanced stages of the disease. Furthermore, individuals with a higher GMV atrophy rate of the PCC-SDN also showed faster decline in multiple cognitive domains. In conclusion, our findings suggest the PCC and hippocampus are two vulnerable regions involved early in AD pathophysiology. However, the PCC-SDN, but not hippocampus-SDN, was more closely associated with AD progression. These results may provide insight into the pathophysiology of AD from large-scale network perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>UDP-glucose: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) 1 and 2 are central hubs in the chaperone network of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), acting as gatekeepers to the early secretory pathway yet little is known about their cellular clients. These two quality control sensors control lectin chaperone binding and glycoprotein egress from ER. A quantitative glycoproteomics strategy was deployed to identify cellular substrates of the UGGTs at endogenous levels in CRISPR-edited HEK293 cells. The seventy-one UGGT substrates identified were mainly large multidomain and heavily glycosylated proteins when compared to the general N-glycoproteome. UGGT1 was the dominant glucosyltransferase with a preference towards large plasma membrane proteins whereas UGGT2 favored the modification of smaller, soluble lysosomal proteins. This study sheds light on differential specificities and roles of UGGT1 and UGGT2 and provides insight into the cellular reliance on carbohydrate-dependent chaperone system to facilitate proper folding and maturation of the cellular N-glycoproteome.</description>

	<title>eLife: The tricuspid valve also maladapts as shown in sheep with biventricular heart failure</title>

	<description>Over 1.6 million Americans suffer from significant tricuspid valve leakage. In most cases this leakage is designated as secondary. Thus, valve dysfunction is assumed to be due to valve-extrinsic factors. We challenge this paradigm and hypothesize that the tricuspid valve maladapts in those patients rendering the valve at least partially culpable for its dysfunction. As a first step in testing this hypothesis, we set out to demonstrate that the tricuspid valve maladapts in disease. To this end, we induced biventricular heart failure in sheep that developed tricuspid valve leakage. In the anterior leaflets of those animals, we investigated maladaptation on multiple scales. We demonstrated alterations on the protein and cell-level, leading to tissue growth, thickening, and stiffening. These data provide a new perspective on a poorly understood, yet highly prevalent disease. Our findings may motivate novel therapy options for many currently untreated patients with leaky tricuspid valves.</description>

	<title>eLife: Association and dissociation between the mitochondrial Far complex and Atg32 regulate mitophagy</title>

	<description>Mitophagy plays an important role in mitochondrial homeostasis. In yeast, the phosphorylation of the mitophagy receptor Atg32 by casein kinase 2 is essential for mitophagy. This phosphorylation is counteracted by the yeast equivalent of the STRIPAK complex consisting of the PP2A-like protein phosphatase Ppg1 and Far3-7-8-9-10-11 (Far complex), but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we show that two subpopulations of the Far complex reside in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively, and play distinct roles; the former inhibits mitophagy via Atg32 dephosphorylation, and the latter regulates TORC2 signaling. Ppg1 and Far11 form a subcomplex, and Ppg1 activity is required for the assembling integrity of Ppg1-Far11-Far8. The Far complex preferentially interacts with phosphorylated Atg32, and this interaction is weakened by mitophagy induction. Furthermore, the artificial tethering of Far8 to Atg32 prevents mitophagy. Taken together, the Ppg1-mediated Far complex formation and its dissociation from Atg32 are crucial for mitophagy regulation.</description>

	<title>eLife: An AMPK-dependent, non-canonical p53 pathway plays a key role in adipocyte metabolic reprogramming</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.63665</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63665</link>
	<description>It has been known adipocytes increase p53 expression and activity in obesity, however, only canonical p53 functions (i.e., senescence and apoptosis) are attributed to inflammation-associated metabolic phenotypes. Whether or not p53 is directly involved in mature adipocyte metabolic regulation remains unclear. Here we show p53 protein expression can be up-regulated in adipocytes by nutrient starvation without activating cell senescence, apoptosis, or a death-related p53 canonical pathway. Inducing the loss of p53 in mature adipocytes significantly reprograms energy metabolism and this effect is primarily mediated through a AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and a novel downstream transcriptional target, lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). The pathophysiological relevance is further demonstrated in a conditional and adipocyte-specific p53 knockout mouse model. Overall, these data support a non-canonical p53 function in the regulation of adipocyte energy homeostasis and indicate that the dysregulation of this pathway may be involved in developing metabolic dysfunction in obesity.</description>

	<description>The inner nuclear membrane is functionalized by diverse transmembrane proteins that associate with nuclear lamins and/or chromatin. When cells enter mitosis, membrane-chromatin contacts must be broken to allow for proper chromosome segregation; yet how this occurs remains ill-understood. Unexpectedly, we observed that an imbalance in the levels of the lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1), an activator of ER-resident Torsin AAA+-ATPases, causes a failure in membrane removal from mitotic chromatin, accompanied by chromosome segregation errors and changes in post-mitotic nuclear morphology. These defects are dependent on a hitherto unknown chromatin-binding region of LAP1 that we have delineated. LAP1-induced NE abnormalities are efficiently suppressed by expression of wild-type but not ATPase-deficient Torsins. Furthermore, a dominant-negative Torsin induces chromosome segregation defects in a LAP1-dependent manner. These results indicate that association of LAP1 with chromatin in the nucleus can be modulated by Torsins in the perinuclear space, shedding new light on the LAP1-Torsin interplay.</description>

	<description>Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) deliver antibacterial effector proteins between neighbouring bacteria. Many effectors harbor N-terminal transmembrane domains (TMDs) implicated in effector translocation across target cell membranes. However, the distribution of these TMD-containing effectors remains unknown. Here we discover prePAAR, a conserved motif found in over 6,000 putative TMD-containing effectors encoded predominantly by 15 genera of Proteobacteria. Based on differing numbers of TMDs, effectors group into two distinct classes that both require a member of the Eag family of T6SS chaperones for export. Co-crystal structures of class I and class II effector TMD-chaperone complexes from &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; Typhimurium and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, respectively, reveals that Eag chaperones mimic transmembrane helical packing to stabilize effector TMDs. In addition to participating in the chaperone-TMD interface, we find that prePAAR residues mediate effector-VgrG spike interactions. Taken together, our findings reveal mechanisms of chaperone-mediated stabilization and secretion of two distinct families of T6SS membrane protein effectors.</description>

	<description>Bacterial cells utilize monitoring substrates, which undergo force-sensitive translation elongation arrest, to feedback-regulate a Sec-related gene. &lt;i&gt;Vibrio alginolyticus &lt;/i&gt;VemP controls the expression of SecD/F that stimulates a late step of translocation by undergoing export-regulated elongation arrest. Here, we attempted at delineating the pathway of the VemP nascent-chain interaction with Sec-related factors, and identified the signal recognition particle (SRP) and PpiD (a membrane-anchored periplasmic chaperone) in addition to other translocon components and a ribosomal protein as interacting partners. Our results showed that SRP is required for the membrane-targeting of VemP, whereas PpiD acts cooperatively with SecD/F in the translocation and arrest-cancelation of VemP. We also identified the conserved Arg-85 residue of VemP as a crucial element that confers PpiD-dependence to VemP and plays an essential role in the regulated arrest-cancelation. We propose a scheme of the arrest-cancelation processes of VemP, which likely monitors late steps in the protein translocation pathway.</description>

	<title>eLife: Transport mechanism of P4 ATPase phosphatidylcholine flippases</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62163</link>
	<description>The P4 ATPases use ATP hydrolysis to transport large lipid substrates across lipid bilayers. The structures of the endosome- and Golgi-localized phosphatidylserine flippases—such as the yeast Drs2 and human ATP8A1—have recently been reported. However, a substrate binding site on the cytosolic side has not been found, and the transport mechanisms of P4 ATPases with other substrates are unknown. Here we report structures of the &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae &lt;/i&gt;Dnf1–Lem3 and Dnf2–Lem3 complexes. We captured substrate phosphatidylcholine molecules on both the exoplasmic and cytosolic sides and found that they have similar structures. Unexpectedly, Lem3 contributes to substrate binding. The conformational transitions of these phosphatidylcholine transporters match those of the phosphatidylserine transporters, suggesting a conserved mechanism among P4 ATPases. Dnf1/Dnf2 have a unique P domain helix-turn-helix insertion that is important for function. Therefore, P4 ATPases may have retained an overall transport mechanism while evolving distinct features for different lipid substrates.</description>

	<description>When the environment changes, vision adapts to maintain accurate perception. For repeatedly encountered environments, learning to adjust more rapidly would be beneficial, but past work remains inconclusive. We tested if the visual system can learn such visual mode switching for a strongly color-tinted environment, where adaptation causes the dominant hue to fade over time. Eleven observers wore bright red glasses for five 1-hr periods per day, for 5 days. Color adaptation was measured by asking observers to identify ‘unique yellow’, appearing neither reddish nor greenish. As expected, the world appeared less and less reddish during the 1-hr periods of glasses wear. Critically, across days the world also appeared significantly less reddish immediately upon donning the glasses. These results indicate that the visual system learned to rapidly adjust to the reddish environment, switching modes to stabilize color vision. Mode switching likely provides a general strategy to optimize perceptual processes.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61048</link>
	<description>Predictions based on learned statistical regularities in the visual worldhave been shown to facilitate attention and goal-directed behavior by sharpening the sensory representation of goal-relevant stimuli in advance. Yet, how the brain learns to ignore predictable goal-irrelevant or distracting information is unclear.Here, we used EEG anda visual search task in which the predictability of a distractor’s location and/or spatial frequency was manipulated to determine how spatial and feature distractor expectations are neurally implemented and reduce distractor interference. We find that expected distractor features could not only be decoded pre-stimulus, but their representation differed from the representation of that same feature when part of the target. Spatial distractor expectations did not induce changes in preparatory neural activity, but a strongly reduced Pd, an ERP index of inhibition. These results demonstrate that neural effects of statistical learning critically depend on the task relevance and dimension (spatial, feature) of predictions</description>

	<description>The ontogenetic trajectory of a marginal jawbone of &lt;i&gt;Lophosteus superbus&lt;/i&gt; (Late Silurian, 422 Million years old), the phylogenetically most basal stem osteichthyan, visualized by synchrotron microtomography, reveals a developmental relationship between teeth and dermal odontodes that is not evident from the adult morphology. The earliest odontodes are two longitudinal founder ridges formed at the ossification center. Subsequent odontodes that are added lingually to the ridges turn into conical teeth and undergo cyclic replacement, while those added labially achieve a stellate appearance. Stellate odontodes deposited directly on the bony plate are aligned with the alternate files of teeth, whereas new tooth positions are inserted into the files of sequential addition when a gap appears. Successive teeth and overgrowing odontodes show hybrid morphologies around the oral-dermal boundary, suggesting signal cross-communication. We propose that teeth and dermal odontodes are modifications of a single system, regulated and differentiated by the oral and dermal epithelia.</description>

	<description>The Red Sea was witness to important events during human history, including the first long steps in a trade network (the spice route) that would drive maritime technology and shape geopolitical fortunes for thousands of years. Punt was a pivotal early node in the rise of this enterprise, serving as an important emporium for luxury goods, including sacred baboons (&lt;i&gt;Papio hamadryas&lt;/i&gt;), but its location is disputed. Here, we use geospatial variation in the oxygen and strontium isotope ratios of 155 baboons from 77 locations to estimate the geoprovenance of mummified baboons recovered from ancient Egyptian temples and tombs. Five Ptolemaic specimens of &lt;i&gt;P. anubis&lt;/i&gt; (404–40 BC) showed evidence of long-term residency in Egypt prior to mummification, consistent with a captive breeding program. Two New Kingdom specimens of &lt;i&gt;P. hamadryas&lt;/i&gt; were sourced to a region that encompasses much of present-day Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Djibouti, and portions of Somalia and Yemen. This result is a testament to the tremendous reach of Egyptian seafaring during the 2nd millennium BC. It also corroborates the balance of scholarly conjecture on the location of Punt.</description>

	<description>Aging-associated diseases, including cardiac dysfunction, are increasingly common in the population. However, the mechanisms of physiologic aging in general, and cardiac aging in particular, remain poorly understood. Age-related heart impairment is lacking a clinically effective treatment. Using the model of naturally aging mice and rats, we show direct evidence of increased proton leak in the aged heart mitochondria. Moreover, our data suggested ANT1 as the most likely site of mediating increased mitochondrial proton permeability in old cardiomyocytes. Most importantly, the tetra-peptide SS-31 prevents age-related excess proton entry, decreases the mitochondrial flash activity and mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, rejuvenates mitochondrial function by direct association with ANT1 and the mitochondrial ATP synthasome, and leads to substantial reversal of diastolic dysfunction. Our results uncover the excessive proton leak as a novel mechanism of age-related cardiac dysfunction and elucidate how SS-31 can reverse this clinically important complication of cardiac aging.</description>

	<description>In many cases of trauma, the same environmental stimuli that become associated with aversive events are experienced on other occasions without adverse consequence. We examined neural circuits underlying partially reinforced fear (PRF), whereby mice received tone-shock pairings on half of conditioning trials. Tone-elicited freezing was lower after PRF conditioning than fully reinforced fear (FRF) conditioning, despite an equivalent number of tone-shock pairings. PRF preferentially activated medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Chemogenetic inhibition of BNST-projecting mPFC neurons increased PRF, not FRF, freezing. Multiplexing chemogenetics with &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; neuronal recordings showed elevated infralimbic cortex (IL) neuronal activity during CS-onset and freezing-cessation; these neural correlates were abolished by chemogenetic mPFC®BNST inhibition. These data suggest mPFC®BNST neurons limit fear to threats with a history of partial association with an aversive stimulus, with potential implications for understanding the neural basis of trauma-related disorders.</description>

	<description>Despite the importance of programming to modern society, the cognitive and neural bases of code comprehension are largely unknown. Programming languages might ‘recycle’ neurocognitive mechanisms originally developed for natural languages. Alternatively, comprehension of code could depend on fronto-parietal networks shared with other culturally-invented symbol systems, such as formal logic and symbolic math such as algebra. Expert programmers (average 11 years of programming experience) performed code comprehension and memory control tasks while undergoing fMRI. The same participants also performed formal logic, symbolic math, executive control, and language localizer tasks. A left-lateralized fronto-parietal network was recruited for code comprehension. Patterns of activity within this network distinguish between ‘for’ loops and ‘if’ conditional code functions. In terms of the underlying neural basis, code comprehension overlapped extensively with formal logic and to a lesser degree math. Overlap with executive processes and language was low, but laterality of language and code covaried across individuals. Cultural symbol systems, including code, depend on a distinctive fronto-parietal cortical network.</description>

	<description>Computer programming is a novel cognitive tool that has transformed modern society. What cognitive and neural mechanisms support this skill? Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate two candidate brain systems: the multiple demand (MD) system, typically recruited during math, logic, problem solving, and executive tasks, and the language system, typically recruited during linguistic processing. We examined MD and language system responses to code written in Python, a text-based programming language (Experiment 1) and in ScratchJr, a graphical programming language (Experiment 2); for both, we contrasted responses to code problems with responses to content-matched sentence problems. We found that the MD system exhibited strong bilateral responses to code in both experiments, whereas the language system responded strongly to sentence problems, but weakly or not at all to code problems. Thus, the MD system supports the use of novel cognitive tools even when the input is structurally similar to natural language.</description>

	<title>eLife: Cold-induced hyperphagia requires AgRP-neuron activation in mice</title>

	<description>To maintain energy homeostasis during cold exposure, the increased energy demands of thermogenesis must be counterbalanced by increased energy intake. To investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this cold-induced hyperphagia, we asked whether agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons are activated when animals are placed in a cold environment and, if so, whether this response is required for the associated hyperphagia. We report that AgRP-neuron activation occurs rapidly upon acute cold exposure, as do increases of both energy expenditure and energy intake, suggesting the mere perception of cold is sufficient to engage each of these responses. We further report that silencing of AgRP neurons selectively blocks the effect of cold exposure to increase food intake but has no effect on energy expenditure. Together, these findings establish a physiologically important role for AgRP neurons in the hyperphagic response to cold exposure.</description>

	<title>eLife: Primary and promiscuous functions coexist during evolutionary innovation through whole protein domain acquisitions</title>

	<description>Molecular examples of evolutionary innovation are scarce and generally involve point mutations. Innovation can occur through larger rearrangements, but here experimental data is extremely limited. Integron integrases innovated from double-strand- towards single-strand-DNA recombination through the acquisition of the I2 a-helix. To investigate how this transition was possible, we have evolved integrase IntI1 to what should correspond to an early innovation state by selecting for its ancestral activity. Using synonymous alleles to enlarge sequence space exploration, we have retrieved 13 mutations affecting both I2 and the multimerization domains of IntI1. We circumvented epistasis constraints among them using a combinatorial library that revealed their individual and collective fitness effects. We obtained up to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-fold increases in ancestral activity with various asymmetrical trade-offs in single-strand-DNA recombination. We show that high levels of primary and promiscuous functions could have initially coexisted following I2 acquisition, paving the way for a gradual evolution towards innovation.</description>

	<description>Aging is characterized by extensive metabolic reprogramming. To identify metabolic pathways associated with aging, we analyzed age-dependent changes in the metabolomes of long-lived &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. Among the metabolites that changed, levels of tyrosine were increased with age in long-lived flies. We demonstrate that the levels of enzymes in the tyrosine degradation pathway increase with age in wild-type flies. Whole-body and neuronal-specific downregulation of enzymes in the tyrosine degradation pathway significantly extends &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;lifespan, causes alterations of metabolites associated with increased lifespan, and upregulates the levels of tyrosine-derived neuromediators. Moreover, feeding wild-type flies with tyrosine increased their lifespan. Mechanistically, we show that suppression of ETC complex I drives the upregulation of enzymes in the tyrosine degradation pathway, an effect that can be rescued by tigecycline, an FDA-approved drug that specifically suppresses mitochondrial translation. In addition, tyrosine supplementation partially rescued lifespan of flies with ETC complex I suppression. Altogether, our study highlights the tyrosine degradation pathway as a regulator of longevity.</description>

	<title>eLife: Autophagy in T cells from aged donors is maintained by spermidine, and correlates with function and vaccine responses</title>

	<description>Older adults are at high risk for infectious diseases such as observed at the recent COVID-19 outbreak and vaccination seems to be the only long-term solution to the pandemic. While most vaccines are less efficacious in older adults, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underpin this. Autophagy, a major degradation pathway and one of the few processes known to prevent aging, is critical for the maintenance of immune memory in mice. Here, we show that autophagy is specifically induced in vaccine-induced antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in healthy human volunteers. In addition, reduced IFN secretion by RSV-induced T cells in older vaccinees correlates with low autophagy levels. We demonstrate in human donors that levels of the endogenous autophagy-inducing metabolite spermidine fall in T cells with age. Spermidine supplementation of T cells from old donors recovers their autophagy level and function, similar to young donors' cells, in which spermidine biosynthesis has been inhibited. Finally, our data show that endogenous spermidine maintains autophagy via the translation factor eIF5A and transcription factor TFEB. With these findings we have uncovered novel targets and biomarkers for the development of anti-aging drugs for human T cells, providing evidence for the use of spermidine in improving vaccine immunogenicity in the aged human population.</description>

	<title>eLife: Therapeutic genetic variation revealed in diverse Hsp104 homologs</title>

	<description>The AAA+ protein disaggregase, Hsp104, increases fitness under stress by reversing stress-induced protein aggregation. Natural Hsp104 variants might exist with enhanced, selective activity against neurodegenerative disease substrates. However, natural Hsp104 variation remains largely unexplored. Here, we screened a cross-kingdom collection of Hsp104 homologs in yeast proteotoxicity models. Prokaryotic ClpG reduced TDP-43, FUS, and a-synuclein toxicity, whereas prokaryotic ClpB and hyperactive variants were ineffective. We uncovered therapeutic genetic variation among eukaryotic Hsp104 homologs that specifically antagonized TDP-43 condensation and toxicity in yeast and TDP-43 aggregation in human cells. We also uncovered distinct eukaryotic Hsp104 homologs that selectively antagonized a-synuclein condensation and toxicity in yeast and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Surprisingly, this therapeutic variation did not manifest as enhanced disaggregase activity, but rather as increased passive inhibition of aggregation of specific substrates. By exploring natural tuning of this passive Hsp104 activity, we elucidated enhanced, substrate-specific agents that counter proteotoxicity underlying neurodegeneration.</description>

	<title>eLife: Subcellular sorting of neuregulins controls the assembly of excitatory-inhibitory cortical circuits</title>

	<description>The assembly of specific neuronal circuits relies on the expression of complementary molecular programs in presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. In the cerebral cortex, the tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB4 is critical for the wiring of specific populations of GABAergic interneurons, in which it paradoxically regulates both the formation of inhibitory synapses as well as the development of excitatory synapses received by these cells. Here we found that Nrg1 and Nrg3, two members of the neuregulin family of trophic factors, respectively regulate the inhibitory outputs and excitatory inputs of interneurons in the mouse cerebral cortex. The differential role of Nrg1 and Nrg3 in this process is not due to their receptor-binding EGF-like domain, but rather to their distinctive subcellular localization within pyramidal cells. Our study reveals a novel strategy for the assembly of cortical circuits that involves the differential subcellular sorting of family-related synaptic proteins.</description>

	<description>Phosphoinositides (PI) are key regulators of cellular organization in eukaryotes and genes that tune PI signalling are implicated in human disease mechanisms. Biochemical analyses and studies in cultured cells have identified a large number of proteins that can mediate PI signalling. However, the role of such proteins in regulating cellular processes &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and development in metazoans remains to be understood. Here we describe a set of CRISPR based genome engineering tools that allow the manipulation of each of these proteins with spatial and temporal control during metazoan development. We demonstrate the use of these reagents to deplete a set of 103 proteins individually in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; eye and identify several new molecules that control eye development. Our work demonstrates the power of this resource in uncovering the molecular basis of tissue homeostasis during normal development and in human disease biology.</description>

	<title>eLife: Using the past to estimate sensory uncertainty</title>

	<description>To form a more reliable percept of the environment, the brain needs to estimate its own sensory uncertainty. Current theories of perceptual inference assume that the brain computes sensory uncertainty instantaneously and independently for each stimulus. We evaluated this assumption in four psychophysical experiments, in which human observers localized auditory signals that were presented synchronously with spatially disparate visual signals. Critically, the visual noise changed dynamically over time continuously or with intermittent jumps. Our results show that observers integrate audiovisual inputs weighted by sensory uncertainty estimates that combine information from past and current signals consistent with an optimal Bayesian learner that can be approximated by exponential discounting. Our results challenge leading models of perceptual inference where sensory uncertainty estimates depend only on the current stimulus. They demonstrate that the brain capitalizes on the temporal dynamics of the external world and estimates sensory uncertainty by combining past experiences with new incoming sensory signals.</description>

	<description>Data binning can cope with overplotting and noise, making it a versatile tool for comparing many observations. However, it goes awry if the same observations are used for binning and contrasting. This creates an inherent circularity, leaving noise and regression to the mean insufficiently controlled. Here, we use population receptive field analyses - where data binning is commonplace - as an example to expose this flaw through simulations and empirical repeat data.</description>

	<description>Mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonists are the most effective analgesics, but their use risks respiratory depression and addiction. The epithalamic lateral habenula (LHb) is a critical site that signals aversive states, often via indirect inhibition of reward circuitry, and MORs are highly expressed in the LHb. We found that the LHb is a potent site for MOR-agonist analgesia. Strikingly, LHb MOR activation generates negative reinforcement but is not rewarding in the absence of noxious input. While the LHb receives inputs from multiple sites, we found that inputs from the lateral preoptic area of the hypothalamus (LPO) are excited by noxious stimulation, express MOR mRNA, and are preferentially targeted by MOR selective agonists. Critically, optogenetic stimulation of LHb-projecting LPO neurons produces an aversive state relieved by LHb MOR activation. Therefore targeting this MOR sensitive forebrain circuit can relieve pain yet lower the risk of misuse by pain free individuals.</description>

	<description>Identification of mechanisms which increase deep sleep could lead to novel treatments which promote the restorative effects of sleep. Here, knockdown of the 3 GABAA-receptor subunit from parvalbumin neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing increased non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep and the thalamocortical delta oscillations implicated in many health-promoting effects of sleep. Inhibitory synaptic currents were strongly reduced in vitro. Effects were selective to the mouse sleep (light) period. Further analysis identified a novel deep-sleep state in mice prior to NREM-REM transitions which was preferentially affected by deletion of 3 subunits. Our results identify a functional role for GABAA receptors on TRN neurons and suggest antagonism of 3 subunits as a strategy to enhance deep sleep.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The role of anatomical connection strength for interareal communication in macaque cortex</title>

	<description>What is the relationship between anatomical connection strength and rhythmic synchronization? Simultaneous recordings of 15 cortical areas in two macaque monkeys show that interareal networks are functionally organized in spatially distinct modules with specific synchronization frequencies, i.e. frequency-specific functional connectomes. We relate the functional interactions between 91 area pairs to their anatomical connection strength defined in a separate cohort of twenty six subjects. This reveals that anatomical connection strength predicts rhythmic synchronization and vice-versa, in a manner that is specific for frequency bands and for the feedforward versus feedback direction, even if interareal distances are taken into account. These results further our understanding of structure-function relationships in large-scale networks covering different modality-specific brain regions and provide strong constraints on mechanistic models of brain function. Because this approach can be adapted to non-invasive techniques, it promises to open new perspectives on the functional organization of the human brain.</description>

	<description>The dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) and median raphe nucleus (MR) contain populations of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons regulating diverse behavioral functions. Their whole-brain input-output circuits remain incompletely understood. We used viral tracing combined with fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography to generate a comprehensive whole-brain atlas of inputs and outputs of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the DR and MR. We discovered that these neurons receive inputs from similar upstream brain regions. The glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the same raphe nucleus have divergent projection patterns with differences in critical brain regions. Specifically, MR glutamatergic neurons project to the lateral habenula via multiple pathways. Correlation and cluster analysis indicated that glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the same raphe nucleus receive inputs from heterogeneous neurons in upstream brain regions and send different collateral projections. This connectivity atlas provides insights into the cell heterogeneity, anatomical connectivity and behavioral functions of the raphe nucleus.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The statistical challenge of finding spontaneous changes in functional connectivity in high-dimensional fMRI data</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.422845v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>An important question in neuroscience is whether or not we can interpret spontaneous variations in the pattern of correlation between brain areas, which we refer to as functional connectivity or FC , as an index of dynamic neuronal communication in fMRI . That is, can we measure time-varying FC reliably? And, if so, can FC reflect information transfer between brain regions at relatively fast-time scales? Answering these questions in practice requires dealing with the statistical challenge of having high-dimensional data and a comparatively lower number of time points or volumes. A common strategy is to use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and then apply some model, such as the hidden Markov model (HMM) or a Bayesian mixture of distributions, to find a set of distinct FC patterns or states. The distinct spatial properties of these FC states together with the time resolved switching between them offer a flexible description of time-varying FC . In this work, we show that in this context PCA can suffer from systematic biases and loss of sensitivity for the purposes of finding time-varying FC . To get around these issues, we propose a novel variety of the HMM, the HMM- PCA , where the states are themselves PCA decompositions. Since PCA is based on the data covariance, the state-specific PCA decompositions reflect distinct patterns of FC . We show, theoretically and empirically, that fusing dimensionality reduction and time-varying FC estimation in one single step can avoid these problems and outperform alternative approaches, eventually facilitating the quantification of transient communication in the brain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Paradoxical phase response of gamma rhythms facilitates their entrainment in heterogeneous networks</title>

	<description>The synchronization of different gamma rhythms arising in different brain areas has been implicated in various cognitive functions. Here, we focus on the effect of the ubiquitous neuronal heterogeneity on the synchronization of PING (pyramidal-interneuronal network gamma) and ING (interneuronal network gamma) rhythms. The synchronization properties of rhythms depends on the response of their collective phase to external input. We therefore determined the macroscopic phase-response curve for finite-amplitude perturbations (fmPRC), using numerical simulation of all-to-all coupled networks of integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons exhibiting either PING or ING rhythms. We show that the intrinsic neuronal heterogeneity can qualitatively modify the fmPRC. While the phase-response curve for the individual IF-neurons is strictly positive (type I), the fmPRC can be biphasic and exhibit both signs (type II). Thus, for PING rhythms, an external excitation to the excitatory cells can, in fact, delay the collective oscillation of the network, even though the same excitation would lead to an advance when applied to uncoupled neurons. This paradoxical delay arises when the external excitation modifies the internal dynamics of the network by causing additional spikes of inhibitory neurons, whose delaying within-network inhibition outweighs the immediate advance caused by the external excitation. These results explain how intrinsic heterogeneity allows the PING rhythm to become synchronized with a periodic forcing or another PING rhythm for a wider range in the mismatch of their frequencies. We demonstrate a similar mechanism for the synchronization of ING rhythms. Our results identify a potential function of neuronal heterogeneity in the synchronization of coupled gamma rhythms, which may play a role in neural information transfer via communication through coherence.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Extracting neuronal activity signals from microscopy recordings of contractile tissue: a cell tracking approach using B-spline Explicit Active Surfaces (BEAS)</title>

	<description>Ca 2+ imaging is a widely used microscopy technique to simultaneously study cellular activity in multiple cells. The desired information consists of cell-specific time series of pixel intensity values, in which the fluorescence intensity represents cellular activity. For static scenes, cellular signal extraction is straightforward, however multiple analysis challenges are present in recordings of contractile tissues, like those of the enteric nervous system (ENS). This layer of critical neurons, embedded within the muscle layers of the gut wall, shows optical overlap between neighboring neurons, intensity changes due to cell activity, and constant movement. These challenges reduce the applicability of classical segmentation techniques and traditional stack alignment and regions-of-interest (ROIs) selection workflows. Therefore, a signal extraction method capable of dealing with moving cells and is insensitive to large intensity changes in consecutive frames is needed. Here we propose a b-spline active contour method to delineate and track neuronal cell bodies based on local and global energy terms. We develop both a single as well as a double-contour approach. The latter takes advantage of the appearance of GCaMP expressing cells, and tracks the nucleus boundaries together with the cytoplasmic contour, providing a stable delineation of neighboring, overlapping cells despite movement and intensity changes. The tracked contours can also serve as landmarks to relocate additional and manually-selected ROIs. This improves the total yield of efficacious cell tracking and allows signal extraction from other cell compartments like neuronal processes. Compared to manual delineation and other segmentation methods, the proposed method can track cells during large tissue deformations and high-intensity changes such as during neuronal firing events, while preserving the shape of the extracted Ca 2+ signal. The analysis package represents a significant improvement to available Ca 2+ imaging analysis workflows for ENS recordings and other systems where movement challenges traditional Ca 2+ signal extraction workflows.</description>

	<description>Several studies have established specific relationships between White Matter (WM) and behaviour. However, these studies have typically focussed on fractional anisotropy (FA), a neuroimaging metric that is sensitive to multiple tissue properties, making it difficult to identify what biological aspects of WM may drive such relationships. Here, we carry out a pre-registered assessment of WM-behaviour relationships across multiple behavioural, anatomical and biological domains. Surprisingly, we find support for predicted relationships between FA and behaviour only in one of three pre-registered tests. We also find no evidence for consistent multimodal signatures across neuroimaging markers with different biological sensitivity, which suggests there is no common biological substrate for WM-behaviour relationships. These results demonstrate that FA-behaviour relationships from the literature may not be easily generalisable across domains. They also highlight a broad heterogeneity in WM's relationship with behaviour, indicating that variable biological effects may be shaping their interaction.</description>

	<description>Expectation violation has been shown to engage adaptive memory formation, resulting in better memory for unexpected information. In two experiments we tested whether this mechanism is engaged dynamically in a goal-irrelevant manner during retrieval, and how it affects trial-by-trial recognition. Participants encoded images of objects, and then learned a contingency between a cue and category (man-made or natural) with new objects. Targets and parametrically manipulated similar foils, comprising set events, were used at retrieval. In each retrieval trial a cue appeared, which either matched or mismatched (according to the established contingency) the following object, for which participants made an old/new decision. We found that unexpected events at retrieval were associated with increased activation along the ventral visual stream, whereas expected events engaged parietal regions of the core recollection network. For targets and most similar foils, we found an interaction between current and previous expectation status on memory performance, such that expected events following unexpected ones (UprevEcurr) showed a boost in performance. This behavioural effect was associated with activation in the hippocampus, SN/VTA and occipital cortex. A combination of two unexpected events (UprevUcurr) resulted in the poorest memory performance and was associated with increased activation in occipital cortex. Taken together, our findings suggest expectation violation engages an encoding mechanism, supported by bottom-up processing, in a task-independent manner. Therefore, when the goal is to retrieve information, the mnemonic consequences of the shift towards an encoding state is detrimental in real-time, but beneficial for subsequent similar events.</description>

	<description>In everyday conversation, we usually process the talker's face as well as the sound of their voice. Access to visual speech information is particularly useful when the auditory signal is degraded. Here we used fMRI to monitor brain activity while adults (n = 60) were presented with visual-only, auditory-only, and audiovisual words. As expected, audiovisual speech perception recruited both auditory and visual cortex, with a trend towards increased recruitment of premotor cortex in more difficult conditions (for example, in substantial background noise). We then investigated neural connectivity using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis with seed regions in both primary auditory cortex and primary visual cortex. Connectivity between auditory and visual cortices was stronger in audiovisual conditions than in unimodal conditions, including a wide network of regions in posterior temporal cortex and prefrontal cortex. Taken together, our results suggest a prominent role for cross-region synchronization in understanding both visual-only and audiovisual speech.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Ageing and MPTP- sensitivity depend on molecular and ultrastructural signatures of astroglia and microglia in mice nigra</title>

	<description>Glia show region-specific distribution in CNS and often mal-adapt to age-associated alterations in their niche. Some studies on autopsied nigra of Parkinson disease (PD) patients and experimental models propose gliosis as a putative trigger of neuronal loss. Epidemiological studies propose an ethnic bias in PD prevalence, as Caucasians are more susceptible than non-whites. Similarly, different mice strains are variably sensitive to MPTP. We had earlier likened divergent MPTP-sensitivity of C57BL/6J and CD-1 mice with differential susceptibility to PD based on differences in neuronal numbers. Here we examined whether the variability was also incumbent to inter-strain differences in glial features. Stereological counts showed more microglia and fewer astrocytes in the nigra of MPTP-susceptible normal C57BL/6J mice, suggesting persistence of an immune-vigilant state. Pronounced MPTP-induced microgliosis and astrogliosis in both strains suggest glial involvement in pathogenesis. ELISA-based estimation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the ventral midbrain revealed middle-age specific augmentation of TNF- and IL-6 that reduced at old-age, suggesting middle-age as a critical, inflamm-aging associated time-point. IL-1{beta} levels declined gradually. Inter-strain differences in TNF-, including that seen post-MPTP, persisted across ageing while IL-6 and IL-1{beta} showed upregulation at old-age. Levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-{beta} were higher in CD-1. The enzymes MAO-A, MAO-B and iNOS were upregulated in both strains upon MPTP-challenge. Enhancement in fracktalkine and hemeoxygenase-1, post-MPTP, may be neuronal compensatory signals. Most importantly, ultrastructural observations of elongated glial mitochondria vis-a-vis the shrunken ones in neurons, suggest upscaling of glial functions with neurotoxic consequences. Thus, glia could be key modulators of ageing and disease-susceptibility.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Information flow, cell types and stereotypy in a full olfactory connectome</title>

	<description>The hemibrain connectome (Scheffer et al., 2020) provides large scale connectivity and morphology information for the majority of the central brain of Drosophila melanogaster. Using this data set, we provide a complete description of the most complex olfactory system studied at synaptic resolution to date, covering all first, second and third-order neurons of the olfactory system associated with the antennal lobe and lateral horn (mushroom body neurons are described in a parallel paper, Li et al., 2020). We develop a generally applicable strategy to extract information flow and layered organisation from synaptic resolution connectome graphs, mapping olfactory input to descending interneurons. This identifies a range of motifs including highly lateralised circuits in the antennal lobe and patterns of convergence downstream of the mushroom body and lateral horn. We also leverage a second data set (FAFB, Zheng et al., 2018) to provide a first quantitative assessment of inter- versus intra-individual stereotypy. Complete reconstruction of select developmental lineages in two brains (three brain hemispheres) reveals striking similarity in neuronal morphology across brains for &amp;gt;170 cell types. Within and across brains, connectivity correlates with morphology. Notably, neurons of the same morphological type show similar connection variability within one brain as across brains; this property should enable a rigorous quantitative approach to cell typing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Regional and age-dependent Effects of Cortical Magnetic Stimulation on Unconstrained Reaching Behavior</title>

	<description>Background: The specific and dynamic contributions of premotor and supplementary motor areas to reaching movements in aging humans are not well understood. Objective: To better understand the role of cortical motor regions and age on the control of unconstrained reaches against gravity by neurologically intact, younger and older adults. Methods: Double pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied at locations targeting primary motor cortex (M1), dorsal premotor area (PMA), supplementary motor area (SMA), or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Paired stimuli were delivered before or after a visual cue was presented to initiate self-paced right-handed reaches to one of three, vertically oriented target locations. Results: Regional stimulation effects on movement amplitude were observed both early and late in the reach. PMA stimulation increased reach distance to a greater extent than M1, SMA, and DLPFC stimulation. M1 and PMA stimulation increased deviation from the straight-line path around the time of peak velocity to an extent that was greater than SMA and DLPFC stimulation. Cortical stimulation increased the time that elapsed after, but not before, peak velocity. Despite stronger effects of stimulation on reaches in the younger group, this group had shorter times to reach the target after reaching peak velocity. Conclusion: These results provide support for a role of PMA in visually guided movement after movement initiation. For older subjects, the increased time to arrive at the target after peak velocity despite weaker stimulation effects suggests an age-related reduction in sensorimotor processing flexibility for online control of unconstrained reaching.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Pyramidal tract neurons drive feed-forward excitation of striatum through cholinergic interneurons</title>

	<description>Corticostriatal connectivity is central for many cognitive and motor processes, such as reinforcement or action initiation and invigoration. The cortical input to the striatum arises from two main cortical populations: intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) neurons. We uncovered a new feed-forward excitatory circuit, supported by a polysynaptic motif from PT neurons to cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) to excitatory inputs, which runs in parallel to the canonical monosynaptic corticostriatal connection. This new motif conveys a delayed second phase of excitation to striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs), through an acetylcholine-dependent glutamate release mechanism, resulting in biphasic corticostriatal signals. These biphasic signals are a hallmark of PT, but not IT, corticostriatal inputs, due to a stronger relative input from PT neurons to ChIs. These results uncover a novel feed-forward circuit mechanism by which PT activity differentially gates excitatory inputs to the striatum, with potential implications for behavior, plasticity and learning.</description>

	<description>Objective: The kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE) model in rats is an etiologically-relevant animal model of epileptogenesis. Just as in patients, who develop temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) following SE, this rat model of KA-induced SE very closely recapitulates many of the clinical and pathological characteristics of human TLE that arise following SE or another neurological insult. Spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) in TLE can present after a latent period following a neurological insult (TBI, SE event, viral infection, etc.). Moreover, this rat model of TLE is ideally suited for preclinical studies to evaluate the long-term process of epileptogenesis and screen putative disease-modifying/antiepileptogenic agents. This report details the pharmacological characterization and methodological refinement of a moderate-throughput drug screening program using the post KA-induced SE model of epileptogenesis in male Sprague Dawley rats to identify potential agents that may prevent or modify the onset or severity of SRS. Specifically, we sought to demonstrate whether our protocol could prevent the development of SRS, or lead to a reduced frequency/severity of SRS. Methods: Rats were administered everolimus (2-3 mg/kg, P.O. commencing at 1, 2, or 24-hrs after SE onset) or phenobarbital (60 mg/kg, beginning 1 hr after SE onset). The rats in all studies (n=12/treatment dose/study) were then followed intermittently by video-EEG monitoring; i.e., 2-weeks on/2-weeks off, 2-weeks on epochs to determine latency to onset of SRS, and disease burden following SRS onset. Results: While there were no adverse side effects observed in any of our studies, no treatment conferred a significant disease modifying effect, nor did any agent prevent the presentation of SRS by 6 weeks post-SE onset. Conclusions: While neither phenobarbital nor everolimus administered at several time points post-SE onset prevented the development of SRS, we herein demonstrate a moderate-throughput screen for potential antiepileptogenic agents in an etiologically-relevant rodent model of TLE.</description>

	<description>Aim The aim of the present study is to investigate the relations between both functional connectivity and brain networks with cognitive decline, in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Introduction PD phenotype is not limited to motor impairment but, rather, a wide range of non-motor disturbances can occur, cognitive impairment being one of the commonest. However, how the large-scale organization of brain activity differs in cognitively impaired patients, as opposed to cognitively preserved ones, remains poorly understood. Methods Starting from source-reconstructed resting-state magnetoencephalography data, we applied the PLM to estimate functional connectivity, globally and between brain areas, in PD patients with and without cognitive impairment (respectively PD-CI and PD-NC), as compared to healthy subjects (HS). Furthermore, using graph analysis, we characterized the alterations in brain network topology and related these, as well as the functional connectivity, to cognitive performance. Results We found reduced global and nodal PLM in several temporal (fusiform gyrus, Heschl's gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus), parietal (postcentral gyrus), and occipital (lingual gyrus) areas within the left hemisphere, in the gamma band, in PD-CI patients, as compared to PD-NC and HS. With regard to the global topological features, PD-CI patients, as compared to HS and PD-NC patients, showed differences in multi frequencies bands (delta, alpha, gamma) in the Leaf fraction, Tree hierarchy (both higher in PD-CI) and Diameter (lower in PD-CI). Finally, we found statistically significant correlations between the MoCA test and both the Diameter in delta band and the Tree Hierarchy in the alpha band. Conclusion Our work points to specific large-scale rearrangements that occur selectively in cognitively compromised PD patients and correlated to cognitive impairment.</description>

	<description>Recent advancements in multielectrode methods and spike-sorting algorithms enable the in vivo recording of the activities of many neurons at a high temporal resolution. These datasets offer new opportunities in the investigation of the biological neural code, including the direct testing of specific coding hypotheses, but they also reveal the limitations of present decoder algorithms. Classical methods rely on a manual feature extraction step, resulting in a feature vector, like the firing rates of an ensemble of neurons. In this paper, we present a recurrent neural-network based decoder and evaluate its performance on experimental and artificial datasets. The experimental datasets were obtained by recording the auditory cortical responses of rats exposed to sound stimuli, while the artificial datasets represent preset encoding schemes. We illustrate that, depending on the coding scheme, the performance of the recurrent-network based encoder can exceed the performance of the classical methods. We also show how randomized copies of the training datasets can be used to reveal the role of candidate spike-train features.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Juvenile exposure to acute traumatic stress leads to long-lasting alterations in grey matter myelination in adult female but not male rats</title>

	<description>Stress early in life can have a major impact on brain development, and there is increasing evidence that childhood stress confers vulnerability for later developing psychiatric disorders. In particular, during peri-adolescence, brain regions crucial for emotional regulation, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY) and hippocampus (HPC), are still developing and are highly sensitive to stress. Changes in myelin levels have been implicated in mental illnesses and stress effects on myelin and oligodendrocytes (OLs) are beginning to be explored as a novel and underappreciated mechanism underlying psychopathologies. Yet there is little research on the effects of acute stress on myelin during peri-adolescence, and even less work exploring sex-differences. Here, we used a rodent model to test the hypothesis that exposure to acute traumatic stress as a juvenile would induce changes in OLs and myelin content across limbic brain regions. Male and female juvenile rats underwent three hours of restraint stress with exposure to a predator odor on postnatal day (p) 28. Acute stress induced a physiological response, increasing corticosterone release and reducing weight gain in stress-exposed animals. Brain sections containing the PFC, AMY and HPC were taken either in adolescence (p40), or in adulthood (p95) and stained for markers of OLs and myelin. We found that acute stress induced sex-specific changes in grey matter (GM) myelination and OLs in both the short- and long-term. Exposure to a single stressor as a juvenile increased GM myelin content in the AMY and HPC in p40 males, compared to the respective control group. At p40, corticosterone release during stress exposure was also positively correlated with GM myelin content in the AMY of male rats. Single exposure to juvenile stress also led to long-term effects exclusively in female rats. Compared to controls, stress-exposed females showed reduced GM myelin content in all three brain regions. Acute stress exposure decreased PFC and HPC OL density in p40 females, perhaps contributing towards this observed long-term decrease in myelin content. Overall, our findings suggest that the juvenile brain is vulnerable to exposure to a brief severe stressor. Exposure to a single short traumatic event during peri-adolescence produces long-lasting changes in GM myelin content in the adult brain of female, but not male, rats. These findings highlight myelin plasticity as a potential contributor to sex-specific sensitivity to perturbation during a critical window of development.</description>

	<description>Few neuroimaging studies are sufficiently large to adequately describe population-wide variations. This study's primary aim was to generate neuroanatomical norms and individual markers that consider age, sex, and brain size, from 629 cerebral measures in the UK Biobank (N = 40 028). The secondary aim was to examine the effects and interactions of sex, age, and brain allometry - the non-linear scaling relationship between a region and brain size (e.g., Total Brain Volume) across cerebral measures. Allometry was a common property of brain volumes, thicknesses, and surface areas (83%) and was largely stable across age and sex. Sex differences occurred in 67% of cerebral measures (median |std. beta|= 0.13): 37% of regions were larger in males and 30% in females. Brain measures (49%) generally decreased with age, although aging effects varied across regions and sexes. While models with an allometric or linear covariate adjustment for brain size yielded similar significant effects, omitting brain allometry influenced reported sex differences in variance. This large scale-study advances our understanding of age, sex, and brain allometry's impact on brain structure and provides data for future UK Biobank studies to identify the cerebral regions that covary with specific phenotypes, independently of sex, age, and brain size.</description>

	<description>Circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) contributes to the development of multiple metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. However, its effect on vision is not understood. We evaluated the impact of CRD on retinal morphology, physiology, and vision after housing mice in a disruption inducing shorter light/dark cycle (L10:D10). Interestingly, the mice under L10:D10 exhibited three different entrainment behaviors; 'entrained', 'freerunning', and 'zigzagging.' These behavior groups under CRD exhibited reduced visual acuity, retinal thinning, and a decrease in the number of rod photoreceptors. Intriguingly, the electroretinogram response was decreased only in the mice exhibiting 'entrained' behavior. The retinal proteome showed distinct changes with each entrainment behavior. These results demonstrate that CRD leads to photoreceptor degeneration and visual dysfunction. We uniquely show the effect of entrainment behavior on retinal protein composition and physiology. Our data has broader implications in understanding and mitigating the effect of CRD on vision health.</description>

	<description>Non-overlapping cell populations within dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), defined by gene expression or projection target, control dissociable aspects of reward seeking through unique activity patterns. However, even within these defined cell populations considerable cell-to-cell variability is found, suggesting that greater resolution is needed to understand information processing in dmPFC. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in awake, behaving mice to monitor the activity of dmPFC excitatory neurons throughout Pavlovian sucrose conditioning. We characterize five unique neuronal ensembles that each encode specialized information related to a reward, reward-predictive cues, and behavioral responses to reward-predictive cues. The ensembles differentially emerge across learning, and stabilize after learning, in a manner that improves the predictive validity of dmPFC activity dynamics for deciphering variables related to behavioral conditioning. Our results characterize the complex dmPFC neuronal ensemble dynamics that relay learning-dependent signals for prediction of reward availability and initiation of conditioned reward seeking.</description>

	<description>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently a standard long-term treatment for advanced motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). In an effort to enable DBS under sedation, asleep DBS, we characterized the cortico-basal ganglia neuronal network of two non-human primates under propofol, ketamine and interleaved propofol-ketamine (IPK) sedation. Further, we compared these sedation states in the healthy and Parkinsonian condition to those of healthy sleep. Ketamine increases high frequency power and synchronization while propofol increases low frequency power and synchronization in polysomnography and neuronal activity recordings. Thus, ketamine does not mask the low frequency oscillations used for physiological navigation toward basal ganglia DBS targets. The brain state under ketamine and propofol mimicked rapid eye movement (REM) and Non-REM (NREM) sleep activity, respectively, and the IPK protocol imitates the NREM-REM sleep cycle. These promising results are the first step towards asleep DBS with non-distorted physiological navigation.</description>

	<description>Bipolar disorder (BD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder with genetic risk factors defined by recurrent episodes of mania/hypomania, depression and circadian rhythm abnormalities. While lithium is an effective drug for BD, 30-40% of patients fail to respond adequately to treatment. Previous work has demonstrated that lithium affects the expression of clock genes and that lithium responders (Li-R) can be distinguished from non-responders (Li-NR) by differences in circadian rhythms. However, rhythm abnormalities in BD have not been evaluated in neurons and it is unknown if neuronal rhythms differ between Li-R and Li-NR. We used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to culture neuronal precursor cells (NPC) and glutamatergic neurons from BD patients and controls. We identified strong circadian rhythms in Per2-luc expression in NPCs and neurons from controls and Li-R. NPC rhythms in Li-R had a shorter circadian period. Li-NR rhythms were low-amplitude and profoundly weakened. In NPCs and neurons, expression of PER2 was higher in both BD groups compared to controls. In neurons, PER2 protein expression was higher in BD than controls, especially in Li-NR samples. In single cells, NPC and neuron rhythms in both BD groups were desynchronized compared to controls. Lithium lengthened period in Li-R and control neurons but failed to alter rhythms in Li-NR. In contrast, temperature entrainment increased amplitude across all groups, and partly restored rhythms in Li-NR neurons. We conclude that neuronal circadian rhythm abnormalities are present in BD and most pronounced in Li-NR. Rhythm deficits in BD may be partly reversible through stimulation of entrainment pathways.</description>

	<description>A central role of the visual system is to integrate inputs from both eyes to form one coherent visual perception. The superior colliculus (SC) plays a central role in visual processing, gaze orientation and vergence eye movements necessary for binocular vision. Indeed, the SC receives direct inputs from both the contralateral and ipsilateral eye and binocularly-modulated neurons have been identified in the SC of multiple species. However, evidence for binocular processing in rodents, particularly mice, has not been functionally confirmed. In this study we recorded visually-evoked activity in the mouse SC while presenting visual stimuli to each eye individually or both together and reveal a surprising diversity of binocularly-modulated responses. Strikingly, we found that ~2/3 of all identified neurons in the anteromedial SC were binocularly-modulated. Furthermore, we identified four binocular subtypes based on their differential responses under varying ocularities of stimulus presentation. Interestingly, we found both orientation- and direction- selective (OS and DS, respectively) neurons in all four binocular subtypes. And, tuning properties of binocular neurons were distinct from neighboring monocular neurons, exhibiting more linear spatial summation. Together, these data suggest that binocular neurons are prevalent in the anteromedial SC of the mouse. Additionally, the distinct tuning properties of binocular neurons suggest a previously unappreciated complexity of visual processing in the SC, which may contribute to binocular perception.</description>

	<description>Episodic memory enables recollection of past experiences to guide future behavior. Humans know which memories to trust (high confidence) and which to doubt (low confidence). How memory retrieval, memory confidence, and memory-guided decisions are related, however, is not understood. Additionally, whether animals can assess confidence in episodic memories to guide behavior is unknown. We developed a spatial episodic memory task in which rats were incentivized to gamble their time: betting more following a correct choice yielded greater reward. Rat behavior reflected memory confidence, with higher temporal bets following correct choices. We applied modern machine learning to identify a memory decision variable, and built a generative model of memories evolving over time that accurately predicted both choices and confidence reports. Our results reveal in rats an ability thought to exist exclusively in primates, and introduce a unified model of memory dynamics, retrieval, choice, and confidence.</description>

	<description>Feeding is essential for animal survival and reproduction and is regulated by both internal states and external stimuli. However, little is known about how internal states influence the perception of external sensory cues that regulate feeding behavior. Here, we investigated the neuronal and molecular mechanisms behind nutritional state-mediated regulation of gustatory perception in control of feeding behavior in the brown planthopper and Drosophila. We found that feeding increases the expression of the cholecystokinin-like peptide, sulfakinin (SK), and the activity of a set of SK-expressing neurons. Starvation elevates the transcription of the sugar receptor Gr64f and SK negatively regulates the expression of Gr64f in both insects. This Gr64f regulation is by direct action of SK neurons on Gr64f-expressing neurons of the proboscis and proleg tarsi that co-express the SK receptor CCKLR-17D3. Our findings thus demonstrate how nutritional state induces peptide signaling to modulate sweet perception and thereby feeding behavior.</description>

	<description>Modulation of neuronal thresholds is ubiquitous in the brain. Phenomena such as figure-ground segmentation, motion detection, stimulus anticipation and shifts in attention all involve changes in a neuron's threshold based on signals from larger scales than its primary inputs. However, this modulation reduces the accuracy with which neurons can represent their primary inputs, creating a mystery as to why threshold modulation is so widespread in the brain. We find that modulation is less detrimental than other forms of neuronal variability and that its negative effects can be nearly completely eliminated if modulation is applied selectively to sparsely responding neurons in a circuit by inhibitory neurons. We verify these predictions in the retina where we find that inhibitory amacrine cells selectively deliver modulation signals to sparsely responding ganglion cell types. Our findings elucidate the central role that inhibitory neurons play in maximizing information transmission under modulation.</description>

	<description>Few investigations have been conducted on selective stimulation of small-radius unmyelinated C nerves (C), which is critical to both recoveries of damaged nerves and pain suppressions. The purpose of this study is to understand how an anodal pulse in an anodal-first stimulation could improve C-selectivity over myelinated nociceptive A{delta} nerves (A{delta}), and further clarify the landscape of the solution space. The Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model and the McIntyre-Richardson-Grill (MRG) model were used for modelling C and A{delta}, respectively to analyze the underlying ion dynamics and the influence of relevant stimulation waveforms, including monopolar, polarity-symmetric, and asymmetric pulses. Results showed that polarity-asymmetric waveforms with preceding anodal stimulations benefit C-selectivity most, underlain by the decrease of the potassium ion current of C. The optimal parameters for C-selectivity have been identified in the low frequency band, which will benefit remarkably the designs of nociceptive nerve selective stimulation.</description>

	<description>Cortical circuits process sensory information and generate motor signals in animals performing perceptual tasks. However, it is still unclear how sensory inputs generate motor signals in the cortex to initiate goal-directed action. Here, we identified a visual-to-motor inhibitory circuit in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that induced action initiation in mice performing visual Go/No-go tasks. Interestingly, higher activity in sensory neurons and faster suppression in motor neurons of the ACC predicted faster reaction times. Notably, optogenetic activation of visual inputs in the ACC evoked strong suppression of neighboring motor neurons by activating fast-spiking sensory neurons and drove task-relevant actions in mice via activating striatal neurons. Finally, the ACC network activity maintained low during spontaneous and perceptual actions and increased during action cancellation in response to the stop signals. Collectively, our data demonstrate that visual salience in the frontal cortex exerts gated feedforward inhibition to release goal-directed actions.</description>

Recent neurocomputational theories have hypothesized that abnormalities in prior beliefs and/or the precision-weighting of afferent interoceptive signals may facilitate the transdiagnostic emergence of psychopathology. Specifically, it has been suggested that, in certain psychiatric disorders, interoceptive processing mechanisms either over-weight prior beliefs or under-weight signals from the viscera (or both), leading to a failure to accurately update beliefs about the body. However, this has not been directly tested empirically. To evaluate the potential roles of prior beliefs and interoceptive precision in this context, we fit a Bayesian computational model to behavior in a transdiagnostic patient sample during an interoceptive awareness (heartbeat tapping) task. Modelling revealed that, during an interoceptive perturbation condition (inspiratory breath-holding during heartbeat tapping), healthy individuals (N = 52) assigned greater precision to ascending cardiac signals than individuals with symptoms of anxiety (N = 15), depression (N = 69), co-morbid depression/anxiety (N = 153), substance use disorders (N = 131), and eating disorders (N = 14)–who failed to increase their precision estimates from resting levels. In contrast, we did not find strong evidence for differences in prior beliefs. These results provide the first empirical computational modeling evidence of a selective dysfunction in adaptive interoceptive processing in psychiatric conditions, and lay the groundwork for future studies examining how reduced interoceptive precision influences body regulation and interoceptively-guided decision-making.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_ARGqjI_jWE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

When we face ambiguous images, the brain cannot commit to a single percept; instead, it switches between mutually exclusive interpretations every few seconds, a phenomenon known as bistable perception. While neuromechanistic models, e.g., adapting neural populations with lateral inhibition, may account for the dynamics of bistability, a larger question remains unresolved: how this phenomenon informs us on generic perceptual processes in less artificial contexts. Here, we propose that bistable perception is due to our prior beliefs being reverberated in the cortical hierarchy and corrupting the sensory evidence, a phenomenon known as “circular inference”. Such circularity could occur in a hierarchical brain where sensory responses trigger activity in higher-level areas but are also modulated by feedback projections from these same areas. We show that in the face of ambiguous sensory stimuli, circular inference can change the dynamics of the perceptual system and turn what should be an integrator of inputs into a bistable attractor switching between two highly trusted interpretations. The model captures various aspects of bistability, including Levelt’s laws and the stabilizing effects of intermittent presentation of the stimulus. Since it is related to the generic perceptual inference and belief updating mechanisms, this approach can be used to predict the tendency of individuals to form aberrant beliefs from their bistable perception behavior. Overall, we suggest that feedforward/feedback information loops in hierarchical neural networks, a phenomenon that could lead to psychotic symptoms when overly strong, could also underlie perception in nonclinical populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SteGn-tFEzk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A joint modeling approach for longitudinal microbiome data improves ability to detect microbiome associations with disease</title>

Changes in the composition of the microbiome over time are associated with myriad human illnesses. Unfortunately, the lack of analytic techniques has hindered researchers’ ability to quantify the association between longitudinal microbial composition and time-to-event outcomes. Prior methodological work developed the joint model for longitudinal and time-to-event data to incorporate time-dependent biomarker covariates into the hazard regression approach to disease outcomes. The original implementation of this joint modeling approach employed a linear mixed effects model to represent the time-dependent covariates. However, when the distribution of the time-dependent covariate is non-Gaussian, as is the case with microbial abundances, researchers require different statistical methodology. We present a joint modeling framework that uses a negative binomial mixed effects model to determine longitudinal taxon abundances. We incorporate these modeled microbial abundances into a hazard function with a parameterization that not only accounts for the proportional nature of microbiome data, but also generates biologically interpretable results. Herein we demonstrate the performance improvements of our approach over existing alternatives via simulation as well as a previously published longitudinal dataset studying the microbiome during pregnancy. The results demonstrate that our joint modeling framework for longitudinal microbiome count data provides a powerful methodology to uncover associations between changes in microbial abundances over time and the onset of disease. This method offers the potential to equip researchers with a deeper understanding of the associations between longitudinal microbial composition changes and disease outcomes. This new approach could potentially lead to new diagnostic biomarkers or inform clinical interventions to help prevent or treat disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5GflSMwc-Yo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Development of a hybrid model for a partially known intracellular signaling pathway through correction term estimation and neural network modeling</title>

Developing an accurate first-principle model is an important step in employing systems biology approaches to analyze an intracellular signaling pathway. However, an accurate first-principle model is difficult to be developed since it requires in-depth mechanistic understandings of the signaling pathway. Since underlying mechanisms such as the reaction network structure are not fully understood, significant discrepancy exists between predicted and actual signaling dynamics. Motivated by these considerations, this work proposes a hybrid modeling approach that combines a first-principle model and an artificial neural network (ANN) model so that predictions of the hybrid model surpass those of the original model. First, the proposed approach determines an optimal subset of model states whose dynamics should be corrected by the ANN by examining the correlation between each state and outputs through relative order. Second, an L2-regularized least-squares problem is solved to infer values of the correction terms that are necessary to minimize the discrepancy between the model predictions and available measurements. Third, an ANN is developed to generalize relationships between the values of the correction terms and the system dynamics. Lastly, the original first-principle model is coupled with the developed ANN to finalize the hybrid model development so that the model will possess generalized prediction capabilities while retaining the model interpretability. We have successfully validated the proposed methodology with two case studies, simplified apoptosis and lipopolysaccharide-induced NF&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B signaling pathways, to develop hybrid models with &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; measurements, respectively.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LSg85YWiQBo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cerebellar stellate cells (CSCs) are spontaneously active, tonically firing (5-30 Hz), inhibitory interneurons that synapse onto Purkinje cells. We previously analyzed the excitability properties of CSCs, focusing on four key features: type I excitability, non-monotonic first-spike latency, switching in responsiveness and runup (i.e., temporal increase in excitability during whole-cell configuration). In this study, we extend this analysis by using whole-cell configuration to show that these neurons can also burst when treated with certain pharmacological agents separately or jointly. Indeed, treatment with (4-Aminopyridine) 4-AP, a partial blocker of delayed rectifier and A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, at low doses induces a bursting profile in CSCs significantly different than that produced at high doses or when it is applied at low doses but with cadmium (Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), a blocker of high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. By expanding a previously revised Hodgkin–Huxley type model, through the inclusion of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (K(Ca)) and HVA currents, we explain how these bursts are generated and what their underlying dynamics are. Specifically, we demonstrate that the expanded model preserves the four excitability features of CSCs, as well as captures their bursting patterns induced by 4-AP and Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Model investigation reveals that 4-AP is potentiating HVA, inducing square-wave bursting at low doses and pseudo-plateau bursting at high doses, whereas Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is potentiating K(Ca), inducing pseudo-plateau bursting when applied in combination with low doses of 4-AP. Using bifurcation analysis, we show that spike adding in square-wave bursts is non-sequential when gradually changing HVA and K(Ca) maximum conductances, delayed Hopf is responsible for generating the plateau segment within the active phase of pseudo-plateau bursts, and bursting can become “chaotic” when HVA and K(Ca) maximum conductances are made low and high, respectively. These results highlight the secondary effects of the drugs applied and suggest that CSCs have all the ingredients needed for bursting.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CLQwzt8tGoo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Because a cell must adapt to different stresses and growth rates, its proteostasis system must too. How do cells detect and adjust proteome folding to different conditions? Here, we explore a biophysical cost-benefit principle, namely that the cell should keep its proteome as folded as possible at the minimum possible energy cost. This can be achieved by differential expression of chaperones–balancing foldases (which accelerate folding) against holdases (which act as parking spots). The model captures changes in the foldase-holdase ratio observed both &lt;i&gt;within&lt;/i&gt; organisms during aging and &lt;i&gt;across&lt;/i&gt; organisms of varying metabolic rates. This work describes a simple biophysical mechanism by which cellular proteostasis adapts to meet the needs of a changing growth environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YsEbOvP-pBk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A major challenge in evolutionary developmental biology is to understand how genetic mutations underlie phenotypic changes. In principle, selective pressures on the phenotype screen the gene pool of the population. Teeth are an excellent model for understanding evolutionary changes in the genotype-phenotype relationship since they exist throughout vertebrates. Genetically modified mice (mutants) with abnormalities in teeth have been used to explore tooth development. The relationship between signaling pathways and molar shape, however, remains elusive due to the high intrinsic complexity of tooth crowns. This hampers our understanding of the extent to which developmental factors explored in mutants explain developmental and phenotypic variation in natural species that represent the consequence of natural selection. Here we combine a novel morphometric method with two kinds of data mining techniques to extract data sets from the three-dimensional surface models of lower first molars: i) machine learning to maximize classification accuracy of 22 mutants, and ii) phylogenetic signal for 31 Murinae species. Major shape variation among mutants is explained by the number of cusps and cusp distribution on a tooth crown. The distribution of mutant mice in morphospace suggests a nonlinear relationship between the signaling pathways and molar shape variation. Comparative analysis of mutants and wild murines reveals that mutant variation overlaps naturally occurring diversity, including more ancestral and derived morphologies. However, taxa with transverse lophs are not fully covered by mutant variation, suggesting experimentally unexplored developmental factors in the evolutionary radiation of Murines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xZ_oJdNW5R8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Understanding the decision process underlying gaze control is an important question in cognitive neuroscience with applications in diverse fields ranging from psychology to computer vision. The decision for choosing an upcoming saccade target can be framed as a selection process between two states: Should the observer further inspect the information near the current gaze position (local attention) or continue with exploration of other patches of the given scene (global attention)? Here we propose and investigate a mathematical model motivated by switching between these two attentional states during scene viewing. The model is derived from a minimal set of assumptions that generates realistic eye movement behavior. We implemented a Bayesian approach for model parameter inference based on the model’s likelihood function. In order to simplify the inference, we applied data augmentation methods that allowed the use of conjugate priors and the construction of an efficient Gibbs sampler. This approach turned out to be numerically efficient and permitted fitting interindividual differences in saccade statistics. Thus, the main contribution of our modeling approach is two–fold; first, we propose a new model for saccade generation in scene viewing. Second, we demonstrate the use of novel methods from Bayesian inference in the field of scan path modeling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qT5yjNvZW90&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Changes to the structure of nodes of Ranvier in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) of multiple sclerosis (MS) brains are associated with chronic inflammation. We show that the paranodal domains in MS NAWM are longer on average than control, with Kv1.2 channels dislocated into the paranode. These pathological features are reproduced in a model of chronic meningeal inflammation generated by the injection of lentiviral vectors for the lymphotoxin-α (LTα) and interferon-γ (IFNγ) genes. We show that tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IFNγ, and glutamate can provoke paranodal elongation in cerebellar slice cultures, which could be reversed by an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker. When these changes were inserted into a computational model to simulate axonal conduction, a rapid decrease in velocity was observed, reaching conduction failure in small diameter axons. We suggest that glial cells activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines can produce high levels of glutamate, which triggers paranodal pathology, contributing to axonal damage and conduction deficits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/eGzFgAoriRc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Self-limiting stem-cell niche signaling through degradation of a stem-cell receptor</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sophia Ladyzhets, Matthew Antel, Taylor Simao, Nathan Gasek, Ann E. Cowan, Mayu Inaba&lt;/p&gt;

Stem-cell niche signaling is short-range in nature, such that only stem cells but not their differentiating progeny receive self-renewing signals. At the apical tip of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; testis, 8 to 10 germline stem cells (GSCs) surround the hub, a cluster of somatic cells that organize the stem-cell niche. We have previously shown that GSCs form microtubule-based nanotubes (MT-nanotubes) that project into the hub cells, serving as the platform for niche signal reception; this spatial arrangement ensures the reception of the niche signal specifically by stem cells but not by differentiating cells. The receptor Thickveins (Tkv) is expressed by GSCs and localizes to the surface of MT-nanotubes, where it receives the hub-derived ligand Decapentaplegic (Dpp). The fate of Tkv receptor after engaging in signaling on the MT-nanotubes has been unclear. Here we demonstrate that the Tkv receptor is internalized into hub cells from the MT-nanotube surface and subsequently degraded in the hub cell lysosomes. Perturbation of MT-nanotube formation and Tkv internalization from MT-nanotubes into hub cells both resulted in an overabundance of Tkv protein in GSCs and hyperactivation of a downstream signal, suggesting that the MT-nanotubes also serve a second purpose to dampen the niche signaling. Together, our results demonstrate that MT-nanotubes play dual roles to ensure the short-range nature of niche signaling by (1) providing an exclusive interface for the niche ligand-receptor interaction; and (2) limiting the amount of stem cell receptors available for niche signal reception.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vmjq1dCSnck&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: N‐cadherin localization in taste buds of mouse circumvallate papillae</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25090?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;N‐cadherin localization in taste buds of mouse circumvallate papillae&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5720faad-323d-416c-b3e8-7f61dc692e16/cne25090-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N‐cadherin is involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses. It was mainly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in taste buds. Immunoelectron microscopy detected N‐cadherin symmetrically in the membranes of contact sites between afferent fibers (N) and type II cells (II), including synapses. Arrowheads: atypical mitochondria.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taste buds, the receptor organs for taste, contain 50‐100 taste bud cells. Although these cells undergo continuous turnover, the structural and functional integrity of taste buds is maintained. The molecular mechanisms by which synaptic connectivity between taste buds and afferent fibers is formed and maintained remain ambiguous. In the present study, we examined the localization of N‐cadherin in the taste buds of the mouse circumvallate papillae because N‐cadherin, one of the classical cadherins, is important for the formation and maintenance of synapses. At the light microscopic level, N‐cadherin was predominantly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in the connective tissues in and around the vallate papillae. At the ultrastructural level, N‐cadherin immunoreactivity appears along the cell membrane and in the intracellular vesicles of type II cells. N‐cadherin immunoreactivity also is evident in the membranes of afferent terminals at the contact sites to N‐cadherin‐positive type II cells. At channel type synapses between type II cells and nerve fibers, N‐cadherin is present surrounding, but not within, the presumed neurotransmitter release zone, identified by large mitochondria apposed to the taste cells. The present results suggest that N‐cadherin is important for the formation or maintenance of type II cell afferent synapses in taste buds.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Age, sex, and regional differences in scavenger receptor CD36 in the mouse brain: Potential relevance to cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3b9eb5e5-bbe1-47aa-a7f0-3c4c5ac15261/cne25089-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scavenger receptor CD36 contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and amyloid deposition in the brain. Here, we characterized CD36 gene and protein expression in the brains of young and aged male and female C57BL/6J mice. We found age‐related increases in CD36 mRNA, and CD36 protein differed by region, age, and sex and was primarily expressed intravascularly. These variations may contribute to Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scavenger receptor CD36 contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and amyloid deposition, while CD36 deficiency is associated with restored cerebrovascular function in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. Yet the distribution of CD36 has not been examined in the brain. Here, we characterized CD36 gene and protein expression in the brains of young, middle aged, aged, and elderly male and female C57BL/6J mice. Age‐related increases in CD36 mRNA expression were observed in the male hippocampus and female midbrain. Additionally, male mice had greater CD36 mRNA expression than females in the striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain. CD36 protein was primarily expressed intravascularly, and this expression differed by region, age, and sex in the mouse brain. Although male mice brains demonstrated an increase in CD36 protein with age in several cortices, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and midbrain, a decrease with age was observed in female mice in the same regions. These data suggest that distinctive age, region, and sex expression of CD36 in the brain may contribute to Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation in AD.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Hippocampus: Exercise interventions preserve hippocampal volume: A meta‐analysis</title>

	<description>Abstract
Hippocampal volume is a marker of brain health and is reduced with aging and neurological disease. Exercise may be effective at increasing and preserving hippocampal volume, potentially serving as a treatment for conditions associated with hippocampal atrophy (e.g., dementia). This meta‐analysis aimed to identify whether exercise training has a positive effect on hippocampal volume and how population characteristics and exercise parameters moderate this effect. Studies met the following criteria: (a) controlled trials; (b) interventions of physical exercise; (c) included at least one time‐point of hippocampal volume data before the intervention and one after; (d) assessed hippocampal volume using either manual or automated segmentation algorithms. Animal studies, voxel‐based morphometry analyses, and multi‐modal interventions (e.g., cognitive training or meditation) were excluded. The primary analysis in n = 23 interventions from 22 published studies revealed a significant positive effect of exercise on total hippocampal volume. The overall effect was significant in older samples (65 years of age or older) and in interventions that lasted over 24 weeks and had less than 150 min per week of exercise. These findings suggest that moderate amounts of exercise for interventions greater than 6 months have a positive effect on hippocampal volume including in older populations vulnerable to hippocampal atrophy.</description>

	<title>Neuroinformatics: Improving Covariance Matrices Derived from Tiny Training Datasets for the Classification of Event-Related Potentials with Linear Discriminant Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Electroencephalogram data used in the domain of brain–computer interfaces typically has subpar signal-to-noise ratio and data acquisition is expensive. An effective and commonly used classifier to discriminate event-related potentials is the linear discriminant analysis which, however, requires an estimate of the feature distribution. While this information is provided by the feature covariance matrix its large number of free parameters calls for regularization approaches like Ledoit–Wolf shrinkage. Assuming that the noise of event-related potential recordings is not time-locked, we propose to decouple the time component from the covariance matrix of event-related potential data in order to further improve the estimates of the covariance matrix for linear discriminant analysis. We compare three regularized variants thereof and a feature representation based on Riemannian geometry against our proposed novel linear discriminant analysis with time-decoupled covariance estimates. Extensive evaluations on 14 electroencephalogram datasets reveal, that the novel approach increases the classification performance by up to four percentage points for small training datasets, and gracefully converges to the performance of standard shrinkage-regularized LDA for large training datasets. Given these results, practitioners in this field should consider using our proposed time-decoupled covariance estimation when they apply linear discriminant analysis to classify event-related potentials, especially when few training data points are available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Adaptation of reach action to a novel force-field is not predicted by acuity of dynamic proprioception in either older or younger adults</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Healthy ageing involves degeneration of the neuromuscular system which impacts movement control and proprioception. Yet the relationship between these sensory and motor deficits in upper limb reaching has not been examined in detail. Recently, we reported that age-related proprioceptive deficits were unrelated to accuracy in rapid arm movements, but whether this applied in motor tasks more heavily dependent on proprioceptive feedback was not clear. To address this, we have tested groups of younger and older adults on a force-field adaptation task under either full or limited visual feedback conditions and examined how performance was related to dynamic proprioceptive acuity. Adaptive performance was similar between the age groups, regardless of visual feedback condition, although older adults showed increased after-effects. Physically inactive individuals made larger systematic (but not variable) proprioceptive errors, irrespective of age. However, dynamic proprioceptive acuity was unrelated to adaptation and there was no consistent evidence of proprioceptive recalibration with adaptation to the force-field for any group. Finally, in spite of clear age-dependent loss of spatial working memory capacity, we found no relationship between memory capacity and adaptive performance or proprioceptive acuity. Thus, non-clinical levels of deficit in dynamic proprioception, due to age or physical inactivity, do not affect force-field adaptation, even under conditions of limited visual feedback that might require greater proprioceptive control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: The steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) reflects the activation of cortical object representations: evidence from semantic stimulus repetition</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We applied high-density EEG to examine steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) during a perceptual/semantic stimulus repetition design. SSVEPs are evoked oscillatory cortical responses at the same frequency as visual stimuli flickered at this frequency. In repetition designs, stimuli are presented twice with the repetition being task irrelevant. The cortical processing of the second stimulus is commonly characterized by decreased neuronal activity (repetition suppression). The behavioral consequences of stimulus repetition were examined in a companion reaction time pre-study using the same experimental design as the EEG study. During the first presentation of a stimulus, we confronted participants with drawings of familiar object images or object words, respectively. The second stimulus was either a repetition of the same object image (perceptual repetition; PR) or an image depicting the word presented during the first presentation (semantic repetition; SR)—all flickered at 15 Hz to elicit SSVEPs. The behavioral study revealed priming effects in both experimental conditions (PR and SR). In the EEG, PR was associated with repetition suppression of SSVEP amplitudes at left occipital and repetition enhancement at left temporal electrodes. In contrast, SR was associated with SSVEP suppression at left occipital and central electrodes originating in bilateral postcentral and occipital gyri, right middle frontal and right temporal gyrus. The conclusion of the presented study is twofold. First, SSVEP amplitudes do not only index perceptual aspects of incoming sensory information but also semantic aspects of cortical object representation. Second, our electrophysiological findings can be interpreted as neuronal underpinnings of perceptual and semantic priming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Acylated Ghrelin as a Multi-Targeted Therapy for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.614828</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Much thought has been given to the impact of Amyloid Beta, Tau and Alpha-Synuclein in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), yet the clinical failures of the recent decades indicate that there are further pathological mechanisms at work. Indeed, besides amyloids, AD and PD are characterized by the culminative interplay of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and hyperfission, defective autophagy and mitophagy, systemic inflammation, BBB and vascular damage, demyelination, cerebral insulin resistance, the loss of dopamine production in PD, impaired neurogenesis and, of course, widespread axonal, synaptic and neuronal degeneration that leads to cognitive and motor impediments. Interestingly, the acylated form of the hormone ghrelin has shown the potential to ameliorate the latter pathologic changes, although some studies indicate a few complications that need to be considered in the long-term administration of the hormone. As such, this review will illustrate the wide-ranging neuroprotective properties of acylated ghrelin and critically evaluate the hormone's therapeutic benefits for the treatment of AD and PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Progranulin Adsorbs to Polypropylene Tubes and Disrupts Functional Assays: Implications for Research, Biomarker Studies, and Therapeutics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Progranulin (PGRN) is a tightly regulated, secreted glycoprotein involved in a wide range of biological processes that is of tremendous interest to the scientific community due to its involvement in neoplastic, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, progranulin haploinsufficiency leads to frontotemporal dementia. While performing experiments with a HIS-tagged recombinant human (rh) PGRN protein, we observed a measurable depletion of protein from solution due to its adsorption onto polypropylene (PPE) microcentrifuge tubes. In this study, we have quantified the extent of rhPGRN adsorption to PPE tubes while varying experimental conditions, including incubation time and temperature. We found that ∼25–35% of rhPGRN becomes adsorbed to the surface of PPE tubes even after a short incubation period. We then directly showed the deleterious impact of PGRN adsorption in functional assays and have recommended alternative labware to minimize these effects. Although the risk of adsorption of some purified proteins and peptides to polymer plastics has been characterized previously, this is the first report of rhPGRN adsorption. Moreover, since PGRN is currently being studied and utilized in both basic science laboratories to perform in vitro studies and translational laboratories to survey PGRN as a quantitative dementia biomarker and potential replacement therapy, the reported observations here are broadly impactful and will likely significantly affect the design and interpretation of future experiments centered on progranulin biology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Cortical Thickness Estimation in Individuals With Cerebral Small Vessel Disease, Focal Atrophy, and Chronic Stroke Lesions</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Regional changes to cortical thickness in individuals with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) can be estimated using specialized neuroimaging software. However, the presence of cerebral small vessel disease, focal atrophy, and cortico-subcortical stroke lesions, pose significant challenges that increase the likelihood of misclassification errors and segmentation failures.&lt;/p&gt;Purpose&lt;p&gt;The main goal of this study was to examine a correction procedure developed for enhancing FreeSurfer’s (FS’s) cortical thickness estimation tool, particularly when applied to the most challenging MRI obtained from participants with chronic stroke and CVD, with varying degrees of neurovascular lesions and brain atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In 155 CVD participants enrolled in the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI), FS outputs were compared between a fully automated, unmodified procedure and a corrected procedure that accounted for potential sources of error due to atrophy and neurovascular lesions. Quality control (QC) measures were obtained from both procedures. Association between cortical thickness and global cognitive status as assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was also investigated from both procedures.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Corrected procedures increased “Acceptable” QC ratings from 18 to 76% for the cortical ribbon and from 38 to 92% for tissue segmentation. Corrected procedures reduced “Fail” ratings from 11 to 0% for the cortical ribbon and 62 to 8% for tissue segmentation. FS-based segmentation of T1-weighted white matter hypointensities were significantly greater in the corrected procedure (5.8 mL vs. 15.9 mL, p &amp;lt; 0.001). The unmodified procedure yielded no significant associations with global cognitive status, whereas the corrected procedure yielded positive associations between MoCA total score and clusters of cortical thickness in the left superior parietal (p = 0.018) and left insula (p = 0.04) regions. Further analyses with the corrected cortical thickness results and MoCA subscores showed a positive association between left superior parietal cortical thickness and Attention (p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that correction procedures which account for brain atrophy and neurovascular lesions can significantly improve FS’s segmentation results and reduce failure rates, thus maximizing power by preventing the loss of our important study participants. Future work will examine relationships between cortical thickness, cerebral small vessel disease, and cognitive dysfunction due to neurodegenerative disease in the ONDRI study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Mutual Information of Multiple Rhythms for EEG Signals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.574796</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.574796</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalograms (EEG) are one of the most commonly used measures to study brain functioning at a macroscopic level. The structure of the EEG time series is composed of many neural rhythms interacting at different spatiotemporal scales. This interaction is often named as cross frequency coupling, and consists of transient couplings between various parameters of different rhythms. This coupling has been hypothesized to be a basic mechanism involved in cognitive functions. There are several methods to measure cross frequency coupling between two rhythms but no single method has been selected as the gold standard. Current methods only serve to explore two rhythms at a time, are computationally demanding, and impose assumptions about the nature of the signal. Here we present a new approach based on Information Theory in which we can characterize the interaction of more than two rhythms in a given EEG time series. It estimates the mutual information of multiple rhythms (MIMR) extracted from the original signal. We tested this measure using simulated and real empirical data. We simulated signals composed of three frequencies and background noise. When the coupling between each frequency component was manipulated, we found a significant variation in the MIMR. In addition, we found that MIMR was sensitive to real EEG time series collected with open vs. closed eyes, and intra-cortical recordings from epileptic and non-epileptic signals registered at different regions of the brain. MIMR is presented as a tool to explore multiple rhythms, easy to compute and without a priori assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Olfactory Dysfunction Predicts Disease Progression in Parkinson’s Disease: A Longitudinal Study</title>

	<description>Background and Objective:&lt;p&gt;Olfactory dysfunction (hyposmia) is an important non-motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD). To investigate the potential prognostic value of hyposmia as a marker for disease progression, we prospectively assessed clinical manifestations and longitudinal changes of hyposmic PD patients and normosmic ones.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Olfactory function was evaluated with the Sniffin’ Sticks in PD patients at baseline. One hundred five hyposmic PD patients and 59 normosmic PD patients were enrolled and followed up for 2 years. They were subsequently evaluated at baseline and during follow-up periods with neurological and neuropsychological assessments. Clinical manifestations and disease progressions were compared between hyposmic and normosmic patients. In addition, the relationship between disease progressions and olfactory function was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our study suggested that hyposmic PD patients and normosmic ones were similar in gender, age, education levels, age of onset, disease duration, and clinical features at baseline. Hyposmic PD patients exhibited more severe Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale Part II–III (UPDRS II-III) scores, higher levodopa equivalent dose (LED) needs, and poorer Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score at follow-up visits compared to those in normosmic PD patients. Hyposmia also showed greater rates in the increase of LED needs, improvement of UPDRS III score, and deterioration of MMSE score. Both improvement of UPDRS III score and decline of MMSE score were associated with poorer odor identification.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our prospective study demonstrated that hyposmic PD patients showed a relatively worse clinical course compared with normosmic patients. Olfactory dysfunction is a useful predictor of disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Whom to Believe? Understanding and Modeling Brain Activity in Source Credibility Evaluation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.607853</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how humans evaluate credibility is an important scientific question in the era of fake news. Source credibility is among the most important aspects of credibility evaluations. One of the most direct ways to understand source credibility is to use measurements of brain activity of humans performing credibility evaluations. Nevertheless, source credibility has never been investigated using such a method before. This article reports the results of an experiment during which we have measured brain activity during source credibility evaluation, using EEG. The experiment allowed for identification of brain areas that were active when a participant made positive or negative source credibility evaluations. Based on experimental data, we modeled and predicted human source credibility evaluations using EEG brain activity measurements with F1 score exceeding 0.7 (using 10-fold cross-validation).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effects of Stochastic Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation on Body Sway and Muscle Activity</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.591671</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether galvanic vestibular stimulation with stochastic noise (nGVS) modulates the body sway and muscle activity of the lower limbs, depending on visual and somatosensory information from the foot using rubber-foam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Seventeen healthy young adults participated in the study. Each subject maintained an upright standing position on a force plate with/without rubber-foam, with their eyes open/closed, to measure the position of their foot center of pressure. Thirty minutes after baseline measurements under four possible conditions (eyes open/closed with/without rubber-foam) performed without nGVS (intensity: 1 mA, duration: 40 s), the stimulation trials (sham-nGVS/real-nGVS) were conducted under the same conditions in random order, which were then repeated a week or more later. The total center of pressure (COP) path length movement (COP-TL) and COP movement velocity in the mediolateral (Vel-ML) and anteroposterior (Vel-AP) directions were recorded for 30 s during nGVS. Furthermore, electromyography activity of the right tibial anterior muscle and soleus muscle was recorded for the same time and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Three-way analysis of variance and post-hoc multiple comparison revealed a significant increment in COP-related parameters by nGVS, and a significant increment in soleus muscle activity on rubber. There was no significant effect of eye condition on any parameter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: During nGVS (1 mA), body sway and muscle activity in the lower limb may be increased depending not on the visual condition, but on the foot somatosensory condition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A significant challenge in Glioblastoma (GBM) management is identifying pseudo-progression (PsP), a benign radiation-induced effect, from tumor recurrence, on routine imaging following conventional treatment. Previous studies have linked tumor lobar presence and laterality to GBM outcomes, suggesting that disease etiology and progression in GBM may be impacted by tumor location. Hence, in this feasibility study, we seek to investigate the following question: Can tumor location on treatment-naïve MRI provide early cues regarding likelihood of a patient developing pseudo-progression vs. tumor recurrence? In this study, 74 pre-treatment Glioblastoma MRI scans with PsP (33) and tumor recurrence (41) were analyzed. First, enhancing lesion on Gd-T&lt;sub&gt;1w&lt;/sub&gt; MRI and peri-lesional hyperintensities on T&lt;sub&gt;2w&lt;/sub&gt;/FLAIR were segmented by experts and then registered to a brain atlas. Using patients from the two phenotypes, we construct two atlases by quantifying frequency of occurrence of enhancing lesion and peri-lesion hyperintensities, by averaging voxel intensities across the population. Analysis of differential involvement was then performed to compute voxel-wise significant differences (p-value &amp;lt; 0.05) across the atlases. Statistically significant clusters were finally mapped to a structural atlas to provide anatomic localization of their location. Our results demonstrate that patients with tumor recurrence showed prominence of their initial tumor in the parietal lobe, while patients with PsP showed a multi-focal distribution of the initial tumor in the frontal and temporal lobes, insula, and putamen. These preliminary results suggest that lateralization of pre-treatment lesions toward certain anatomical areas of the brain may allow to provide early cues regarding assessing likelihood of occurrence of pseudo-progression from tumor recurrence on MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Imaging Subthreshold Voltage Oscillation With Cellular Resolution in the Inferior Olive in vitro</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Voltage imaging with cellular resolution in mammalian brain slices is still a challenging task. Here, we describe and validate a method for delivery of the voltage-sensitive dye ANNINE-6plus (A6+) into tissue for voltage imaging that results in higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than conventional bath application methods. The not fully dissolved dye was injected into the inferior olive (IO) 0, 1, or 7 days prior to acute slice preparation using stereotactic surgery. We find that the voltage imaging improves after an extended incubation period in vivo in terms of labeled volume, homogeneous neuropil labeling with saliently labeled somata, and SNR. Preparing acute slices 7 days after the dye injection, the SNR is high enough to allow single-trial recording of IO subthreshold oscillations using wide-field (network-level) as well as high-magnification (single-cell level) voltage imaging with a CMOS camera. This method is easily adaptable to other brain regions where genetically-encoded voltage sensors are prohibitively difficult to use and where an ultrafast, pure electrochromic sensor, like A6+, is required. Due to the long-lasting staining demonstrated here, the method can be combined, for example, with deep-brain imaging using implantable GRIN lenses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Distinct Changes in Global Brain Synchronization in Early-Onset vs. Late-Onset Parkinson Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Early- and late-onset Parkinson’s disease (EOPD and LOPD, respectively) have different risk factors, clinical features, and disease course; however, the functional outcome of these differences have not been well characterized. This study investigated differences in global brain synchronization changes and their clinical significance in EOPD and LOPD patients. Patients with idiopathic PD including 25 EOPD and 24 LOPD patients, and age- and sex-matched healthy control (HC) subjects including 27 younger and 26 older controls (YCs and OCs, respectively) were enrolled. Voxel-based degree centrality (DC) was calculated as a measure of global synchronization and compared between PD patients and HC groups matched in terms of disease onset and severity. DC was decreased in bilateral Rolandic operculum and left insula and increased in the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and precuneus of EOPD patients compared to YCs. DC was decreased in the right putamen, mid-cingulate cortex, bilateral Rolandic operculum, and left insula and increased in the right cerebellum-crus1 of LOPD patients compared to OCs. Correlation analyses showed that DC in the right cerebellum-crus1 was inversely associated with the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS) score in LOPD patients. Thus, EOPD and LOPD patients show distinct alterations in global synchronization relative to HCs. Furthermore, our results suggest that the left SFG and right cerebellum-crus1 play important roles in the compensation for corticostriatal–thalamocortical loop injury in EOPD and LOPD patients, whereas the cerebellum is a key hub in the neural mechanisms underlying LOPD with depression. These findings provide new insight into the clinical heterogeneity of the two PD subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is the leading cause of serious long-term disability, significantly reducing mobility in almost half of the affected patients aged 65 years and older. There are currently no proven neurorestorative treatments for chronic stroke. To address the complex problem of restoring function in ischemic brain tissue, stem cell transplantation-based therapies have emerged as potential restorative therapies. Aligning with the major cell types found within the ischemic brain, stem-cell-based clinical trials for ischemic stroke have fallen under three broad cell lineages: hematopoietic, mesenchymal, and neural. In this review article, we will discuss the scientific rationale for transplanting cells from each of these lineages and provide an overview of published and ongoing trials using this framework.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: The connectome of the adult Drosophila mushroom body provides insights into function</title>

	<description>Making inferences about the computations performed by neuronal circuits from synapse-level connectivity maps is an emerging opportunity in neuroscience. The mushroom body (MB) is well positioned for developing and testing such an approach due to its conserved neuronal architecture, recently completed dense connectome, and extensive prior experimental studies of its roles in learning, memory and activity regulation. Here we identify new components of the MB circuit in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, including extensive visual input and MB output neurons (MBONs) with direct connections to descending neurons. We find unexpected structure in sensory inputs, in the transfer of information about different sensory modalities to MBONs, and in the modulation of that transfer by dopaminergic neurons (DANs).  We provide insights into the circuitry used to integrate MB outputs, connectivity between the MB and the central complex and inputs to DANs, including feedback from MBONs. Our results provide a foundation for further theoretical and experimental work.</description>

	<title>eLife: A Drosophila screen identifies NKCC1 as a modifier of NGLY1 deficiency</title>

	<description>N-Glycanase 1 (NGLY1) is a cytoplasmic deglycosylating enzyme. Loss-of-function mutations in the &lt;i&gt;NGLY1&lt;/i&gt; gene cause NGLY1 deficiency, which is characterized by developmental delay, seizures, and a lack of sweat and tears. To model the phenotypic variability observed among patients, we crossed a &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; model of NGLY1 deficiency onto a panel of genetically diverse strains. The resulting progeny showed a phenotypic spectrum from 0-100% lethality. Association analysis on the lethality phenotype, as well as an evolutionary rate covariation analysis, generated lists of modifying genes, providing insight into NGLY1 function and disease. The top association hit was &lt;i&gt;Ncc69&lt;/i&gt; (human &lt;i&gt;NKCC1/2&lt;/i&gt;), a conserved ion transporter. Analyses in &lt;i&gt;NGLY1&lt;/i&gt; -/- mouse cells demonstrated that NKCC1 has an altered average molecular weight and reduced function. The misregulation of this ion transporter may explain the observed defects in secretory epithelium function in NGLY1 deficiency patients.</description>

	<title>eLife: Cardiac endothelial cells maintain open chromatin and expression of cardiomyocyte myofibrillar genes</title>

	<description>Endothelial cells (ECs) are widely heterogenous depending on tissue and vascular localization. Jambusaria et al. recently demonstrated that ECs in various tissues surprisingly possess mRNA signatures of their underlying parenchyma. The mechanism underlying this observation remains unexplained, and could include mRNA contamination during cell isolation, in vivo mRNA paracrine transfer from parenchymal cells to ECs, or cell-autonomous expression of these mRNAs in ECs. Here, we use a combination of bulk RNASeq, single cell RNASeq datasets, in situ mRNA hybridization, and most importantly ATAC-Seq of FACS-isolated nuclei, to show that cardiac endothelial cells actively express cardiomyocyte myofibril (CMF) genes and have open chromatin at CMF gene promoters. These open chromatin sites are enriched for sites targeted by cardiac transcription factors, and close upon expansion of ECs in culture&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;Together, these data demonstrate unambiguously that the expression of CMF genes in ECs is cell-autonomous, and not simply a result of technical contamination or paracrine transfers of mRNAs, and indicate that local cues in the heart &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; unexpectedly maintain fully open chromatin in ECs at genes previously thought limited to cardiomyocytes.</description>

	<description>Abstract
The pervasive use of opioid compounds for pain relief is rooted in their utility as one of the most effective therapeutic strategies for providing analgesia. While the detrimental side effects of these compounds have significantly contributed to the current opioid epidemic, opioids still provide millions of patients with reprieve from the relentless and agonizing experience of pain. The human experience of pain has long recognized the perceived unpleasantness entangled with a unique sensation that is immediate and identifiable from the first‐person subjective vantage point as “painful.” From this phenomenological perspective, how is it that opioids interfere with pain perception? Evidence from human lesion, neuroimaging, and preclinical functional neuroanatomy approaches is sculpting the view that opioids predominately alleviate the affective or inferential appraisal of nociceptive neural information. Thus, opioids weaken pain‐associated unpleasantness rather than modulate perceived sensory qualities. Here, we discuss the historical theories of pain to demonstrate how modern neuroscience is revisiting these ideas to deconstruct the brain mechanisms driving the emergence of aversive pain perceptions. We further detail how targeting opioidergic signaling within affective or emotional brain circuits remains a strong avenue for developing targeted pharmacological and gene‐therapy analgesic treatments that might reduce the dependence on current clinical opioid options.</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemical synapse is the principal form of contact between neurons of the central nervous system. These synapses are typically configured as presynaptic axon terminations onto postsynaptic dendrites or somata, giving rise to axo‐dendritic and axo‐somatic synapses, respectively. Beyond these common synapse configurations are less‐studied, non‐canonical synapse types that are prevalent throughout the brain and significantly contribute to neural circuit function. Among these are the axo‐axonic synapses, which consist of an axon terminating on another axon or axon terminal. Here, we review evidence for axo‐axonic synapse contributions to neural signaling in the mammalian nervous system and survey functional neural circuit motifs enabled by these synapses. We also detail how recent advances in microscopy, transgenics, and biological sensors may be used to identify and functionally assay axo‐axonic synapses.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Objective
To investigate the significance of circulating miRNAs in the pathogenesis of RCVS.


Methods
We prospectively recruited three independent cohorts of patients with RCVS and age‐ and sex‐matched controls in a single medical center. Next‐generation small RNA sequencing followed by quantitative PCR was used to identify and validate differentially expressed miRNAs, which was cross‐validated in migraine patients in ictal stage or interictal stage. Computational analysis was used to predict the target genes of miRNAs, followed by in vitro functional analysis.


Results
We identified a panel of miRNAs including miR‐130a‐3p, miR‐130b‐3p, let‐7a‐5p, let‐7b‐5p and let‐7f‐5p that well differentiated RCVS patients from controls (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.906, 0.890 and 0.867 in the three cohorts, respectively). The abundance of let‐7a‐5p, let‐7b‐5p and let‐7f‐5p, but not miR‐130a‐3p nor miR‐130b‐3p, was significantly higher in ictal migraine patients compared to that of controls and interictal migraine patients. Target prediction and pathway enrichment analysis suggested that suggested that the transforming growth factor‐β signaling pathway and endothelin‐1 responsible for vasomotor control might link these miRNAs to RCVS pathogenesis, which was confirmed in vitro by transfecting miRNAs mimics or incubating the patients' CSF in three different vascular endothelial cells. Moreover, miR‐130a‐3p was associated with imaging‐proven disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) in RCVS patients and its overexpression led to reduced transendothelial electrical resistance (i.e. increased permeability) in in vitro human BBB model.


Interpretation
We identified the circulating miRNA signatures associated with RCVS, which may be functionally linked to its headache, BBB integrity and vasomotor function.

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The mouse dorsal raphe nucleus as understood by temporal Fgf8 lineage analysis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ca88c5ae-8f31-4c6a-8f07-2c5b84061585/cne25071-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin neurons (dots) depicted in sagittal section (left) and coronal section (right), color‐coded by &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt;‐lineage captured at different time‐points in development. The arrows indicate the approximate level of the coronal section. Serotonin neurons arising from progenitors expressing &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; at later ages in development progressively populate more rostral and dorsal locations in the dorsal raphe, with serotonin neurons arising from the latest &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; expressers also located in the lateral wings.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; is expressed transiently during embryogenesis at the midbrain–hindbrain border, an area that gives rise to a variety of neuronal populations including the dorsal raphe (DR) nucleus. Using an inducible &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt;‐cre allele, we identified the populations of neurons defined by &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; lineage at different stages of development. When &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt;‐cre expression is induced at embryonic day 7.5 (T‐E7.5), in the adult the entire DR and part of the median raphe (MnR) have &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; lineage. When induced at later timepoints, &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; lineage progressively ebbs from the caudal and ventral aspect of this domain, particularly on the midline. Successively excluded from &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt;‐ lineage at T‐E9.5 are serotonin neurons in the MnR and caudal‐intrafascicular DR, followed at T‐E11.5 by ventral‐middle and caudal‐dorsal DR. The last to show &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; lineage are those serotonin neurons in the lateral wings and those at the rostral‐dorsal pole of DR nucleus. Thus, the temporal succession of &lt;i&gt;Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; lineage correlates with organizational features of serotonin neurons in these nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Maximal aerobic capacity is associated with hippocampal cognitive reserve in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment</title>

	<description>Abstract
Maximal aerobic capacity (MAC) has been associated with preserved neural tissue or brain maintenance (BM) in healthy older adults, including the hippocampus. Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is considered a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease. While aMCI is characterized by hippocampal deterioration, the MAC‐hippocampal relationship in these patients is not well understood. In contrast to healthy individuals, neurocognitive protective effects in neurodegenerative populations have been associated with mechanisms of cognitive reserve (CR) altering the neuropathology‐cognition relationship. We investigated the MAC‐hippocampal relationship in aMCI (n = 29) from the perspectives of BM and CR mechanistic models with structural MRI and a memory fMRI paradigm using both group‐level (higher‐fit patients vs. lower‐fit patients) and individual level (continuous correlation) approaches. While MAC was associated with smaller hippocampal volume, contradicting the BM model, higher‐fit patients demonstrated statistically significant lower correlation between hippocampal volume and memory performance compared with the lower‐fit patients, supporting the model of CR. In addition, while there was no difference in brain activity between the groups during low cognitive demand (encoding of familiar stimuli), higher MAC level was associated with increased cortical and sub‐cortical activation during increased cognitive demand (encoding of novel stimuli) and also with bilateral hippocampal activity even when controlling for hippocampal volume, suggesting for an independent effect of MAC. Our results suggest that MAC may be associated with hippocampal‐related cognitive reserve in aMCI through altering the relationship between hippocampal‐related structural deterioration and cognitive function. In addition, MAC was found to be associated with increased capacity to recruit neural resources during increased cognitive demands.</description>

We introduce a novel methodology for describing animal behavior as a tradeoff between value and complexity, using the Morris Water Maze navigation task as a concrete example. We develop a dynamical system model of the Water Maze navigation task, solve its optimal control under varying complexity constraints, and analyze the learning process in terms of the value and complexity of swimming trajectories. The value of a trajectory is related to its energetic cost and is correlated with swimming time. Complexity is a novel learning metric which measures how unlikely is a trajectory to be generated by a naive animal. Our model is analytically tractable, provides good fit to observed behavior and reveals that the learning process is characterized by early value optimization followed by complexity reduction. Furthermore, complexity sensitively characterizes behavioral differences between mouse strains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O8fjAExQPyM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Despite recent progress in recognizing the importance of mesenchymal cells for the homeostasis of the intestinal system, the current picture of how these cells communicate with the associated epithelial layer remains unclear. To describe the relevant cell populations in an unbiased manner, we carried out a single-cell transcriptome analysis of the adult murine colon, producing a high-quality atlas of matched colonic epithelium and mesenchyme. We identify two crypt-associated colonic fibroblast populations that are demarcated by different strengths of platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (Pdgfra) expression. Crypt-bottom fibroblasts (CBFs), close to the intestinal stem cells, express low levels of Pdgfra and secrete canonical Wnt ligands, Wnt potentiators, and bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) inhibitors. Crypt-top fibroblasts (CTFs) exhibit high Pdgfra levels and secrete noncanonical Wnts and Bmp ligands. While the Pdgfra&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt; cells maintain intestinal stem cell proliferation, the Pdgfra&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; cells induce differentiation of the epithelial cells. Our findings enhance our understanding of the crosstalk between various colonic epithelial cells and their associated mesenchymal signaling hubs along the crypt axis—placing differential Pdgfra expression levels in the spotlight of intestinal fibroblast identity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/WsYKdDQ2BGc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and critical regulator of cell cycle progression. Despite its vital role, it has remained challenging to globally map APC/C substrates. By combining orthogonal features of known substrates, we predicted APC/C substrates in silico. This analysis identified many known substrates and suggested numerous candidates. Unexpectedly, chromatin regulatory proteins are enriched among putative substrates, and we show experimentally that several chromatin proteins bind APC/C, oscillate during the cell cycle, and are degraded following APC/C activation, consistent with being direct APC/C substrates. Additional analysis revealed detailed mechanisms of ubiquitylation for UHRF1, a key chromatin regulator involved in histone ubiquitylation and DNA methylation maintenance. Disrupting UHRF1 degradation at mitotic exit accelerates G1-phase cell cycle progression and perturbs global DNA methylation patterning in the genome. We conclude that APC/C coordinates crosstalk between cell cycle and chromatin regulatory proteins.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Statewide Emergency Medical Services Protocols for Status Epilepticus Management</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25989</guid>

	<description>Although seizures are common in prehospital settings, standardized emergency medical services (EMS) treatment algorithms do not exist nationally. We examined nationwide variability in status epilepticus treatment by analyzing 33 publicly‐available statewide EMS protocols. All adult protocols recommend intravenous benzodiazepines (midazolam, n=33; lorazepam, n=23; diazepam, n=24), 30 recommend intramuscular (midazolam, n=30; lorazepam, n=8; diazepam, n=3), and 27 recommend intranasal (midazolam, n=27; lorazepam, n=3), while pediatric protocols also frequently recommend rectal diazepam (n=14). Recommended dosages vary widely, and first‐ and second‐line agents are designated in only 18 and 2 states, respectively. Given this degree of variability, standardized national EMS guidelines are needed.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: The Inferior Colliculus in Alcoholism and Beyond</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.606345</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.606345</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Post-mortem neuropathological and in vivo neuroimaging methods have demonstrated the vulnerability of the inferior colliculus to the sequelae of thiamine deficiency as occurs in Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome (WKS). A rich literature in animal models ranging from mice to monkeys—including our neuroimaging studies in rats—has shown involvement of the inferior colliculi in the neural response to thiamine depletion, frequently accomplished with pyrithiamine, an inhibitor of thiamine metabolism. In uncomplicated alcoholism (i.e., absent diagnosable neurological concomitants), the literature citing involvement of the inferior colliculus is scarce, has nearly all been accomplished in preclinical models, and is predominately discussed in the context of ethanol withdrawal. Our recent work using novel, voxel-based analysis of structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has demonstrated significant, persistent shrinkage of the inferior colliculus using acute and chronic ethanol exposure paradigms in two strains of rats. We speculate that these consistent findings should be considered from the perspective of the inferior colliculi having a relatively high CNS metabolic rate. As such, they are especially vulnerable to hypoxic injury and may be provide a common anatomical link among a variety of disparate insults. An argument will be made that the inferior colliculi have functions, possibly related to auditory gating, necessary for awareness of the external environment. Multimodal imaging including diffusion methods to provide more accurate in vivo visualization and quantification of the inferior colliculi may clarify the roles of brain stem nuclei such as the inferior colliculi in alcoholism and other neuropathologies marked by altered metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Modulation of the Mechanisms Driving Transthyretin Amyloidosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.592644</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.592644</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidoses are systemic diseases associated with TTR aggregation and extracellular deposition in tissues as amyloid. The most frequent and severe forms of the disease are hereditary and associated with amino acid substitutions in the protein due to single point mutations in the TTR gene (ATTRv amyloidosis). However, the wild type TTR (TTR wt) has an intrinsic amyloidogenic potential that, in particular altered physiologic conditions and aging, leads to TTR aggregation in people over 80 years old being responsible for the non-hereditary ATTRwt amyloidosis. In normal physiologic conditions TTR wt occurs as a tetramer of identical subunits forming a central hydrophobic channel where small molecules can bind as is the case of the natural ligand thyroxine (T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). However, the TTR amyloidogenic variants present decreased stability, and in particular conditions, dissociate into partially misfolded monomers that aggregate and polymerize as amyloid fibrils. Therefore, therapeutic strategies for these amyloidoses may target different steps in the disease process such as decrease of variant TTR (TTRv) in plasma, stabilization of TTR, inhibition of TTR aggregation and polymerization or disruption of the preformed fibrils. While strategies aiming decrease of the mutated TTR involve mainly genetic approaches, either by liver transplant or the more recent technologies using specific oligonucleotides or silencing RNA, the other steps of the amyloidogenic cascade might be impaired by pharmacologic compounds, namely, TTR stabilizers, inhibitors of aggregation and amyloid disruptors. Modulation of different steps involved in the mechanism of ATTR amyloidosis and compounds proposed as pharmacologic agents to treat TTR amyloidosis will be reviewed and discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Parallel Spatial–Temporal Self-Attention CNN-Based Motor Imagery Classification for BCI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.587520</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.587520</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motor imagery (MI) electroencephalography (EEG) classification is an important part of the brain-computer interface (BCI), allowing people with mobility problems to communicate with the outside world via assistive devices. However, EEG decoding is a challenging task because of its complexity, dynamic nature, and low signal-to-noise ratio. Designing an end-to-end framework that fully extracts the high-level features of EEG signals remains a challenge. In this study, we present a parallel spatial–temporal self-attention-based convolutional neural network for four-class MI EEG signal classification. This study is the first to define a new spatial-temporal representation of raw EEG signals that uses the self-attention mechanism to extract distinguishable spatial–temporal features. Specifically, we use the spatial self-attention module to capture the spatial dependencies between the channels of MI EEG signals. This module updates each channel by aggregating features over all channels with a weighted summation, thus improving the classification accuracy and eliminating the artifacts caused by manual channel selection. Furthermore, the temporal self-attention module encodes the global temporal information into features for each sampling time step, so that the high-level temporal features of the MI EEG signals can be extracted in the time domain. Quantitative analysis shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for intra-subject and inter-subject classification, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. In terms of qualitative analysis, we perform a visual inspection of the new spatial–temporal representation estimated from the learned architecture. Finally, the proposed method is employed to realize control of drones based on EEG signal, verifying its feasibility in real-time applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Changes in Electroencephalography and Cardiac Autonomic Function During Craft Activities: Experimental Evidence for the Effectiveness of Occupational Therapy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.621826</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.621826</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Occupational therapy often uses craft activities as therapeutic tools, but their therapeutic effectiveness has not yet been adequately demonstrated. The aim of this study was to examine changes in frontal midline theta rhythm (Fmθ) and autonomic nervous responses during craft activities, and to explore the physiological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effectiveness of occupational therapy. To achieve this, we employed a simple craft activity as a task to induce Fmθ and performed simultaneous EEG and ECG recordings. For participants in which Fmθ activities were provoked, parasympathetic and sympathetic activities were evaluated during the appearance of Fmθ and rest periods using the Lorenz plot analysis. Both parasympathetic and sympathetic indices increased with the appearance of Fmθ compared to during resting periods. This suggests that a relaxed-concentration state is achieved by concentrating on craft activities. Furthermore, the appearance of Fmθ positively correlated with parasympathetic activity, and theta band activity in the frontal area were associated with sympathetic activity. This suggests that there is a close relationship between cardiac autonomic function and Fmθ activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Abnormal Whole Brain Functional Connectivity Pattern Homogeneity and Couplings in Migraine Without Aura</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.619839</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.619839</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have reported abnormal amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation and regional homogeneity in patients with migraine without aura using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. However, how whole brain functional connectivity pattern homogeneity and its corresponding functional connectivity changes in patients with migraine without aura is unknown. In the current study, we employed a recently developed whole brain functional connectivity homogeneity (FcHo) method to identify the voxel-wise changes of functional connectivity patterns in 21 patients with migraine without aura and 21 gender and age matched healthy controls. Moreover, resting-state functional connectivity analysis was used to reveal the changes of corresponding functional connectivities. FcHo analyses identified significantly decreased FcHo values in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), thalamus (THA), and left anterior insula (AI) in patients with migraine without aura compared to healthy controls. Functional connectivity analyses further found decreased functional connectivities between PCC and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), between AI and anterior cingulate cortex, and between THA and left precentral gyrus (PCG). The functional connectivities between THA and PCG were negatively correlated with pain intensity. Our findings indicated that whole brain FcHo and connectivity abnormalities of these regions may be associated with functional impairments in pain processing in patients with migraine without aura.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Motor Function in Children 8–12 Years With Developmental Coordination Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.608131</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.608131</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background and objectives: Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is a neurodevelopmental motor disorder occurring in 5-6% of school-aged children. It is suggested that children with DCD show deficits in motor learning. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) enhances motor learning in adults and children but is unstudied in DCD. We aimed to investigate if tDCS, paired with motor skill training, facilitates motor learning in a pediatric sample with DCD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty-eight children with diagnosed DCD (22 males, mean age: 10.62 ± 1.44 years) were randomized and placed into a treatment or sham group. Anodal tDCS was applied (1 mA, 20 min) in conjunction with fine manual training over 5 consecutive days. Children's motor functioning was assessed with the Purdue Pegboard Test and Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test at baseline, post-intervention and 6 weeks following intervention. Group differences in rates of motor learning and skill transfer/retention were examined using linear mixed modeling and repeated measures ANOVAs, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: There were no serious adverse events or drop-outs and procedures were well-tolerated. Independent of group, all participants demonstrated improved motor scores over the 5 training days [F&lt;sub&gt;(69.280)&lt;/sub&gt;, p &amp;lt; 0.001, 95% CI (0.152, 0.376)], with no skill decay observed at retention. There was no interaction between intervention group and day [F&lt;sub&gt;(2.998)&lt;/sub&gt;, p = 0.086, 95% CI (−0.020, 0.297)].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Children with DCD demonstrate motor learning with long-term retention of acquired skill. Motor cortex tDCS did not enhance motor learning as seen in other populations. Before conclusions of tDCS efficacy can be drawn, additional carefully designed trials with reproducible results are required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03453983&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) results from an external force to the head or body causing neurophysiological changes within the brain. The number and severity of symptoms can vary, with some individuals experiencing rapid recovery, and others having persistent symptoms for months to years, impacting their quality of life. Current rehabilitation is limited in its ability to treat persistent symptoms and novel approaches are being sought to improve outcomes following mTBI. Neuromodulation is one technique used to encourage adaptive neuroplasticity within the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To systematically review the literature on the efficacy of neuromodulation in the mTBI population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: A systematic review was conducted using Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and EBM Review. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis reporting guidelines were used and a narrative review of the selected studies was completed. Fourteen articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria which were published in English, investigating an adult sample and using a pre- and post-intervention design. Studies were excluded if they included non-mild TBI severities, pediatric or older adult populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Thirteen of fourteen studies reported positive reductions in mTBI symptomatology following neuromodulation. Specifically, improvements were reported in post-concussion symptom ratings, headaches, dizziness, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, general disability, cognition, return to work and quality of life. Normalization of working memory activation patterns, vestibular field potentials, hemodynamics of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and excessive delta wave activity were also seen. The studies reviewed had several methodological limitations including small, heterogenous samples and varied intervention protocols, limiting generalisability. Further research is required to understand the context in which neuromodulation may be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: While these positive effects are observed, limitations included unequal representation of neuromodulation modalities in the literature, and lack of literature describing the efficacy of neuromodulation on the development or duration of persistent mTBI symptoms. Better clarity regarding neuromodulation efficacy could have a significant impact on mTBI patients, researchers, clinicians, and policy makers, facilitating a more productive post-mTBI population. Despite the limitations, the literature indicates that neuromodulation warrants further investigation. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020161279.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Using Posterior EEG Theta Band to Assess the Effects of Architectural Designs on Landmark Recognition in an Urban Setting</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The process of urban landmark-based navigation has proven to be difficult to study in a rigorous fashion, primarily due to confounding variables and the problem of obtaining reliable data in real-world contexts. The development of high-resolution, immersive virtual reality technologies has opened exciting new possibilities for gathering data on human wayfinding that could not otherwise be readily obtained. We developed a research platform using a virtual environment and electroencephalography (EEG) to better understand the neural processes associated with landmark usage and recognition during urban navigation tasks. By adjusting the architectural parameters of different buildings in this virtual environment, we isolated and tested specific design features to determine whether or not they served as a target for landmarking. EEG theta band (4–7 Hz) event-related synchronization/desynchronization over posterior scalp areas was evaluated at the time when participants observed each target building along a predetermined self-paced route. A multi-level linear model was used to investigate the effects of salient architectural features on posterior scalp areas. Our results support the conclusion that highly salient architectural features—those that contrast sharply with the surrounding environment—are more likely to attract visual attention, remain in short-term memory, and activate brain regions associated with wayfinding compared with non-salient buildings. After establishing this main aggregate effect, we evaluated specific salient architectural features and neural correlates of navigation processing. The buildings that most strongly associated extended gaze time, location recall accuracy, and changes in theta-band neural patterns with landmarking in our study were those that incorporated rotational twist designs and natural elements such as trees and gardens. Other building features, such as unusual façade patterns or building heights, were to a lesser extent also associated with landmarking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cognitive Outcomes for Essential Tremor Patients Selected for Thalamic Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery Through Interdisciplinary Evaluations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578348</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578348</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeted to the ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus is effective for motor symptoms in essential tremor (ET), but there is limited data on cognitive outcomes. We examined cognitive outcomes in a large cohort of ET DBS patients (pre-DBS and 1+ year after DBS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In a retrospective analysis, we used repeated-measures ANOVA testing to examine whether the age of tremor onset, age at DBS surgery, hemisphere side implanted with lead, unilateral vs. bilateral implantations, and presence of surgical complications influenced the cognitive outcomes. Neuropsychological outcomes of interest were verbal memory, executive functioning, working memory, language functioning, visuospatial functioning, and general cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We identified 50 ET DBS patients; 29 (58%) males; the mean age of tremor onset was 35.84 (±21.50) years with a median age of 38 years. The mean age at DBS was 68.18 (±10.07) years. There were 37 unilateral 30 left, seven right, and 13 bilateral brain implantations. In the subgroup analysis, there was a significant interaction between assessment (pre vs. post) and age of tremor onset (&amp;lt;38 vs. &amp;gt;38 years); F&lt;sub&gt;(1,30)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.47; p = 0.043 for working memory. The post hoc testing found improvements for younger onset ET. Similarly, there was a significant interaction between assessment (pre vs. post) and complications vs. no complications subgroups; F&lt;sub&gt;(1,45)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.34; p = 0.043 for verbal memory with worsening scores seen for ET patients with complications. The remaining tests were not significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In this large cohort of ET patients with (&amp;gt;30% improvements), DBS was not accompanied by a significant decline in many cognitive domains. These outcomes were possibly related to the selection of patients with normal cognitive functioning before surgery, unilateral DBS implantations for the majority, and selection of patients with optimal response to DBS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Olfactory Bulb Facilitates Use of Category Bounds for Classification of Odorants in Different Intensity Groups</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.613635</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.613635</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Signal processing of odor inputs to the olfactory bulb (OB) changes through top-down modulation whose shaping of neural rhythms in response to changes in stimulus intensity is not understood. Here we asked whether the representation of a high vs. low intensity odorant in the OB by oscillatory neural activity changed as the animal learned to discriminate odorant concentration ranges in a go-no go task. We trained mice to discriminate between high vs. low concentration odorants by learning to lick to the rewarded group (low or high). We recorded the local field potential (LFP) in the OB of these mice and calculated the theta-referenced beta or gamma oscillation power (theta phase-referenced power, or tPRP). We found that as the mouse learned to differentiate odorant concentrations, tPRP diverged between trials for the rewarded vs. the unrewarded concentration range. For the proficient animal, linear discriminant analysis was able to predict the rewarded odorant group and the performance of this classifier correlated with the percent correct behavior in the odor concentration discrimination task. Interestingly, the behavioral response and decoding accuracy were asymmetric as a function of concentration when the rewarded stimulus was shifted between the high and low odorant concentration ranges. A model for decision making motivated by the statistics of OB activity that uses a single threshold in a logarithmic concentration scale displays this asymmetry. Taken together with previous studies on the intensity criteria for decisions on odorant concentrations, our finding suggests that OB oscillatory events facilitate decision making to classify concentrations using a single intensity criterion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Olfactory Dysfunction and Its Association With Neuropathologic Proteins in Cerebrospinal Fluid From Patients With Parkinson Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.594324</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.594324</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background and Purpose: Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson disease (PD). However, the relationship between OD and neuropathologic proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from PD patients remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: 166 PD patients were included in the study. Overall olfactory function was assessed by summing up the scores of olfactory threshold, discrimination, and identification by a Sniffin' Sticks test, based on which, patients were divided into PD with OD (PD-OD) and PD with no OD (PD-NOD) groups. CSF samples were obtained from 76 PD patients. The levels of neuropathologic proteins, including α-Synuclein, Aβ1-42, total tau (T-tau), and multiple forms of phosphorylated tau (P-tau) in CSF were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: out of the 166 PD patients, 103 cases (62.0%) had OD. The scores of overall olfactory functions, and olfactory threshold, discrimination, and identification in the PD-OD group were all significantly lower than that in the PD-NOD group (P &amp;lt; 0.001). α-Synuclein level in CSF was significantly higher in the PD-OD group than the PD-NOD group (P &amp;lt; 0.05), and was significantly and negatively correlated with the scores of overall olfactory function, and olfactory discrimination and identification (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Aβ1-42 level in CSF was higher in the PD-OD group than the PD-NOD group, and was significantly and negatively correlated with the olfactory identification score (P &amp;lt; 0.05). T-tau level in CSF was significantly lower in the PD-OD group than the PD-NOD group (P &amp;lt; 0.05), and was significantly and positively correlated with the olfactory discrimination score (P &amp;lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in P-tau level in CSF between the PD-OD and PD-NOD groups and no correlation between OD score and P-tau level in CSF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: PD-OD includes the impairments of olfactory threshold, discrimination, and identification, and is associated with the significant elevation of α-Synuclein and the decrease of the T-tau level in CSF.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Abnormal Cingulum Bundle Induced by Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Diffusion Tensor Tractography Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.594198</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.594198</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: In Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), white matter (WM) pathology has been suggested to play an important role in the etiology of T2DM-related cognitive impairment. This study aims to investigate the integrity of the cingulum bundle (CB), a major WM tract, in T2DM patients using diffusion tensor tractography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty-seven T2DM patients and 34 age-, sex- and education matched healthy controls were included and underwent diffusion tensor imaging. Tractography of bilateral CB tracts was performed and diffusion measurements were compared between the two groups. Next, brain regions with significant group differences on fractional anisotropy (FA) values were set as the region of interest (ROI), and the CB fibers that passed through were identified. Diffusion measures were extracted from these fibers to investigate their correlations with the cognitive performances and endocrine parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: T2DM patients exhibited decreased FA in bilateral CB, increased mean diffusion (MD) in the right CB, and decreased length in the left CB. Through voxel-wise comparison, the most prominent FA difference was identified in the posterior segment of the CB and the reconstructed tract was part of the retrosplenial component. Importantly, the diffusion measurements of the tract were significantly correlated with the impaired performance in executive functioning and elevated insulin resistance (IR) in the T2DM group, instead of the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The diffusion measurements in bilateral CB were altered in T2DM patients, which might reflect important neuropathologic changes in the fibers. Our study adds to knowledge about how the cingulum changes structurally along its entire length in T2DM and highlights the relationship between WM and cognitive performance. Besides, IR might be an important risk factor that warrants further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.539933</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) has been reported to have beneficial effects in improving behavioral deficits, and rescuing dopaminergic neuron loss in rodent models of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, their pooled effects for dopaminergic neuron have yet to be described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To review the neuroprotective effect of naïve BMSCs in rodent models of PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched up to September 30, 2020. Inclusion criteria according to PICOS criteria were as follows: (1) population: rodents; (2) intervention: unmodified BMSCs; (3) comparison: not specified; (4) primary outcome: tyrosine hydroxylase level in the substantia nigra pars compacta and rotational behavior; secondary outcome: rotarod test, and limb function; (5) study: experimental studies. Multiple prespecified subgroup and meta-regression analysis were conducted. Following quality assessment, random effects models were used for this meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Twenty-seven animal studies were included. The median quality score was 4.7 (interquartile range, 2–8). Overall standardized mean difference between animals treated with naïve BMSCs and controls was 2.79 (95% confidence interval: 1.70, 3.87; P &amp;lt; 0.001) for densitometry of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive staining; −1.54 (95% confidence interval: −2.11, −0.98; P &amp;lt; 0.001) for rotational behavior. Significant heterogeneity among studies was observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Results of this meta-analysis suggest that naïve BMSCs therapy increased dopaminergic neurons and ameliorated behavioral deficits in rodent models of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

How epithelial cells coordinate their polarity to form functional tissues is an open question in cell biology. Here, we characterize a unique type of polarity found in liver tissue, nematic cell polarity, which is different from vectorial cell polarity in simple, sheet-like epithelia. We propose a conceptual and algorithmic framework to characterize complex patterns of polarity proteins on the surface of a cell in terms of a multipole expansion. To rigorously quantify previously observed tissue-level patterns of nematic cell polarity (Morales-Navarette et al., eLife 2019), we introduce the concept of co-orientational order parameters, which generalize the known biaxial order parameters of the theory of liquid crystals. Applying these concepts to three-dimensional reconstructions of single cells from high-resolution imaging data of mouse liver tissue, we show that the axes of nematic cell polarity of hepatocytes exhibit local coordination and are aligned with the biaxially anisotropic sinusoidal network for blood transport. Our study characterizes liver tissue as a biological example of a biaxial liquid crystal. The general methodology developed here could be applied to other tissues and in-vitro organoids.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RHFPfW8zYDs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Buttenschön, Leah Edelstein-Keshet&lt;/p&gt;

Mathematical and computational models can assist in gaining an understanding of cell behavior at many levels of organization. Here, we review models in the literature that focus on eukaryotic cell motility at 3 size scales: intracellular signaling that regulates cell shape and movement, single cell motility, and collective cell behavior from a few cells to tissues. We survey recent literature to summarize distinct computational methods (phase-field, polygonal, Cellular Potts, and spherical cells). We discuss models that bridge between levels of organization, and describe levels of detail, both biochemical and geometric, included in the models. We also highlight links between models and experiments. We find that models that span the 3 levels are still in the minority.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vMg-rmwyxmU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

De Salazar, Joel Hellewell, Sophie Meakin, James D. Munday, Nikos I. Bosse, Katharine Sherrat, Robin N. Thompson, Laura F. White, Jana S.

Estimation of the effective reproductive number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is important for detecting changes in disease transmission over time. During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, policy makers and public health officials are using &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; to assess the effectiveness of interventions and to inform policy. However, estimation of &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; from available data presents several challenges, with critical implications for the interpretation of the course of the pandemic. The purpose of this document is to summarize these challenges, illustrate them with examples from synthetic data, and, where possible, make recommendations. For near real-time estimation of &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, we recommend the approach of Cori and colleagues, which uses data from before time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; and empirical estimates of the distribution of time between infections. Methods that require data from after time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;, such as Wallinga and Teunis, are conceptually and methodologically less suited for near real-time estimation, but may be appropriate for retrospective analyses of how individuals infected at different time points contributed to the spread. We advise caution when using methods derived from the approach of Bettencourt and Ribeiro, as the resulting &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; estimates may be biased if the underlying structural assumptions are not met. Two key challenges common to all approaches are accurate specification of the generation interval and reconstruction of the time series of new infections from observations occurring long after the moment of transmission. Naive approaches for dealing with observation delays, such as subtracting delays sampled from a distribution, can introduce bias. We provide suggestions for how to mitigate this and other technical challenges and highlight open problems in &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; estimation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/93_GehRlOxE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Decoding the neural dynamics of free choice in humans</title>

How do we choose a particular action among equally valid alternatives? Nonhuman primate findings have shown that decision-making implicates modulations in unit firing rates and local field potentials (LFPs) across frontal and parietal cortices. Yet the electrophysiological brain mechanisms that underlie free choice in humans remain ill defined. Here, we address this question using rare intracerebral electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in surgical epilepsy patients performing a delayed oculomotor decision task. We find that the temporal dynamics of high-gamma (HG, 60–140 Hz) neural activity in distinct frontal and parietal brain areas robustly discriminate free choice from instructed saccade planning at the level of single trials. Classification analysis was applied to the LFP signals to isolate decision-related activity from sensory and motor planning processes. Compared with instructed saccades, free-choice trials exhibited delayed and longer-lasting HG activity during the delay period. The temporal dynamics of the decision-specific sustained HG activity indexed the unfolding of a deliberation process, rather than memory maintenance. Taken together, these findings provide the first direct electrophysiological evidence in humans for the role of sustained high-frequency neural activation in frontoparietal cortex in mediating the intrinsically driven process of freely choosing among competing behavioral alternatives.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/j3T-biMlRLI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Johnston's organ and its central projections in Cataglyphis desert ants&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/92b8c907-636a-41f7-90d6-e75ababc810d/cne25077-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnston's organ is a highly sensitive mechanoreceptive organ in insect antennae. For the first time, we examined the 3D‐structure of the Johnston's organ in &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt; desert ants together with its neuronal projections in the ant brain. The multisensory nature of the organ together with its targets in multimodal brain regions make the Johnston's organ an important component of the navigational toolkit in &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt; ants.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Johnston's organ (JO) in the insect antenna is a multisensory organ involved in several navigational tasks including wind‐compass orientation, flight control, graviception, and, possibly, magnetoreception. Here we investigate the three dimensional anatomy of the JO and its neuronal projections into the brain of the desert ant &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt;, a marvelous long‐distance navigator. The JO of &lt;i&gt;C. nodus&lt;/i&gt; workers consists of 40 scolopidia comprising three sensory neurons each. The numbers of scolopidia slightly vary between different sexes (female/male) and castes (worker/queen). Individual scolopidia attach to the intersegmental membrane between pedicel and flagellum of the antenna and line up in a ring‐like organization. Three JO nerves project along the two antennal nerve branches into the brain. Anterograde double staining of the antennal afferents revealed that JO receptor neurons project to several distinct neuropils in the central brain. The T5 tract projects into the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC), while the T6 tract bypasses the AMMC via the saddle and forms collaterals terminating in the posterior slope (PS) (T6I), the ventral complex (T6II), and the ventrolateral protocerebrum (T6III). Double labeling of JO and ocellar afferents revealed that input from the JO and visual information from the ocelli converge in tight apposition in the PS. The general JO anatomy and its central projection patterns resemble situations in honeybees and &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. The multisensory nature of the JO together with its projections to multisensory neuropils in the ant brain likely serves synchronization and calibration of different sensory modalities during the ontogeny of navigation in &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Increased brain plasmin levels following experimental ischemic stroke in male mice</title>

	<description>Following permanent right middle cerebral artery occlusion, we measured plasmin activity in mouse brain slices utilizing a novel direct method. Positive correlation between plasmin level and infarct volume was found and demonstrated by a representative tetrazolium chloride staining of slice no. 6. Scale bars: 1 mm.

Abstract
Many coagulation factor proteases are increased in the brain during ischemic stroke. One of these proteases is plasmin. In this study we established a novel method for direct quantitative measurement of plasmin activity in male mouse brain slices using a sensitive fluorescent substrate in the presence of specific protease inhibitors. In both the ischemic and contralateral hemispheres, plasmin activity increased 3, 6, and 24 hr following stroke in comparison to healthy mice (F(3, 72) = 39.5, p &amp;lt; 0.0001, repeated measures ANOVA) after the induction of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (PMCAo). Plasmin activity was higher in the ischemic hemisphere (F(1,36) = 9.1, p = 0.005) and there was a significant interaction between time and ischemic hemisphere (F(3,36) = 4.4, p = 0.009). Plasmin activity was correlated with infarct volume (R2 = 0.5289, p = 0.0009 by Spearman). The specificity of the assay was verified utilizing tissue‐type plasminogen activator (tPA)‐deficient mice which, as expected, had significantly lower levels of plasmin 24 hr following ischemia compared to wild‐type mice (ischemic (0.6 ± 0.23 and 1.94 ± 0.5, respectively), p = 0.049 and contralateral hemispheres (0.13 ± 0.14 and 0.75 ± 0.10, respectively), p = 0.018 by t test). There is a time‐dependent increase in plasmin levels and an association of higher levels of plasmin with larger infarct volumes in an experimental stroke model. This suggests caution in the use of recombinant tPA (rtPA) and that plasmin inhibition in the brain may be a therapeutic target in acute ischemic stroke.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Forebrain NgR1 Overexpression Impairs DA Release Suggesting Synergy of Local and Global Synaptic Plasticity Mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.545854</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Structural synaptic reorganizations needed to permanently embed novel memories in the brain involve complex plasticity-enhancing and plasticity-inhibiting systems. Increased neural activity is linked to rapid downregulation of Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1), needed to allow local structural synaptic plasticity. This local regulation of plasticity is thought to be moderated by global systems, such as the ascending cholinergic and monoaminergic systems, adding significance to locally increased neural activity. Here we address the reverse possibility that the global systems may also be influenced by the status of local plasticity. Using NgR1-overexpressing mice, with impaired plasticity and long-term memory, we measured the ability to release dopamine (DA), implicated in regulating plasticity and memory. In vivo chronoamperometric recording with high temporal and spatial resolution revealed severe impairment of potassium chloride (KCl)-induced increase of extracellular DA in the dorsal striatum of mice overexpressing NgR1 in forebrain neurons. A similar, but lesser, impairment of DA release was seen following amphetamine delivery. In contrast, potassium chloride-evoked DA release in NgR1 knockout (KO) mice led to increased levels of extracellular DA. That NgR1 can impair DA signaling, thereby further dampening synaptic plasticity, suggests a new role for NgR1 signaling, acting in synergy with DA signaling to control synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance Statement:The inverse correlation between local NgR1 levels and magnitude of KCl-inducible amounts of DA release in the striatum reinforces the rule of NgR1 as a regulator of structural synaptic plasticity and suggests synergy between local and global plasticity regulating systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The aim of the present review is to summarize the prevalence of abnormal levels of various metal micronutrients including copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), and selenium (Se) in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using hair, nail and serum samples. A correlation of selected abnormal metal ions with known neurodevelopmental processes using Gene Ontology (GO) term was also conducted. Data included in this review are derived from ASD clinical studies performed globally. Metal ion disparity data is also analyzed and discussed based on gender (Male/Female) to establish any gender dependent correlation. Finally, a rational perspective and possible path to better understand the role of metal micronutrients in ASD is suggested.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Qualitative and Quantitative Wall Enhancement Analyses in Unruptured Aneurysms Are Associated With an Increased Risk of Aneurysm Instability</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Intracranial aneurysm wall enhancement (AWE) is independently associated with unstable aneurysms. However, a quantitative analysis of wall enhancement is lacking. This study aims to investigate the relationship between qualitative and quantitative wall enhancement indices (WEIs), traditional risk factors for aneurysms, and clinical ELAPSS/PHASES scores in a large cohort of intracranial saccular aneurysms.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;In this cross-sectional study, a total of 174 patients (mean age 60.4 ± 9.5 years; 53% women) with 248 asymptomatic unruptured intracranial aneurysms underwent pre- and post-contrast black-blood magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The extent of AWE was defined as non-AWE (pattern 0), focal AWE (pattern 1), or circumferential AWE (pattern 2). WEI was calculated using wall signal intensities on pre- and post-contrast images. Predicted 3- and 5-year growth risk and 5-year rupture risk were obtained from ELAPSS and PHASES scores, respectively. Uni- and multivariate analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between AWE characteristics, risk-related factors, and aneurysm instability.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Aneurysm size [odds ratio (OR), 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2–1.4; P &amp;lt; 0.001], non-internal carotid artery/middle cerebral artery location (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0–3.6; P = 0.045), and irregular shape (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2–4.5; P = 0.009) were independently associated with AWE. For aneurysms with AWE, the estimated 3- and 5-year growth risk (25.3 ± 13.0% and 38.0 ± 17.4%) and the 5-year rupture risk (3.9 ± 5.2%) were 1.9–3.3 times higher than those for aneurysms without AWE (12.8 ± 9.1%, 20.3 ± 13.0%, and 1.2 ± 1.6%, respectively; all P &amp;lt; 0.001). Larger areas and higher WEIs of enhancement positively correlated with aneurysm size (r = 0.43 and 0.38, respectively), 3- and 5-year growth risk, and 5-year rupture risk (r = 0.49 and 0.40, r = 0.49 and 0.40, r = 0.36 and 0.24, respectively; all P &amp;lt; 0.001). In sum, a larger aneurysm size, non-internal carotid artery/middle cerebral artery location, and irregular shape were independently associated with AWE. Larger areas and higher WEIs were associated with an increased risk of aneurysm growth and rupture. These findings suggest that quantitative AWE metrics should be considered in future large-scale longitudinal studies to evaluate their value in aneurysm risk management.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve function is metabolically demanding and nerve energy failure has been implicated in the onset and development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and neuropathic pain conditions. Distal peripheral nerve oxygen supply relies on the distribution of red blood cells (RBCs) in just a few, nearby capillary-sized vessels and is therefore technically challenging to characterize. We developed an approach to characterize distal sural nerve hemodynamics in anesthetized, adult male mice using in vivo two-photon laser scanning microscopy. Our results show that RBC velocities in mouse sural nerve vessels are higher than those previously measured in mouse brain, and are sensitive to hindlimb temperatures. Nerve blood flow, measured as RBC flux, however, was similar to that of mouse brain and unaffected by local temperature. Power spectral density analysis of fluctuations in RBC velocities over short time intervals suggest that the technique is sufficiently sensitive and robust to detect subtle flow oscillations over time scales from 0.1 to tens of seconds. We conclude that in vivo two-photon laser scanning microscopy provides a suitable approach to study peripheral nerve hemodynamics in mice, and that local temperature control is important during such measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Antipsychotic Effects on Cortical Morphology in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.579139</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.579139</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Previous studies of atypical antipsychotic effects on cortical structures in schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) have findings that vary between the short and long term. In particular, there has not been a study exploring the effects of atypical antipsychotics on age-related cortical structural changes in SZ and BD. This study aimed to determine whether mid- to long-term atypical antipsychotic treatment (mean duration = 20 months) is associated with cortical structural changes and whether age-related cortical structural changes are affected by atypical antipsychotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Structural magnetic resonance imaging images were obtained from 445 participants consisting of 88 medicated patients (67 with SZ, 21 with BD), 84 unmedicated patients (50 with SZ, 34 with BD), and 273 healthy controls (HC). Surface-based analyses were employed to detect differences in thickness and area among the three groups. We examined the age-related effects of atypical antipsychotics after excluding the potential effects of illness duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Significant differences in cortical thickness were observed in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and insular areas and the isthmus of the cingulate gyrus. The medicated group showed greater cortical thinning in these regions than the unmediated group and HC; furthermore, there were age-related differences in the effects of atypical antipsychotics, and these effects did not relate to illness duration. Moreover, cortical thinning was significantly correlated with lower symptom scores and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) deficits in patients. After false discovery rate correction, cortical thinning in the right middle temporal gyrus in patients was significantly positively correlated with lower HAMD scores. The unmedicated group showed only greater frontotemporal thickness than the HC group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Mid- to long-term atypical antipsychotic use may adversely affect cortical thickness over the course of treatment and ageing and may also result in worsening cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Adaptive Memory: Independent Effects of Survival Processing and Reward Motivation on Memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.588100</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Humans preferentially remember information processed for their survival relevance, a memorial benefit known as the survival processing effect. Memory is also biased towards information associated with the prospect of reward. Given the adaptiveness of these effects, they may depend on similar mechanisms. We tested whether motivation drives both effects, with reward incentives that are known to boost extrinsic motivation and survival processing perhaps stimulating intrinsic motivation. Accordingly, we manipulated survival processing and reward incentive independently during an incidental-encoding task in which participants chose between pairs of words concerning their relevance for a scenario, and examined the effects on encoding event-related potentials (ERP) activity and later performance on a surprise recall test. We hypothesized that if survival processing fosters intrinsic motivation, it should reduce the beneficial effects of extrinsic motivation (reward incentive). In contrast to this prediction, we found that reward incentive and survival processing independently improved memory and that the P300, a measure of lower-level cognitive resource allocation, was increased by reward incentive independent of survival processing. Further, survival processing and reward incentive independently increased the frontal slow wave (FSW), a measure of higher-level elaboration. These findings suggest that while survival processing and reward incentive may both increase encoding elaboration, the memory-enhancing effect of survival processing does not depend on increased intrinsic motivation. Additionally, we replicated a recent finding whereby the survival processing effect generalizes to a choice-based encoding task and further showed that the beneficial effect of choice on memory likely does not interact with either survival processing or reward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Exploring the Neural Structures Underlying the Procedural Memory Network as Predictors of Language Ability in Children and Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.587019</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: There is significant overlap in the type of structural language impairments exhibited by children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This similarity suggests that the cognitive impairment(s) contributing to the structural language deficits in ASD and ADHD may be shared. Previous studies have speculated that procedural memory deficits may be the shared cognitive impairment. The procedural deficit hypothesis (PDH) argues that language deficits can be explained by differences in the neural structures underlying the procedural memory network. This hypothesis is based on the premise that the neural structures comprising the procedural network support language learning. In this study, we aimed to test the PDH in children with ASD, ADHD, and typical development (TD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One hundred and sixty-three participants (ages 10–21): 91 with ASD, 26 with ADHD, and 46 with TD, completed standardized measures of cognitive and language ability as well as structural magnetic resonance imaging. We compared the structural language abilities, the neural structures underlying the procedural memory network, and the relationship between structural language and neural structure across diagnostic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our analyses revealed that while the structural language abilities differed across ASD, ADHD, and TD groups, the thickness, area, and volume of the structures supporting the procedural memory network were not significantly different between diagnostic groups. Also, several neural structures were associated with structural language abilities across diagnostic groups. Only two of these structures, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the left superior parietal gyrus, are known to be linked to the procedural memory network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The inferior frontal gyrus and the left superior parietal gyrus, have well-established roles in language learning independent of their role as part of the procedural memory system. Other structures such as the caudate and cerebellum, with critical roles in the procedural memory network, were not associated with structural language abilities across diagnostic groups. It is unclear whether the procedural memory network plays a fundamental role in language learning in ASD, ADHD, and TD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Developmental Trends of Visual Processing of Letters and Objects Using Naming Speed Tasks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Studying the typical development of reading is key to understanding the precise deficits that underlie reading disabilities. An important correlate of efficient reading is the speed of naming arrays of simple stimuli such as letters and pictures. In this cross-sectional study, we examined developmental changes in visual processing that occurs during letter and object naming from childhood to early adulthood in terms of behavioral task efficiency, associated articulation and eye movement parameters, and the coordination between them, as measured by eye-voice span in both the spatial and temporal domains. We used naming speed (NS) tasks, in which participants were required to name sets of letters or simple objects as quickly and as accurately as possible. Single stimulus manipulations were made to these tasks to make the stimuli either more visually and/or phonologically similar to one another in order to examine how these manipulations affected task performance and the coordination between speech and eye movements. Across development there was an increased efficiency in speech and eye movement performance and their coordination in both the spatial and temporal domains. Furthermore, manipulations to the phonological and visual similarity of specific letter and object stimuli revealed that orthographic processing played a greater role than phonological processing in performance, with the contribution of phonological processing diminishing across development. This comprehensive typical developmental trajectory provides a benchmark for clinical populations to elucidate the nature of the cognitive dysfunction underlying reading difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Revisiting PNS Plasticity: How Uninjured Sensory Afferents Promote Neuropathic Pain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the widespread study of how injured nerves contribute to chronic pain, there are still major gaps in our understanding of pain mechanisms. This is particularly true of pain resulting from nerve injury, or neuropathic pain, wherein tactile or thermal stimuli cause painful responses that are particularly difficult to treat with existing therapies. Curiously, this stimulus-driven pain relies upon intact, uninjured sensory neurons that transmit the signals that are ultimately sensed as painful. Studies that interrogate uninjured neurons in search of cell-specific mechanisms have shown that nerve injury alters intact, uninjured neurons resulting in an activity that drives stimulus-evoked pain. This review of neuropathic pain mechanisms summarizes cell-type-specific pathology of uninjured sensory neurons and the sensory ganglia that house their cell bodies. Uninjured neurons have demonstrated a wide range of molecular and neurophysiologic changes, many of which are distinct from those detected in injured neurons. These intriguing findings include expression of pain-associated molecules, neurophysiological changes that underlie increased excitability, and evidence that intercellular signaling within sensory ganglia alters uninjured neurons. In addition to well-supported findings, this review also discusses potential mechanisms that remain poorly understood in the context of nerve injury. This review highlights key questions that will advance our understanding of the plasticity of sensory neuron subpopulations and clarify the role of uninjured neurons in developing anti-pain therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cornea is the most densely innervated and sensitive tissue in the body. The cornea is exclusively innervated by C- and A-delta fibers, including mechano-nociceptors that are triggered by noxious mechanical stimulation, polymodal nociceptors that are excited by mechanical, chemical, and thermal stimuli, and cold thermoreceptors that are activated by cooling. Noxious stimulations activate corneal nociceptors whose cell bodies are located in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) and project central axons to the trigeminal brainstem sensory complex. Ocular pain, in particular, that driven by corneal nerves, is considered to be a core symptom of inflammatory and traumatic disorders of the ocular surface. Ocular surface injury affecting corneal nerves and leading to inflammatory responses can occur under multiple pathological conditions, such as chemical burn, persistent dry eye, and corneal neuropathic pain as well as after some ophthalmological surgical interventions such as photorefractive surgery. This review depicts the morphological and functional changes of corneal nerve terminals following corneal damage and dry eye disease (DED), both ocular surface conditions leading to sensory abnormalities. In addition, the recent fundamental and clinical findings of the importance of peripheral and central neuroimmune interactions in the development of corneal hypersensitivity are discussed. Next, the cellular and molecular changes of corneal neurons in the TG and central structures that are driven by corneal nerve abnormalities are presented. A better understanding of the corneal nerve abnormalities as well as neuroimmune interactions may contribute to the identification of a novel therapeutic targets for alleviating corneal pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Synaptic Vesicles Dynamics in Neocortical Epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal hyperexcitability often results from an unbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, but the synaptic alterations leading to enhanced seizure propensity are only partly understood. Taking advantage of a mouse model of neocortical epilepsy, we used a combination of photoconversion and electron microscopy to assess changes in synaptic vesicles pools in vivo. Our analyses reveal that epileptic networks show an early onset lengthening of active zones at inhibitory synapses, together with a delayed spatial reorganization of recycled vesicles at excitatory synapses. Proteomics of synaptic content indicate that specific proteins were increased in epileptic mice. Altogether, our data reveal a complex landscape of nanoscale changes affecting the epileptic synaptic release machinery. In particular, our findings show that an altered positioning of release-competent vesicles represent a novel signature of epileptic networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Mesenchymal Stromal Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Reduce Neuroinflammation, Promote Neural Cell Proliferation and Improve Oligodendrocyte Maturation in Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.601176</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.601176</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Neonatal encephalopathy caused by hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is a major cause of childhood mortality and disability. Stem cell-based regenerative therapies seem promising to prevent long-term neurological deficits. Our previous work in neonatal HI revealed an unexpected interaction between mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and the brains' microenvironment leading to an altered therapeutic efficiency. MSCs are supposed to mediate most of their therapeutic effects in a paracrine mode via extracellular vesicles (EVs), which might be an alternative to cell therapy. In the present study, we investigated the impact of MSC-EVs on neonatal HI-induced brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Nine-day-old C57BL/6 mice were exposed to HI through ligation of the right common carotid artery followed by 1 h hypoxia (10% oxygen). MSC-EVs were injected intraperitoneally 1, 3, and 5 days after HI. One week after HI, brain injury was evaluated by regional neuropathological scoring, atrophy measurements and immunohistochemistry to assess effects on neuronal, oligodendrocyte and vessel densities, proliferation, oligodendrocyte maturation, myelination, astro-, and microglia activation. Immunohistochemistry analyses were complemented by mRNA expression analyses for a broad set of M1/M2- and A1/A2-associated molecules and neural growth factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: While total neuropathological scores and tissue atrophy were not changed, MSC-EVs significantly protected from HI-induced striatal tissue loss and decreased micro- and astroglia activation. MSC-EVs lead to a significant downregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFa, accompanied by a significant upregulation of the M2 marker YM-1 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGFb. MSC-EVs significantly decreased astrocytic expression of the A1 marker C3, concomitant with an increased expression of neural growth factors (i.e., BDNF, VEGF, and EGF). These alterations were associated with an increased neuronal and vessel density, coinciding with a significant increase of proliferating cells in the neurogenic sub-ventricular zone juxtaposed to the striatum. MSC-EV-mediated neuroprotection went along with a significant improvement of oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that MSC-EVs mediate anti-inflammatory effects, promote regenerative responses and improve key developmental processes in the injured neonatal brain. The present results suggest different cellular target mechanisms of MSC-EVs, preventing secondary HI-induced brain injury. MSC-EV treatment may be a promising alternative to risk-associated cell therapies in neonatal brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Comprehensive Profiling of Gene Expression in the Cerebral Cortex and Striatum of BTBRTF/ArtRbrc Mice Compared to C57BL/6J Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.595607</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mouse line BTBR T+ Iptr3&lt;sup&gt;tf&lt;/sup&gt;/J (hereafter referred as to BTBR/J) is a mouse strain that shows lower sociability compared to the C57BL/6J mouse strain (B6) and thus is often utilized as a model for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this study, we utilized another subline, BTBRTF/ArtRbrc (hereafter referred as to BTBR/R), and analyzed the associated brain transcriptome compared to B6 mice using microarray analysis, quantitative RT-PCR analysis, various bioinformatics analyses, and in situ hybridization. We focused on the cerebral cortex and the striatum, both of which are thought to be brain circuits associated with ASD symptoms. The transcriptome profiling identified 1,280 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 974 downregulated and 306 upregulated genes, including 498 non-coding RNAs [ncRNAs]) in BTBR/R mice compared to B6 mice. Among these DEGs, 53 genes were consistent with ASD-related genes already established. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis highlighted 78 annotations (GO terms) including DNA/chromatin regulation, transcriptional/translational regulation, intercellular signaling, metabolism, immune signaling, and neurotransmitter/synaptic transmission-related terms. RNA interaction analysis revealed novel RNA–RNA networks, including 227 ASD-related genes. Weighted correlation network analysis highlighted 10 enriched modules including DNA/chromatin regulation, neurotransmitter/synaptic transmission, and transcriptional/translational regulation. Finally, the behavioral analyses showed that, compared to B6 mice, BTBR/R mice have mild but significant deficits in social novelty recognition and repetitive behavior. In addition, the BTBR/R data were comprehensively compared with those reported in the previous studies of human subjects with ASD as well as ASD animal models, including BTBR/J mice. Our results allow us to propose potentially important genes, ncRNAs, and RNA interactions. Analysis of the altered brain transcriptome data of the BTBR/R and BTBR/J sublines can contribute to the understanding of the genetic underpinnings of autism susceptibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: TSPO Ligands PK11195 and Midazolam Reduce NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation and Proinflammatory Cytokine Release in BV-2 Cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.544431</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation related to microglial activation plays an important role in neurodegenerative diseases. Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a biomarker of reactive gliosis, its ligands can reduce neuroinflammation and can be used to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we explored whether TSPO ligands exert an anti-inflammatory effect by affecting the nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, thereby inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines in microglial cells. In the present study, BV-2 cells were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 6 h to induce an inflammatory response. We found that the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), NLRP3 inflammasome, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-18 (IL-18) were significantly increased. However, pretreatment with TSPO ligands inhibited BV-2 microglial and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and significantly reduced the levels of ROS, IL-1β, and IL-18. Furthermore, a combination of LPS and ATP was used to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Both pretreatment and post-treatment with TSPO ligand can downregulate the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β expression. Finally, we found that TSPO was involved in the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome with TSPO ligands treatment in TSPO knockdown BV2 cells. Collectively, these results indicate that TSPO ligands are promising targets to control microglial reactivity and neuroinflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Spatiotemporal Up-Regulation of Mu Opioid Receptor 1 in Striatum of Mouse Model of Huntington’s Disease Differentially Affecting Caudal and Striosomal Regions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.608060</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.608060</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The striatum of humans and other mammals is divided into macroscopic compartments made up of a labyrinthine striosome compartment embedded in a much larger surrounding matrix compartment. Anatomical and snRNA-Seq studies of the Huntington’s disease (HD) postmortem striatum suggest a preferential decline of some striosomal markers, and mRNAs studies of HD model mice concur. Here, by immunohistochemical methods, we examined the distribution of the canonical striosomal marker, mu-opioid receptor 1 (MOR1), in the striatum of the Q175 knock-in mouse model of HD in a postnatal time series extending from 3 to 19 months. We demonstrate that, contrary to the loss of many markers for striosomes, there is a pronounced up-regulation of MOR1 in these Q175 knock-in mice. We show that in heterozygous Q175 knock-in model mice [~192 cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats], this MOR1 up-regulation progressed with advancing age and disease progression, and was particularly remarkable at caudal levels of the striatum. Given the known importance of MOR1 in basal ganglia signaling, our findings, though in mice, should offer clues to the pathogenesis of psychiatric features, especially depression, reinforcement sensitivity, and involuntary movements in HD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mitochondrial Dynamics and Bioenergetic Alteration During Inflammatory Activation of Astrocytes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are essential cellular organelles that act as metabolic centers and signaling platforms and have been identified as an important subcellular target in a broad range of neuropathologies. Studies on the role of mitochondria in neurological disorders have primarily focused on neurons. However, dysfunctional mitochondria in glial cells, particularly astrocytes, have recently gained research attention due to their close involvement in neuroinflammation and metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, alterations in mitochondrial energy metabolism in astrocytes have been reported to modulate cellular morphology and activity and induce the release of diverse proinflammatory mediators. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics characterized by aberrant fission and fusion events in glial cells is closely associated with the inflammatory activation of glia. In this mini-review, we cover the recent advances in the molecular aspects of astrocytic mitochondrial dynamics and their metabolic changes under the pathological conditions of the central nervous system (CNS).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: AChRs Degeneration at NMJ in Aging-Associated Sarcopenia–A Systematic Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.597811</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.597811</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sarcopenia is an aging process with a decline of skeletal muscle mass and function, which is a challenging public health problem with reduced quality of life in patients. The endplate, the post-synaptic part of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), occupies 0.1% of the myofiber surface area only, but is composed of millions of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) that are efficient in binding to acetylcholine (ACh) and triggering skeletal muscle contraction. This systematic review aims to examine aging-associated alterations of post-synaptic AChRs, including morphology, function and related gene expression. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science with relevant keywords by two independent reviewers. Original pre-clinical and clinical studies regarding AChRs changes during aging with available full text and written in English were included. Information was extracted from the included studies for further review. In total, 30 articles were included. Various parameters assessing AChRs alterations by radioassay, immunofluorescence, electrophysiology and mechanical test were reported. Endplate fragmentation and denervation were common in old skeletal muscles during aging. To ensure efficient NMJ transmission and force generation, type I or IIb muscle fibers tended to have increased ACh quanta releasing after electrical stimulations, while type IIa muscle fibers tended to have stronger binding between ACh and AChRs, but the overall function of AChRs was reduced during aging. Alterations of AChRs area depended on muscle type, species and the progress of muscle atrophy and type I muscles fibers tended to demonstrate enlarging AChRs areas. Myogenic regulator factors (MRFs) can regulate the expression of AChRs subunits, while decreased MRF4 may lead to expression changes of AChRs subunits during aging. Sarcoglycan-α can delay low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) degradation. This protein was increased in old muscles but still cannot suppress the degradation of LRP4. Investigating the role of these AChRs-related genes in the process of aging may provide a potential target to treat sarcopenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Neural Correlates of Age-Related Changes in Precise Grip Force Regulation: A Combined EEG-fNIRS Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motor control is associated with suppression of oscillatory activity in alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (12–30 Hz) ranges and elevation of oxygenated hemoglobin levels in motor-cortical areas. Aging leads to changes in oscillatory and hemodynamic brain activity and impairments in motor control. However, the relationship between age-related changes in motor control and brain activity is not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate age-related and task-complexity-related changes in grip force control and the underlying oscillatory and hemodynamic activity. Sixteen younger [age (mean ± SD) = 25.4 ± 1.9, 20–30 years] and 16 older (age = 56.7 ± 4.7, 50–70 years) healthy men were asked to use a power grip to perform six trials each of easy and complex force tracking tasks (FTTs) with their right dominant hand in a randomized within-subject design. Grip force control was assessed using a sensor-based device. Brain activity in premotor and primary motor areas of both hemispheres was assessed by electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Older adults showed significantly higher inaccuracies and higher hemodynamic activity in both FTTs than did young adults. Correlations between grip force control owing to task complexity and beta activity were different in the contralateral premotor cortex (PMC) between younger and older adults. Collectively, these findings suggest that aging leads to impairment of grip force control and an increase in hemodynamic activity independent of task complexity. EEG beta oscillations may represent a task-specific neurophysiological marker for age-related decline in complex grip force control and its underlying compensation strategies. Further EEG-fNIRS studies are necessary to determine neurophysiological markers of dysfunctions underlying age-related motor disabilities for the improvement of individual diagnosis and therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The appearance and fast spreading of Covid-19 took the international community by surprise. Collaboration between researchers, public health workers, and politicians has been established to deal with the epidemic. One important contribution from researchers in epidemiology is the analysis of trends so that both the current state and short-term future trends can be carefully evaluated. Gompertz model has been shown to correctly describe the dynamics of cumulative confirmed cases, since it is characterized by a decrease in growth rate showing the effect of control measures. Thus, it provides a way to systematically quantify the Covid-19 spreading velocity and it allows short-term predictions and longer-term estimations. This model has been employed to fit the cumulative cases of Covid-19 from several European countries. Results show that there are systematic differences in spreading velocity among countries. The model predictions provide a reliable picture of the short-term evolution in countries that are in the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak, and may permit researchers to uncover some characteristics of the long-term evolution. These predictions can also be generalized to calculate short-term hospital and intensive care units (ICU) requirements.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/W4VECPIBSMw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Population variability in the generation and selection of T-cell repertoires</title>

The diversity of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires is achieved by a combination of two intrinsically stochastic steps: random receptor generation by VDJ recombination, and selection based on the recognition of random self-peptides presented on the major histocompatibility complex. These processes lead to a large receptor variability within and between individuals. However, the characterization of the variability is hampered by the limited size of the sampled repertoires. We introduce a new software tool SONIA to facilitate inference of individual-specific computational models for the generation and selection of the TCR beta chain (TRB) from sequenced repertoires of 651 individuals, separating and quantifying the variability of the two processes of generation and selection in the population. We find not only that most of the variability is driven by the VDJ generation process, but there is a large degree of consistency between individuals with the inter-individual variance of repertoires being about ∼2% of the intra-individual variance. Known viral-specific TCRs follow the same generation and selection statistics as all TCRs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/l6Fdi8OUDek&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: TNF-α signaling: TACE inhibition to put out the burning heart</title>

More than 20 years ago, Seta and colleagues hypothesized that cytokines, which are activated by myocardial injury, significantly drive heart failure progression and would therefore be effective targets to treat cardiac dysfunction. Unfortunately, several clinical trials inhibiting key cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 1 beta (Il-1β) turned out negative or even revealed adverse clinical effects. Providing a potential mechanistic explanation for the ineffectiveness of TNF-α blockade in heart failure, novel findings demonstrate that the membrane-bound precursor form of TNF-α, transmembrane TNF-α (tmTNF-α), mediates cardioprotective effects during pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling. This study suggests that preventing tmTNF-α cleavage by targeting the TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE) rather than inhibiting TNF-α signaling altogether might be a valuable therapeutic approach.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dx4zwMpIHfI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The carnivorous plant &lt;i&gt;Dionaea muscipula&lt;/i&gt; harbors multicellular trigger hairs designed to sense mechanical stimuli upon contact with animal prey. At the base of the trigger hair, mechanosensation is transduced into an all-or-nothing action potential (AP) that spreads all over the trap, ultimately leading to trap closure and prey capture. To reveal the molecular basis for the unique functional repertoire of this mechanoresponsive plant structure, we determined the transcriptome of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;muscipula&lt;/i&gt;’s trigger hair. Among the genes that were found to be highly specific to the trigger hair, the Shaker-type channel KDM1 was electrophysiologically characterized as a hyperpolarization- and acid-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-selective channel, thus allowing the reuptake of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions into the trigger hair’s sensory cells during the hyperpolarization phase of the AP. During trap development, the increased electrical excitability of the trigger hair is associated with the transcriptional induction of &lt;i&gt;KDM1&lt;/i&gt;. Conversely, when KDM1 is blocked by Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in adult traps, the initiation of APs in response to trigger hair deflection is reduced, and trap closure is suppressed. KDM1 thus plays a dominant role in K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis in the context of AP and turgor formation underlying the mechanosensation of trigger hair cells and thus &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;muscipula&lt;/i&gt;’s hapto-electric signaling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/XSaNFTC--Pc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Ensuring the quality and specificity of preregistrations</title>

Researchers face many, often seemingly arbitrary, choices in formulating hypotheses, designing protocols, collecting data, analyzing data, and reporting results. Opportunistic use of “researcher degrees of freedom” aimed at obtaining statistical significance increases the likelihood of obtaining and publishing false-positive results and overestimated effect sizes. Preregistration is a mechanism for reducing such degrees of freedom by specifying designs and analysis plans before observing the research outcomes. The effectiveness of preregistration may depend, in part, on whether the process facilitates sufficiently specific articulation of such plans. In this preregistered study, we compared 2 formats of preregistration available on the OSF: Standard Pre-Data Collection Registration and Prereg Challenge Registration (now called “OSF Preregistration,” http://osf.io/prereg/). The Prereg Challenge format was a “structured” workflow with detailed instructions and an independent review to confirm completeness; the “Standard” format was “unstructured” with minimal direct guidance to give researchers flexibility for what to prespecify. Results of comparing random samples of 53 preregistrations from each format indicate that the “structured” format restricted the opportunistic use of researcher degrees of freedom better (Cliff’s Delta = 0.49) than the “unstructured” format, but neither eliminated all researcher degrees of freedom. We also observed very low concordance among coders about the number of hypotheses (14%), indicating that they are often not clearly stated. We conclude that effective preregistration is challenging, and registration formats that provide effective guidance may improve the quality of research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/apYiin04t7M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The Impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on Stroke Epidemiology and Care: A Meta‐Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25967</guid>

	<description>Objective
Emerging data indicate an increased risk of cerebrovascular events with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and highlight the potential impact of coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) on the management and outcomes of acute stroke. We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis to evaluate the aforementioned considerations.


Methods
We performed a meta‐analysis of observational cohort studies reporting on the occurrence and/or outcomes of patients with cerebrovascular events in association with their SARS‐CoV‐2 infection status. We used a random‐effects model. Summary estimates were reported as odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).


Results
We identified 18 cohort studies including 67,845 patients. Among patients with SARS‐CoV‐2, 1.3% (95% CI = 0.9–1.6%, I2 = 87%) were hospitalized for cerebrovascular events, 1.1% (95% CI = 0.8–1.3%, I2 = 85%) for ischemic stroke, and 0.2% (95% CI = 0.1–0.3%, I2 = 64%) for hemorrhagic stroke. Compared to noninfected contemporary or historical controls, patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection had increased odds of ischemic stroke (OR = 3.58, 95% CI = 1.43–8.92, I2 = 43%) and cryptogenic stroke (OR = 3.98, 95% CI = 1.62–9.77, I2 = 0%). Diabetes mellitus was found to be more prevalent among SARS‐CoV‐2 stroke patients compared to noninfected historical controls (OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.00–1.94, I2 = 0%). SARS‐CoV‐2 infection status was not associated with the likelihood of receiving intravenous thrombolysis (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 0.65–3.10, I2 = 0%) or endovascular thrombectomy (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.35–1.74, I2 = 0%) among hospitalized ischemic stroke patients during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Odds of in‐hospital mortality were higher among SARS‐CoV‐2 stroke patients compared to noninfected contemporary or historical stroke patients (OR = 5.60, 95% CI = 3.19–9.80, I2 = 45%).


Interpretation
SARS‐CoV‐2 appears to be associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, and potentially cryptogenic stroke in particular. It may also be related to an increased mortality risk. ANN NEUROL 2020</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Activation of ventral CA1 hippocampal neurons projecting to the lateral septum during feeding</title>

	<description>Abstract
A number of studies have reported the involvement of the ventral hippocampus (vHip) and the lateral septum (LS) in negative emotional responses. Besides these well‐documented functions, they are also thought to control feeding behavior. In particular, optogenetic and pharmacogenetic interventions to LS‐projecting vHip neurons have demonstrated that the vHip→LS neural circuit exerts an inhibition on feeding behavior. However, there have been no reports of vHip neuronal activity during feeding. Here, we focused on LS‐projecting vCA1 neurons (vCA1→LS) and monitored their activity during feeding behaviors in mice. vCA1→LS neurons were retrogradely labeled with adeno‐associated virus carrying a ratiometric Ca2+ indicator and measured compound Ca2+ dynamics by fiber photometry. We first examined vCA1→LS activity in random food‐exploring behavior and found that vCA1→LS activation seemed to coincide with food intake; however, our ability to visually confirm this during freely moving behaviors was not sufficiently reliable. We next examined vCA1→LS activity in a goal‐directed, food‐seeking lever‐press task which temporally divided the mouse state into preparatory, effort, and consummatory phases. We observed vCA1→LS activation in the postprandial period during the consummatory phase. Such timing‐ and pathway‐specific activation was not observed from pan‐vCA1 neurons. In contrast, reward omission eliminated this activity, indicating that vCA1→LS activation is contingent on the food reward. Sated mice pressed the lever significantly fewer times but still ate food; however, vCA1→LS neurons were not activated, suggesting that vCA1→LS neurons did not respond to habitual behavior. Combined, these results suggest that gastrointestinal interoception rather than food‐intake motions or external sensations are likely to coincide with vCA1→LS activity. Accordingly, we propose that vCA1→LS neurons discriminate between matched or unmatched predictive bodily states in which incoming food will satisfy an appetite. We also demonstrate that vCA1→LS neurons are activated in aversive/anxious situations in an elevated plus maze and tail suspension test. Future behavioral tests utilizing anxious conflict and food intake may reconcile the multiple functions of vCA1→LS neurons.</description>

	<description>We diagnosed 11 Guillain‐Barre syndrome (GBS) cases among 71,904 COVID patients attended at 61 Spanish emergency departments (ED) during the 2‐month pandemic peak. The relative frequency of GBS among ED patients was higher in COVID (0.15‰) than non‐COVID(0.02‰) patients (OR=6.30, 95%CI=3.18‐12.5) as was the standardized incidence (9.44 and 0.69 cases/100,000‐year, respectively, OR=13.5; 95%CI=9.87‐18.4). Regarding clinical characteristics, olfactory‐gustatory disorders were more frequent in COVID‐GBS than non‐COVID‐GBS (OR=27.59, 95%CI=1.296‐587) and COVID‐non‐GBS (OR=7.875, 95%CI=1.587‐39.09) patients. Although COVID‐GBS patients were more frequently admitted to intensive care, mortality was not increased versus control groups. Our results suggest SARS‐CoV‐2 could be another viral infection causing GBS.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Conventional immunomarkers stain a fraction of astrocytes in vitro: A comparison of rat cortical and spinal cord astrocytes in naïve and stimulated cultures</title>

	<description>Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST), glutamine synthetase (GS), ALDH1L1, and SOX9 stained different percentages of cortical and spinal cord astrocytes in vitro. SOX9 in cortical and ALDH1L1 in spinal cord cultures consistently stained astrocytes in naïve and transforming growth factor‐β‐treated cultures.

Abstract
Astrocytes are responsible for a wide variety of essential functions throughout the central nervous system. The protein markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST), glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1), glutamine synthetase (GS), 10‐formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (ALDH1L1), and the transcription factor SOX9 are routinely used to label astrocytes in primary rodent cultures. However, GLAST, GLT‐1, GS, and SOX9 are also produced by microglia and oligodendrocytes and GFAP, GLAST, GLT‐1, and GS production levels are affected by astrocyte phenotypic changes associated with reactive astrogliosis. No group has performed a comprehensive immunocytochemical evaluation to quantify the percentage of cells labeled by these markers in vitro, nor compared changes in staining between cortex‐ and spinal cord‐derived cells in naïve and stimulated cultures. Here, we quantified the percentage of cells positively stained for these six markers in astrocyte, microglia, and oligodendrocyte cultures isolated from neonatal rat cortices and spinal cords. Additionally, we incubated the astrocytes with transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β1 or TGF‐β3 to determine if the labeling of these markers is altered by these stimuli. We found that only SOX9 in cortical cultures and ALDH1L1 in spinal cord cultures labeled more than 75% of the cells in naïve and stimulated astrocyte cultures and stained less than 5% of the cells in microglia and oligodendrocyte cultures. Furthermore, significantly more cortical than spinal cord astrocytes stained for GFAP, GLAST, and ALDH1L1 in naïve cultures, whereas significantly more spinal cord than cortical astrocytes stained for GLAST and GS in TGF‐β1‐treated cultures. These findings are important as variability in marker staining may lead to misinterpretation of the astrocyte response in cocultures, migration assays, or engineered disease models.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: AChR β-Subunit mRNAs Are Stabilized by HuR in a Mouse Model of Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome With Acetylcholinesterase Deficiency</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.568171</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Collagen Q (COLQ) is a specific collagen that anchors acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the synaptic cleft of the neuromuscular junction. So far, no mutation has been identified in the ACHE human gene but over 50 different mutations in the COLQ gene are causative for a congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) with AChE deficiency. Mice deficient for COLQ mimic most of the functional deficit observed in CMS patients. At the molecular level, a striking consequence of the absence of COLQ is an increase in the levels of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) mRNAs and proteins in vivo and in vitro in murine skeletal muscle cells. Here, we decipher the mechanisms that drive AChR mRNA upregulation in cultured muscle cells deficient for COLQ. We show that the levels of AChR β-subunit mRNAs are post-transcriptionally regulated by an increase in their stability. We demonstrate that this process results from an activation of p38 MAPK and the cytoplasmic translocation of the nuclear RNA-binding protein human antigen R (HuR) that interacts with the AU-rich element located within AChR β-subunit transcripts. This HuR/AChR transcript interaction induces AChR β-subunit mRNA stabilization and occurs at a specific stage of myogenic differentiation. In addition, pharmacological drugs that modulate p38 activity cause parallel modifications of HuR protein and AChR β-subunit levels. Thus, our study provides new insights into the signaling pathways that are regulated by ColQ-deficiency and highlights for the first time a role for HuR and p38 in mRNA stability in a model of congenital myasthenic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Abnormal Regional Spontaneous Brain Activity and Its Indirect Effect on Spasm Ratings in Patients With Hemifacial Spasm</title>

	<description>Purpose&lt;p&gt;Three classical methods of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) were employed to explore the local functional abnormalities and their effect on spasm ratings in hemifacial spasm (HFS) patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Thirty HFS patients and 30 matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Rs-fMRI data, neurovascular compression (NVC) degree and spasm severity were collected in each subject. Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and degree centrality (DC) were calculated in the whole brain voxels. Two sample t-tests were performed to investigate group differences of fALFF, ReHo, and DC. Correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationships between the regional brain abnormalities and clinical variables in HFS.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with HCs, HFS patients exhibited increased fALFF in the left precuneus and right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), together with increased ReHo in the bilateral PCC and bilateral precuneus. Decreased ReHo was observed in the right middle occipital gyrus (MOG), right superior occipital gyrus (SOG), right cuneus, and right angular gyrus (AG) in HFS patients. Moreover, ReHo in the right PCC were positively correlated with NVC degree and spasm severity in HFS patients, respectively. Mediation analysis revealed that increased ReHo in the right PCC regulated the neurovascular compression degree, and further resulted in increased spasm ratings.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study revealed regional brain dysfunctions from different perspectives and an indirect effect of ReHo in right PCC on spasm ratings predominantly through the alteration of NVC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Morphometric Changes to Corneal Dendritic Cells in Individuals With Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>

	<description>Purpose&lt;p&gt;There has been increasing interest in identifying non-invasive, imaging biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to investigate whether corneal sensory nerve and dendritic cell (DC) parameters, captured using in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM), are altered in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifteen participants were recruited from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study in Melbourne, VIC, Australia. The cohort consisted of cognitively normal (CN) individuals (n = 5), and those with MCI (n = 5) and AD (n = 5). Participants underwent a slit lamp examination of the anterior segment, followed by corneal imaging using laser-scanning in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) of the central and inferior whorl regions. Corneal DC density, field area, perimeter, circularity index, aspect ratio, and roundness were quantified using Image J. Quantitative data were derived for corneal nerve parameters, including nerve fiber length (CNFL), fiber density (CNFD), branch density (CNBD), and diameter.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Corneal DC field area and perimeter were greater in individuals with MCI, relative to CN controls, in both the central and inferior whorl regions (p &amp;lt; 0.05 for all comparisons). In addition, corneal DCs in the whorl region of MCI eyes had lower circularity and roundness indices and a higher aspect ratio relative to CNs (p &amp;lt; 0.05 for all comparisons). DC density was similar across participant groups in both corneal regions. There was a trend toward lower quantitative parameters for corneal nerve architecture in the AD and MCI groups compared with CN participants, however, the inter-group differences did not reach statistical significance. Central corneal nerve diameters were similar between groups.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to report morphological differences in corneal DCs in humans with MCI. These differences were evident in both the central and mid-peripheral cornea, and in the absence of significant nerve abnormalities or a difference in DC density. These findings justify future large-scale studies to assess the utility of corneal IVCM and DC analysis for identifying early stage pathology in neurodegenerative disorders of the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Validation and Diagnostic Performance of a CFD-Based Non-invasive Method for the Diagnosis of Aortic Coarctation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: The clinical diagnosis of aorta coarctation (CoA) constitutes a challenge, which is usually tackled by applying the peak systolic pressure gradient (PSPG) method. Recent advances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have suggested that multi-detector computed tomography angiography (MDCTA)-based CFD can serve as a non-invasive PSPG measurement. The aim of this study was to validate a new CFD method that does not require any medical examination data other than MDCTA images for the diagnosis of CoA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and methods: Our study included 65 pediatric patients (38 with CoA, and 27 without CoA). All patients underwent cardiac catheterization to confirm if they were suffering from CoA or any other congenital heart disease (CHD). A series of boundary conditions were specified and the simulated results were combined to obtain a stenosis pressure-flow curve. Subsequently, we built a prediction model and evaluated its predictive performance by considering the AUC of the ROC by 5-fold cross-validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The proposed MDCTA-based CFD method exhibited a good predictive performance in both the training and test sets (average AUC: 0.948 vs. 0.958; average accuracies: 0.881 vs. 0.877). It also had a higher predictive accuracy compared with the non-invasive criteria presented in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines (average accuracies: 0.877 vs. 0.539).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The new non-invasive CFD-based method presented in this work is a promising approach for the accurate diagnosis of CoA, and will likely benefit clinical decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neuromechanical Assessment of Activated vs. Resting Leg Rigidity Using the Pendulum Test Is Associated With a Fall History in People With Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.602595</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Leg rigidity is associated with frequent falls in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD), suggesting a potential role in functional balance and gait impairments. Changes in the neural state due to secondary tasks, e.g., activation maneuvers, can exacerbate (or “activate”) rigidity, possibly increasing the risk of falls. However, the subjective interpretation and coarse classification of the standard clinical rigidity scale has prohibited the systematic, objective assessment of resting and activated leg rigidity. The pendulum test is an objective diagnostic method that we hypothesized would be sensitive enough to characterize resting and activated leg rigidity. We recorded kinematic data and electromyographic signals from rectus femoris and biceps femoris during the pendulum test in 15 individuals with PD, spanning a range of leg rigidity severity. From the recorded data of leg swing kinematics, we measured biomechanical outcomes including first swing excursion, first extension peak, number and duration of the oscillations, resting angle, relaxation index, maximum and minimum angular velocity. We examined associations between biomechanical outcomes and clinical leg rigidity score. We evaluated the effect of increasing rigidity through activation maneuvers on biomechanical outcomes. Finally, we assessed whether either biomechanical outcomes or changes in outcomes with activation were associated with a fall history. Our results suggest that the biomechanical assessment of the pendulum test can objectively quantify parkinsonian leg rigidity. We found that the presence of high rigidity during clinical exam significantly impacted biomechanical outcomes, i.e., first extension peak, number of oscillations, relaxation index, and maximum angular velocity. No differences in the effect of activation maneuvers between groups with clinically assessed low rigidity were observed, suggesting that activated rigidity may be independent of resting rigidity and should be scored as independent variables. Moreover, we found that fall history was more common among people whose rigidity was increased with a secondary task, as measured by biomechanical outcomes. We conclude that different mechanisms contributing to resting and activated rigidity may play an important yet unexplored functional role in balance impairments. The pendulum test may contribute to a better understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying motor symptoms in PD, evaluating the efficacy of treatments, and predicting the risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Motor Deficits in the Ipsilesional Arm of Severely Paretic Stroke Survivors Correlate With Functional Independence in Left, but Not Right Hemisphere Damage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.599220</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic stroke survivors with severe contralesional arm paresis face numerous challenges to performing activities of daily living, which largely rely on the use of the less-affected ipsilesional arm. While use of the ipsilesional arm is often encouraged as a compensatory strategy in rehabilitation, substantial evidence indicates that motor control deficits in this arm can be functionally limiting, suggesting a role for remediation of this arm. Previous research has indicated that the nature of ipsilesional motor control deficits vary with hemisphere of damage and with the severity of contralesional paresis. Thus, in order to design rehabilitation that accounts for these deficits in promoting function, it is critical to understand the relative contributions of both ipsilesional and contralesional arm motor deficits to functional independence in stroke survivors with severe contralesional paresis. We now examine motor deficits in each arm of severely paretic chronic stroke survivors with unilateral damage (10 left-, 10 right-hemisphere damaged individuals) to determine whether hemisphere-dependent deficits are correlated with functional independence. Clinical evaluation of contralesional, paretic arm impairment was conducted with the upper extremity portion of the Fugl-Meyer assessment (UEFM). Ipsilesional arm motor performance was evaluated using the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT), grip strength, and ipsilesional high-resolution kinematic analysis during a visually targeted reaching task. Functional independence was measured with the Barthel Index. Functional independence was better correlated with ipsilesional than contralesional arm motor performance in the left hemisphere damage group [JTHFT: [r&lt;sub&gt;(10)&lt;/sub&gt; = −0.73, p = 0.017]; grip strength: [r&lt;sub&gt;(10)&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.64, p = 0.047]], and by contralesional arm impairment in the right hemisphere damage group [UEFM: [r&lt;sub&gt;(10)&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.66, p = 0.040]]. Ipsilesional arm kinematics were correlated with functional independence in the left hemisphere damage group only. Examination of hemisphere-dependent motor correlates of functional independence showed that ipsilesional arm deficits were important in determining functional outcomes in individuals with left hemisphere damage only, suggesting that functional independence in right hemisphere damaged participants was affected by other factors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Feasibility and Safety of Bilateral Hybrid EEG/EOG Brain/Neural–Machine Interaction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.580105</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cervical spinal cord injuries (SCIs) often lead to loss of motor function in both hands and legs, limiting autonomy and quality of life. While it was shown that unilateral hand function can be restored after SCI using a hybrid electroencephalography/electrooculography (EEG/EOG) brain/neural hand exoskeleton (B/NHE), it remained unclear whether such hybrid paradigm also could be used for operating two hand exoskeletons, e.g., in the context of bimanual tasks such as eating with fork and knife. To test whether EEG/EOG signals allow for fluent and reliable as well as safe and user-friendly bilateral B/NHE control, eight healthy participants (six females, mean age 24.1 ± 3.2 years) as well as four chronic tetraplegics (four males, mean age 51.8 ± 15.2 years) performed a complex sequence of EEG-controlled bilateral grasping and EOG-controlled releasing motions of two exoskeletons visually presented on a screen. A novel EOG command performed by prolonged horizontal eye movements (&amp;gt;1 s) to the left or right was introduced as a reliable switch to activate either the left or right exoskeleton. Fluent EEG control was defined as average “time to initialize” (TTI) grasping motions below 3 s. Reliable EEG control was assumed when classification accuracy exceeded 80%. Safety was defined as “time to stop” (TTS) all unintended grasping motions within 2 s. After the experiment, tetraplegics were asked to rate the user-friendliness of bilateral B/NHE control using Likert scales. Average TTI and accuracy of EEG-controlled operations ranged at 2.14 ± 0.66 s and 85.89 ± 15.81% across healthy participants and at 1.90 ± 0.97 s and 81.25 ± 16.99% across tetraplegics. Except for one tetraplegic, all participants met the safety requirements. With 88 ± 11% of the maximum achievable score, tetraplegics rated the control paradigm as user-friendly and reliable. These results suggest that hybrid EEG/EOG B/NHE control of two assistive devices is feasible and safe, paving the way to test this paradigm in larger clinical trials performing bimanual tasks in everyday life environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Alteration of Cortical and Subcortical Structures in Children With Profound Sensorineural Hearing Loss</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is an auditory disability associated with auditory and cognitive dysfunction. Due to distinct pathogenesis, some associated structural and functional changes within the brain have been investigated in previous studies, but whole-brain structural alterations are incompletely understood. We extended the exploration of neuroanatomic differences in whole-brain structure in children with profound SNHL who are primarily users of Chinese sign language (CSL). We employed surface-based morphometry (SBM) and subcortical analyses. T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of 26 children with profound SNHL and 27 age- and sex-matched children with normal hearing were analyzed. Compared with the normal control (NC) group, children with profound SNHL showed diverse structural changes in surface-based and subcortical analyses, including decreased cortical thickness in the left postcentral gyrus, superior parietal lobule, paracentral lobule, precuneus, the right transverse temporal gyri, and the middle temporal gyrus; a noticeable increase in the Local Gyrification Index (LGI) in the left precuneus and superior parietal lobule; and diverse changes in gray-matter volume (GMV) in different brain regions. Surface-based vertex analyses revealed regional contractions in the right thalamus, putamen, pallidum, and the brainstem of children with profound SNHL when compared with those in the NC group. Volumetric analyses showed decreased volumes of the right thalamus and pallidum in children with profound SNHL. Our data suggest that children with profound SNHL are associated with diffuse cerebral dysfunction to cortical and subcortical nuclei, and revealed neuroplastic reorganization in the precuneus, superior parietal lobule, and temporal gyrus. Our study provides robust evidence for changes in connectivity and structure in the brain associated with hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Hierarchical Sparse Coding of Objects in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.578158</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.578158</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have attained human-level performances on challenging object recognition tasks owing to their complex internal representation. However, it remains unclear how objects are represented in DCNNs with an overwhelming number of features and non-linear operations. In parallel, the same question has been extensively studied in primates' brain, and three types of coding schemes have been found: one object is coded by the entire neuronal population (distributed coding), or by one single neuron (local coding), or by a subset of neuronal population (sparse coding). Here we asked whether DCNNs adopted any of these coding schemes to represent objects. Specifically, we used the population sparseness index, which is widely-used in neurophysiological studies on primates' brain, to characterize the degree of sparseness at each layer in representative DCNNs pretrained for object categorization. We found that the sparse coding scheme was adopted at all layers of the DCNNs, and the degree of sparseness increased along the hierarchy. That is, the coding scheme shifted from distributed-like coding at lower layers to local-like coding at higher layers. Further, the degree of sparseness was positively correlated with DCNNs' performance in object categorization, suggesting that the coding scheme was related to behavioral performance. Finally, with the lesion approach, we demonstrated that both external learning experiences and built-in gating operations were necessary to construct such a hierarchical coding scheme. In sum, our study provides direct evidence that DCNNs adopted a hierarchically-evolved sparse coding scheme as the biological brain does, suggesting the possibility of an implementation-independent principle underling object recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: An Analysis of the Putative CBD Binding Site in the Ionotropic Cannabinoid Receptors</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cannabinoids have been long studied for their therapeutic properties, particularly for their use in the treatment of pain. As new therapies are sought after to treat conditions of chronic pain, so is a better understanding of the ligands and their target receptors or channels. A recently published cryo-EM structure showed the putative binding location of a well-known cannabinoid ligand, cannabidiol (CBD), in TRPV2, a channel that has been implicated in inflammation and chronic pain. TRPV2, along with TRPV1, TRPV3, TRPV4, TRPA1, and TRPM8 all have the capability to be modulated by cannabinoid ligands and are located in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we analyze the putative CBD binding site in each of these channels and compare structural and sequential information with experimental data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Hypoxia Augments Cerebral Inflammation in a Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Colitis Mouse Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The importance of hypoxia in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasingly being realized; also, hypoxia seems to be an important accelerator of brain inflammation, as has been reported by our group and others. IBD is a chronic intestinal disorder that leads to the development of inflammation, which is related to brain dysfunction. However, no studies have reported whether hypoxia is associated with IBD-induced neuroinflammation. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine whether hypoxia augments cerebral inflammation in a DSS-induced colitis mouse model. The mouse model was developed using 3% DSS for five days combined with exposure to hypoxic conditions (6,000 m) for two days. Mice were randomly divided into four groups: control group, DSS group, hypoxia group, and DSS plus hypoxia group. The results demonstrated that DSS combined with hypoxia resulted in up-regulation of colonic and plasmatic proinflammatory cytokines. Meanwhile, DSS plus hypoxia increased expression of Iba1, which is a marker of activated microglia, accompanied by increased expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the brain. Moreover, the expression of tight junction proteins, such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin, and claudin-5, was markedly downregulated. The current study provides new insight into how hypoxia exposure induces excessive inflammatory responses andpathophysiological consequences in the brain in a DSS-induced colitis model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Intrinsically Self-renewing Neuroprogenitors From the A/J Mouse Spiral Ganglion as Virtually Unlimited Source of Mature Auditory Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.599152</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly 460 million individuals are affected by sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), one of the most common human sensory disorders. In mammals, hearing loss is permanent due to the lack of efficient regenerative capacity of the sensory epithelia and spiral ganglion neurons (SGN). Sphere-forming progenitor cells can be isolated from the mammalian inner ear and give rise to inner ear specific cell types in vitro. However, the self-renewing capacities of auditory progenitor cells from the sensory and neuronal compartment are limited to few passages, even after adding powerful growth factor cocktails. Here, we provide phenotypical and functional characterization of a new pool of auditory progenitors as sustainable source for sphere-derived auditory neurons. The so-called phoenix auditory neuroprogenitors, isolated from the A/J mouse spiral ganglion, exhibit robust intrinsic self-renewal properties beyond 40 passages. At any passage or freezing–thawing cycle, phoenix spheres can be efficiently differentiated into mature spiral ganglion cells by withdrawing growth factors. The differentiated cells express both neuronal and glial cell phenotypic markers and exhibit similar functional properties as mouse spiral ganglion primary explants and human sphere-derived spiral ganglion cells. In contrast to other rodent models aiming at sustained production of auditory neurons, no genetic transformation of the progenitors is needed. Phoenix spheres therefore represent an interesting starting point to further investigate self-renewal in the mammalian inner ear, which is still far from any clinical application. In the meantime, phoenix spheres already offer an unlimited source of mammalian auditory neurons for high-throughput screens while substantially reducing the numbers of animals needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Adeno-Associated Virus-Mediated Single-Cell Labeling of Mitral Cells in the Mouse Olfactory Bulb: Insights into the Developmental Dynamics of Dendrite Remodeling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.572256</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.572256</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons typically remodel axons/dendrites for functional refinement of neural circuits in the developing brain. Mitral cells in the mammalian olfactory system remodel their dendritic arbors in the perinatal development, but the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain elusive in part due to a lack of convenient methods to label mitral cells with single-cell resolution. Here we report a novel method for single-cell labeling of mouse mitral cells using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene delivery. We first demonstrated that AAV injection into the olfactory ventricle of embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) mice preferentially labels mitral cells in the olfactory bulb (OB). Birthdate labeling indicated that AAV can transduce mitral cells independently of their birthdates. Furthermore, in combination with the Cre-mediated gene expression system, AAV injection allows visualization of mitral cells at single-cell resolution. Using this AAV-mediated single-cell labeling method, we investigated dendrite development of mitral cells and found that ~50% of mitral cells exhibited mature apical dendrites with a single thick and tufted branch before birth, suggesting that a certain population of mitral cells completes dendrite remodeling during embryonic stages. We also found an atypical subtype of mitral cells that have multiple dendritic shafts innervating the same glomeruli. Our data thus demonstrate that the AAV-mediated labeling method that we reported here provides an efficient way to visualize mitral cells with single-cell resolution and could be utilized to study dynamic aspects as well as functions of mitral cells in the olfactory circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Have I Been Here? Sense of Location in People With Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.582525</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.582525</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: When navigating in a particular space, a sense of being at a current location is of great help for the navigators in reaching their destination or getting back to the start. To accomplish this work, interwoven neural structures and neurons are called into play. This system is called the heading direction cell-place cell-grid cell circuit. Evidence from various neuroscience studies has revealed that the regions responsible for this circuit are damaged in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This may explain why wayfinding difficulty is one of the most frequent symptoms in persons with AD. The aim of this study was to examine the sense of location (SoL) in persons with mild AD, persons with prodromal AD (prAD), and those who were cognitively unimpaired (CU).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We invited people with mild AD, prAD, and CU to participate in this study. The venue of the core experiment to assess SoL was a 660-m path located on the university campus. The participants were instructed to take a walk on the path and press a device to indicate their arrival at each of the five carefully chosen targets. The linear deviations from the target site were compared among the groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 20 AD, 28 prAD, and 29 CU persons completed the study. Their Mini-Mental State Examination scores were on average 20 (SD 3), 24 (SD 3), and 28 (SD 2). The groups were well differentiated regarding several measurements for cognitive ability and spatial navigation. As for the SoL, the hit rates of exact location with linear deviation of 16 m or less were 0.05, 0.54, and 0.86 for AD, prAD, and CU persons, respectively. The hit rates were well correlated with the presence of getting lost. Also, SoL differentiated well among CU, PrAD, and AD in terms of average linear deviation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our employing linear deviation by utilizing a grid-cell function device as an assessment for SoL showed distinct features among the three groups. This model can be used to develop more delicate devices or instruments to detect, monitor, and aid spatial navigation in persons with prAD and AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Applying the Inverse Efficiency Score to Visual–Motor Task for Studying Speed-Accuracy Performance While Aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.574401</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.574401</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The current study examines the relationship between speed and accuracy of performance in a reaction time setting and explores the informative value of the inverse efficiency score (IES) regarding the possibility to reflect age-related cognitive changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To study the characteristics of speed and accuracy while performing psychophysiological tests throughout the lifespan; to examine the speed-accuracy ratio in age groups and to apply IES to discriminative visual-motor reaction task; and to figure out the predictive potential of psychophysiological tests to identify IES values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We utilize nonparametric statistical tests, regression analysis, and supervised machine learning methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results and Conclusion: The examinees under 20 and over 60 years of age share one tendency regarding the speed-accuracy ratio without speed-accuracy trade-off. Both at the time of active developmental changes in adolescence and during ongoing atrophic changes in elderly there is a tendency toward a rise of the number of mistakes while slowing the reaction. In the age range from 20 to 60 the relationship between the speed and accuracy is opposite and speed-accuracy trade-off is present. In our battery, complex visual-motor reaction is the only test with the significant negative association between reaction time and error rate in the subcohort of young and midlife adults taken together. On average, women perform more slowly and accurately than men in the speed-accuracy task, however most of the gender-related differences are insignificant. Using results of other psychophysiological tests, we predicted IES values for the visual-motor reaction with high accuracy (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.77 ± 0.08; mean absolute error / IES range = 3.37%). The regression model shows the best performance in the cognitively preserved population groups of young and middle-aged adults (20–60 years). Because of the individual rate of neurodevelopment in youth and cognitive decline in the elderly, the regression model for these subcohorts has a low predictive performance. IES accounts for different cognitive subdomains and may reflect their disproportional changes throughout the lifespan. This encourages us to proceed to explore the combination of executive functioning and psychophysiological test results utilizing machine learning models. The latter can be designed as a reliable computer-aided detector of cognitive changes at early stages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: FOCAL3D: A 3-dimensional clustering package for single-molecule localization microscopy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel F. Nino, Daniel Djayakarsana, Joshua N. Milstein&lt;/p&gt;

Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is a powerful tool for studying intracellular structure and macromolecular organization at the nanoscale. The increasingly massive pointillistic data sets generated by SMLM require the development of new and highly efficient quantification tools. Here we present FOCAL3D, an accurate, flexible and exceedingly fast (scaling linearly with the number of localizations) density-based algorithm for quantifying spatial clustering in large 3D SMLM data sets. Unlike DBSCAN, which is perhaps the most commonly employed density-based clustering algorithm, an optimum set of parameters for FOCAL3D may be objectively determined. We initially validate the performance of FOCAL3D on simulated datasets at varying noise levels and for a range of cluster sizes. These simulated datasets are used to illustrate the parametric insensitivity of the algorithm, in contrast to DBSCAN, and clustering metrics such as the F1 and Silhouette score indicate that FOCAL3D is highly accurate, even in the presence of significant background noise and mixed populations of variable sized clusters, once optimized. We then apply FOCAL3D to 3D astigmatic dSTORM images of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in human osteosaracoma cells, illustrating both the validity of the parameter optimization and the ability of the algorithm to accurately cluster complex, heterogeneous 3D clusters in a biological dataset. FOCAL3D is provided as an open source software package written in Python.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ty1k0LKREqs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into target cells requires the activation of its surface spike protein, S, by host proteases. The host serine protease TMPRSS2 and cysteine proteases Cathepsin B/L can activate S, making two independent entry pathways accessible to SARS-CoV-2. Blocking the proteases prevents SARS-CoV-2 entry &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. This blockade may be achieved &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; through ‘repurposing’ drugs, a potential treatment option for COVID-19 that is now in clinical trials. Here, we found, surprisingly, that drugs targeting the two pathways, although independent, could display strong synergy in blocking virus entry. We predicted this synergy first using a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 entry and dynamics &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. The model considered the two pathways explicitly, let the entry efficiency through a pathway depend on the corresponding protease expression level, which varied across cells, and let inhibitors compromise the efficiency in a dose-dependent manner. The synergy predicted was novel and arose from effects of the drugs at both the single cell and the cell population levels. Validating our predictions, available &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; data on SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV entry displayed this synergy. Further, analysing the data using our model, we estimated the relative usage of the two pathways and found it to vary widely across cell lines, suggesting that targeting both pathways &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; may be important and synergistic given the broad tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 entry into target cells and may help improve the deployability of drug combinations targeting host proteases required for the entry.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cWuoL1Ip05g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A generative spiking neural-network model of goal-directed behaviour and one-step planning</title>

In mammals, goal-directed and planning processes support flexible behaviour used to face new situations that cannot be tackled through more efficient but rigid habitual behaviours. Within the Bayesian modelling approach of brain and behaviour, models have been proposed to perform planning as probabilistic inference but this approach encounters a crucial problem: explaining how such inference might be implemented in brain spiking networks. Recently, the literature has proposed some models that face this problem through recurrent spiking neural networks able to internally simulate state trajectories, the core function at the basis of planning. However, the proposed models have relevant limitations that make them biologically implausible, namely their world model is trained ‘off-line’ before solving the target tasks, and they are trained with supervised learning procedures that are biologically and ecologically not plausible. Here we propose two novel hypotheses on how brain might overcome these problems, and operationalise them in a novel architecture pivoting on a spiking recurrent neural network. The first hypothesis allows the architecture to learn the world model in parallel with its use for planning: to this purpose, a new arbitration mechanism decides when to explore, for learning the world model, or when to exploit it, for planning, based on the entropy of the world model itself. The second hypothesis allows the architecture to use an unsupervised learning process to learn the world model by observing the effects of actions. The architecture is validated by reproducing and accounting for the learning profiles and reaction times of human participants learning to solve a visuomotor learning task that is new for them. Overall, the architecture represents the first instance of a model bridging probabilistic planning and spiking-processes that has a degree of autonomy analogous to the one of real organisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zCe_cCUb2ng&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The actions of others act as a pseudo-reward to drive imitation in the context of social reinforcement learning</title>

While there is no doubt that social signals affect human reinforcement learning, there is still no consensus about how this process is computationally implemented. To address this issue, we compared three psychologically plausible hypotheses about the algorithmic implementation of imitation in reinforcement learning. The first hypothesis, decision biasing (DB), postulates that imitation consists in transiently biasing the learner’s action selection without affecting their value function. According to the second hypothesis, model-based imitation (MB), the learner infers the demonstrator’s value function through inverse reinforcement learning and uses it to bias action selection. Finally, according to the third hypothesis, value shaping (VS), the demonstrator’s actions directly affect the learner’s value function. We tested these three hypotheses in 2 experiments (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 24 and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 44) featuring a new variant of a social reinforcement learning task. We show through model comparison and model simulation that VS provides the best explanation of learner’s behavior. Results replicated in a third independent experiment featuring a larger cohort and a different design (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 302). In our experiments, we also manipulated the quality of the demonstrators’ choices and found that learners were able to adapt their imitation rate, so that only skilled demonstrators were imitated. We proposed and tested an efficient meta-learning process to account for this effect, where imitation is regulated by the agreement between the learner and the demonstrator. In sum, our findings provide new insights and perspectives on the computational mechanisms underlying adaptive imitation in human reinforcement learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/pNE0OR6jQZM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Reoccurring neural stem cell divisions in the adult zebrafish telencephalon are sufficient for the emergence of aggregated spatiotemporal patterns</title>

Regulation of quiescence and cell cycle entry is pivotal for the maintenance of stem cell populations. Regulatory mechanisms, however, are poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear how the activity of single stem cells is coordinated within the population or if cells divide in a purely random fashion. We addressed this issue by analyzing division events in an adult neural stem cell (NSC) population of the zebrafish telencephalon. Spatial statistics and mathematical modeling of over 80,000 NSCs in 36 brain hemispheres revealed weakly aggregated, nonrandom division patterns in space and time. Analyzing divisions at 2 time points allowed us to infer cell cycle and S-phase lengths computationally. Interestingly, we observed rapid cell cycle reentries in roughly 15% of newly born NSCs. In agent-based simulations of NSC populations, this redividing activity sufficed to induce aggregated spatiotemporal division patterns that matched the ones observed experimentally. In contrast, omitting redivisions leads to a random spatiotemporal distribution of dividing cells. Spatiotemporal aggregation of dividing stem cells can thus emerge solely from the cell’s history.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0Nq8wybcZu4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The Drosophila amyloid precursor protein homologue mediates neuronal survival and neuroglial interactions</title>

The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a structurally and functionally conserved transmembrane protein whose physiological role in adult brain function and health is still unclear. Because mutations in APP cause familial Alzheimer’s disease (fAD), most research focuses on this aspect of APP biology. We investigated the physiological function of APP in the adult brain using the fruit fly &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, which harbors a single APP homologue called APP Like (APPL). Previous studies have provided evidence for the implication of APPL in neuronal wiring and axonal growth through the Wnt signaling pathway during development. However, like APP, APPL continues to be expressed in all neurons of the adult brain where its functions and their molecular and cellular underpinnings are unknown. We report that APPL loss of function (LOF) results in the dysregulation of endolysosomal function in neurons, with a notable enlargement of early endosomal compartments followed by neuronal cell death and the accumulation of dead neurons in the brain during a critical period at a young age. These defects can be rescued by reduction in the levels of the early endosomal regulator Rab5, indicating a causal role of endosomal function for cell death. Finally, we show that the secreted extracellular domain of APPL interacts with glia and regulates the size of their endosomes, the expression of the Draper engulfment receptor, and the clearance of neuronal debris in an axotomy model. We propose that APP proteins represent a novel family of neuroglial signaling factors required for adult brain homeostasis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/XlPXoybySJ4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Late onset of Synaptotagmin 2a expression at synapses relevant to social behavior</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Late onset of Synaptotagmin 2a expression at synapses relevant to social behavior&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/81bf9d55-9078-401e-91fb-ba05470ecf6b/cne25084-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During brain development synapses form and are refined through the accumulation of different proteins. Here we examined the dynamic distribution of Synaptotagmin 2a (Syt2a) in the developing forebrain of zebrafish larvae with a focus on regions associated with social behavior. We show that Syt2a colocalized with Tyrosine Hydroxylase, a protein important for behavior. Further, we found that Syt2a localizes to synapses onto neurons implicated in social behavior, with an increase of Syt2a expression coinciding with the emergence of social behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they form, synapses go through various stages of maturation and refinement. These steps are linked to significant changes in synaptic function, potentially resulting in emergence and maturation of behavioral outputs. Synaptotagmins are calcium‐sensing proteins of the synaptic vesicle exocytosis machinery, and changes in Synaptotagmin proteins at synapses have significant effects on vesicle release and synaptic function. Here, we examined the distribution of the synaptic vesicle protein Synaptotagmin 2a (Syt2a) during development of the zebrafish nervous system. Syt2a is widely distributed throughout the midbrain and hindbrain early during larval development but very weakly expressed in the forebrain. Later in development, Syt2a expression levels in the forebrain increase, particularly in regions associated with social behavior, and most intriguingly, around the time social behavior becomes apparent. We provide evidence that Syt2a localizes to synapses onto neurons implicated in social behavior in the ventral forebrain and show that Syt2a is colocalized with Tyrosine Hydroxylase, a biosynthetic enzyme in the dopamine pathway. Our results suggest a developmentally important role for Syt2a in maturing synapses in the forebrain, coinciding with the emergence of social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a disease characterized by recurrent, episodic, and transient central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction resulting from an excessive synchronous discharge of brain neurons. It is characterized by diverse etiology, complex pathogenesis, and difficult treatment. In addition, most epileptic patients exhibit social cognitive impairment and psychological impairment. Iron is an essential trace element for human growth and development and is also involved in a variety of redox reactions in organisms. However, abnormal iron metabolism is associated with several neurological disorders, including hemorrhagic post-stroke epilepsy and post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). Moreover, ferroptosis is also considered a new form of regulation of cell death, which is attributed to severe lipid peroxidation caused by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and iron overload found in various neurological diseases, including epilepsy. Therefore, this review summarizes the study on iron metabolism and ferroptosis in epilepsy, in order to elucidate the correlation between iron and epilepsy. It also provides a novel method for the treatment, prevention, and research of epilepsy, to control epileptic seizures and reduce nerve injury after the epileptic seizure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: DeepVesselNet: Vessel Segmentation, Centerline Prediction, and Bifurcation Detection in 3-D Angiographic Volumes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present DeepVesselNet, an architecture tailored to the challenges faced when extracting vessel trees and networks and corresponding features in 3-D angiographic volumes using deep learning. We discuss the problems of low execution speed and high memory requirements associated with full 3-D networks, high-class imbalance arising from the low percentage (&amp;lt;3%) of vessel voxels, and unavailability of accurately annotated 3-D training data—and offer solutions as the building blocks of DeepVesselNet. First, we formulate 2-D orthogonal cross-hair filters which make use of 3-D context information at a reduced computational burden. Second, we introduce a class balancing cross-entropy loss function with false-positive rate correction to handle the high-class imbalance and high false positive rate problems associated with existing loss functions. Finally, we generate a synthetic dataset using a computational angiogenesis model capable of simulating vascular tree growth under physiological constraints on local network structure and topology and use these data for transfer learning. We demonstrate the performance on a range of angiographic volumes at different spatial scales including clinical MRA data of the human brain, as well as CTA microscopy scans of the rat brain. Our results show that cross-hair filters achieve over 23% improvement in speed, lower memory footprint, lower network complexity which prevents overfitting and comparable accuracy that does not differ from full 3-D filters. Our class balancing metric is crucial for training the network, and transfer learning with synthetic data is an efficient, robust, and very generalizable approach leading to a network that excels in a variety of angiography segmentation tasks. We observe that sub-sampling and max pooling layers may lead to a drop in performance in tasks that involve voxel-sized structures. To this end, the DeepVesselNet architecture does not use any form of sub-sampling layer and works well for vessel segmentation, centerline prediction, and bifurcation detection. We make our synthetic training data publicly available, fostering future research, and serving as one of the first public datasets for brain vessel tree segmentation and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Multivariate Brain Functional Connectivity Through Regularized Estimators</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional connectivity analyses are typically based on matrices containing bivariate measures of covariability, such as correlations. Although this has been a fruitful approach, it may not be the optimal strategy to fully explore the complex associations underlying brain activity. Here, we propose extending connectivity to multivariate functions relating to the temporal dynamics of a region with the rest of the brain. The main technical challenges of such an approach are multidimensionality and its associated risk of overfitting or even the non-uniqueness of model solutions. To minimize these risks, and as an alternative to the more common dimensionality reduction methods, we propose using two regularized multivariate connectivity models. On the one hand, simple linear functions of all brain nodes were fitted with ridge regression. On the other hand, a more flexible approach to avoid linearity and additivity assumptions was implemented through random forest regression. Similarities and differences between both methods and with simple averages of bivariate correlations (i.e., weighted global brain connectivity) were evaluated on a resting state sample of N = 173 healthy subjects. Results revealed distinct connectivity patterns from the two proposed methods, which were especially relevant in the age-related analyses where both ridge and random forest regressions showed significant patterns of age-related disconnection, almost completely absent from the much less sensitive global brain connectivity maps. On the other hand, the greater flexibility provided by the random forest algorithm allowed detecting sex-specific differences. The generic framework of multivariate connectivity implemented here may be easily extended to other types of regularized models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Functional Segregation of Human Brain Networks Across the Lifespan: An Exploratory Analysis of Static and Dynamic Resting-State Functional Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.561594</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prior research has shown that during development, there is increased segregation between, and increased integration within, prototypical resting-state functional brain networks. Functional networks are typically defined by static functional connectivity over extended periods of rest. However, little is known about how time-varying properties of functional networks change with age. Likewise, a comparison of standard approaches to functional connectivity may provide a nuanced view of how network integration and segregation are reflected across the lifespan. Therefore, this exploratory study evaluated common approaches to static and dynamic functional network connectivity in a publicly available dataset of subjects ranging from 8 to 75 years of age. Analyses evaluated relationships between age and static resting-state functional connectivity, variability (standard deviation) of connectivity, and mean dwell time of functional network states defined by recurring patterns of whole-brain connectivity. Results showed that older age was associated with decreased static connectivity between nodes of different canonical networks, particularly between the visual system and nodes in other networks. Age was not significantly related to variability of connectivity. Mean dwell time of a network state reflecting high connectivity between visual regions decreased with age, but older age was also associated with increased mean dwell time of a network state reflecting high connectivity within and between canonical sensorimotor and visual networks. Results support a model of increased network segregation over the lifespan and also highlight potential pathways of top-down regulation among networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: PASS: A Multimodal Database of Physical Activity and Stress for Mobile Passive Body/ Brain-Computer Interface Research</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With the burgeoning of wearable devices and passive body/brain-computer interfaces (B/BCIs), automated stress monitoring in everyday settings has gained significant attention recently, with applications ranging from serious games to clinical monitoring. With mobile users, however, challenges arise due to other overlapping (and potentially confounding) physiological responses (e.g., due to physical activity) that may mask the effects of stress, as well as movement artifacts that can be introduced in the measured signals. For example, the classical increase in heart rate can no longer be attributed solely to stress and could be caused by the activity itself. This makes the development of mobile passive B/BCIs challenging. In this paper, we introduce PASS, a multimodal database of Physical Activity and StresS collected from 48 participants. Participants performed tasks of varying stress levels at three different activity levels and provided quantitative ratings of their perceived stress and fatigue levels. To manipulate stress, two video games (i.e., a calm exploration game and a survival game) were used. Peripheral physical activity (electrocardiography, electrodermal activity, breathing, skin temperature) as well as cerebral activity (electroencephalography) were measured throughout the experiment. A complete description of the experimental protocol is provided and preliminary analyses are performed to investigate the physiological reactions to stress in the presence of physical activity. The PASS database, including raw data and subjective ratings has been made available to the research community at http://musaelab.ca/pass-database/. It is hoped that this database will help advance mobile passive B/BCIs for use in everyday settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Methods by which to achieve non-invasive deep brain stimulation via temporally interfering with electric fields have been proposed, but the precision of the positioning of the stimulation and the reliability and stability of the outputs require improvement. In this study, a temporally interfering electrical stimulator was developed based on a neuromodulation technique using the interference modulation waveform produced by several high-frequency electrical stimuli to treat neurodegenerative diseases. The device and auxiliary software constitute a non-invasive neuromodulation system. The technical problems related to the multichannel high-precision output of the device were solved by an analog phase accumulator and a special driving circuit to reduce crosstalk. The function of measuring bioimpedance in real time was integrated into the stimulator to improve effectiveness. Finite element simulation and phantom measurements were performed to find the functional relations among the target coordinates, current ratio, and electrode position in the simplified model. Then, an appropriate approach was proposed to find electrode configurations for desired target locations in a detailed and realistic mouse model. A mouse validation experiment was carried out under the guidance of a simulation, and the reliability and positioning accuracy of temporally interfering electric stimulators were verified. Stimulator improvement and precision positioning solutions promise opportunities for further studies of temporally interfering electrical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interface (BCI) multi-modal fusion has the potential to generate multiple commands in a highly reliable manner by alleviating the drawbacks associated with single modality. In the present work, a hybrid EEG-fNIRS BCI system—achieved through a fusion of concurrently recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals—is used to overcome the limitations of uni-modality and to achieve higher tasks classification. Although the hybrid approach enhances the performance of the system, the improvements are still modest due to the lack of availability of computational approaches to fuse the two modalities. To overcome this, a novel approach is proposed using Multi-resolution singular value decomposition (MSVD) to achieve system- and feature-based fusion. The two approaches based up different features set are compared using the KNN and Tree classifiers. The results obtained through multiple datasets show that the proposed approach can effectively fuse both modalities with improvement in the classification accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Chemical Basis of Intracerebral Hemorrhage and Cell Toxicity With Contributions From Eryptosis and Ferroptosis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a particularly devastating event both because of the direct injury from space-occupying blood to the sequelae of the brain exposed to free blood components from which it is normally protected. Not surprisingly, the usual metabolic and energy pathways are overwhelmed in this situation. In this review article, we detail the complexity of red blood cell degradation, the contribution of eryptosis leading to hemoglobin breakdown into its constituents, the participants in that process, and the points at which injury can be propagated such as elaboration of toxic radicals through the metabolism of the breakdown products. Two prominent products of this breakdown sequence, hemin, and iron, induce a variety of pathologies including free radical damage and DNA breakage, which appear to include events independent from typical oxidative DNA injury. As a result of this confluence of damaging elements, multiple pathways of injury, cell death, and survival are likely engaged including ferroptosis (which may be the same as oxytosis but viewed from a different perspective) and senescence, suggesting that targeting any single cause will likely not be a sufficient strategy to maximally improve outcome. Combination therapies in addition to safe methods to reduce blood burden should be pursued.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cytoplasmic Expression of the ALS/FTD-Related Protein TDP-43 Decreases Global Translation Both in vitro and in vivo</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;TDP-43 is a major component of cytoplasmic inclusions observed in neurodegenerative diseases like frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To further understand the role of TDP-43 in mRNA/protein metabolism and proteostasis, we used a combined approach with cellular and animal models overexpressing a cytoplasmic form of human TDP-43 (TDP-43-ΔNLS), recapitulating ALS/FTD features. We applied in HEK293 cells a method for labeling de novo translation, surface sensing of translation (SUnSET), based on puromycin (PURO) incorporation. While control cells displayed robust puromycilation, TDP-43-ΔNLS transfected cells exhibited reduced ongoing protein synthesis. Next, by using a transgenic mouse overexpressing cytoplasmic TDP-43 in the forebrain (TDP-43-ΔNLS mice) we assessed whether cytoplasmic TDP-43 regulates global translation in vivo. Polysome profiling of brain cortices from transgenic mice showed a shift toward non-polysomal fractions as compared to wild-type littermates, indicating a decrease in global translation. Lastly, cellular level translational assessment by SUNSET was performed in TDP-43-ΔNLS mice brain slices. Control mice slices incubated with PURO exhibited robust cytoplasmic PURO signal in layer 5 neurons from motor cortex, and normal nuclear TDP-43 staining. Neurons in TDP-43-ΔNLS mice slices incubated with PURO exhibited high cytoplasmic expression of TDP-43 and reduced puromycilation respect to control mice. These in vitro and in vivo results indicate that cytoplasmic TDP-43 decreases global translation and potentially cause functional/cytotoxic effects as observed in ALS/FTD. Our study provide in vivo evidence (by two independent and complementary methods) for a role of mislocalized TDP-43 in the regulation of global mRNA translation, with implications for TDP-43 proteinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Fyn-tau Ablation Modifies PTZ-Induced Seizures and Post-seizure Hallmarks of Early Epileptogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.592374</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Both Fyn and tau have been associated with neuronal hyperexcitability and neurotoxicity in many tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individual genetic ablation of fyn or tau appears to be protective against aberrant excitatory neuronal activities in AD and epilepsy models. It is, however, still unknown whether ablation of both Fyn and tau can likely elicit more profound anti-seizure and neuroprotective effects. Here, we show the effects of genetic deletion of Fyn and/or tau on seizure severity in response to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure in mouse models and neurobiological changes 24 h post-seizures. We used Fyn KO (fyn&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;), tau KO (tau&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;), double knockout (DKO) (fyn&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;/tau&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;), and wild-type (WT) mice of the same genetic background. Both tau KO and DKO showed a significant increase in latency to convulsive seizures and significantly decreased the severity of seizures post-PTZ. Although Fyn KO did not differ significantly from WT, in response to PTZ, Fyn KO still had 36 ± 8% seizure reduction and a 30% increase in seizure latency compared to WT. Surprisingly, in contrast to WT, Fyn KO mice showed higher mortality in &amp;lt;20 min of seizure induction; these mice had severe hydrocephalous. None of the tau&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; and DKO died during the study. In response to PTZ, all KO groups showed a significant reduction in neurodegeneration and gliosis, in contrast to WT, which showed increased neurodegeneration [especially, parvalbumin (PV)-GABAergic interneurons] and gliosis. DKO mice had the most reduced gliosis. Immunohistochemically, phospho-tau (AT8, pS199/S202), Fyn expression, as well as Fyn-tau interaction as measured by PLA increased in WT post-PTZ. Moreover, hippocampal Western blots revealed increased levels of AT8, tyrosine phospho-tau (pY18), and phosphorylated Src tyrosine family kinases (pSFK) in PTZ-treated WT, but not in KO, compared to respective controls. Furthermore, PV interneurons were protected from PTZ-induced seizure effects in all KO mice. The levels of inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir 4.1) channels were also downregulated in astrocytes in the WT post-PTZ, while its levels did not change in KO groups. Overall, our results demonstrated the role of Fyn and tau in seizures and their impact on the mediators of early epileptogenesis in PTZ model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Real-time structural motif searching in proteins using an inverted index strategy</title>

Biochemical and biological functions of proteins are the product of both the overall fold of the polypeptide chain, and, typically, structural motifs made up of smaller numbers of amino acids constituting a catalytic center or a binding site that may be remote from one another in amino acid sequence. Detection of such structural motifs can provide valuable insights into the function(s) of previously uncharacterized proteins. Technically, this remains an extremely challenging problem because of the size of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) archive. Existing methods depend on a clustering by sequence similarity and can be computationally slow. We have developed a new approach that uses an inverted index strategy capable of analyzing &amp;gt;170,000 PDB structures with unmatched speed. The efficiency of the inverted index method depends critically on identifying the small number of structures containing the query motif and ignoring most of the structures that are irrelevant. Our approach (implemented at motif.rcsb.org) enables real-time retrieval and superposition of structural motifs, either extracted from a reference structure or uploaded by the user. Herein, we describe the method and present five case studies that exemplify its efficacy and speed for analyzing 3D structures of both proteins and nucleic acids.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DeXPBiOQ2jc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The coronavirus disease COVID-19 constitutes the most severe pandemic of the last decades having caused more than 1 million deaths worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 virus recognizes the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of human cells through its spike protein. It has been reported that the coronavirus can mildly infect cats, and ferrets, and perhaps dogs while not pigs, mice, chicken and ducks. Differences in viral infectivity among different species or individuals could be due to amino acid differences at key positions of the host proteins that interact with the virus, the immune response, expression levels of host proteins and translation efficiency of the viral proteins among other factors. Here, first we have addressed the importance that sequence variants of different animal species, human individuals and virus isolates have on the interaction between the RBD domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike S protein and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Second, we have looked at viral translation efficiency by using the tRNA adaptation index. We find that integration of both interaction energy with ACE2 and translational efficiency explains animal infectivity. Humans are the top species in which SARS-CoV-2 is both efficiently translated as well as optimally interacting with ACE2. We have found some viral mutations that increase affinity for hACE and some hACE2 variants affecting ACE2 stability and virus binding. These variants suggest that different sensitivities to coronavirus infection in humans could arise in some cases from allelic variability affecting ACE2 stability and virus binding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BE-TWehCs_M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Prior expectations evoke stimulus-specific activity in the deep layers of the primary visual cortex</title>

The way we perceive the world is strongly influenced by our expectations. In line with this, much recent research has revealed that prior expectations strongly modulate sensory processing. However, the neural circuitry through which the brain integrates external sensory inputs with internal expectation signals remains unknown. In order to understand the computational architecture of the cortex, we need to investigate the way these signals flow through the cortical layers. This is crucial because the different cortical layers have distinct intra- and interregional connectivity patterns, and therefore determining which layers are involved in a cortical computation can inform us on the sources and targets of these signals. Here, we used ultra-high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to reveal that prior expectations evoke stimulus-specific activity selectively in the deep layers of the primary visual cortex (V1). These findings are in line with predictive processing theories proposing that neurons in the deep cortical layers represent perceptual hypotheses and thereby shed light on the computational architecture of cortex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/uyzBMQpP44k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Many studies have highlighted the difficulty inherent to the clinical application of fundamental neuroscience knowledge based on machine learning techniques. It is difficult to generalize machine learning brain markers to the data acquired from independent imaging sites, mainly due to large site differences in functional magnetic resonance imaging. We address the difficulty of finding a generalizable marker of major depressive disorder (MDD) that would distinguish patients from healthy controls based on resting-state functional connectivity patterns. For the discovery dataset with 713 participants from 4 imaging sites, we removed site differences using our recently developed harmonization method and developed a machine learning MDD classifier. The classifier achieved an approximately 70% generalization accuracy for an independent validation dataset with 521 participants from 5 different imaging sites. The successful generalization to a perfectly independent dataset acquired from multiple imaging sites is novel and ensures scientific reproducibility and clinical applicability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/79-l82ejQAA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Approximately 28% of the human population have been exposed to &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (MTB), with the overwhelming majority of infected individuals not developing disease (latent TB infection (LTBI)). While it is known that uncontrolled HIV infection is a major risk factor for the development of TB, the effect of underlying LTBI on HIV disease progression is less well characterized, in part because longitudinal data are lacking. We sorted all participants of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) with at least 1 documented MTB test into one of the 3 groups: MTB uninfected, LTBI, or active TB. To detect differences in the HIV set point viral load (SPVL), linear regression was used; the frequency of the most common opportunistic infections (OIs) in the SHCS between MTB uninfected patients, patients with LTBI, and patients with active TB were compared using logistic regression and time-to-event analyses. In adjusted models, we corrected for baseline demographic characteristics, i.e., HIV transmission risk group and gender, geographic region, year of HIV diagnosis, and CD4 nadir. A total of 13,943 SHCS patients had at least 1 MTB test documented, of whom 840 (6.0%) had LTBI and 770 (5.5%) developed active TB. Compared to MTB uninfected patients, LTBI was associated with a 0.24 decreased log HIV SPVL in the adjusted model (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Patients with LTBI had lower odds of having candida stomatitis (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.68, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0035) and oral hairy leukoplakia (adjusted OR = 0.67, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.033) when compared to MTB uninfected patients. The association of LTBI with a reduced HIV set point virus load and fewer unrelated infections in HIV/TB coinfected patients suggests a more complex interaction between LTBI and HIV than previously assumed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VeEs9fGFrLE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Chronic inflammation is now a well-known precursor for cancer development. Infectious prostatitis are the most common causes of prostate inflammation, but emerging evidence points the role of metabolic disorders as a potential source of cancer-related inflammation. Although the widely used treatment for prostate cancer based on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) effectively decreases tumor size, it also causes profound alterations in immune tumor microenvironment within the prostate. Here, we demonstrate that prostates of a mouse model invalidated for nuclear receptors liver X receptors (LXRs), crucial lipid metabolism and inflammation integrators, respond in an unexpected way to androgen deprivation. Indeed, we observed profound alterations in immune cells composition, which was associated with chronic inflammation of the prostate. This was explained by the recruitment of phagocytosis-deficient macrophages leading to aberrant hyporesponse to castration. This phenotypic alteration was sufficient to allow prostatic neoplasia. Altogether, these data suggest that ADT and inflammation resulting from metabolic alterations interact to promote aberrant proliferation of epithelial prostate cells and development of neoplasia. This raises the question of the benefit of ADT for patients with metabolic disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/b9iMz93lid4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A Prodromal Brain‐Clinical Pattern of Cognition in Synucleinopathies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25962</guid>

	<description>Objective
Isolated (or idiopathic) rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is associated with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Biomarkers are lacking to predict conversion to a dementia or a motor‐first phenotype. Here, we aimed at identifying a brain‐clinical signature that predicts dementia in iRBD.


Methods
A brain‐clinical signature was identified in 48 patients with polysomnography‐confirmed iRBD using partial least squares between brain deformation and 27 clinical variables. The resulting variable was applied to 78 patients with iRBD followed longitudinally to predict conversion to a synucleinopathy, specifically DLB. The deformation scores from patients with iRBD were compared with 207 patients with PD, DLB, or prodromal DLB to assess if scores were higher in DLB compared to PD.


Results
One latent variable explained 31% of the brain‐clinical covariance in iRBD, combining cortical and subcortical deformation and subarachnoid/ventricular expansion to cognitive and motor variables. The deformation score of this signature predicted conversion to a synucleinopathy in iRBD (p = 0.036, odds ratio [OR] = 2.249; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.053–4.803), specifically to DLB (OR = 4.754; 95% CI = 1.283–17.618, p = 0.020) and not PD (p = 0.286). Patients with iRBD who developed dementia had scores similar to clinical and prodromal patients with DLB but higher scores compared with patients with PD. The deformation score also predicted cognitive performance over 1, 2, and 4 years in patients with PD.


Interpretation
We identified a brain‐clinical signature that predicts conversion in iRBD to more severe/dementing forms of synucleinopathy. This pattern may serve as a new biomarker to optimize patient care, target risk reduction strategies, and administer neuroprotective trials. ANN NEUROL 2020</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Structural Basis for Noradrenergic Regulation of Neural Circuits in the Mouse Olfactory Bulb&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d4353e2c-4495-4f15-9153-3f35171fcf3e/cne25085-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We accomplished visualization and reconstruction of noradrenergic neurons projecting to the olfactory bulb (OB) by infection of adeno‐associated viruses into the locus coeruleus of DBH‐Cre mice. An individual noradrenergic axon traveled while forming several branches and was distributed in multiple glomeruli that were located in different areas of the glomerular layer in the OB.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olfactory input is processed in the glomerulus of the main olfactory bulb (OB) and relayed to higher centers in the brain by projection neurons. Conversely, centrifugal inputs from other brain regions project to the OB. We have previously analyzed centrifugal inputs into the OB from several brain regions using single‐neuron labeling. In this study, we analyzed the centrifugal noradrenergic (NA) fibers derived from the locus coeruleus (LC), because their projection pathways and synaptic connections in the OB have not been clarified in detail. We analyzed the NA centrifugal projections by single‐neuron labeling and immuno‐electron microscopy. Individual NA neurons labeled by viral infection were 3‐dimensionally traced using Neurolucida software to visualize the projection pathway from the LC to the OB. Also, centrifugal NA fibers were visualized using an antibody for noradrenaline transporter (NET). NET immunoreactive (‐ir) fibers contained many varicosities and synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, electron tomography demonstrated that NET‐ir fibers formed asymmetrical synapses of varied morphology. Although these synapses were present at varicosities, the density of synapses was relatively low throughout the OB. The maximal density of synapses was found in the external plexiform layer; about 17% of all observed varicosities contained synapses. These results strongly suggest that NA‐containing fibers in the OB release NA from both varicosities and synapses to influence the activities of OB neurons. The present study provides a morphological basis for olfactory modulation by centrifugal NA fibers derived from the LC.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Perfusion‐Dependent Cerebral Autoregulation Impairment in Hemispheric Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25963</guid>

	<description>Objective
Loss of cerebral autoregulation (CA) plays a key role in secondary neurologic injury. However, the regional distribution of CA impairment after acute cerebral injury remains unclear because, in clinical practice, CA is only assessed within a limited compartment. Here, we performed large‐scale regional mapping of cortical perfusion and CA in patients undergoing decompressive surgery for malignant hemispheric stroke.


Methods
In 24 patients, autoregulation over the affected hemisphere was calculated based on direct, 15 to 20‐minute cortical perfusion measurement with intraoperative laser speckle imaging and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) recording. Cortical perfusion was normalized against noninfarcted tissue and 6 perfusion categories from 0% to &amp;gt;100% were defined. The interaction between cortical perfusion and MAP was estimated using a linear random slope model and Pearson correlation.


Results
Cortical perfusion and CA impairment were heterogeneously distributed across the entire hemisphere. The degree of CA impairment was significantly greater in areas with critical hypoperfusion (40–60%: 0.42% per mmHg and 60–80%: 0.46% per mmHg) than in noninfarcted (&amp;gt; 100%: 0.22% per mmHg) or infarcted (0–20%: 0.29% per mmHg) areas (*p &amp;lt; 0.001). Pearson correlation confirmed greater CA impairment at critically reduced perfusion (20–40%: r = 0.67; 40–60%: r = 0.68; and 60–80%: r = 0.68) compared to perfusion &amp;gt; 100% (r = 0.36; *p &amp;lt; 0.05). Tissue integrity had no impact on the degree of CA impairment.


Interpretation
In hemispheric stroke, CA is impaired across the entire hemisphere to a variable extent. Autoregulation impairment was greatest in hypoperfused and potentially viable tissue, suggesting that precise localization of such regions is essential for effective tailoring of perfusion pressure‐based treatment strategies.

	<title>Hippocampus: Prolactin enhances hippocampal synaptic plasticity in female mice of reproductive age</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/10.1002/hipo.23288</guid>

	<description>Abstract
Dynamic signaling between the endocrine system (ES) and the nervous system (NS) is essential for brain and body homeostasis. In particular, reciprocal interaction occurs during pregnancy and motherhood that may involve changes in some brain plasticity processes. Prolactin (PRL), a hormone with pleiotropic effects on the NS, promotes maternal behavior and has been linked to modifications in brain circuits during motherhood; however, it is unclear whether PRL may regulate synaptic plasticity. Therefore, the main aim of the present work was to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms triggered by PRL that regulate synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. By analyzing extracellular recordings in CA3‐CA1 synapses of hippocampal slices, we report that PRL modifies short and long‐term synaptic plasticity in female mice of reproductive age, but not in sexually immature females or adult males. This effect is carried out through mechanisms that include participation of GABAA receptors and activation of the JAK2‐mediated signaling pathway. These findings show for the first time how PRL enhances the synaptic strength in hippocampal circuits and that this effect is sexually dimorphic, which would influence complex brain processes in physiological conditions like pregnancy and lactation.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Development and Validation of the Pediatric Charcot–Marie–Tooth Disease Quality of Life Outcome Measure</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25966</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25966?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) reduces health‐related quality of life (QOL), especially in children. Defining QOL in pediatric CMT can help physicians monitor disease burden clinically and in trials. We identified items pertaining to QOL in children with CMT and conducted validation studies to develop a pediatric CMT‐specific QOL outcome measure (pCMT‐QOL).


Methods
Development and validation of the pCMT‐QOL patient‐reported outcome measure were iterative, involving identifying relevant domains, item pool generation, prospective pilot testing and clinical assessments, structured focus‐group interviews, and psychometric testing. Testing was conducted in children with CMT seen at participating sites from the USA, United Kingdom, and Australia.


Results
We conducted systematic literature reviews and analysis of generic QOL measures to identify 6 domains relevant to QOL in children with CMT. Sixty items corresponding to those domains were developed de novo, or identified from literature review and CMT‐specific modification of items from the pediatric Neuro‐QOL measures. The draft version underwent prospective feasibility and face content validity assessments to develop a working version of the pCMT‐QOL measure. From 2010 to 2016, the pCMT‐QOL working version was administered to 398 children aged 8 to 18 years seen at the participating study sites of the Inherited Neuropathies Consortium. The resulting data underwent rigorous psychometric analysis, including factor analysis, test–retest reliability, internal consistency, convergent validity, item response theory analysis, and longitudinal analysis, to develop the final pCMT‐QOL patient‐reported outcome measure.


Interpretation
The pCMT‐QOL patient‐reported outcome measure is a reliable, valid, and sensitive measure of health‐related QOL for children with CMT. ANN NEUROL 2020</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Diagnostic Accuracy of Amyloid versus 18F‐Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography in Autopsy‐Confirmed Dementia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25968</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25968?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of antemortem 11C‐Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) and 18F‐fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) versus autopsy diagnosis in a heterogenous sample of patients.


Methods
One hundred one participants underwent PIB and FDG PET during life and neuropathological assessment. PET scans were visually interpreted by 3 raters blinded to clinical information. PIB PET was rated as positive or negative for cortical retention, whereas FDG scans were read as showing an Alzheimer disease (AD) or non‐AD pattern. Neuropathological diagnoses were assigned using research criteria. Majority visual reads were compared to intermediate–high AD neuropathological change (ADNC).


Results
One hundred one participants were included (mean age = 67.2 years, 41 females, Mini‐Mental State Examination = 21.9, PET‐to‐autopsy interval = 4.4 years). At autopsy, 32 patients showed primary AD, 56 showed non‐AD neuropathology (primarily frontotemporal lobar degeneration [FTLD]), and 13 showed mixed AD/FTLD pathology. PIB showed higher sensitivity than FDG for detecting intermediate–high ADNC (96%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 89–100% vs 80%, 95% CI = 68–92%, p = 0.02), but equivalent specificity (86%, 95% CI = 76–95% vs 84%, 95% CI = 74–93%, p = 0.80). In patients with congruent PIB and FDG reads (77/101), combined sensitivity was 97% (95% CI = 92–100%) and specificity was 98% (95% CI = 93–100%). Nine of 24 patients with incongruent reads were found to have co‐occurrence of AD and non‐AD pathologies.


Interpretation
In our sample enriched for younger onset cognitive impairment, PIB‐PET had higher sensitivity than FDG‐PET for intermediate–high ADNC, with similar specificity. When both modalities are congruent, sensitivity and specificity approach 100%, whereas mixed pathology should be considered when PIB and FDG are incongruent. ANN NEUROL 2020</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Quantitative Multi-Parameter Mapping Optimized for the Clinical Routine</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.611194</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Using quantitative multi-parameter mapping (MPM), studies can investigate clinically relevant microstructural changes with high reliability over time and across subjects and sites. However, long acquisition times (20 min for the standard 1-mm isotropic protocol) limit its translational potential. This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity gain of a fast 1.6-mm isotropic MPM protocol including post-processing optimized for longitudinal clinical studies. 6 healthy volunteers (35±7 years old; 3 female) were scanned at 3T to acquire the following whole-brain MPM maps with 1.6 mm isotropic resolution: proton density (PD), magnetization transfer saturation (MT), longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), and transverse relaxation rate (R2&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;). MPM maps were generated using two RF transmit field (B1+) correction methods: (1) using an acquired B1+ map and (2) using a data-driven approach. Maps were generated with and without Gibb's ringing correction. The intra-/inter-subject coefficient of variation (CoV) of all maps in the gray and white matter, as well as in all anatomical regions of a fine-grained brain atlas, were compared between the different post-processing methods using Student's t-test. The intra-subject stability of the 1.6-mm MPM protocol is 2–3 times higher than for the standard 1-mm sequence and can be achieved in less than half the scan duration. Intra-subject variability for all four maps in white matter ranged from 1.2–5.3% and in gray matter from 1.8 to 9.2%. Bias-field correction using an acquired B1+ map significantly improved intra-subject variability of PD and R1 in the gray (42%) and white matter (54%) and correcting the raw images for the effect of Gibb's ringing further improved intra-subject variability in all maps in the gray (11%) and white matter (10%). Combining Gibb's ringing correction and bias field correction using acquired B1+ maps provides excellent stability of the 7-min MPM sequence with 1.6 mm resolution suitable for the clinical routine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: A Protocol for Cortical Type Analysis of the Human Neocortex Applied on Histological Samples, the Atlas of Von Economo and Koskinas, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human cerebral cortex is parcellated in hundreds of areas using neuroanatomy and imaging methods. Alternatively, cortical areas can be classified into few cortical types according to their degree of laminar differentiation. Cortical type analysis is based on the gradual and systematic variation of laminar features observed across the entire cerebral cortex in Nissl stained sections and has profound implications for understanding fundamental aspects of evolution, development, connections, function, and pathology of the cerebral cortex. In this protocol paper, we explain the general principles of cortical type analysis and provide tables with the fundamental features of laminar structure that are studied for this analysis. We apply cortical type analysis to the micrographs of the Atlas of the human cerebral cortex of von Economo and Koskinas and provide tables and maps with the areas of this Atlas and their corresponding cortical type. Finally, we correlate the cortical type maps with the T1w/T2w ratio from widely used reference magnetic resonance imaging scans. The analysis, tables and maps of the human cerebral cortex shown in this protocol paper can be used to predict patterns of connections between areas according to the principles of the Structural Model and determine their level in cortical hierarchies. Cortical types can also predict the spreading of abnormal proteins in neurodegenerative diseases to the level of cortical layers. In summary, cortical type analysis provides a theoretical and practical framework for directed studies of connectivity, synaptic plasticity, and selective vulnerability to neurologic and psychiatric diseases in the human neocortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Early Dendritic Dystrophy in Human Brains With Primary Age-Related Tauopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.596894</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dystrophic neurites (DNs) are found in many neurological conditions such as traumatic brain injury and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) specifically, senile plaques containing silver-stained DNs were already described in the original literature defining this disease. These DNs could be both axonal and dendritic in origin, while axonal dystrophy relative to plaque formation has been more extensively studied. Here, we demonstrate an early occurrence of dendritic dystrophy in the hippocampal CA1 and subicular regions in human brains (n = 23) with primary age-related tauopathy (PART), with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) burden ranging from Braak stages I to III in the absence of cerebral β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition. In Bielschowsky’s silver stain, segmented fusiform swellings on the apical dendrites of hippocampal and subicular pyramidal neurons were observed in all the cases, primarily over the stratum radiatum (s.r.). The numbers of silver-stained neuronal somata and dendritic swellings counted over CA1 to subiculum were positively correlated among the cases. Swollen dendritic processes were also detected in sections immunolabeled for phosphorylated tau (pTau) and sortilin. In aged and AD brains with both Aβ and pTau pathologies, silver- and immunolabeled dystrophic-like dendritic profiles occurred around and within individual neuritic plaques. These findings implicate that dendritic dystrophy can occur among hippocampal pyramidal neurons in human brains with PART. Therefore, as with the case of axonal dystrophy reported in literature, dendritic dystrophy can develop prior to Alzheimer-type plaque and tangle formation in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Metabolic Disorder of Extracellular Matrix Mediated by Decorin Upregulation Is Associated With Brain Arteriovenous Malformation Diffuseness</title>

	<description>Background and Objective&lt;p&gt;Diffuse brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) are mixed up with normal brain parenchyma and therefore increase the difficulty of surgical resection, leading to poor surgical prognosis. Since the mechanism underlying BAVM diffuseness remains unknown, a quantitative proteomic analysis was performed to investigate the altered expression of proteins in diffuse BAVMs compared to compact ones.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We performed proteomic analysis on five diffuse BAVMs and five compact BAVMs. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to identify potential signals related to BAVM diffuseness. Candidate proteins were then investigated in BAVM specimens using immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Tube formation assays were used to investigate the effects of candidate proteins on the angiogenesis of human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). Finally, Masson, Sirius red staining, and immunofluorescence were used to evaluate the characteristics of extracellular matrix (ECM) in BAVM tissues.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A total of 58 proteins were found to be differentially expressed between diffuse and compact BAVMs via proteomic analysis. TGF-β (transforming growth factor-beta) signaling pathway, ECM–receptor pathway, relaxin signaling pathway, and several other pathways were associated with BAVM diffuseness. The TGF-β signaling pathway is associated with angiogenesis; the role of this pathway in the formation of diffuse BAVMs was investigated, and the decorin (DCN) upregulation played an important role in this process. Immunofluorescence showed that DCN was significantly upregulated within and around the malformed vessels of diffuse BAVMs. Functional assays showed that exogenous DCN could promote the tube formation ability of HUVECs through inhibiting the TGF-β signaling pathway and overproducing ECM. Histological staining demonstrated the overproduction of ECM in diffuse BAVMs.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;TGF-β signaling pathway inhibited by DCN in vascular endothelial cells is related to BAVM diffuseness. The metabolic disorder of ECM caused by DCN upregulation may significantly contribute to the formation of diffuse BAVMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Role of Chronic Inflammatory Bone and Joint Disorders in the Pathogenesis and Progression of Alzheimer's Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that causes significant cognitive debilitation in tens of millions of patients worldwide. Throughout disease progression, abnormal secretase activity results in the aberrant cleavage and subsequent aggregation of neurotoxic Aβ plaques in the cerebral extracellular space and hyperphosphorylation and destabilization of structural tau proteins surrounding neuronal microtubules. Both pathologies ultimately incite the propagation of a disease-associated subset of microglia—the principle immune cells of the brain—characterized by preferentially pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and inhibited AD substrate uptake capacity, which further contribute to neuronal degeneration. For decades, chronic neuroinflammation has been identified as one of the cardinal pathophysiological driving features of AD; however, despite a number of works postulating the underlying mechanisms of inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration, its pathogenesis and relation to the inception of cognitive impairment remain obscure. Moreover, the limited clinical success of treatments targeting specific pathological features in the central nervous system (CNS) illustrates the need to investigate alternative, more holistic approaches for ameliorating AD outcomes. Accumulating evidence suggests significant interplay between peripheral immune activity and blood-brain barrier permeability, microglial activation and proliferation, and AD-related cognitive decline. In this work, we review a narrow but significant subset of chronic peripheral inflammatory conditions, describe how these pathologies are associated with the preponderance of neuroinflammation, and posit that we may exploit peripheral immune processes to design interventional, preventative therapies for LOAD. We then provide a comprehensive overview of notable treatment paradigms that have demonstrated considerable merit toward treating these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Comprehensive map of visual projection neurons for processing ultraviolet information in the Drosophila brain</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Comprehensive map of visual projection neurons for processing ultraviolet information in the Drosophila brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3b2de9c0-6b43-480f-b54e-f121d2692725/cne25068-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insects use UV light as navigation signals to locate the position of the sun. In this study, we construct a comprehensive map of the downstream circuitry of UV‐sensing R7 neurons by analyzing large‐scale 3D neural data at the single‐neuron resolution in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. We find six families of visual projection neurons that connect the optic lobe to the central brain. Our imaging study reveals the morphological diversity of these visual projection neurons of the medulla layer 6 (M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) downstream circuitry suggests the multi‐dimensional processing of UV information via hierarchical, multiple‐layer, parallel, and bilateral circuits in the brain. Furthermore, we describe a detailed neuroanatomical description of the lateral anterior optic tubercle (L‐AOTU) and the bulb (BU).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain perceives visual information and controls behavior depending on its underlying neural circuits. How UV information is represented and processed in the brain remains poorly understood. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, UV light is detected by the R7 photoreceptor that projects exclusively into the medulla layer 6 (M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). Herein, we imaged 28,768 single neurons and identified 238 visual projection neurons linking M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to the central brain. Based on morphology and connectivity, these visual projection neurons were systematically classified into 94 cell types belonging to 12 families. Three tracts connected M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in each optic lobe to the central brain: One dorsal tract linking to the ipsilateral lateral anterior optic tubercle (L‐AOTU) and two medial tracts linking to the ipsilateral ventral medial protocerebrum (VMP) and the contralateral VMP. The M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; information was primarily represented in the L‐AOTU. Each L‐AOTU consisted of four columns that each contained three glomeruli. Each L‐AOTU glomerulus received inputs from M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; subdomains and gave outputs to a glomerulus within the ellipsoid body dendritic region, suggesting specific processing of spatial information through the dorsal pathway. Furthermore, the middle columns of the L‐AOTUs of both hemispheres were connected via the intertubercle tract, suggesting information integration between the two eyes. In contrast, an ascending neuron linked each VMP to all glomeruli in the bulb and the L‐AOTU, bilaterally, suggesting general processing of information through the ventral pathway. Altogether, these diverse morphologies of the visual projection neurons suggested multi‐dimensional processing of UV information through parallel and bilateral circuits in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Functional, molecular and morphological heterogeneity of superficial interneurons in the larval zebrafish tectum</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superficial interneurons, SINs, of the zebrafish tectum, have been implicated in a range of visual functions, including size discrimination, directional selectivity and looming‐evoked escape. This raises the question if SIN subpopulations, despite their morphological similarities and shared anatomical position in the retinotectal processing stream, carry out diverse, task‐specific functions in visual processing, or if they have simple tuning properties in common. Here we have further characterized the SINs through functional imaging, electrophysiological recordings and neurotransmitter typing in two transgenic lines, the widely used Gal4s1156t and the recently reported LCRRH2‐RH2‐2:GFP. We found that about a third of the SINs strongly responded to changes in whole‐field light levels, with a strong preference for OFF over ON stimuli. Interestingly, individual SINs were selectively tuned to a diverse range of narrow luminance decrements. Overall responses to whole‐field luminance steps did not vary with the position of the SIN cell body along the depth of the tectal neuropil or with the orientation of its neurites. We ruled out the possibility that intrinsic photosensitivity of Gal4s1156t+ SINs contribute to the measured visual responses. We found that, while most SINs express GABAergic markers, a substantial minority express an excitatory neuronal marker, the vesicular glutamate transporter, expanding the possible roles of SIN function in the tectal circuitry. In conclusion, SINs represent a molecularly, morphologically and functionally heterogeneous class of interneurons, with subpopulations that detect a range of specific visual features, to which we have now added narrow luminance decrements.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Activation of TRPV4 inhibited IK through activating CaMKII in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and decreased the expression of Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 in hippocampi.

TRPV4‐induced decrease of Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 expression and IK may be involved in the pathological changes following PISE.










Abstract
Activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) can increase hippocampal neuronal excitability. TRPV4 has been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Voltage‐gated potassium channels (VGPCs) play an important role in regulating neuronal excitability and abnormal VGPCs expression or function is related to epilepsy. Here, we examined the effect of TRPV4 activation on the delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and on the Kv subunits expression in male mice. We also explored the role of TRPV4 in changes in Kv subunits expression in male mice following pilocarpine‐induced status epilepticus (PISE). Application of TRPV4 agonists, GSK1016790A and 5,6‐EET, markedly reduced IK in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and shifted the voltage‐dependent inactivation curve to the hyperpolarizing direction. GSK1016790A‐ and 5,6‐EET‐induced inhibition of IK was blocked by TRPV4 specific antagonists, HC‐067047 and RN1734. GSK1016790A‐induced inhibition of IK was markedly attenuated by calcium/calmodulin‐dependent kinase II (CaMKII) antagonist. Application of GSK1016790A for up to 1 hr did not change the hippocampal protein levels of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, or Kv2.1. Intracerebroventricular injection of GSK1016790A for 3 d reduced the hippocampal protein levels of Kv1.2 and Kv2.1, leaving that of Kv1.1 unchanged. Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 protein levels as well as IK reduced markedly in hippocampi on day 3 post PISE, which was significantly reversed by HC‐067047. We conclude that activation of TRPV4 inhibits IK in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, possibly by activating CaMKII. TRPV4‐induced decrease in Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 expression and IK may be involved in the pathological changes following PISE.</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We investigated whether Early Posterior Negativity (EPN) indicated the subjective dilation of time when judging the duration of arousing stimuli. Participants performed a visual temporal bisection task along with high-level and low-level arousing auditory stimuli, while we simultaneously recorded EEG. In accordance with previous studies, arousing stimuli were temporally overestimated and led to higher EPN amplitude. Yet, we observed that time dilation and EPN amplitude were significantly correlated and this effect cannot be explained by confounds from stimulus valence. We interpret our findings in terms of the pacemaker–accumulator model of human timing, and suggest that EPN indicates an arousal-based increasing of the speed of our mental clock.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Integrated into their bacterial hosts’ genomes, prophage sequences exhibit a wide diversity of length and gene content, from highly degraded cryptic sequences to intact, functional prophages that retain a full complement of lytic-function genes. We apply three approaches—bioinformatics, analytical modelling and computational simulation—to understand the diverse gene content of prophages. In the bioinformatics work, we examine the distributions of over 50,000 annotated prophage genes identified in 1384 prophage sequences, comparing the gene repertoires of intact and incomplete prophages. These data indicate that genes involved in the replication, packaging, and release of phage particles have been preferentially lost in incomplete prophages, while tail fiber, transposase and integrase genes are significantly enriched. Consistent with these results, our mathematical and computational approaches predict that genes involved in phage lytic function are preferentially lost, resulting in shorter prophages that often retain genes that benefit the host. Informed by these models, we offer novel hypotheses for the enrichment of integrase and transposase genes in cryptic prophages. Overall, we demonstrate that functional and cryptic prophages represent a diversity of genetic sequences that evolve along a parasitism-mutualism continuum.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/36v3ylChupQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Infectious disease surveillance systems provide vital data for guiding disease prevention and control policies, yet the formalization of methods to optimize surveillance networks has largely been overlooked. Decisions surrounding surveillance design parameters—such as the number and placement of surveillance sites, target populations, and case definitions—are often determined by expert opinion or deference to operational considerations, without formal analysis of the influence of design parameters on surveillance objectives. Here we propose a simulation framework to guide evidence-based surveillance network design to better achieve specific surveillance goals with limited resources. We define evidence-based surveillance design as an optimization problem, acknowledging the many operational constraints under which surveillance systems operate, the many dimensions of surveillance system design, the multiple and competing goals of surveillance, and the complex and dynamic nature of disease systems. We describe an analytical framework—the Disease Surveillance Informatics Optimization and Simulation (DIOS) framework—for the identification of optimal surveillance designs through mathematical representations of disease and surveillance processes, definition of objective functions, and numerical optimization. We then apply the framework to the problem of selecting candidate sites to expand an existing surveillance network under alternative objectives of: (1) improving spatial prediction of disease prevalence at unmonitored sites; or (2) estimating the observed effect of a risk factor on disease. Results of this demonstration illustrate how optimal designs are sensitive to both surveillance goals and the underlying spatial pattern of the target disease. The findings affirm the value of designing surveillance systems through quantitative and adaptive analysis of network characteristics and performance. The framework can be applied to the design of surveillance systems tailored to setting-specific disease transmission dynamics and surveillance needs, and can yield improved understanding of tradeoffs between network architectures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MDSl_12VOh4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Control of filament length by a depolymerizing gradient</title>

Cells assemble microns-long filamentous structures from protein monomers that are nanometers in size. These structures are often highly dynamic, yet in order for them to function properly, cells maintain them at a precise length. Here we investigate length-dependent depolymerization as a mechanism of length control. This mechanism has been recently proposed for flagellar length control in the single cell organisms Chlamydomonas and Giardia. Length dependent depolymerization can arise from a concentration gradient of a depolymerizing protein, such as kinesin-13 in Giardia, along the length of the flagellum. Two possible scenarios are considered: a linear and an exponential gradient of depolymerizing proteins. We compute analytically the probability distributions of filament lengths for both scenarios and show how these distributions are controlled by key biochemical parameters through a dimensionless number that we identify. In Chlamydomonas cells, the assembly dynamics of its two flagella are coupled via a shared pool of molecular components that are in limited supply, and so we investigate the effect of a limiting monomer pool on the length distributions. Finally, we compare our calculations to experiments. While the computed mean lengths are consistent with observations, the noise is two orders of magnitude smaller than the observed length fluctuations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/41N23r0QzBk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

GC skew is a phenomenon observed in many bacterial genomes, wherein the two replication strands of the same chromosome contain different proportions of guanine and cytosine nucleotides. Here we demonstrate that this phenomenon, which was first discovered in the mid-1990s, can be used today as an analysis tool for the 15,000+ complete bacterial genomes in NCBI’s Refseq library. In order to analyze all 15,000+ genomes, we introduce a new method, SkewIT (Skew Index Test), that calculates a single metric representing the degree of GC skew for a genome. Using this metric, we demonstrate how GC skew patterns are conserved within certain bacterial phyla, e.g. Firmicutes, but show different patterns in other phylogenetic groups such as Actinobacteria. We also discovered that outlier values of SkewIT highlight potential bacterial mis-assemblies. Using our newly defined metric, we identify multiple mis-assembled chromosomal sequences in previously published complete bacterial genomes. We provide a SkewIT web app https://jenniferlu717.shinyapps.io/SkewIT/ that calculates SkewI for any user-provided bacterial sequence. The web app also provides an interactive interface for the data generated in this paper, allowing users to further investigate the SkewI values and thresholds of the Refseq-97 complete bacterial genomes. Individual scripts for analysis of bacterial genomes are provided in the following repository: https://github.com/jenniferlu717/SkewIT.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bj6bsqIaDCQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Bacteria use protein-protein interactions to infect their hosts and hijack fundamental pathways, which ensures their survival and proliferation. Hence, the infectious capacity of the pathogen is closely related to its ability to interact with host proteins. Here, we show that hubs in the host-pathogen interactome are isolated in the pathogen network by adapting the geometry of the interacting interfaces. An imperfect mimicry of the eukaryotic interfaces allows pathogen proteins to actively bind to the host’s target while preventing deleterious effects on the pathogen interactome. Understanding how bacteria recognize eukaryotic proteins may pave the way for the rational design of new antibiotic molecules.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cLM7oZ8muM4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Metabolic networks undergo gene expression regulation in response to external nutrient signals. In microbes, the synthesis of enzymes that are used to transport and catabolize less preferred carbon sources is repressed in the presence of a preferred carbon source. For most microbes, glucose is a preferred carbon source, and it has long been believed that as long as glucose is present in the environment, the expression of genes related to the metabolism of alternative carbon sources is shut down, due to catabolite repression. However, recent studies have shown that the induction of the galactose (GAL) metabolic network does not solely depend on the exhaustion of glucose. Instead, the GAL genes respond to the external concentration ratio of galactose to glucose, a phenomenon of unknown mechanism that we termed ratio-sensing. Using mathematical modeling, we found that ratio-sensing is a general phenomenon that can arise from competition between two carbon sources for shared transporters, between transcription factors for binding to communal regulatory sequences of the target genes, or a combination of the aforementioned two levels of competition. We analyzed how the parameters describing the competitive interaction influenced ratio-sensing behaviors in each scenario and found that the concatenation of both layers of signal integration could expand the dynamical range of ratio-sensing. Finally, we investigated the influence of circuit topology on ratio-sensing and found that incorporating negative auto-regulation and/or coherent feedforward loop motifs to the basic signal integration unit could tune the sensitivity of the response to the external nutrient signals. Our study not only deepened our understanding of how ratio-sensing is achieved in yeast GAL metabolic regulation, but also elucidated design principles for ratio-sensing signal processing that can be used in other biological settings, such as being introduced into circuit designs for synthetic biology applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kKsLHVVuvdM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Loss of hepatic aldolase B activates Akt and promotes hepatocellular carcinogenesis by destabilizing the Aldob/Akt/PP2A protein complex</title>

Loss of hepatic fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase B (Aldob) leads to a paradoxical up-regulation of glucose metabolism to favor hepatocellular carcinogenesis (HCC), but the upstream signaling events remain poorly defined. Akt is highly activated in HCC, and targeting Akt is being explored as a potential therapy for HCC. Herein, we demonstrate that Aldob suppresses Akt activity and tumor growth through a protein complex containing Aldob, Akt, and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), leading to inhibition of cell viability, cell cycle progression, glucose uptake, and metabolism. Interestingly, Aldob directly interacts with phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and promotes the recruitment of PP2A to dephosphorylate p-Akt, and this scaffolding effect of Aldob is independent of its enzymatic activity. Loss of Aldob or disruption of Aldob/Akt interaction in Aldob R304A mutant restores Akt activity and tumor-promoting effects. Consistently, Aldob and p-Akt expression are inversely correlated in human HCC tissues, and Aldob down-regulation coupled with p-Akt up-regulation predicts a poor prognosis for HCC. We have further discovered that Akt inhibition or a specific small-molecule activator of PP2A (SMAP) efficiently attenuates HCC tumorigenesis in xenograft mouse models. Our work reveals a novel nonenzymatic role of Aldob in negative regulation of Akt activation, suggesting that directly inhibiting Akt activity or through reactivating PP2A may be a potential therapeutic approach for HCC treatment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6LXKvgNqrUI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: The effects of hippocampal and area parahippocampalis lesions on the processing and retention of serial‐order behavior, autoshaping, and spatial behavior in pigeons</title>

	<description>Abstract
We examined the role of the avian hippocampus and area parahippocampalis in serial‐order behavior and a variety of other tasks known to be sensitive to hippocampal damage in mammals. Damage to the hippocampus and area parahippocampalis caused impairments in autoshaping and performance on an analogue of a radial‐arm maze task, but had no effect on acquisition of 2‐item, 3‐item, and 4‐item serial‐order lists. Additionally, the lesions had no effect on the retention of 3‐items lists, or on the ability to perform novel derived lists composed of elements from lists they had previously learned. The impairments in autoshaping and spatial behavior are consistent with the findings in mammals. The absence of impairments on the serial‐order task may also be consistent once one considers that damage to the hippocampus in mammals seems to affect more internally‐organized rather than externally‐organized serial‐order tasks. Together, the findings support the view that the avian hippocampal complex serves a function very similar to the mammalian hippocampus, a finding that is interesting given that the architecture of the avian hippocampus differs dramatically from that of the mammalian hippocampus.</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Novel inhibitory brainstem neurons with selective projections to spinal lamina I reduces both pain and itch&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a70f3e40-ca05-4820-a28a-023dd6bbd7f5/cne25076-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a novel population of inhibitory prodynorphin neurons in the brainstem which we named LJA5. LJA5 neurons selectively target lamina I of the spinal cord, and other sensory nuclei including the lateral parabrachial and periaqueductal gray. Activation of LJA5 neurons reduces pain and itch.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensory information is transmitted from peripheral nerves, through the spinal cord, and up to the brain (“bottom up” pathway). Some of this information may be modulated by “top‐down” projections from the brain to the spinal cord. Discovering endogenous mechanisms for reducing pain and itch holds enormous potential for developing new treatments. However, neurons mediating the top‐down inhibition of pain are not well understood, nor has any such pathway been identified for itch sensation. Here, we identify a novel population of GABAergic neurons in the ventral brainstem, distinguished by prodynorphin expression, which we named LJA5. LJA5 neurons provide the only known inhibitory projection specifically to lamina I of the spinal cord, which contains sensory neurons that transmit pain and itch information up to the brain. Chemogenetically activating LJA5 neurons in male mice reduces capsaicin‐induced pain and histamine‐induced itch. Identifying this new pathway opens new treatment opportunities for chronic, refractory pain, and pruritis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objective
To use childhood cancer survivors as a novel model to study whether children who experience central nervous system (CNS) injury are at higher risk for neurocognitive impairment associated with subsequent late onset chronic health conditions (CHC).


Methods
Adult survivors of childhood cancer (n=2,859, ≥10 years from diagnosis, ≥18 years old) completed a comprehensive neurocognitive battery and clinical exam. Neurocognitive impairment was defined as age‐adjusted Z‐score &amp;lt;10th percentile. Participants impaired on ≥3 tests had global impairment. CHC were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.3 (grade 1:mild, 2:moderate, 3:severe/disabling), 4:life‐threatening), and were combined into a severity/burden score by frequency and grade (none/low, medium, high, and very high). 1,598 survivors received CNS directed therapy including cranial radiation, intrathecal methotrexate, or neurosurgery. Logistic regression estimated the odds of neurocognitive impairment associated with severity/burden score and grade 2‐4 conditions, stratified by CNS treatment.


Results
CNS‐treated survivors performed worse than non‐CNS‐treated survivors on all neurocognitive tests and were more likely to have global neurocognitive impairment (46.9% vs 35.3%, p&amp;lt;0.001). After adjusting for demographic and treatment factors, there was a dose‐response association between severity/burden score and global neurocognitive impairment, but only among CNS‐treated survivors (high OR=2.24, 95%CI 1.42‐3.53; very high OR=4.07, 95%CI 2.30‐7.17). Cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions were associated with processing speed, executive function, and memory impairments in CNS‐treated but not non‐CNS‐treated survivors, who were impacted by neurologic conditions.


Interpretation
Reduced cognitive/brain reserve associated with CNS‐directed therapy during childhood may make survivors vulnerable to adverse cognitive effects of cardiopulmonary conditions during adulthood.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Lewy body disease is a contributor to logopenic progressive aphasia phenotype</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25979</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25979?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
To describe clinical features, [18F]‐fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)‐PET metabolism and digital pathology in patients with logopenic progressive aphasia and pathologic diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease (LPA‐DLBD) and compare to LPA patients with other pathologies, as well as patients with classical features of probable dementia with Lewy bodies (pDLB).


Methods
This is a clinico‐pathologic case‐control study of 45 patients, including 20 prospectively recruited LPA patients among whom six with LPA‐DLBD. We analyze clinical features and compare FDG‐PET metabolism in LPA‐DLBD to an independent group of clinical pDLB patients and regional α‐synuclein burden on digital pathology to a second independent group of autopsied patients with DLBD pathology and ante mortem pDLB (DLB‐DLBD).


Results
All LPA‐DLBD patients were men. Neurological, speech and neuropsychological characteristics were similar across LPA‐DLBD, LPA‐Alzheimer disease (LPA‐AD) and LPA‐ frontotemporal lobar degeneration (LPA‐FTLD). Genetic screening of AD, DLBD and FTLD linked genes were negative. Seventy‐five percent of LPA‐DLBD patients showed a parietal‐dominant pattern of hypometabolism; LPA‐FTLD – temporal‐dominant pattern whereas LPA‐AD showed heterogeneous patterns of hypometabolism. LPA‐DLBD had more asymmetrical hypometabolism affecting frontal lobes, with relatively spared occipital lobe in the non‐dominantly affected hemisphere, compared to pDLB. LPA‐DLBD had minimal atrophy on gross brain examination, higher cortical Lewy body counts and higher α‐synuclein burden in middle frontal and inferior parietal cortices compared to DLB‐DLBD.


Interpretation
Whereas AD is the most frequent underlying pathology of LPA, DLBD can also be present and may contribute to the LPA phenotype possibly due to α‐synuclein‐associated functional impairment of the dominant parietal lobe.

	<description>Objectives
Gut microbiome alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been reported repeatedly, but their functional relevance remains unclear. Fecal metabolomics, which provide a functional readout of microbial activity, have scarcely been investigated. We investigated fecal microbiome and metabolome alterations in PD, and their clinical relevance.


Methods
Two‐hundred subjects (104 patients, 96 controls) underwent extensive clinical phenotyping. Stool samples were analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Fecal metabolomics were performed using two platforms, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry.


Results
Fecal microbiome and metabolome composition in PD were significantly different vs. controls, with the largest effect size seen in NMR‐based metabolome. Microbiome and NMR‐based metabolome compositional differences remained significant after comprehensive confounder analyses. Differentially abundant fecal metabolite features and predicted functional changes in PD vs. controls included bioactive molecules with putative neuroprotective effects (e.g., short chain fatty acids [SCFAs], ubiquinones, and salicylate), and other compounds increasingly implicated in neurodegeneration (e.g., ceramides, sphingosine, and trimethylamine N‐oxide). In the PD group, cognitive impairment, low body mass index (BMI), frailty, constipation, and low physical activity were associated with fecal metabolome compositional differences. Notably, low SCFAs in PD were significantly associated with poorer cognition and low BMI. Lower butyrate levels correlated with worse postural instability‐gait disorder scores.


Interpretation
Gut microbial function is altered in PD, characterized by differentially abundant metabolic features that provide important biological insights into gut‐brain pathophysiology. Their clinical relevance further supports a role for microbial‐metabolites as potential targets for the development of new biomarkers and therapies in PD.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Subtype diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease with diffusion MRI</title>

	<description>Objective
Sporadic Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease (sCJD) comprises several subtypes as defined by genetic and prion protein characteristics, which are associated with distinct clinical and pathological phenotypes. To date, no clinical test can reliably diagnose the subtype. We established two procedures for the antemortem diagnosis of sCJD subtype using diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).


Methods
MRI of 1458 patients referred to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center were collected through its consultation service. One neuroradiologist blind to the diagnosis scored 12 brain regions and generated a lesion profile. We selected 487 patients with autopsy‐confirmed diagnosis of “pure” sCJD subtype and at least one positive diffusion MRI examination.
We designed and tested two data‐driven procedures for subtype diagnosis: the first procedure —“Prion Subtype Classification Algorithm with MRI” (PriSCA_MRI)— uses only MRI examinations; the second —“PriSCA_MRI+Gen”— includes knowledge of the prion protein codon 129 genotype, a major determinant of sCJD subtypes. Both procedures were tested on first and the last MRI follow‐up.


Results
PriSCA_MRI classified the three most prevalent subtypes with 82% accuracy. PriSCA_MRI+Gen raised the accuracy to 89% and identified all subtypes. Individually, the two most prevalent sCJD subtypes, MM1 and VV2, were diagnosed with both procedures with accuracies up to 95% and 97%, respectively. The performances of both procedures did not change in 168 patients with longitudinal MRI studies when the last examination was used.


Interpretation
This study provides the first practical algorithms for antemortem diagnosis of sCJD subtypes. MRI diagnosis of subtype is likely to be attainable at early disease stages to prognosticate clinical course and design future therapeutic trials.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Graph theory analysis of the dopamine D2 receptor network in Parkinson’s disease patients with cognitive decline</title>

	<description>Graph theory analysis can be used to detect subtle changes in brain networks that may be missed by regional comparisons. The present study found evidence that compensatory network reorganization likely occurs in a frontal dopamine D2 receptor network to preserve cognitive function in Parkinson's disease patients without cognitive impairment. 

Abstract
Cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common sequela of the disorder that has a large impact on patient well‐being. Its physiological etiology, however, remains elusive. Our study used graph theory analysis to investigate the large‐scale topological patterns of the extrastriatal dopamine D2 receptor network. We used positron emission tomography with [11C]FLB‐457 to measure the binding potential of cortical dopamine D2 receptors in two networks: the meso‐cortical dopamine network and the meso‐limbic dopamine network. We also investigated the application of partial volume effect correction (PVEC) in conjunction with graph theory analysis. Three groups were investigated in this study divided according to their cognitive status as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score, with a score ≤25 considered cognitively impaired: (a) healthy controls (n = 13, 11 female), (b) cognitively unimpaired PD patients (PD‐CU, n = 13, 5 female), and (c) PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD‐MCI, n = 17, 4 female). In the meso‐cortical network, we observed increased small‐worldness, normalized clustering, and local efficiency in the PD‐CU group compared to the PD‐MCI group, as well as a hub shift in the PD‐MCI group. Compensatory reorganization of the meso‐cortical dopamine D2 receptor network may be responsible for some of the cognitive preservation observed in PD‐CU. These results were found without PVEC applied and PVEC proved detrimental to the graph theory analysis. Overall, our findings demonstrate how graph theory analysis can be used to detect subtle changes in the brain that would otherwise be missed by regional comparisons of receptor density.</description>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A reliable measure of PSP-specific midbrain atrophy, the midbrain-to-pons ratio (MTPR) has been reported to support the differential diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) from idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD). Since longitudinal analyses are lacking so far, the present study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of the relative change of MTPR (relΔt_MTPR) over a 1-year period in patients with PSP, IPD, and healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Midsagittal individual MRIs of patients with PSP (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 15), IPD (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 15), and healthy controls (HC; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 15) were assessed and the MTPR at baseline and after 1 year were defined. The diagnostic accuracy of the MTPR and its relative change were evaluated using ROC curve analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSP-patients had a significantly lower MTPR at baseline (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; = 0.45 ± 0.06), compared to both non-PSP groups (F (2, 41) = 62.82, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), with an overall predictive accuracy of 95.6% for an MTPR ≤ 0.54. PSP-patients also presented a significantly stronger 1-year decline in MTPR compared to IPD (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Though predictive accuracy of relΔ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;_MTPR for PSP (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; = − 4.74% ± 4.48) from IPD (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; =  + 1.29 ± 3.77) was good (76.6%), ROC analysis did not reveal a significant improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining the MTPR and relΔ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;_MTPR (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.670). Still, specificity for PSP increased, though not significantly (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.500).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The present results indicate that the relΔ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;_MTPR is a potentially useful tool to support the differential diagnosis of PSP from IPD. For its relative 1-year change, still, more evaluation is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Systemic inflammation may be implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Since PD occurs usually in later life, most studies of causal factors are conducted in older populations, so potentially important influences from early life cannot be adequately captured. We investigated whether the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in early adulthood is associated with the subsequent development of PD in men. As part of Swedish national conscription testing conducted from 1968 through 1983 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 716,550), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, as a measure of inflammation, was measured in 659,278 young men. The cohort was observed for subsequent PD events (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 1513) through December 2016. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CI with adjustment for potential confounders. Individuals with higher ESRs were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with PD, as ESR was linearly and inversely associated with PD risk. The magnitude of the association between ESR and PD risk was similar for increases up to 15 mm/h, leveled off thereafter, and was non-significant for ESR values &amp;gt; 20 mm/h. The HR for PD with basic adjustments (age at conscription, year of conscription, test center and erythrocyte volume fraction) was 0.94 (95% CI 0.89–0.99, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02) per log&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increase in ESR, corresponding to a two-fold increase in ESR. Further adjustments for potential confounders (parental education, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and IQ) scarcely altered the HR. The results suggest a prospective association between high ESR and reduced risk for PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Gene Therapy Vector Encoding Neuropeptide Y and Its Receptor Y2 for Future Treatment of Epilepsy: Preclinical Data in Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gene therapy to treat pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy in humans is now being developed using an AAV vector (CG01) that encodes the combination of neuropeptide Y and its antiepileptic receptor Y2. With this in mind, the present study aimed to provide important preclinical data on the effects of CG01 on the duration of transgene expression, cellular tropism, and potential side effects on body weight and cognitive function. The CG01 vector was administered unilaterally into the dorsal and ventral hippocampus of adult male rats and expression of both transgenes was found to remain elevated without a sign of decline at 6 months post-injection. CG01 appeared to mediate expression selectively in hippocampal neurons, without expression in astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. No effects were seen on body weight as well as on short- or long-term memory as revealed by testing in the Y-maze or Morris water maze tests. Thus these data show that unilateral CG01 vector treatment as future gene therapy in pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy patients should result in stable and long-term expression predominantly in neurons and be well tolerated without side effects on body weight and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most common forms of peripheral neuropathy, and its incidence has been increasing. Mounting evidence has shown that patients with DPN have been associated with widespread alterations in the structure, function and connectivity of the brain, suggesting possible alterations in large-scale brain networks. Using structural covariance networks as well as advanced graph-theory-based computational approaches, we investigated the topological abnormalities of large-scale brain networks for a relatively large sample of patients with DPN (N = 67) compared to matched healthy controls (HCs; N = 88). Compared with HCs, the structural covariance networks of patients with DPN showed an increased characteristic path length, clustering coefficient, sigma, transitivity, and modularity, suggestive of inefficient global integration and increased local segregation. These findings may improve our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying alterations in the central nervous system of patients with DPN from the perspective of large-scale structural brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Evaluation of Synergy Extrapolation for Predicting Unmeasured Muscle Excitations from Measured Muscle Synergies</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electromyography (EMG)-driven musculoskeletal modeling relies on high-quality measurements of muscle electrical activity to estimate muscle forces. However, a critical challenge for practical deployment of this approach is missing EMG data from muscles that contribute substantially to joint moments. This situation may arise due to either the inability to measure deep muscles with surface electrodes or the lack of a sufficient number of EMG channels. Muscle synergy analysis (MSA) is a dimensionality reduction approach that decomposes a large number of muscle excitations into a small number of time-varying synergy excitations along with time-invariant synergy weights that define the contribution of each synergy excitation to all muscle excitations. This study evaluates how well missing muscle excitations can be predicted using synergy excitations extracted from muscles with available EMG data (henceforth called “synergy extrapolation” or SynX). The method was evaluated using a gait data set collected from a stroke survivor walking on an instrumented treadmill at self-selected and fastest-comfortable speeds. The evaluation process started with full calibration of a lower-body EMG-driven model using 16 measured EMG channels (collected using surface and fine wire electrodes) per leg. One fine wire EMG channel (either iliopsoas or adductor longus) was then treated as unmeasured. The synergy weights associated with the unmeasured muscle excitation were predicted by solving a nonlinear optimization problem where the errors between inverse dynamics and EMG-driven joint moments were minimized. The prediction process was performed for different synergy analysis algorithms (principal component analysis and non-negative matrix factorization), EMG normalization methods, and numbers of synergies. SynX performance was most influenced by the choice of synergy analysis algorithm and number of synergies. Principal component analysis with five or six synergies consistently predicted unmeasured muscle excitations the most accurately and with the greatest robustness to EMG normalization method. Furthermore, the associated joint moment matching accuracy was comparable to that produced by initial EMG-driven model calibration using all 16 EMG channels per leg. SynX may facilitate the assessment of human neuromuscular control and biomechanics when important EMG signals are missing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Neural Generators Underlying Temporal Envelope Processing Show Altered Responses and Hemispheric Asymmetry Across Age</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Speech understanding problems are highly prevalent in the aging population, even when hearing sensitivity is clinically normal. These difficulties are attributed to changes in central temporal processing with age and can potentially be captured by age-related changes in neural generators. The aim of this study is to investigate age-related changes in a wide range of neural generators during temporal processing in middle-aged and older persons with normal audiometric thresholds. A minimum-norm imaging technique is employed to reconstruct cortical and subcortical neural generators of temporal processing for different acoustic modulations. The results indicate that for relatively slow modulations (&amp;lt;50 Hz), the response strength of neural sources is higher in older adults than in younger ones, while the phase-locking does not change. For faster modulations (80 Hz), both the response strength and the phase-locking of neural sources are reduced in older adults compared to younger ones. These age-related changes in temporal envelope processing of slow and fast acoustic modulations are possibly due to loss of functional inhibition, which is accompanied by aging. Both cortical (primary and non-primary) and subcortical neural generators demonstrate similar age-related changes in response strength and phase-locking. Hemispheric asymmetry is also altered in older adults compared to younger ones. Alterations depend on the modulation frequency and side of stimulation. The current findings at source level could have important implications for the understanding of age-related changes in auditory temporal processing and for developing advanced rehabilitation strategies to address speech understanding difficulties in the aging population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Acupuncture Treatment Reduces Incidence of Parkinson's Disease in Patients With Depression: A Population-Based Retrospective Cohort Study in Taiwan</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Depression is a risk factor for subsequent Parkinson's disease (PD). Some patients with depression undergo acupuncture treatment because of other diseases in Taiwan. Therefore, the present study used data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to investigate the incidence of PD in patients having depression with and without acupuncture treatment. We conducted a retrospective study of a matched cohort of 48,981 patients with newly diagnosed depression between 2000 and 2012 who were selected from the NHIRD. The 1:1 propensity score method was utilized to match an equal number of patients (N = 9,189) in the acupuncture and non-acupuncture cohorts. We employed Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the risk of PD. The cumulative incidence of PD in both cohorts was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method, and the difference was examined through a log-rank test. Patients with depression who received acupuncture treatment demonstrated a lower risk of PD [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.39, 95% confidence interval = 0.31–0.49] than those who did not undergo acupuncture treatment, after adjusting for age, sex, insurance amount, geographic region, urbanization levels, comorbidities, and drugs. The cumulative incidence of PD was significantly lower in the acupuncture cohort than in the non-acupuncture cohort (log-rank test, p &amp;lt; 0.001). The database did not indicate the severity of depression and acupoints. The results suggest that acupuncture treatment significantly reduced the development of PD in patients with depression; however, a future study should be conducted to provide more objective evidence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Endocannabinoids regulate cerebellar GABAergic transmission in a synapse type‐dependent manner</title>

	<description>Endocannabinoids (eCBs) elicit inhibitory modulation of synaptic transmission at various brain sites. We now show that neither a CB1/CB2 receptor agonist WIN55212 nor an eCB affect GABA release from axon terminals of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) making synaptic contacts with their target neurons, globular cells in the cerebellar cortex and principal neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei. The finding is in sharp contrast to the fact that PCs receive abundant excitatory and inhibitory inputs that are under eCB‐mediated presynaptic modulation, suggesting that the synapse type‐selective action of eCBs in the cerebellar neural circuitry allows the precise control of motor coordination and learning associated with the cerebellum.

Abstract
Endocannabinoids (eCBs) act as ubiquitous modulators of synaptic transmission via the activation of cannabinoid receptors (CBRs). Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) make strong inhibitory synaptic contacts not only with neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) but also with Lugaro cells and globular cells, whose cell bodies are located underneath the PC layer. However, little is known about the modulatory actions of eCBs on GABA release from PC axon terminals. Here, we examined the effects of eCBs on the GABAergic transmission at PC‐globular cell synapses and PC‐large DCN neuron synapses electrophysiologically using mouse cerebellar slices. We showed that the types 1 and 2 CBR agonist WIN55212 did not affect either spontaneous or miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in globular cells under control conditions and in a state of enhanced synaptic activity. By contrast, another Gi/o protein‐coupled receptor agonist, baclofen, significantly reduced the miniature IPSC frequency in globular cells. WIN55212 had no effects on IPSCs in large DCN neurons. A type 2 CBR agonist, HU308, also had no effects on IPSCs in either globular cells or large DCN neurons. Moreover, the PCs' target neurons did not elicit depolarization‐induced suppression of inhibition. These results suggest the lack of a functional role of CBRs at PCs' axon terminals. This is in sharp contrast to the fact that PCs receive abundant excitatory and inhibitory inputs that are under eCB‐mediated presynaptic inhibitory modulation. The actions of eCBs are selective to distinct synapses and possibly contribute to information processes and rigorous signal transmission in the cerebellum.</description>

	<description>We find that the levels of the m6A methylase Mettl3 are upregulated following spinal cord injury (SCI) in both zebrafish and mice. Additionally, Mettl3 disruption leads to poor motor function recovery in zebrafish SCI.

Abstract
RNA methylation is involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes. However, the role of RNA methylation in spinal cord regeneration has not been reported. In this study, we find an altered m6A (N6‐methyladenosine) RNA methylation profiling following zebrafish spinal cord injury (SCI), in line with an altered transcription level of the m6A methylase Mettl3. Interestingly, many of the differential m6A‐tagged genes associated with neural regeneration are hypomethylated, but their transcription levels are upregulated in SCI. Moreover, we find that METTL3 may be important for spinal cord regeneration. We also show a conserved feature of METTL3 changes in mouse SCI model, in which the expression of METTL3 is increased in both astrocytes and neural stem cells. Together, our results indicate that m6A RNA methylation is dynamic and conserved following SCI and may contribute to spinal cord regeneration.</description>

The extent to which brain functions are localized or distributed is a foundational question in neuroscience. In the human brain, common fMRI methods such as cluster correction, atlas parcellation, and anatomical searchlight are biased by design toward finding localized representations. Here we introduce the functional searchlight approach as an alternative to anatomical searchlight analysis, the most commonly used exploratory multivariate fMRI technique. Functional searchlight removes any anatomical bias by grouping voxels based only on functional similarity and ignoring anatomical proximity. We report evidence that visual and auditory features from deep neural networks and semantic features from a natural language processing model, as well as object representations, are more widely distributed across the brain than previously acknowledged and that functional searchlight can improve model-based similarity and decoding accuracy. This approach provides a new way to evaluate and constrain computational models with brain activity and pushes our understanding of human brain function further along the spectrum from strict modularity toward distributed representation&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9YAIwQx3Ksw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the ongoing global pandemic that has infected more than 31 million people in more than 180 countries worldwide. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have been transmitted to humans from wild animals. Given the scale and widespread geographical distribution of the current pandemic and confirmed cases of cross-species transmission, the question of the extent to which this transmission is possible emerges, as well as what molecular features distinguish susceptible from non-susceptible animal species. Here, we investigated the structural properties of several ACE2 orthologs bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We found that species known not to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection have non-conservative mutations in several ACE2 amino acid residues that disrupt key polar and charged contacts with the viral spike protein. Our models also allow us to predict affinity-enhancing mutations that could be used to design ACE2 variants for therapeutic purposes. Finally, our study provides a blueprint for modeling viral-host protein interactions and highlights several important considerations when designing these computational studies and analyzing their results.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H1dwCO1hk_o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The two kinds of free energy and the Bayesian revolution</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sebastian Gottwald, Daniel A. Braun&lt;/p&gt;

The concept of free energy has its origins in 19th century thermodynamics, but has recently found its way into the behavioral and neural sciences, where it has been promoted for its wide applicability and has even been suggested as a fundamental principle of understanding intelligent behavior and brain function. We argue that there are essentially two different notions of free energy in current models of intelligent agency, that can both be considered as applications of Bayesian inference to the problem of action selection: one that appears when trading off accuracy and uncertainty based on a general maximum entropy principle, and one that formulates action selection in terms of minimizing an error measure that quantifies deviations of beliefs and policies from given reference models. The first approach provides a normative rule for action selection in the face of model uncertainty or when information processing capabilities are limited. The second approach directly aims to formulate the action selection problem as an inference problem in the context of Bayesian brain theories, also known as Active Inference in the literature. We elucidate the main ideas and discuss critical technical and conceptual issues revolving around these two notions of free energy that both claim to apply at all levels of decision-making, from the high-level deliberation of reasoning down to the low-level information processing of perception.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t1EnEmD_Z_E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Quantifying the impact of COVID-19 control measures using a Bayesian model of physical distancing</title>

Extensive non-pharmaceutical and physical distancing measures are currently the primary interventions against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. It is therefore urgent to estimate the impact such measures are having. We introduce a Bayesian epidemiological model in which a proportion of individuals are willing and able to participate in distancing, with the timing of distancing measures informed by survey data on attitudes to distancing and COVID-19. We fit our model to reported COVID-19 cases in British Columbia (BC), Canada, and five other jurisdictions, using an observation model that accounts for both underestimation and the delay between symptom onset and reporting. We estimated the impact that physical distancing (social distancing) has had on the contact rate and examined the projected impact of relaxing distancing measures. We found that, as of April 11 2020, distancing had a strong impact in BC, consistent with declines in reported cases and in hospitalization and intensive care unit numbers; individuals practising physical distancing experienced approximately 0.22 (0.11–0.34 90% CI [credible interval]) of their normal contact rate. The threshold above which prevalence was expected to grow was 0.55. We define the “contact ratio” to be the ratio of the estimated contact rate to the threshold rate at which cases are expected to grow; we estimated this contact ratio to be 0.40 (0.19–0.60) in BC. We developed an R package ‘covidseir’ to make our model available, and used it to quantify the impact of distancing in five additional jurisdictions. As of May 7, 2020, we estimated that New Zealand was well below its threshold value (contact ratio of 0.22 [0.11–0.34]), New York (0.60 [0.43–0.74]), Washington (0.84 [0.79–0.90]) and Florida (0.86 [0.76–0.96]) were progressively closer to theirs yet still below, but California (1.15 [1.07–1.23]) was above its threshold overall, with cases still rising. Accordingly, we found that BC, New Zealand, and New York may have had more room to relax distancing measures than the other jurisdictions, though this would need to be done cautiously and with total case volumes in mind. Our projections indicate that intermittent distancing measures—if sufficiently strong and robustly followed—could control COVID-19 transmission. This approach provides a useful tool for jurisdictions to monitor and assess current levels of distancing relative to their threshold, which will continue to be essential through subsequent waves of this pandemic.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jsdpN4ctAD8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Phosphorylation of specific substrates by protein kinases is a key control mechanism for vital cell-fate decisions and other cellular processes. However, discovering specific kinase-substrate relationships is time-consuming and often rather serendipitous. Computational predictions alleviate these challenges, but the current approaches suffer from limitations like restricted kinome coverage and inaccuracy. They also typically utilise only local features without reflecting broader interaction context. To address these limitations, we have developed an alternative predictive model. It uses statistical relational learning on top of phosphorylation networks interpreted as knowledge graphs, a simple yet robust model for representing networked knowledge. Compared to a representative selection of six existing systems, our model has the highest kinome coverage and produces biologically valid high-confidence predictions not possible with the other tools. Specifically, we have experimentally validated predictions of previously unknown phosphorylations by the LATS1, AKT1, PKA and MST2 kinases in human. Thus, our tool is useful for focusing phosphoproteomic experiments, and facilitates the discovery of new phosphorylation reactions. Our model can be accessed publicly via an easy-to-use web interface (LinkPhinder).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Blm5do8tkYQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Transmembrane tumor necrosis factor alpha attenuates pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy via tumor necrosis factor receptor 2</title>

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) plays an important pathogenic role in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (HF); however, anti-TNF is paradoxically negative in clinical trials and even worsens HF, indicating a possible protective role of TNF-α in HF. TNF-α exists in transmembrane (tmTNF-α) and soluble (sTNF-α) forms. Herein, we found that TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) knockout (KO) or knockdown (KD) by short hairpin RNA or small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly alleviated cardiac hypertrophy, heart dysfunction, fibrosis, and inflammation with increased tmTNF-α expression, whereas TNFR2 KO or KD exacerbated the pathological phenomena with increased sTNF-α secretion in transverse aortic constriction (TAC)- and isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro, respectively, indicating the beneficial effects of TNFR2 associated with tmTNF-α. Suppressing TNF-α converting enzyme by TNF-α Protease Inhibitor-1 (TAPI-1) to increase endogenous tmTNF-α expression significantly alleviated TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Importantly, direct addition of exogenous tmTNF-α into cardiomyocytes in vitro significantly reduced ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy and transcription of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and induced proliferation. The beneficial effects of tmTNF-α were completely blocked by TNFR2 KD in H9C2 cells and TNFR2 KO in primary myocardial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that tmTNF-α displayed antihypertrophic and anti-inflammatory effects by activating the AKT pathway and inhibiting the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway via TNFR2. Our data suggest that tmTNF-α exerts cardioprotective effects via TNFR2. Specific targeting of tmTNF-α processing, rather than anti-TNF therapy, may be more useful for the treatment of hypertrophy and HF.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wGLFWOTcSFY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Our understanding of the evolutionary history of primates is undergoing continual revision due to ongoing genome sequencing efforts. Bolstered by growing fossil evidence, these data have led to increased acceptance of once controversial hypotheses regarding phylogenetic relationships, hybridization and introgression, and the biogeographical history of primate groups. Among these findings is a pattern of recent introgression between species within all major primate groups examined to date, though little is known about introgression deeper in time. To address this and other phylogenetic questions, here, we present new reference genome assemblies for 3 Old World monkey (OWM) species: &lt;i&gt;Colobus angolensis&lt;/i&gt; ssp. &lt;i&gt;palliatus&lt;/i&gt; (the black and white colobus), &lt;i&gt;Macaca nemestrina&lt;/i&gt; (southern pig-tailed macaque), and &lt;i&gt;Mandrillus leucophaeus&lt;/i&gt; (the drill). We combine these data with 23 additional primate genomes to estimate both the species tree and individual gene trees using thousands of loci. While our species tree is largely consistent with previous phylogenetic hypotheses, the gene trees reveal high levels of genealogical discordance associated with multiple primate radiations. We use strongly asymmetric patterns of gene tree discordance around specific branches to identify multiple instances of introgression between ancestral primate lineages. In addition, we exploit recent fossil evidence to perform fossil-calibrated molecular dating analyses across the tree. Taken together, our genome-wide data help to resolve multiple contentious sets of relationships among primates, while also providing insight into the biological processes and technical artifacts that led to the disagreements in the first place.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6Y1ZCNOvZtY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Subpopulations of sensorless bacteria drive fitness in fluctuating environments</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas Julou, Ludovit Zweifel, Diana Blank, Athos Fiori, Erik van Nimwegen&lt;/p&gt;

Populations of bacteria often undergo a lag in growth when switching conditions. Because growth lags can be large compared to typical doubling times, variations in growth lag are an important but often overlooked component of bacterial fitness in fluctuating environments. We here explore how growth lag variation is determined for the archetypical switch from glucose to lactose as a carbon source in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. First, we show that single-cell lags are bimodally distributed and controlled by a single-molecule trigger. That is, gene expression noise causes the population before the switch to divide into subpopulations with zero and nonzero &lt;i&gt;lac&lt;/i&gt; operon expression. While “sensorless” cells with zero preexisting &lt;i&gt;lac&lt;/i&gt; expression at the switch have long lags because they are unable to sense the lactose signal, any nonzero &lt;i&gt;lac&lt;/i&gt; operon expression suffices to ensure a short lag. Second, we show that the growth lag at the population level depends crucially on the fraction of sensorless cells and that this fraction in turn depends sensitively on the growth condition before the switch. Consequently, even small changes in basal expression can significantly affect the fraction of sensorless cells, thereby population lags and fitness under switching conditions, and may thus be subject to significant natural selection. Indeed, we show that condition-dependent population lags vary across wild &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; isolates. Since many sensory genes are naturally low expressed in conditions where their inducer is not present, bimodal responses due to subpopulations of sensorless cells may be a general mechanism inducing phenotypic heterogeneity and controlling population lags in switching environments. This mechanism also illustrates how gene expression noise can turn even a simple sensory gene circuit into a bet hedging module and underlines the profound role of gene expression noise in regulatory responses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/nIOLnI4Rd8g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Body–brain isomorphism of pig rostrum and cortical rostrum gyrus.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physiological studies of the last century mapped a somatosensory cortical gyrus representing the pig's rostrum. Here, we describe the extraordinary correspondence of this gyrus to the rostrum. The pig rostrum is packed with microvibrissae (~470 per hemi‐rostrum) and innervated by a prominent infraorbital nerve, containing about 80,000 axons. The pig's rostrum has three major skin‐folds. The nostrils have a rectangular medial wall and a funnel‐like lateral opening, nasal channels run obliquely from lateral (surface) to medial (inside). The rostrum gyrus mimics rostrum geometry in great detail. The putative representation of skin folds coincides with blood sinus and folds of the rostrum gyrus. The putative nostril representation is an oblique sulcus running from lateral (surface) to medial (inside). As observed in rodents, Layer 4 is thin in the nostril sulcus. The side of the nostril sulcus representing the medial wall of the nostril is rectangular, whereas the side of the nostril sulcus representing the lateral wall is funnel‐like. Proportions and geometry of the rostrum and the rostrum gyrus are similar, albeit with a collapsed nostril and a larger interindividual variability in the gyrus. The pig's cortical rostrum gyrus receives dense thalamic innervation, has a thin Layer 1 and contains roughly 8 million neurons. With all that, the rostrum gyrus looks like a model of the pig rostrum at a scale of ~1:2. Our findings are reminiscent of the raccoon cortex with its forepaw‐like somatosensory forepaw‐representation. Representing highly relevant afferents in three‐dimensional body‐part‐models might facilitate isomorphic cortical computations in large‐brained tactile specialists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A Pilot Randomized, Controlled, Double‐Blind Trial of Bumetanide to Treat Neonatal Seizures</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25959</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25959?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
In the absence of controlled trials, treatment of neonatal seizures has changed minimally despite poor drug efficacy. We tested bumetanide added to phenobarbital to treat neonatal seizures in the first trial to include a standard‐therapy control group.


Methods
A randomized, double‐blind, dose‐escalation design was employed. Neonates with postmenstrual age 33 to 44 weeks at risk of or with seizures were eligible. Subjects with electroencephalography (EEG)‐confirmed seizures after ≥20 and &amp;lt;40mg/kg phenobarbital were randomized to receive additional phenobarbital with either placebo (control) or 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3mg/kg bumetanide (treatment). Continuous EEG monitoring data from ≥2 hours before to ≥48 hours after study drug administration (SDA) were analyzed for seizures.


Results
Subjects were randomized to treatment (n = 27) and control (n = 16) groups. Pharmacokinetics were highly variable among subjects and altered by hypothermia. The only statistically significant adverse event was diuresis in treated subjects (48% vs 13%, p = 0.02). One treated (4%) and 3 control subjects died (19%, p = 0.14). Among survivors, 2 of 26 treated subjects (8%) and 0 of 13 control subjects had hearing impairment, as did 1 nonrandomized subject. Total seizure burden varied widely, with much higher seizure burden in treatment versus control groups (median = 3.1 vs 1.2 min/h, p = 0.006). There was significantly greater reduction in seizure burden 0 to 4 hours and 2 to 4 hours post‐SDA (both p &amp;lt; 0.01) compared with 2‐hour baseline in treatment versus control groups with adjustment for seizure burden.


Interpretation
Although definitive proof of efficacy awaits an appropriately powered phase 3 trial, this randomized, controlled, multicenter trial demonstrated an additional reduction in seizure burden attributable to bumetanide over phenobarbital without increased serious adverse effects. Future trials of bumetanide and other drugs should include a control group and balance seizure severity. ANN NEUROL 2020</description>

	<description>Traumatic contusion to the primary somatosensory and motor cortices is delivered to the exposed left forebrain. Sensorimotor dysfunction is tested every other day for the first week post‐injury (PI) and weekly thereafter up to 8 weeks PI. The impacted cortical area was harvested at 4 hours (h), 12h, 24h, 7 days (d), 14d, and 8 weeks PI and sampled for cytokine and chemokine levels using multiplex electro‐chemiluminescent immunoassays.

Abstract
Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States. Acute trauma to the brain triggers chronic secondary injury mechanisms that contribute to long‐term neurological impairment. We have developed a single, unilateral contusion injury model of sensorimotor dysfunction in adult mice. By targeting a topographically defined neurological circuit with a mild impact, we are able to track sustained behavioral deficits in sensorimotor function in the absence of tissue cavitation or neuronal loss in the contused cortex of these mice. Stereological histopathology and multiplex enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay proteomic screening confirm contusion resulted in chronic gliosis and the robust expression of innate immune cytokines and monocyte attractant chemokines IL‐1β, IL‐5, IL‐6, TNFα, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL10, CCL2, and CCL3 in the contused cortex. In contrast, the expression of neuroinflammatory proteins with adaptive immune functions was not significantly modulated by injury. Our data support widespread activation of innate but not adaptive immune responses, confirming an association between sensorimotor dysfunction with innate immune activation in the absence of tissue or neuronal loss in our mice.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Age-Related EEG Features of Bursting Activity During Anesthetic-Induced Burst Suppression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.599962</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalographic (EEG) Burst Suppression (BSUPP) is a discontinuous pattern characterized by episodes of low voltage disrupted by bursts of cortical synaptic activity. It can occur while delivering high-dose anesthesia. Current research suggests an association between BSUPP and the occurrence of postoperative delirium in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and beyond. We investigated burst micro-architecture to further understand how age influences the neurophysiology of this pharmacologically-induced state. We analyzed a subset of EEG recordings (n = 102) taken from a larger data set previously published. We selected the initial burst that followed a visually identified “silent second,” i.e., at least 1 s of iso-electricity of the EEG during propofol induction. We derived the (normalized) power spectral density [(n)PSD], the alpha band power, the maximum amplitude, the maximum slope of the EEG as well as the permutation entropy (PeEn) for the first 1.5 s of the initial burst of each patient. In the old patients &amp;gt;65 years, we observed significantly lower (p &amp;lt; 0.001) EEG power in the 1–15 Hz range. In general, their EEG contained a significantly higher amount of faster oscillations (&amp;gt;15 Hz). Alpha band power (p &amp;lt; 0.001), EEG amplitude (p = 0.001), and maximum EEG slope (p = 0.045) all significantly decreased with age, whereas PeEn increased (p = 0.008). Hence, we can describe an age-related change in features during EEG burst suppression. Sub-group analysis revealed no change in results based on pre-medication. These EEG changes add knowledge to the impact of age on cortical synaptic activity. In addition to a reduction in EEG amplitude, age-associated burst features can complicate the identification of excessive anesthetic administration in patients under general anesthesia. Knowledge of these neurophysiologic changes may not only improve anesthesia care through improved detection of burst suppression but might also provide insight into changes in neuronal network organization in patients at risk for age-related neurocognitive problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: The α5 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Subunit Differentially Modulates α4β2* and α3β4* Receptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.607959</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nicotine, the principal reinforcing compound in tobacco, acts in the brain by activating neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This review summarizes our current knowledge regarding how the α5 accessory nAChR subunit, encoded by the CHRNA5 gene, differentially modulates α4β2&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and α3β4&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; receptors at the cellular level. Genome-wide association studies have linked a gene cluster in chromosomal region 15q25 to increased susceptibility to nicotine addiction, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and peripheral arterial disease. Interestingly, this gene cluster contains a non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human CHRNA5 gene, causing an aspartic acid (D) to asparagine (N) substitution at amino acid position 398 in the α5 nAChR subunit. Although other SNPs have been associated with tobacco smoking behavior, efforts have focused predominantly on the D398 and N398 variants in the α5 subunit. In recent years, significant progress has been made toward understanding the role that the α5 nAChR subunit—and the role of the D398 and N398 variants—plays on nAChR function at the cellular level. These insights stem primarily from a wide range of experimental models, including receptors expressed heterologously in Xenopus oocytes, various cell lines, and neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), as well as endogenous receptors in genetically engineered mice and—more recently—rats. Despite providing a wealth of available data, however, these studies have yielded conflicting results, and our understanding of the modulatory role that the α5 subunit plays remains incomplete. Here, we review these reports and the various techniques used for expression and analysis in order to examine how the α5 subunit modulates key functions in α4β2&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and α3β4&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; receptors, including receptor trafficking, sensitivity, efficacy, and desensitization. In addition, we highlight the strikingly different role that the α5 subunit plays in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling between α4β2&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and α3β4&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; receptors, and we discuss whether the N398 α5 subunit variant can partially replace the D398 variant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Transient Enhanced GluA2 Expression in Young Hippocampal Neurons of a Fragile X Mouse Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are tetrameric ligand-gated channels made up of combinations of GluA1-4 subunits and play important roles in synaptic transmission and plasticity. Here, we have investigated the development of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of the Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mouse, a widely used model of Fragile X syndrome (FXS). FXS is the leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and it is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder. For that reason, we investigated synaptic properties and dendritic development in animals from an early stage when synapses are starting to form up to adulthood. We found that hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in the Fmr1-KO mouse exhibit a higher AMPAR-NMDAR ratio early in development but reverses to normal values after P13. This increase was accompanied by a larger presence of the GluA2-subunit in synaptic AMPARs that will lead to altered Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeability of AMPARs that could have a profound impact upon neural circuits, learning, and diseases. Following this, we found that young KO animals lack Long-term potentiation (LTP), a well-understood model of synaptic plasticity necessary for proper development of circuits, and exhibit an increased frequency of spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, a measure of synaptic density. Furthermore, post hoc morphological analysis of recorded neurons revealed altered dendritic branching in the KO group. Interestingly, all these anomalies are transitory and revert to normal values in older animals. Our data suggest that loss of FMRP during early development leads to temporary upregulation of the GluA2 subunit and this impacts synaptic plasticity and altering morphological dendritic branching.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a highly specialized synapse between a motor neuron nerve terminal and its muscle fiber that are responsible for converting electrical impulses generated by the motor neuron into electrical activity in the muscle fibers. On arrival of the motor nerve action potential, calcium enters the presynaptic terminal, which leads to the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). ACh crosses the synaptic gap and binds to ACh receptors (AChRs) tightly clustered on the surface of the muscle fiber; this leads to the endplate potential which initiates the muscle action potential that results in muscle contraction. This is a simplified version of the events in neuromuscular transmission that take place within milliseconds, and are dependent on a tiny but highly structured NMJ. Much of this review is devoted to describing in more detail the development, maturation, maintenance and regeneration of the NMJ, but first we describe briefly the most important molecules involved and the conditions that affect their numbers and function. Most important clinically worldwide, are myasthenia gravis (MG), the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), each of which causes specific molecular defects. In addition, we mention the neurotoxins from bacteria, snakes and many other species that interfere with neuromuscular transmission and cause potentially fatal diseases, but have also provided useful probes for investigating neuromuscular transmission. There are also changes in NMJ structure and function in motor neuron disease, spinal muscle atrophy and sarcopenia that are likely to be secondary but might provide treatment targets. The NMJ is one of the best studied and most disease-prone synapses in the nervous system and it is amenable to in vivo and ex vivo investigation and to systemic therapies that can help restore normal function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: New Insights Into Drug Discovery Targeting Tau Protein</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microtubule-associated protein tau is characterized by the fact that it is an intrinsically disordered protein due to its lack of a stable conformation and high flexibility. Intracellular inclusions of fibrillar forms of tau with a β-sheet structure accumulate in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Accordingly, detachment of tau from microtubules and transition of tau from a disordered state to an abnormally aggregated state are essential events preceding the onset of tau-related diseases. Many reports have shown that this transition is caused by post-translational modifications, including hyperphosphorylation and acetylation. The misfolded tau is self-assembled and forms a tau oligomer before the appearance of tau inclusions. Animal and pathological studies using human samples have demonstrated that tau oligomer formation contributes to neuronal loss. During the progression of tauopathies, tau seeds are released from cells and incorporated into other cells, leading to the propagation of pathological tau aggregation. Accumulating evidence suggests several potential approaches for blocking tau-mediated toxicity: (1) direct inhibition of pathological tau aggregation and (2) inhibition of tau post-translational modifications that occur prior to pathological tau aggregation, (3) inhibition of tau propagation and (4) stabilization of microtubules. In addition to traditional low-molecular-weight compounds, newer drug discovery approaches such as the development of medium-molecular-weight drugs (peptide- or oligonucleotide-based drugs) and high-molecular-weight drugs (antibody-based drugs) provide alternative pathways to preventing the formation of abnormal tau. Of particular interest are recent studies suggesting that tau droplet formation by liquid-liquid phase separation may be the initial step in aberrant tau aggregation, as well results that implicate roles for tau in dendritic and nuclear functions. Here, we review the mechanisms through which drugs can target tau and consider recent clinical trials for the treatment of tauopathies. In addition, we discuss the utility of these newer strategies and propose future directions for research on tau-targeted therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last two decades, the explosion of experimental, computational, and high-throughput technologies has led to critical insights into how the brain functions in health and disease. It has become increasingly clear that the vast majority of brain activities result from the complex entanglement of genetic factors, epigenetic changes, and environmental stimuli, which, when altered, can lead to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal activities and higher-order cognitive processes continues to elude neuroscientists. Here, we provide a concise overview of how the interaction between the environment and genetic as well as epigenetic mechanisms shapes complex neuronal processes such as learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity. We then consider how this interaction contributes to the development of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, and how it can be modeled to predict phenotypic variability and disease risk. Finally, we outline new frontiers in neurogenetic and neuroepigenetic research and highlight the challenges these fields will face in their quest to decipher the molecular mechanisms governing brain functioning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Reduced Information Transmission of Medial Prefrontal Cortex to Basolateral Amygdala Inhibits Exploratory Behavior in Depressed Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.608587</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Depression is a mental and neurological disease that reduces the desire for exploration. Dysregulation of the information transmission between medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) is associated with depression. However, which direction of information transmission (mPFC-BLA or BLA-mPFC) related to the decline of exploratory interests in depression is unclear. Therefore, it is important to determine what specific changes occur in mPFC and BLA information transmission in depressed rats during exploratory behavior. In the present study, local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded via multi-electrodes implanted in the mPFC and BLA for the control and depression groups of rats when they were exploring in an open field. The theta band was determined to be the characteristic band of exploratory behavior. The direct transfer function (DTF) was used to calculate the mPFC and BLA bidirectional information flow (IF) to measure information transmission. Compared with the control group, the theta IF of mPFC-BLA in the depression group was significantly reduced, and there was no significant difference in theta IF of BLA-mPFC between the two groups. Our results indicated that the reduction of mPFC-BLA information transmission can inhibit the exploratory behavior of depressed rats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Dopaminergic System Alteration in Anxiety and Compulsive Disorders: A Systematic Review of Neuroimaging Studies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.608520</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.608520</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The dopaminergic system is involved in many psychiatric disorders as a GABAergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic system. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to elucidate the alteration of the dopaminergic system in anxiety and compulsive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The databases of Pubmed, Embase, and ScienceDirect were searched and articles reporting the involvement of the dopaminergic system in patients with anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) were recognized. The key research data were extracted from the included articles and standardized mean differences were calculated using meta-analyses if there were more than two studies with obtainable data. Sensitivity analyses were further performed to detect the stability of results, and the qualities of all the included studies were assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Finally, we identified 8 and 11 studies associated with anxiety disorder and OCD for further analysis, respectively. Most consistently, the striatal dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) of OCD patients had decreased while no significant correlation was found between striatal D2R and disease severity. The striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) had not been significantly altered in both the anxiety disorder and OCD patients. The heterogeneity values from the meta-analyses were extremely high while those results remained stable after sensitivity analyses. Inconsistent data were found in the striatal D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R of patients with anxiety disorder. Limited data had suggested that dopamine synthesis increased in most regions of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum in OCD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The most convincing finding was that the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor decreased in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. The dopamine transporter may have no relationship with anxiety and compulsive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;People living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH) are at high risk of neurocognitive impairment. The pathogenesis of neurocognitive impairment remains unclear, and there is still no diagnostic biomarker. By coupling three-dimensional T1-weighted imaging and resting-state functional imaging, we explored structural and functional alterations in PLWH and examined whether such imaging alterations had the potential to denote neurocognitive function. A total of 98 PLWH and 47 seronegative controls aged 20–53 years were recruited. Structural alterations were first explored between HIV-negative controls and PLWH. Subsequently, brain regions showing gray matter alterations were used as seeds for separate whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) analysis. Finally, the relationships between imaging alterations and cognitive function were explored. PLWH suffered from thalamus, occipital lobe, and hippocampus/parahippocampus atrophy. Visual cortices in PLWH showed decreased anticorrelation with the posterior cingulate cortex and left angular gyrus of the default mode network. FC within the visual cortices (between the left calcarine and right calcarine) and in the thalamic prefrontal circuit and between the thalamus and somatosensory association cortex were also altered. In addition, FC between the left thalamus and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the cognitively impaired group was significantly different from that in the cognitively normal group in PLWH. Partial correlation analysis uncorrected for multiple comparisons suggested that some imaging alterations can be associated with neurocognition. Our study supports the presence of brain atrophy and functional reconfiguration in PLWH. Imaging alterations can be associated with neurocognitive function. We hold that neuroimaging is a promising approach in evaluating PLWH and might have the potential to clarify the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Dynamic Changes in the Gut Microbiome at the Acute Stage of Ischemic Stroke in a Pig Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is a major cause of death and long-term disability affecting seven million adults in the United States each year. Recently, it has been demonstrated that neurological diseases, associated pathology, and susceptibility changes correlated with changes in the gut microbiota. However, changes in the microbial community in stroke has not been well characterized. The acute stage of stroke is a critical period for assessing injury severity, therapeutic intervention, and clinical prognosis. We investigated the changes in the gut microbiota composition and diversity using a middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion ischemic stroke pig model. Ischemic stroke was induced by cauterization of the MCA in pigs. Blood samples were collected prestroke and 4 h, 12 h, 1 day, and 5 days poststroke to evaluate circulating proinflammatory cytokines. Fecal samples were collected prestroke and 1, 3, and 5 days poststroke to assess gut microbiome changes. Results showed elevated systemic inflammation with increased plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha at 4 h and interleukin-6 at 12 h poststroke, relative to prestroke. Microbial diversity and evenness were reduced at 1 day poststroke compared to prestroke. Microbial diversity at 3 days poststroke was negatively correlated with lesion volume. Moreover, beta-diversity analysis revealed trending overall differences over time, with the most significant changes in microbial patterns observed between prestroke and 3 days poststroke. Abundance of the Proteobacteria was significantly increased, while Firmicutes decreased at 3 days poststroke, compared to prestroke populations. Abundance of the lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus was reduced at 3 days poststroke. By day 5, the microbial pattern returned to similar values as prestroke, suggesting the plasticity of gut microbiome in an acute period of stroke in a pig model. These findings provide a basis for characterizing gut microbial changes during the acute stage of stroke, which can be used to assess stroke pathology and the potential development of therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Physiological Synchrony in EEG, Electrodermal Activity and Heart Rate Detects Attentionally Relevant Events in Time</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Interpersonal physiological synchrony (PS), or the similarity of physiological signals between individuals over time, may be used to detect attentionally engaging moments in time. We here investigated whether PS in the electroencephalogram (EEG), electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate and a multimodal metric signals the occurrence of attentionally relevant events in time in two groups of participants. Both groups were presented with the same auditory stimulus, but were instructed to attend either to the narrative of an audiobook (audiobook-attending: AA group) or to interspersed emotional sounds and beeps (stimulus-attending: SA group). We hypothesized that emotional sounds could be detected in both groups as they are expected to draw attention involuntarily, in a bottom-up fashion. Indeed, we found this to be the case for PS in EDA or the multimodal metric. Beeps, that are expected to be only relevant due to specific “top-down” attentional instructions, could indeed only be detected using PS among SA participants, for EDA, EEG and the multimodal metric. We further hypothesized that moments in the audiobook accompanied by high PS in either EEG, EDA, heart rate or the multimodal metric for AA participants would be rated as more engaging by an independent group of participants compared to moments corresponding to low PS. This hypothesis was not supported. Our results show that PS can support the detection of attentionally engaging events over time. Currently, the relation between PS and engagement is only established for well-defined, interspersed stimuli, whereas the relation between PS and a more abstract self-reported metric of engagement over time has not been established. As the relation between PS and engagement is dependent on event type and physiological measure, we suggest to choose a measure matching with the stimulus of interest. When the stimulus type is unknown, a multimodal metric is most robust.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In humans, a considerable number of the autopsy samples of cognitively normal individuals aged between 57 and 102 years have revealed the presence of amyloid plaques, one of the typical signs of AD, indicating that many of us use mechanisms that defend ourselves from the toxic consequences of Aß. The human APP NL/F (hAPP NL/F) knockin mouse appears as the ideal mouse model to identify these mechanisms, since they have high Aß42 levels at an early age and moderate signs of disease when old. Here we show that in these mice, the brain levels of the hemoprotein Neuroglobin (Ngb) increase with age, in parallel with the increase in Aß42. In vitro, in wild type neurons, exogenous Aß increases the expression of Ngb and Ngb over-expression prevents Aß toxicity. In vivo, in old hAPP NL/F mice, Ngb knockdown leads to dendritic tree simplification, an early sign of Alzheimer’s disease. These results could indicate that Alzheimer’s symptoms may start developing at the time when defense mechanisms start wearing out. In agreement, analysis of plasma Ngb levels in aged individuals revealed decreased levels in those whose cognitive abilities worsened during a 5-year longitudinal follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Amplitude of fNIRS Resting-State Global Signal Is Related to EEG Vigilance Measures: A Simultaneous fNIRS and EEG Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been utilized to image the hemodynamic activities and connectivity in the human brain. With the advantage of economic efficiency, portability, and fewer physical constraints, fNIRS enables studying of the human brain at versatile environment and various body positions, including at bed side and during exercise, which complements the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, like fMRI, fNIRS imaging can be influenced by the presence of a strong global component. Yet, the nature of the global signal in fNIRS has not been established. In this study, we investigated the relationship between fNIRS global signal and electroencephalogram (EEG) vigilance using simultaneous recordings in resting healthy subjects in high-density and whole-head montage. In Experiment 1, data were acquired at supine, sitting, and standing positions. Results found that the factor of body positions significantly affected the amplitude of the resting-state fNIRS global signal, prominently in the frequency range of 0.05–0.1 Hz but not in the very low frequency range of less than 0.05 Hz. As a control, the task-induced fNIRS or EEG responses to auditory stimuli did not differ across body positions. However, EEG vigilance plays a modulatory role in the fNIRS signals in the frequency range of less than 0.05 Hz: resting-state sessions of low EEG vigilance measures are associated with high amplitudes of fNIRS global signals. Moreover, in Experiment 2, we further examined the epoch-to-epoch fluctuations in concurrent fNIRS and EEG data acquired from a separate group of subjects and found a negative temporal correlation between EEG vigilance measures and fNIRS global signal amplitudes. Our study for the first time revealed that vigilance as a neurophysiological factor modulates the resting-state dynamics of fNIRS, which have important implications for understanding and processing the noises in fNIRS signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: A Spelling Paradigm With an Added Red Dot Improved the P300 Speller System Performance</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The traditional P300 speller system uses the flashing row or column spelling paradigm. However, the classification accuracy and information transfer rate of the P300 speller are not adequate for real-world application. To improve the performance of the P300 speller, we devised a new spelling paradigm in which the flashing row or column of a virtual character matrix is covered by a translucent green circle with a red dot in either the upper or lower half (GC-RD spelling paradigm). We compared the event-related potential (ERP) waveforms with a control paradigm (GC spelling paradigm), in which the flashing row or column of a virtual character matrix was covered by a translucent green circle only. Our experimental results showed that the amplitude of P3a at the parietal area and P3b at the frontal–central–parietal areas evoked by the GC-RD paradigm were significantly greater than those induced by the GC paradigm. Higher classification accuracy and information transmission rates were also obtained in the GC-RD system. Our results indicated that the added red dots increased attention and visuospatial information, resulting in an amplitude increase in both P3a and P3b, thereby improving the performance of the P300 speller system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: ClipKIT: A multiple sequence alignment trimming software for accurate phylogenomic inference</title>

Highly divergent sites in multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), which can stem from erroneous inference of homology and saturation of substitutions, are thought to negatively impact phylogenetic inference. Thus, several different trimming strategies have been developed for identifying and removing these sites prior to phylogenetic inference. However, a recent study reported that doing so can worsen inference, underscoring the need for alternative alignment trimming strategies. Here, we introduce ClipKIT, an alignment trimming software that, rather than identifying and removing putatively phylogenetically uninformative sites, instead aims to identify and retain parsimony-informative sites, which are known to be phylogenetically informative. To test the efficacy of ClipKIT, we examined the accuracy and support of phylogenies inferred from 14 different alignment trimming strategies, including those implemented in ClipKIT, across nearly 140,000 alignments from a broad sampling of evolutionary histories. Phylogenies inferred from ClipKIT-trimmed alignments are accurate, robust, and time saving. Furthermore, ClipKIT consistently outperformed other trimming methods across diverse datasets, suggesting that strategies based on identifying and retaining parsimony-informative sites provide a robust framework for alignment trimming.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vxjeiNr5ESs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Mitochondrial dysfunction induces RNA interference in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; through a pathway homologous to the mammalian RIG-I antiviral response</title>

RNA interference (RNAi) is an antiviral pathway common to many eukaryotes that detects and cleaves foreign nucleic acids. In mammals, mitochondrially localized proteins such as mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) mediate antiviral responses. Here, we report that mitochondrial dysfunction in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; activates RNAi-directed silencing via induction of a pathway homologous to the mammalian RIG-I helicase viral response pathway. The induction of RNAi also requires the conserved RNA decapping enzyme EOL-1/DXO. The transcriptional induction of &lt;i&gt;eol-1&lt;/i&gt; requires DRH-1 as well as the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR&lt;sup&gt;mt&lt;/sup&gt;). Upon mitochondrial dysfunction, EOL-1 is concentrated into foci that depend on the transcription of mitochondrial RNAs that may form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), as has been observed in mammalian antiviral responses. Enhanced RNAi triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction is necessary for the increase in longevity that is induced by mitochondrial dysfunction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Rqj5R3MuVoI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: YAP/TAZ deficiency reprograms macrophage phenotype and improves infarct healing and cardiac function after myocardial infarction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000941</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Masum M. Mia, Dasan Mary Cibi, Siti Aishah Binte Abdul Ghani, Weihua Song, Nicole Tee, Sujoy Ghosh, Junhao Mao, Eric N. Olson, Manvendra K. Singh&lt;/p&gt;

Adverse cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) causes structural and functional changes in the heart leading to heart failure. The initial post-MI pro-inflammatory response followed by reparative or anti-inflammatory response is essential for minimizing the myocardial damage, healing, and scar formation. Bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) are recruited to the injured myocardium and are essential for cardiac repair as they can adopt both pro-inflammatory or reparative phenotypes to modulate inflammatory and reparative responses, respectively. Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are the key mediators of the Hippo signaling pathway and are essential for cardiac regeneration and repair. However, their functions in macrophage polarization and post-MI inflammation, remodeling, and healing are not well established. Here, we demonstrate that expression of YAP and TAZ is increased in macrophages undergoing pro-inflammatory or reparative phenotype changes. Genetic deletion of &lt;i&gt;YAP/TAZ&lt;/i&gt; leads to impaired pro-inflammatory and enhanced reparative response. Consistently, YAP activation enhanced pro-inflammatory and impaired reparative response. We show that YAP/TAZ promote pro-inflammatory response by increasing interleukin 6 (&lt;i&gt;IL6&lt;/i&gt;) expression and impede reparative response by decreasing Arginase-I (&lt;i&gt;Arg1&lt;/i&gt;) expression through interaction with the histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)-nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) repressor complex. These changes in macrophages polarization due to &lt;i&gt;YAP/TAZ&lt;/i&gt; deletion results in reduced fibrosis, hypertrophy, and increased angiogenesis, leading to improved cardiac function after MI. Also, YAP activation augmented MI-induced cardiac fibrosis and remodeling. In summary, we identify YAP/TAZ as important regulators of macrophage-mediated pro-inflammatory or reparative responses post-MI.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/H9OMCm_gjTg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Theta power and theta‐gamma coupling support long‐term spatial memory retrieval</title>

	<description>Abstract
Hippocampal theta oscillations have been implicated in spatial memory function in both rodents and humans. What is less clear is how hippocampal theta interacts with higher frequency oscillations to support long‐term memory. Here we asked 10 presurgical epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial EEG recording to perform a long‐term spatial memory task in desktop virtual reality and found that increased theta power in two discrete bands (“low” 2‐5 Hz and “high” 6‐11 Hz) during cued retrieval was associated with improved task performance. Similarly, increased coupling between “low” theta phase and gamma amplitude during the same period was associated with improved task performance. Finally, low and high gamma amplitude appeared to peak at different phases of the theta cycle; providing a novel connection between human hippocampal function and rodent data. These results help to elucidate the role of theta oscillations and theta‐gamma phase‐amplitude coupling in human long‐term memory.</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Quantitative assessment of amygdala in Macaca fascicularis monkeys&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/713ac175-bfe3-430d-9c95-78f821d55a7c/cne25074-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amygdaloid volume in &lt;i&gt;Macaca fascicularis&lt;/i&gt; monkeys &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; of 174 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with a surface area of 151 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The accessory basal nuclei are smaller than the lateral and basal nuclei, showing no brain interhemispheric differences. In opposite, the greater size of neuronal volume appears in the accessory basal nuclei.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amygdaloid complex (AC) is involved in very relevant cognitive and emotional pathways and exhibits changes in aging and in some neurological and psychiatric disorders. The quantitative estimators of AC could be useful to understand the impact of amygdaloid pathology in these processes, both globally and for each nucleus in particular, and their neurons. The present study analyzes morphometric and stereological estimators in the whole AC and its three main nuclei (lateral [La], basal [Ba], and accessory basal [AB]) in six &lt;i&gt;Macaca fascicularis&lt;/i&gt; monkeys. All the brains were fixed and sectioned in the coronal plane; Nissl‐stained sections were used for estimation of size and form parameters in both, the AC, and the La, Ba, and AB nuclei separately. The study includes stereological estimates of the volume and surface area of the AC; also, volume of the neurons in the amygdaloid nuclei was estimated using the point‐sampled intercepts method. Our results show that the AB nucleus is smaller than both the La and Ba nuclei in both morphometric and stereological estimators. Brain hemispheric side had not significant influence on any of quantitative estimates. The neuron volume was higher in the AB nucleus relative to LA and Ba of the nuclei. These data describe some quantitative parameters of the amygdaloid complex and their main nuclei that could help us to detect small changes in neurodegenerative and other pathological processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Rabies virus‐based monosynaptic circuit tracing allows the exploration of cell‐type specificity of both long‐distance and local connections in the central nervous system. We provide anatomical evidence of the cell type‐ and layer‐specific convergence in dLGN core and shell neurons. These findings suggest that dLGN core neurons integrate and process more multimodal information along with visual information than dLGN shell neurons and that LGN core and shell neurons integrate different types of information, send their own convergent information to discrete populations of the V1, and differentially contribute to visual perception and behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 40 distinct types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) generate parallel processing pathways in the visual system. In mice, two subdivisions of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the core and the shell, organize distinct parallel channels to transmit visual information from the retina to the primary visual cortex (V1). To investigate how the dLGN core and shell differentially integrate visual information and other modalities, we mapped synaptic input sources to each dLGN subdivision at the cell‐type level with G‐deleted rabies viral vectors. The monosynaptic circuit tracing revealed that dLGN core neurons received inputs from alpha‐RGCs, Layer 6 neurons of the V1, the superficial and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (SC), the internal ventral LGN, the lower layer of the external ventral LGN (vLGNe), the intergeniculate leaf, the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), and the pretectal nucleus (PT). Conversely, shell neurons received inputs from alpha‐RGCs and direction‐selective ganglion cells of the retina, Layer 6 neurons of the V1, the superficial layer of the SC, the superficial and lower layers of the vLGNe, the TRN, the PT, and the parabigeminal nucleus. The present study provides anatomical evidence of the cell type‐ and layer‐specific convergence in dLGN core and shell neurons. These findings suggest that dLGN core neurons integrate and process more multimodal information along with visual information than shell neurons and that LGN core and shell neurons integrate different types of information, send their own convergent information to discrete populations of the V1, and differentially contribute to visual perception and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Non-dystrophic myotonias (NDM) are heterogeneous diseases caused by mutations in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CLCN1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SCN4A&lt;/em&gt;. The study aimed to describe the clinical and genetic spectrum of NDM in a large German cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We retrospectively identified all patients with genetically confirmed NDM diagnosed in our center. The following data were analyzed: demographics, family history, muscular features, cardiac involvement, CK, EMG, genotype, other tested genes, treatment perceived efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;70 patients (age 40.2 years ± 14.9; 52.8% males) were included in our study (48 NDM-CLCN1, 22 NDM-SCN4A). The most frequent presenting symptoms were myotonia (NDM-CLCN1 83.3%, NDM-SCN4A 72.2%) and myalgia (NDM-CLCN1 57.4%, NDM-SCN4A 52.6%). Besides a more prominent facial involvement in NDM-SCN4A and cold-sensitivity in NDM-CLCN1, no other significant differences were observed between groups. Cardiac arrhythmia or conduction defects were documented in sixNDM-CLCN1 patients (three of them requiring a pacemaker) and one patient with NDM-SCN4A. CK was normal in 40% of patients. Myotonic runs in EMG were detected in 89.1% of CLCN1 and 78.9% of SCN4A. 50% of NDM-CLCN1 patients had the classic c.2680C&amp;gt;T (p.Arg894*) mutation. 12 new genetic variants are reported. About 50% of patients were not taking any anti-myotonic drug at the last follow-up. The anti-myotonic drugs with the best patient’s perceived efficacy were mexiletine and lamotrigine.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study highlights the relevant clinical overlap between NDM-CLCN1 and NDM-SCN4A patients and warrants the use of early and broad genetic investigation for the precise identification of the NDM subtype. Besides the clinical and genetic heterogeneity, the limited response to current anti-myotonic drugs constitutes a continuing challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Not Part of the Temporal Lobe, but Still of Importance? Substantia Nigra and Subthalamic Nucleus in Epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The most researched brain region in epilepsy research is the temporal lobe, and more specifically, the hippocampus. However, numerous other brain regions play a pivotal role in seizure circuitry and secondary generalization of epileptic activity: The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and its direct input structure, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), are considered seizure gating nuclei. There is ample evidence that direct inhibition of the SNr is capable of suppressing various seizure types in experimental models. Similarly, inhibition via its monosynaptic glutamatergic input, the STN, can decrease seizure susceptibility as well. This review will focus on therapeutic interventions such as electrical stimulation and targeted drug delivery to SNr and STN in human patients and experimental animal models of epilepsy, highlighting the opportunities for overcoming pharmacoresistance in epilepsy by investigating these promising target structures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Hypoxia-Ischemia Induced Age-Dependent Gene Transcription Effects at Two Development Stages in the Neonate Mouse Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human brain lesions in the perinatal period result in life-long neuro-disabilities impairing sensory-motor, cognitive, and behavior functions for years. Topographical aspects of brain lesions depend on gestational age at the time of insult in preterm or term infants and impaired subsequent steps of brain development and maturation. In mice, the Rice-Vannucci procedure of neonate hypoxia-ischemia (HI) was used at 5 days (P5) or P10, mimicking the development of 30 week-gestation fetus/preterm newborn, or full-term infant, respectively. Transcription response to HI was assessed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after insult, using micro-array technology. Statistical Pathway and Gene Ontology terms enrichments were investigated using DAVID&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, Revigo&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;) to identify a core of transcription response to HI, age-specific regulations, and interactions with spontaneous development. Investigations were based on direction, amplitude, and duration of responses, basal expression, and annotation. Five major points deserve attention; (i) inductions exceeded repressions (60/40%) at both ages, (ii) only 20.3% (393/1938 records) were common to P5 and P10 mice, (iii) at P5, HI effects occurred early and decreased 24 h after insult whereas they were delayed at P10 and increased 24 h after insult, (iv) common responses at P5 and P10 involved inflammation, immunity, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. (v) age-specific effects occurred with higher statistical significance at P5 than at P10. Transient repression of 12 genes encoding cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes was transiently observed 12 h after HI at P5. Synaptogenesis appeared inhibited at P5 while induced at P10, showing reciprocal effects on glutamate receptors. Specific involvement of Il-1 (interleukin-1) implicated in the firing of inflammation was observed at P10. This study pointed out age-differences in HI responses kinetics, e.g., a long-lasting inflammatory response at P10 compared to P5. Whether the specific strong depression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes that could account for white matter-specific vulnerability at P5 or prevent delayed inflammation needs further investigation. Determination of putative involvement of Il-1 and the identification of upstream regulators involved in the delayed inflammation firing at P10 appears promising routes of research in the understandings of age-dependent vulnerabilities in the neonatal brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Q336H MAPT Mutation Linked to Pick’s Disease Leads to Increased Binding of Tau to the Microtubule Network via Altered Conformational and Phosphorylation Effects</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tauopathies are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by Tau aggregation. Genetic studies on familial cases allowed for the discovery of mutations in the MAPT gene that increase Tau propensity to detach from microtubules and to form insoluble cytoplasmic Tau aggregates. Recently, the rare mutation Q336H has been identified to be associated with Pick’s disease (PiD) and biochemical analyses demonstrated its ability to increase the microtubules (MTs) polymerization, thus revealing an opposite character compared to other Tau mutations studied so far. Here we investigated the biophysical and molecular properties of Tau&lt;sup&gt;Q336H&lt;/sup&gt; in living cells by the employment of the conformational Tau biosensor CST. We found that this mutation alters Tau conformation on microtubules, stabilizes its binding to tubulin, and is associated with a paradoxical lower level of Tau phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that this mutation impacts the cytoskeletal complexity by increasing the tubulin filament length and the number of branches. However, despite these apparently non-pathological traits, we observed the formation of intracellular inclusions confirming that Q336H leads to aggregation. Our results suggest that the Tau aggregation process might be triggered by molecular mechanisms other than Tau destabilization or post-translational modifications which are likely to be detrimental to neuronal function in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Fetal Cortical Plate Segmentation Using Fully Convolutional Networks With Multiple Plane Aggregation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.591683</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to advance our understanding of human brain development by providing quantitative information of cortical plate (CP) development in vivo. However, for a reliable quantitative analysis of cortical volume and sulcal folding, accurate and automated segmentation of the CP is crucial. In this study, we propose a fully convolutional neural network for the automatic segmentation of the CP. We developed a novel hybrid loss function to improve the segmentation accuracy and adopted multi-view (axial, coronal, and sagittal) aggregation with a test-time augmentation method to reduce errors using three-dimensional (3D) information and multiple predictions. We evaluated our proposed method using the ten-fold cross-validation of 52 fetal brain MR images (22.9–31.4 weeks of gestation). The proposed method obtained Dice coefficients of 0.907 ± 0.027 and 0.906 ± 0.031 as well as a mean surface distance error of 0.182 ± 0.058 mm and 0.185 ± 0.069 mm for the left and right, respectively. In addition, the left and right CP volumes, surface area, and global mean curvature generated by automatic segmentation showed a high correlation with the values generated by manual segmentation (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;gt; 0.941). We also demonstrated that the proposed hybrid loss function and the combination of multi-view aggregation and test-time augmentation significantly improved the CP segmentation accuracy. Our proposed segmentation method will be useful for the automatic and reliable quantification of the cortical structure in the fetal brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: MMP13 Expression Is Increased Following Mutant α-Synuclein Exposure and Promotes Inflammatory Responses in Microglia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein is a 140-amino acid protein that readily misfolds and is associated with the Lewy body pathology found in sporadic and genetic forms of Parkinson's disease. We and others have shown that wild-type α-synuclein is a damage-associated molecular pattern that directly elicits a proinflammatory response in microglia through toll-like receptor activation. Here we investigated the direct effect of oligomeric mutant α-synuclein (A53T) on microglia morphology and activation. We found that misfolded A53T increased quantitative measures of amoeboid cell morphology, NFκB nuclear translocation and the expression of prototypical proinflammatory molecules. We also demonstrated that A53T increased expression of MMP13, a matrix metalloproteinase that remodels the extracellular matrix. To better understand the role of MMP13 in synucleinopathies, we further characterized the role of MMP13 in microglial signaling. We showed exposure of microglia to MMP13 induced a change in morphology and promoted the release of TNFα and MMP9. Notably, IL1β was not released indicating that the pathway involved in MMP13 activation of microglia may be different than the A53T pathway. Lastly, MMP13 increased the expression of CD68 suggesting that the lysosomal pathway might be altered by this MMP. Taken together this study shows that mutant α-synuclein directly induces a proinflammatory phenotype in microglia, which includes the expression of MMP13. In turn, MMP13 directly alters microglia supporting the need for multi-target therapies to treat Parkinson's disease patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; cleaves the decoding center of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; ribosomes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alejandro Vasquez-Rifo, Emiliano P. Ricci, Victor Ambros&lt;/p&gt;

Pathogens such as &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; advantageously modify animal host physiology, for example, by inhibiting host protein synthesis. Translational inhibition of insects and mammalian hosts by &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; utilizes the well-known exotoxin A effector. However, for the infection of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; by &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, the precise pathways and mechanism(s) of translational inhibition are not well understood. We found that upon exposure to &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; PA14, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; undergoes a rapid loss of intact ribosomes accompanied by the accumulation of ribosomes cleaved at helix 69 (H69) of the 26S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a key part of ribosome decoding center. H69 cleavage is elicited by certain virulent &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; isolates in a quorum sensing (QS)–dependent manner and independently of exotoxin A–mediated translational repression. H69 cleavage is antagonized by the 3 major host defense pathways defined by the &lt;i&gt;pmk-1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;fshr-1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;zip-2&lt;/i&gt; genes. The level of H69 cleavage increases with the bacterial exposure time, and it is predominantly localized in the worm’s intestinal tissue. Genetic and genomic analysis suggests that H69 cleavage leads to the activation of the worm’s &lt;i&gt;zip-2&lt;/i&gt;-mediated defense response pathway, consistent with translational inhibition. Taken together, our observations suggest that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; deploys a virulence mechanism to induce ribosome degradation and H69 cleavage of host ribosomes. In this manner, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; would impair host translation and block antibacterial responses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/EOwlxU_Y4R4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2: SARS-CoV-2), which originated from Wuhan, China, has spread to the other countries in a short period of time. We report a 47-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital due to suffering from progressive vertigo and ataxia for 7 days prior to the admission. Neurological examination revealed cerebellar dysfunction, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) depicted edema of the cerebellar hemisphere associated with leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal and CSF specimens. As a result, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir was initiated, and patient symptoms and signs improved significantly during the course of hospitalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of acute cerebellitis associated with COVID-19 disease which is reported in the literature so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) can be associated with impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and poor clinical outcome, but whether this holds true for patients with diffuse glioma is unknown. With blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD)-CVR imaging, we determined the presence of CCD in patients with diffuse glioma and investigated its relationship with cerebrovascular reactivity and clinical outcome. For eighteen enrolled subjects (nineteen datasets) with diffuse glioma, CCD was deferred from BOLD-CVR using a predetermined cerebellar asymmetry index (CAI) cutoff value of 6.0%. A FET-PET study was done as a verification of the CCD diagnosis. BOLD-CVR values as well as clinical performance scores (i.e., Karnofsky performance score (KPS), disability rating scale (DRS), and modified Rankin scale (mRS)) by BOLD-CVR scan at 3-month clinical follow-up were assessed and compared for the CCD-positive and CCD-negative group. CCD was present in 26.3% of subjects and strongly associated with impaired BOLD-CVR of the affected (i.e., the hemisphere harboring the glioma) and unaffected supratentorial hemisphere (CCD(+) vs. CCD(−): 0.08 ± 0.11 vs. 0.18 ± 0.04; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007 and 0.08 ± 0.12 vs. 0.19 ± 0.04; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007, respectively). This finding was independent of tumor volume (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.48). Furthermore, poorer initial (by scan) clinical performance scores at follow-up were found for the CCD(+) group. The presence of crossed cerebellar diaschisis in patients with diffuse glioma is associated with impaired supratentorial cerebrovascular reactivity and worse clinical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Ataxia Associated with CADASIL: a Pathology-Confirmed Case Report and Literature Review</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is primarily characterized by migraine, stroke, mood disturbances, and cognitive decline. Ataxia has seldom been reported as a presenting symptom. Here, we review reports of CADASIL presenting as ataxia and compare these to the first pathologically confirmed case of CADASIL presenting with progressive ataxia. A 50-year-old woman presented with progressive truncal ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed white matter hyperintensities in the bilateral anterior temporal lobes, external capsules, and periventricular areas, but not the cerebellum. Electron microscopy of skin biopsy material revealed multiple granular osmiophilic materials. Genetic testing confirmed a c.4552C &amp;gt; A mutation in exon 25 of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NOTCH3&lt;/em&gt; gene. CADASIL is a rare cause of progressive ataxia, and only four cases of CADASIL presenting with ataxia have been reported in the literature. We also discuss the possible pathophysiology of cerebellar ataxia associated with CADASIL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Cathodal Cerebellar tDCS Combined with Visual Feedback Improves Balance Control</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Balance control is essential to maintain a stable body position and to prevent falls. The aim of this study was to determine whether balance control could be improved by using cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and visual feedback in a combined approach. A total of 90 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to six groups defined by the delivery of tDCS (cathodal or anodal or sham) and the provision or not of visual feedback on balance during the acquisition phase. tDCS was delivered over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the dominant leg for 20 min at 2 mA during a unipedal stance task. Body sway (i.e., ankle angle and hip position) was measured as an overall maximal unit in anteroposterior and mediolateral direction, together with participant rating of perception of stability, before (baseline), during (acquisition), and after (final) the intervention. We found a reduction in body sway during the acquisition session when visual feedback alone was provided. When the visual feedback was removed (final session), however, body sway increased above baseline. Differently, the reduction in overall maximal body sway was maintained during the final session when the delivery of cathodal tDCS and visual feedback was combined. These findings suggest that cathodal tDCS may support the short-term maintenance of the positive effects of visual feedback on balance and provide the basis for a new approach to optimize balance control, with potential translational implications for the elderly and patients with impaired posture control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Cerebellar Damage Affects Contextual Priors for Action Prediction in Patients with Childhood Brain Tumor</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Predictive coding accounts of action perception sustain that kinematics information is compared with contextual top-down predictions (i.e., priors) to understand actions in conditions of perceptual ambiguity. It has been previously shown that the cerebellum contributes to motor simulation of observed actions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a specific contribution of the cerebellum to action perception is to provide contextual priors that guide the sampling of perceptual kinematic information. To this aim, we compared the performance of 42 patients with childhood brain tumor affecting infratentorial (ITT) or supratentorial (STT) areas with that of peers with typical development in an action prediction task. First, participants were exposed to videos depicting a child performing different reaching-to-grasp actions, which were associated with contextual cues in a probabilistic fashion. Then, they were presented with shortened versions of the same videos and asked to infer the action outcome; since kinematics was ambiguous, we expected their responses would be biased toward the previously learned contextual priors. We found that patients with brain tumor were impaired in predicting actions when compared to healthy controls. However, STT patients presented a reliable probabilistic effect, while ITT patients, who had cerebellar damage, did not rely on contextual priors in predicting actions. Furthermore, we found an association between the use of contextual priors and the ability to infer others’ mental states as assessed by a standardized test. These results suggest that the cerebellum provides contextual priors to understand others’ actions and this predictive function might underlie complex social cognition abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is caused by unstable expanded CAG repeats (expCAGs) in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ATXN3&lt;/em&gt;. Factors associated with intergenerational instability (delta-expCAG) and genetic anticipation in SCA3 have never been reported in Chinese mainland. Here, we demonstrated that unstable transmissions occurred more often in sons than in daughters (91% vs 72%, Fisher’s exact test, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.012). The extended delta-expCAG of father-son transmissions was greater than that of mother-son transmissions (3.8 ± 2.3 repeats vs 1.6 ± 1.0 repeats, Mann-Whitney &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;U&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001). Genetic anticipation was frequently observed between generations but not affected by the delta-expCAG.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Cerebellar Intermittent Theta-Burst Stimulation Combined with Vestibular Rehabilitation Improves Gait and Balance in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis: a Preliminary Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01166-y</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Difficulties in gait and balance disorders are among the most common mobility limitations in multiple sclerosis (MS), mainly due to a damage of cerebellar circuits. Moreover, the cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting new motor tasks, which is an essential function for neurorehabilitation. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol able to increase cerebellar activity, on gait and balance in a sample of 20 hospitalized participants with MS, undergoing vestibular rehabilitation (VR), an exercise-based program primarily designed to reduce vertigo and dizziness, gaze instability, and/or imbalance and falls in MS. Patients were assigned to receive either c-iTBS or sham iTBS before being treated with VR during 2 weeks. VR consisted of two types of training: gaze stability and postural stability exercises. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in the Tinetti Balance and Gait scale (TBG). The secondary outcome measures were changes from baseline in Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Two Minute Walking Test (2MWT), and Timed 25-ft walk test (T25FW) scales. MS patients treated with c-iTBS-VR showed a significant improvement in the TBG as compared to patients treated with sham iTBS-VR. Moreover, MS patients in the c-iTBS groups showed better performances in the vestibular-ocular reflex exercises. Combined c-iTBS and VR improves gait and balance abilities more than standard VR treatment in MS patients with a high level of disability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Effects of Cerebellar tDCS on Inhibitory Control: Evidence from a Go/NoGo Task</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Response inhibition as an executive function refers to the ability to suppress inappropriate but prepotent responses. Several brain regions have been implicated in the process underlying inhibitory control, including the cerebellum. The aim of the present study was to explore the role of the cerebellum in executive functioning, particularly in response inhibition. For this purpose, we transitorily inhibited cerebellar activity by means of cathodal tDCS and studied the effects of this inhibition on ERP components elicited during a Go/NoGo task in healthy subjects. Sixteen healthy subjects underwent a Go/NoGo task prior to and after cathodal and sham cerebellar tDCS in separate sessions. A reduction in N2-NoGo amplitude and a prolongation in N2-NoGo latency emerged after cathodal tDCS whereas no differences were detected after sham stimulation. Moreover, commission errors in NoGo trials were significantly higher after cathodal tDCS than at the basal evaluation. No differences emerged between performances in Go trials and those after sham stimulation. These data indicate that cerebellar inhibition following cathodal stimulation alters the ability to allocate attentional resources to stimuli containing conflict information and the inhibitory control. The cerebellum may regulate the attentional mechanisms of stimulus orientation and inhibitory control both directly, by making predictions of errors or behaviors related to errors, and indirectly, by controlling the functioning of the cerebral cortical areas involved in the perception of conflict signals and of the basal ganglia involved in the inhibitory control of movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Is Purkinje Neuron Hyperpolarisation Important for Cerebellar Synaptic Plasticity? A Retrospective and Prospective Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Two recent studies have demonstrated that the dendritic Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signal associated with a climbing fibre (CF) input to the cerebellar Purkinje neuron (PN) depends on the membrane potential (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;). Specifically, when the cell is hyperpolarised, this signal is mediated by T-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels; in contrast, when the cell is firing, the CF-PN signal is mediated by P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. When the CF input is paired with parallel fibre (PF) activity, the signal is locally amplified at the sites of PF-activated synapses according to the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; at the time of the CF input, suggesting that the standing &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is a critical parameter for the induction of PF synaptic plasticity. In this review, I analyse how the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; can potentially play a role in cerebellar learning focussing, in particular, on the hyperpolarised state that appears to occur episodically, since PNs are mostly firing under physiological conditions. By revisiting the recent literature reporting in vivo recordings and synaptic plasticity studies, I speculate on how a putative role of the PN &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; can provide an interpretation for the results of these studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
