	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2: SARS-CoV-2), which originated from Wuhan, China, has spread to the other countries in a short period of time. We report a 47-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital due to suffering from progressive vertigo and ataxia for 7 days prior to the admission. Neurological examination revealed cerebellar dysfunction, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) depicted edema of the cerebellar hemisphere associated with leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal and CSF specimens. As a result, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir was initiated, and patient symptoms and signs improved significantly during the course of hospitalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of acute cerebellitis associated with COVID-19 disease which is reported in the literature so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Crossed Cerebellar Diaschisis in Patients with Diffuse Glioma Is Associated with Impaired Supratentorial Cerebrovascular Reactivity and Worse Clinical Outcome</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) can be associated with impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and poor clinical outcome, but whether this holds true for patients with diffuse glioma is unknown. With blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD)-CVR imaging, we determined the presence of CCD in patients with diffuse glioma and investigated its relationship with cerebrovascular reactivity and clinical outcome. For eighteen enrolled subjects (nineteen datasets) with diffuse glioma, CCD was deferred from BOLD-CVR using a predetermined cerebellar asymmetry index (CAI) cutoff value of 6.0%. A FET-PET study was done as a verification of the CCD diagnosis. BOLD-CVR values as well as clinical performance scores (i.e., Karnofsky performance score (KPS), disability rating scale (DRS), and modified Rankin scale (mRS)) by BOLD-CVR scan at 3-month clinical follow-up were assessed and compared for the CCD-positive and CCD-negative group. CCD was present in 26.3% of subjects and strongly associated with impaired BOLD-CVR of the affected (i.e., the hemisphere harboring the glioma) and unaffected supratentorial hemisphere (CCD(+) vs. CCD(−): 0.08 ± 0.11 vs. 0.18 ± 0.04; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007 and 0.08 ± 0.12 vs. 0.19 ± 0.04; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007, respectively). This finding was independent of tumor volume (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.48). Furthermore, poorer initial (by scan) clinical performance scores at follow-up were found for the CCD(+) group. The presence of crossed cerebellar diaschisis in patients with diffuse glioma is associated with impaired supratentorial cerebrovascular reactivity and worse clinical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Ataxia Associated with CADASIL: a Pathology-Confirmed Case Report and Literature Review</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is primarily characterized by migraine, stroke, mood disturbances, and cognitive decline. Ataxia has seldom been reported as a presenting symptom. Here, we review reports of CADASIL presenting as ataxia and compare these to the first pathologically confirmed case of CADASIL presenting with progressive ataxia. A 50-year-old woman presented with progressive truncal ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed white matter hyperintensities in the bilateral anterior temporal lobes, external capsules, and periventricular areas, but not the cerebellum. Electron microscopy of skin biopsy material revealed multiple granular osmiophilic materials. Genetic testing confirmed a c.4552C &amp;gt; A mutation in exon 25 of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NOTCH3&lt;/em&gt; gene. CADASIL is a rare cause of progressive ataxia, and only four cases of CADASIL presenting with ataxia have been reported in the literature. We also discuss the possible pathophysiology of cerebellar ataxia associated with CADASIL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Cathodal Cerebellar tDCS Combined with Visual Feedback Improves Balance Control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01172-0</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Balance control is essential to maintain a stable body position and to prevent falls. The aim of this study was to determine whether balance control could be improved by using cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and visual feedback in a combined approach. A total of 90 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to six groups defined by the delivery of tDCS (cathodal or anodal or sham) and the provision or not of visual feedback on balance during the acquisition phase. tDCS was delivered over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the dominant leg for 20 min at 2 mA during a unipedal stance task. Body sway (i.e., ankle angle and hip position) was measured as an overall maximal unit in anteroposterior and mediolateral direction, together with participant rating of perception of stability, before (baseline), during (acquisition), and after (final) the intervention. We found a reduction in body sway during the acquisition session when visual feedback alone was provided. When the visual feedback was removed (final session), however, body sway increased above baseline. Differently, the reduction in overall maximal body sway was maintained during the final session when the delivery of cathodal tDCS and visual feedback was combined. These findings suggest that cathodal tDCS may support the short-term maintenance of the positive effects of visual feedback on balance and provide the basis for a new approach to optimize balance control, with potential translational implications for the elderly and patients with impaired posture control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Cerebellar Damage Affects Contextual Priors for Action Prediction in Patients with Childhood Brain Tumor</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01168-w</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01168-w</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Predictive coding accounts of action perception sustain that kinematics information is compared with contextual top-down predictions (i.e., priors) to understand actions in conditions of perceptual ambiguity. It has been previously shown that the cerebellum contributes to motor simulation of observed actions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a specific contribution of the cerebellum to action perception is to provide contextual priors that guide the sampling of perceptual kinematic information. To this aim, we compared the performance of 42 patients with childhood brain tumor affecting infratentorial (ITT) or supratentorial (STT) areas with that of peers with typical development in an action prediction task. First, participants were exposed to videos depicting a child performing different reaching-to-grasp actions, which were associated with contextual cues in a probabilistic fashion. Then, they were presented with shortened versions of the same videos and asked to infer the action outcome; since kinematics was ambiguous, we expected their responses would be biased toward the previously learned contextual priors. We found that patients with brain tumor were impaired in predicting actions when compared to healthy controls. However, STT patients presented a reliable probabilistic effect, while ITT patients, who had cerebellar damage, did not rely on contextual priors in predicting actions. Furthermore, we found an association between the use of contextual priors and the ability to infer others’ mental states as assessed by a standardized test. These results suggest that the cerebellum provides contextual priors to understand others’ actions and this predictive function might underlie complex social cognition abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is caused by unstable expanded CAG repeats (expCAGs) in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ATXN3&lt;/em&gt;. Factors associated with intergenerational instability (delta-expCAG) and genetic anticipation in SCA3 have never been reported in Chinese mainland. Here, we demonstrated that unstable transmissions occurred more often in sons than in daughters (91% vs 72%, Fisher’s exact test, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.012). The extended delta-expCAG of father-son transmissions was greater than that of mother-son transmissions (3.8 ± 2.3 repeats vs 1.6 ± 1.0 repeats, Mann-Whitney &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;U&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001). Genetic anticipation was frequently observed between generations but not affected by the delta-expCAG.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Cerebellar Intermittent Theta-Burst Stimulation Combined with Vestibular Rehabilitation Improves Gait and Balance in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis: a Preliminary Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01166-y</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Difficulties in gait and balance disorders are among the most common mobility limitations in multiple sclerosis (MS), mainly due to a damage of cerebellar circuits. Moreover, the cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting new motor tasks, which is an essential function for neurorehabilitation. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol able to increase cerebellar activity, on gait and balance in a sample of 20 hospitalized participants with MS, undergoing vestibular rehabilitation (VR), an exercise-based program primarily designed to reduce vertigo and dizziness, gaze instability, and/or imbalance and falls in MS. Patients were assigned to receive either c-iTBS or sham iTBS before being treated with VR during 2 weeks. VR consisted of two types of training: gaze stability and postural stability exercises. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in the Tinetti Balance and Gait scale (TBG). The secondary outcome measures were changes from baseline in Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Two Minute Walking Test (2MWT), and Timed 25-ft walk test (T25FW) scales. MS patients treated with c-iTBS-VR showed a significant improvement in the TBG as compared to patients treated with sham iTBS-VR. Moreover, MS patients in the c-iTBS groups showed better performances in the vestibular-ocular reflex exercises. Combined c-iTBS and VR improves gait and balance abilities more than standard VR treatment in MS patients with a high level of disability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Effects of Cerebellar tDCS on Inhibitory Control: Evidence from a Go/NoGo Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01165-z</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Response inhibition as an executive function refers to the ability to suppress inappropriate but prepotent responses. Several brain regions have been implicated in the process underlying inhibitory control, including the cerebellum. The aim of the present study was to explore the role of the cerebellum in executive functioning, particularly in response inhibition. For this purpose, we transitorily inhibited cerebellar activity by means of cathodal tDCS and studied the effects of this inhibition on ERP components elicited during a Go/NoGo task in healthy subjects. Sixteen healthy subjects underwent a Go/NoGo task prior to and after cathodal and sham cerebellar tDCS in separate sessions. A reduction in N2-NoGo amplitude and a prolongation in N2-NoGo latency emerged after cathodal tDCS whereas no differences were detected after sham stimulation. Moreover, commission errors in NoGo trials were significantly higher after cathodal tDCS than at the basal evaluation. No differences emerged between performances in Go trials and those after sham stimulation. These data indicate that cerebellar inhibition following cathodal stimulation alters the ability to allocate attentional resources to stimuli containing conflict information and the inhibitory control. The cerebellum may regulate the attentional mechanisms of stimulus orientation and inhibitory control both directly, by making predictions of errors or behaviors related to errors, and indirectly, by controlling the functioning of the cerebral cortical areas involved in the perception of conflict signals and of the basal ganglia involved in the inhibitory control of movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Is Purkinje Neuron Hyperpolarisation Important for Cerebellar Synaptic Plasticity? A Retrospective and Prospective Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Two recent studies have demonstrated that the dendritic Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signal associated with a climbing fibre (CF) input to the cerebellar Purkinje neuron (PN) depends on the membrane potential (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;). Specifically, when the cell is hyperpolarised, this signal is mediated by T-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels; in contrast, when the cell is firing, the CF-PN signal is mediated by P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. When the CF input is paired with parallel fibre (PF) activity, the signal is locally amplified at the sites of PF-activated synapses according to the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; at the time of the CF input, suggesting that the standing &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is a critical parameter for the induction of PF synaptic plasticity. In this review, I analyse how the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; can potentially play a role in cerebellar learning focussing, in particular, on the hyperpolarised state that appears to occur episodically, since PNs are mostly firing under physiological conditions. By revisiting the recent literature reporting in vivo recordings and synaptic plasticity studies, I speculate on how a putative role of the PN &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; can provide an interpretation for the results of these studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Cerebellar Volumes Associate with Behavioral Phenotypes in Prader-Willi Syndrome</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The objective of this study was to investigate lobule-specific cerebellar structural alterations relevant to clinical behavioral characteristics of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We performed a case-control study of 21 Japanese individuals with PWS (age; median 21.0, range 13–50 years, 14 males, 7 females) and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls with typical development. Participants underwent 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Three-dimensional T&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted images were assessed for cerebellar lobular volume and adjusted for total intracerebellar volume (TIV) using a spatially unbiased atlas template to give a relative volume ratio. A region of interest analysis included the deep cerebellar nuclei. A correlation analysis was performed between the volumetric data and the clinical behavioral scores derived from the standard questionnaires (hyperphagia, autism, obsession, and maladaptive index) for global intelligence assessment in paired subgroups. In individuals with PWS, TIV was significantly reduced compared with that of controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, family-wise error corrected; mean [standard deviation], 1014.1 [93.0] mm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Decreased relative lobular volume ratios were observed in posterior inferior lobules with age, sex, and TIV as covariates (Crus I, Crus II, lobules VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, and IX). However, increased ratios were found in the dentate nuclei bilaterally in individuals with PWS (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01); the mean (standard deviation) × 10&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; was as follows: left, 1.58 (0.26); right, 1.67 (0.30). The altered lobular volume ratios showed negative correlations with hyperphagic and autistic characteristics and positive correlations with obsessive and intellectual characteristics. This study provides the first objective evidence of topographic patterns of volume differences in cerebellar structures consistent with clinical behavioral characteristics in individuals with PWS and strongly suggests a cerebellar contribution to altered functional brain connectivity in PWS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Associations of Reading Efficiency with White Matter Properties of the Cerebellar Peduncles in Children</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Reading in children has been associated with microstructural properties of the cerebellar peduncles, the white matter pathways connecting the cerebellum to the cerebrum. In this study, we used two independent neuroimaging modalities to assess which features of the cerebellar peduncles would be associated with reading. Twenty-three 8-year-old children were evaluated on word reading efficiency and imaged using diffusion MRI (dMRI) and quantitative T1 relaxometry (qT1). We segmented the superior (SCP), middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles and extracted two metrics: fractional anisotropy (FA) from dMRI and R1 from qT1. Tract-FA was significantly correlated with tract-R1 in left and right SCPs (left: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(21) = .63, right: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(21) = .76, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; ≤ .001) suggesting that FA of these peduncles, at least in part, indexed myelin content. Tract-FA and tract R1 were not correlated in the other cerebellar peduncles. Reading efficiency negatively correlated with tract-FA of the left (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(21) = − .43, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = .040) and right SCP (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(21) = − .37, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = .079). Reading efficiency did not correlate with tract-R1 in the SCPs. The negative association of reading efficiency with tract-FA and the lack of association of reading efficiency with tract-R1 implicate properties other than myelin content as relevant to the information flow between the cerebellum and the cerebrum for individual differences in reading skills in children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Essential tremor (ET) has recently been reconceptualized by many as a degenerative disease of the cerebellum. Until now, though, there has been no attempt to frame it within the context of these diseases. Here, we compare the clinical and postmortem features of ET with other cerebellar degenerations, thereby placing it within the broader context of these diseases. Action tremor is the hallmark feature of ET. Although often underreported in the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), action tremors occur, and it is noteworthy that in SCA12 and 15, they are highly prevalent, often severe, and can be the earliest disease manifestation, resulting in an initial diagnosis of ET in many cases. Intention tremor, sometimes referred to as “cerebellar tremor,” is a common feature of ET and many SCAs. Other features of cerebellar dysfunction, gait ataxia and eye motion abnormalities, are seen to a mild degree in ET and more markedly in SCAs. Several SCAs (e.g., SCA5, 6, 14, and 15), like ET, follow a milder and more protracted disease course. In ET, numerous postmortem changes have been localized to the cerebellum and are largely confined to the cerebellar cortex, preserving the cerebellar nuclei. Purkinje cell loss is modest. Similarly, in SCA3, 12, and 15, Purkinje cell loss is limited, and in SCA12 and 15, there is preservation of cerebellar nuclei and relative sparing of other central nervous system regions. Both clinically and pathologically, there are numerous similarities and intersection points between ET and other disorders of cerebellar degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: GIRK1-Mediated Inwardly Rectifying Potassium Current Is a Candidate Mechanism Behind Purkinje Cell Excitability, Plasticity, and Neuromodulation</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels contribute to the resting membrane potential of many neurons and play an important role in controlling neuronal excitability. Although previous studies have revealed a high expression of GIRK subunits in the cerebellum, their functional role has never been clearly described. Using patch-clamp recordings in mice cerebellar slices, we examined the properties of the GIRK currents in Purkinje cells (PCs) and investigated the effects of a selective agonist of GIRK1-containing channels, ML297 (ML), on PC firing and synaptic plasticity. We demonstrated that GIRK channel activation decreases the PC excitability by inhibiting both sodium and calcium spikes and, in addition, modulates the complex spike response evoked by climbing fiber stimulation. Our results indicate that GIRK channels have also a marked effect on synaptic plasticity of the parallel fiber-PC synapse, as the application of ML297 increased the expression of LTP while preventing LTD. We, therefore, propose that the recruitment of GIRK channels represents a crucial mechanism by which neuromodulators can control synaptic strength and membrane conductance for proper refinement of the neural network involved in memory storage and higher cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Abnormal Cerebellar Volume in Patients with Remitted Major Depression with Persistent Cognitive Deficits</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar involvement in major depressive disorder (MDD) has been demonstrated by a growing number of studies, but it is unknown whether cognitive functioning in depressed individuals is related to cerebellar gray matter volume (GMV) abnormalities. Impaired attention and executive dysfunction are characteristic cognitive deficits in MDD, and critically, they often persist despite remission of mood symptoms. In this study, we investigated cerebellar GMV in patients with remitted MDD (rMDD) that showed persistent cognitive impairment. We applied cerebellum-optimized voxel-based morphometry in 37 patients with rMDD and with cognitive deficits, in 12 patients with rMDD and without cognitive deficits, and in 36 healthy controls (HC). Compared with HC, rMDD patients with cognitive deficits had lower GMV in left area VIIA, crus II, and in vermal area VIIB. In patients with rMDD, regression analyses demonstrated significant associations between GMV reductions in both regions and impaired attention and executive dysfunction. Compared with HC, patients without cognitive deficits showed increased GMV in bilateral area VIIIB. This study supports cerebellar contributions to the cognitive dimension of MDD. The data also point towards cerebellar area VII as a potential target for non-invasive brain stimulation to treat cognitive deficits related to MDD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Consensus Paper: Cerebellum and Social Cognition</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The traditional view on the cerebellum is that it controls motor behavior. Although recent work has revealed that the cerebellum supports also nonmotor functions such as cognition and affect, only during the last 5 years it has become evident that the cerebellum also plays an important social role. This role is evident in social cognition based on interpreting goal-directed actions through the movements of individuals (social “mirroring”) which is very close to its original role in motor learning, as well as in social understanding of other individuals’ mental state, such as their intentions, beliefs, past behaviors, future aspirations, and personality traits (social “mentalizing”). Most of this mentalizing role is supported by the posterior cerebellum (e.g., Crus I and II). The most dominant hypothesis is that the cerebellum assists in learning and understanding social action sequences, and so facilitates social cognition by supporting optimal predictions about imminent or future social interaction and cooperation. This consensus paper brings together experts from different fields to discuss recent efforts in understanding the role of the cerebellum in social cognition, and the understanding of social behaviors and mental states by others, its effect on clinical impairments such as cerebellar ataxia and autism spectrum disorder, and how the cerebellum can become a potential target for noninvasive brain stimulation as a therapeutic intervention. We report on the most recent empirical findings and techniques for understanding and manipulating cerebellar circuits in humans. Cerebellar circuitry appears now as a key structure to elucidate social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Sex-and Region-Dependent Expression of the Autism-Linked ADNP Correlates with Social- and Speech-Related Genes in the Canary Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP&lt;/em&gt;) syndrome is an autistic-like disorder, instigated by mutations in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP&lt;/em&gt;. This syndrome is characterized by developmental delays, impairments in speech, motor function, abnormal hearing, and intellectual disabilities. In the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Adnp&lt;/em&gt;-haploinsufficient mouse model, many of these impediments are evident, appearing in a sex-dependent manner. In zebra finch songbird (ZF; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Taeniopygia guttata&lt;/em&gt;), an animal model used for song/language studies, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP&lt;/em&gt; mRNA most robust expression is observed in the cerebrum of young males, potentially corroborating with male ZF exclusive singing behavior and developed cerebral song system. Herein, we report a similar sex-dependent &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP&lt;/em&gt; expression profile, with the highest expression in the cerebrum (qRT-PCR) in the brain of another songbird, the domesticated canary (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Serinus canaria domestica&lt;/em&gt;). Additional analyses for the mRNA transcripts of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP&lt;/em&gt; regulator, vasoactive intestinal peptide (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VIP&lt;/em&gt;), sister gene &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP2&lt;/em&gt;, and speech-related Forkhead box protein P2 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FoxP2&lt;/em&gt;) revealed multiple sex and brain region–dependent positive correlations between the genes (including &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP&lt;/em&gt;). Parallel transcript expression patterns for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FoxP2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VIP&lt;/em&gt; were observed alongside specific &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FoxP2&lt;/em&gt; increase in males compared with females as well as &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VIP/ADNP2&lt;/em&gt; correlations. In spatial view, a sexually independent extensive form of expression was found for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP&lt;/em&gt; in the canary cerebrum (RNA in situ hybridization). The songbird cerebral mesopallium area stood out as a potentially high-expressing &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADNP&lt;/em&gt; tissue, further strengthening the association of ADNP with sense integration and auditory memory formation, previously implicated in mouse and human.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Identification of Hub Genes in Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor by Bioinformatics Analyses</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is a devastating intracranial tumor in children. Currently, its molecular mechanisms cannot be studied effectively because patient samples are limited, and many factors are involved in its pathogenesis. In this study, we analyzed three gene expression profile data sets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify genes that participate in ATRT. The datasets were integrated and analyzed using the RobustRankAggreg method to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We identified 197 DEGs, including 94 downregulated and 103 upregulated genes which were then used for gene set enrichment analysis. The results showed that the downregulated genes were mainly enriched in synaptic vesicle cycle, nicotine addiction, and GABAergic synapse, whereas the upregulated genes were enriched in the cell cycle, p53 signaling pathway, and cellular senescence. Consistent with these results, gene set enrichment analysis showed that E2F targets, G2M checkpoints, and MYC targets were significantly enriched in datasets. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network revealed that CDK1, CCNA2, BUB1B, CDC20, KIF11, KIF20A, KIF2C, NCAPG, NDC80, NUSAP1, PBK, RRM2, TPX2, TOP2A, and TTK were hub genes. NetworkAnalyst algorithm was used to predict the transcription factor (TF), and the results showed that MYC, SOX2, and KDM5B could regulate these hub genes. In conclusion, the present study brings a new perspective of ATRT pathogenesis and the strategy targeted to cell cycle related gene may be promising treatments for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Identification of Circular RNA Expression Profiles and their Implication in Spinal Cord Injury Rats at the Immediate Phase</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study aimed to explore the implication of circular RNA (circRNA) expression profiles in spinal cord injury (SCI) rats at the immediate phase. CircRNA expression profiles in spinal cord samples from five SCI rats at the immediate phase (2 h post SCI) and five sham control (Ctrl) rats were assessed by microarray analysis. Subsequently, ten candidate circRNAs (obtained from microarray analysis) were validated in ten SCI rats at the immediate phase and ten Ctrl rats by the reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). PCA plots and heatmap analyses revealed that circRNA expression profiles could distinguish SCI rats at the immediate phase from Ctrl rats. Furthermore, 1101 circRNAs were upregulated and 897 circRNAs were downregulated in SCI rats at the immediate phase compared with Ctrl rats. These dysregulated circRNAs distributed on all chromosomes, and most of them located on chromosome 1–10. As for circRNA types, most of these dysregulated circRNAs were exonic. Additionally, enrichment analyses displayed that these dysregulated circRNAs were enriched in multiple signaling pathways related to neuronal signal transduction, immunity, and inflammation, such as the calcium signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway. Using RT-qPCR, eight out of ten candidate circRNAs (including rno_circRNA_011690, rno_circRNA_011494, rno_circRNA_005470, rno_circRNA_014301, rno_circRNA_009608, rno_circRNA_016031, rno_circRNA_011497, and rno_circRNA_015152) were dysregulated in SCI rats at the immediate phase compared with Ctrl rats. Our study provides a valuable reference for circRNA expression profiles in SCI rats at the immediate phase, which offers new clues for investigating mechanisms underlying the immediate phase and possible early intervention targets of SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Schizophrenia (SZ) is a complex and severe psychiatric disorder, which has a global lifetime prevalence of 0.4% and a heritability of around 0.81. A number of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have been carried out for SZ, with discordant results. The main aim of this study was to carry out an integrative in silico analysis of available genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in schizophrenia. In this work, an integration of multiple lines of evidence (top candidate genes from several EWAS and genome-wide expression and association data) was carried out, in order to identify top differentially methylated (DM) genes for SZ. In addition, functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction analyses were carried out. Several top differentially methylated genes, such as &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;APC, CACNB2,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PRKN,&lt;/em&gt; were found, and an enrichment of binding sites for brain-expressed transcription factors, such as &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FOXO1, MYB,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ZIC3&lt;/em&gt;, was also observed. Moreover, a protein-protein interaction network showed a central role for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;DISC1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ZNF688&lt;/em&gt; genes, and experimentally validated targets of MIR-137, such as and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KCNB2, NRXN1,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SYN2&lt;/em&gt;, were identified among DM genes. This is the first integrative in silico analysis of available genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in schizophrenia. This work identified novel candidate genes and pathways for SZ and provides the basis to explore their role in the pathogenesis of SZ in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Suicidal behavior as a psychological problem with high public health burden is associated with a number of genetically determined risk factors. In the current study, we investigated the association between two polymorphisms within the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NINJ2&lt;/em&gt; gene and risk of suicide in an Iranian population. The study included 295 individuals who attempted suicide with soft suicide methods, 234 suicide victims and 410 normal controls. The rs11833579 SNP was associated with death from suicide in a codominant model in that the AG genotype decreased the risk of death from suicide compared with the GG genotype (OR (95% CI) = 0.49 (0.34–0.71), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 4e−04). This SNP was also associated with death from suicide in dominant (AG + AA versus GG: OR (95% CI) = 0.63 (0.46–0.87), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.011) and overdominant (AG versus GG + AA: OR (95% CI) = 0.49 (0.35–0.69), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001) models. In addition, this SNP was associated with soft suicide attempts in a codominant model (AG versus AA + GG: OR (95% CI) = 0.7 (0.5–0.98), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.02). The rs3806263 SNP was associated with death from suicide in allelic (A versus G: OR (95% CI) = 1.48 (1.17–1.88), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.002), codominant (AA versus GG: OR (95% CI) = 3.14 (1.89–5.21), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001), recessive (AA versus GG + AG: OR (95% CI) = 3.47 (2.15–5.61), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001), overdominant (AG versus AA + GG: OR (95% CI) = 0.62 (0.45–0.87), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.0092) and log-additive models (OR (95% CI) = 1.45 (1.15–1.83), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.0034). When comparing allele/genotype frequencies of this SNP between suicide victims and soft suicide attempters, significant associations were found in allelic, codominant, recessive and log-additive models. The AG haplotype (rs11833579 and rs3806263, respectively) was significantly less prevalent among suicide victims compared with controls (OR (95% CI) = 0.37 (0.26–0.52), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001). This haplotype was also less prevalent among suicide victims vs. soft suicide attempters (OR (95% CI) = 0.43 (0.31–0.61), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001). The GA haplotype (rs11833579 and rs3806263, respectively) was less frequent among suicide victims compared with controls (OR (95% CI) = 0.63 (0.45–0.89), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.0156). Finally, the AA haplotype was more prevalent among suicide victims compared with both controls (OR (95% CI) = 2.37 (1.56–3.6), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.0002) and soft suicide attempters (OR (95% CI) = 1.92 (1.32–2.78), adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.0012). Thus, these two SNPs might be regarded as genetic determinants of suicide risk in Iranian populations. Further studies in different populations are needed to verify these results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The aim of this study was to determine the optimum frequency of electroacupuncture (EA) for the treatment of dysphagia after stroke. Male C57BL/6 J mice were randomly divided into five groups: normal, model, 2 Hz, 50 Hz, and 100 Hz groups. All mice received a photochemical ischemia, except the normal group. The EA parameters were 1 mA for 15 min, with different frequencies (2, 50, and 100 Hz) applied. After a three day treatment, neuronal activation was detected by the expression of c-Fos. A multi-channel electrophysiological technique was used to assess the discharge of contralateral neurons and the neuron types in each group. The concentration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the contralateral neurons was also examined. In addition, the dysfunction of swallowing in mice was calculated according to the lick counts and the lick–lick interval within a certain period of time. The number of c-Fos neurons (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) and the expression of BDNF (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) increased after the 2 Hz EA treatment. The total frequency of neuron discharge in the 2 Hz group increased compared with the model group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The pattern of sorted neuron populations was similar between the normal and 2 Hz groups. Consistent with these results, the lick counts increased (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) and the lick–lick interval decreased after the 2 Hz EA treatment, which indicated a functional improvement in swallowing. These results indicated that the 2 Hz EA treatment had a good effect on dysphagia after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: 3′UTRs Regulate Mouse Ntrk2 mRNA Distribution in Cortical Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;There are two major isoforms of NTRK2 (neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 2, or TrkB), full-length isoform with tyrosine kinase (TK) domain intact (+) and spliced isoform without tyrosine kinase domain (TK(−)). Within each isoform, there exist subtypes with minor modifications of the protein sequences. In human, the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NTRK2&lt;/em&gt; mRNA transcripts encoding TK(+) have same 3′UTRs, while the transcripts encoding subtypes of NTRK2 TK(−) have two completely different 3′UTRs. In mouse, the mRNA transcripts encoding same NTRK2 protein sequence for either TK(+) or TK(−) have long or short 3′UTRs, respectively. The physiological functions of these different 3′UTRs are still unknown. Pilocarpine stimulation increased &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ntrk2&lt;/em&gt; mRNA levels in soma, while the increase in synaptosome was smaller. FISH results further showed that mouse &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ntrk2&lt;/em&gt; transcripts with different 3′UTRs were distributed differently in cultured cortical neurons. The transcripts with long 3′UTR were distributed more in apical dendrites compared with transcripts with short 3′UTR. Our results provide evidence of non-coding 3′UTR function in regulating mRNA distribution in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Schizophrenia is a serious neurodevelopmental disorder. Genetics is an important factor leading to schizophrenia, but its exact role is still unclear. Many studies have focused on neurotransmitters and regulators that participate in the processes mediated by these neurotransmitters. Alcohol dehydrogenase may not only catalyze the oxidation of retinol and ethanol but also be involved in a variety of neurotransmitter metabolic pathways. Therefore, our study investigated whether &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADH7&lt;/em&gt; gene variations in the Chinese Han population were associated with schizophrenia. Genomic DNA was extracted from a cohort of 275 schizophrenic patients (136 men and 139 women) and 313 healthy controls (160 men and 153 women) from the Northern Han Chinese population. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test and linkage disequilibrium analysis were performed. Differences in genotypes, alleles, and haplotypes between the schizophrenic and control groups were determined using the chi-square test and correlation analysis. The distribution of the CC + TT genotype of rs284787 was statistically different between the case and control groups (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.026, OR = 1.448); however, the difference disappeared after Bonferroni correction. Linkage analysis indicated that rs739147, rs284787, rs3805329, rs894369, rs3805331, and rs284786 were closely linked in one block. The haplotype analysis found no association between the composed haplotypes and the occurrence of schizophrenia. Our study showed that the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ADH7&lt;/em&gt; gene was not associated with the risk of schizophrenia. Additional studies with larger cohorts of different ethnicities are needed to validate our findings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been proposed as useful medical carriers in the field of regenerative medicine. This study aimed to assess the direct conjugation ability of retinoic acid (RA) with AuNPs and to develop a strategy to differentiate the human adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (hADSCs) into neurons using AuNPs-RA. The physical properties of this nanocarrier were characterized using FT-IR, TEM, and FE-SEM. Moreover, the efficiency of RA conjugation on AuNPs was determined at 99% using UV-Vis spectroscopy. According to the MTT assay, an RA concentration of 66 μM caused a 50% inhibition of cell viability and AuNPs were not cytotoxic in concentrations below 5 μg/ml. Real-time PCR and immunocytochemistry proved that AuNPs-RA is able to increase the expression of neuronal marker genes and the number of neuronal protein (GFAP and MAP2)-positive cells, 14 days post-induction of hADSCs. Taken together, these results confirmed that the AuNPs-RA promote the neuronal differentiation of hADSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Convex optimization problems with staged structure appear in several
contexts, including optimal control, verification of deep neural networks, and
isotonic regression. Off-the-shelf solvers can solve these problems but may
scale poorly. We develop a nonconvex reformulation designed to exploit this
staged structure. Our reformulation has only simple bound constraints, enabling
solution via projected gradient methods and their accelerated variants. The
method automatically generates a sequence of primal and dual feasible solutions
to the original convex problem, making optimality certification easy. We
establish theoretical properties of the nonconvex formulation, showing that it
is (almost) free of spurious local minima and has the same global optimum as
the convex problem. We modify PGD to avoid spurious local minimizers so it
always converges to the global minimizer. For neural network verification, our
approach obtains small duality gaps in only a few gradient steps. Consequently,
it can quickly solve large-scale verification problems faster than both
off-the-shelf and specialized solvers.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synergies between wireless communications and artificial intelligence are
increasingly motivating research at the intersection of the two fields. On the
one hand, the presence of more and more wirelessly connected devices, each with
its own data, is driving efforts to export advances in machine learning (ML)
from high performance computing facilities, where information is stored and
processed in a single location, to distributed, privacy-minded, processing at
the end user. On the other hand, ML can address algorithm and model deficits in
the optimization of communication protocols. However, implementing ML models
for learning and inference on battery-powered devices that are connected via
bandwidth-constrained channels remains challenging. This paper explores two
ways in which Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can help address these open
problems. First, we discuss federated learning for the distributed training of
SNNs, and then describe the integration of neuromorphic sensing, SNNs, and
impulse radio technologies for low-power remote inference.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the operation of biological brains, Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs) have the unique ability to detect information encoded in spatio-temporal
patterns of spiking signals. Examples of data types requiring spatio-temporal
processing include logs of time stamps, e.g., of tweets, and outputs of neural
prostheses and neuromorphic sensors. In this paper, the second of a series of
three review papers on SNNs, we first review models and training algorithms for
the dominant approach that considers SNNs as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
and adapt learning rules based on backpropagation through time to the
requirements of SNNs. In order to tackle the non-differentiability of the
spiking mechanism, state-of-the-art solutions use surrogate gradients that
approximate the threshold activation function with a differentiable function.
Then, we describe an alternative approach that relies on probabilistic models
for spiking neurons, allowing the derivation of local learning rules via
stochastic estimates of the gradient. Finally, experiments are provided for
neuromorphic data sets, yielding insights on accuracy and convergence under
different SNN models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are biologically inspired machine learning
models that build on dynamic neuronal models processing binary and sparse
spiking signals in an event-driven, online, fashion. SNNs can be implemented on
neuromorphic computing platforms that are emerging as energy-efficient
co-processors for learning and inference. This is the first of a series of
three papers that introduce SNNs to an audience of engineers by focusing on
models, algorithms, and applications. In this first paper, we first cover
neural models used for conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and SNNs.
Then, we review learning algorithms and applications for SNNs that aim at
mimicking the functionality of ANNs by detecting or generating spatial patterns
in rate-encoded spiking signals. We specifically discuss ANN-to-SNN conversion
and neural sampling. Finally, we validate the capabilities of SNNs for
detecting and generating spatial patterns through experiments.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With the increase in interest in deployment of robots in unstructured
environments to work alongside humans, the development of human-like sense of
touch for robots becomes important. In this work, we implement a multi-channel
neuromorphic tactile system that encodes contact events as discrete spike
events that mimic the behavior of slow adapting mechanoreceptors. We study the
impact of information pooling across artificial mechanoreceptors on
classification performance of spatially non-uniform naturalistic textures. We
encoded the spatio-temporal activation patterns of mechanoreceptors through
gray-level co-occurrence matrix computed from time-varying mean spiking
rate-based tactile response volume. We found that this approach greatly
improved texture classification in comparison to use of individual
mechanoreceptor response alone. In addition, the performance was also more
robust to changes in sliding velocity. The importance of exploiting precise
spatial and temporal correlations between sensory channels is evident from the
fact that on either removal of precise temporal information or altering of
spatial structure of response pattern, a significant performance drop was
observed. This study thus demonstrates the superiority of population coding
approaches that can exploit the precise spatio-temporal information encoded in
activation patterns of mechanoreceptor populations. It, therefore, makes an
advance in the direction of development of bio-inspired tactile systems
required for realistic touch applications in robotics and prostheses.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Neural Network Approximation: Three Hidden Layers Are Enough. (arXiv:2010.14075v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14075</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14075</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A three-hidden-layer neural network with super approximation power is
introduced. This network is built with the Floor function ($\lfloor x\rfloor$),
the exponential function ($2^x$), the step function ($\one_{x\geq 0}$), or
their compositions as activation functions in each neuron and hence we call
such networks as Floor-Exponential-Step (FLES) networks. For any width
hyper-parameter $N\in\mathbb{N}^+$, it is shown that FLES networks with a width
$\max\{d,\, N\}$ and three hidden layers can uniformly approximate a H{\&quot;o}lder
function $f$ on $[0,1]^d$ with an exponential approximation rate $3\lambda
d^{\alpha/2}2^{-\alpha N}$, where $\alpha \in(0,1]$ and $\lambda$ are the
H{\&quot;o}lder order and constant, respectively. More generally for an arbitrary
continuous function $f$ on $[0,1]^d$ with a modulus of continuity
$\omega_f(\cdot)$, the constructive approximation rate is
$\omega_f(\sqrt{d}\,2^{-N})+2\omega_f(\sqrt{d}){2^{-N}}$. As a consequence,
this new {class of networks} overcomes the curse of dimensionality in
approximation power when the variation of $\omega_f(r)$ as $r\rightarrow 0$ is
moderate (e.g., $\omega_f(r){\lesssim} r^\alpha$ for H{\&quot;o}lder continuous
functions), since the major term to be concerned in our approximation rate is
essentially $\sqrt{d}$ times a function of $N$ independent of $d$ within the
modulus of continuity.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Classical approaches in learning theory are often seen to yield very loose
generalization bounds for deep neural networks. Using the example of &quot;stability
and generalization&quot; \citep{bousquet2002stability}, however, we demonstrate that
generalization bounds can be significantly improved by taking into account
refined characteristics of modern neural networks. Specifically, this paper
proposes a new notion of algorithmic stability termed \textit{locally elastic
stability} in light of a certain phenomenon in the training of neural networks
\citep{he2020local}. We prove that locally elastic stability implies a tighter
generalization bound than that derived based on uniform stability in many
situations. When applied to deep neural networks, our new generalization bound
attaches much more meaningful confidence statements to the performance on
unseen data than existing algorithmic stability notions, thereby shedding light
on the effectiveness of modern neural networks in real-world applications.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modeling patient disease progression using Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
is critical to assist clinical decision making. While most of prior work has
mainly focused on developing effective disease progression models using EHRs
collected from an individual medical system, relatively little work has
investigated building robust yet generalizable diagnosis models across
different systems. In this work, we propose a general domain adaptation (DA)
framework that tackles two categories of discrepancies in EHRs collected from
different medical systems: one is caused by heterogeneous patient populations
(covariate shift) and the other is caused by variations in data collection
procedures (systematic bias). Prior research in DA has mainly focused on
addressing covariate shift but not systematic bias. In this work, we propose an
adversarial domain separation framework that addresses both categories of
discrepancies by maintaining one globally-shared invariant latent
representation across all systems} through an adversarial learning process,
while also allocating a domain-specific model for each system to extract local
latent representations that cannot and should not be unified across systems.
Moreover, our proposed framework is based on variational recurrent neural
network (VRNN) because of its ability to capture complex temporal dependencies
and handling missing values in time-series data. We evaluate our framework for
early diagnosis of an extremely challenging condition, septic shock, using two
real-world EHRs from distinct medical systems in the U.S. The results show that
by separating globally-shared from domain-specific representations, our
framework significantly improves septic shock early prediction performance in
both EHRs and outperforms the current state-of-the-art DA models.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Solving optimization problems is the key to decision making in many real-life
analytics applications. However, the coefficients of the optimization problems
are often uncertain and dependent on external factors, such as future demand or
energy or stock prices. Machine learning (ML) models, especially neural
networks, are increasingly being used to estimate these coefficients in a
data-driven way. Hence, end-to-end predict-and-optimize approaches, which
consider how effective the predicted values are to solve the optimization
problem, have received increasing attention. In case of integer linear
programming problems, a popular approach to overcome their non-differentiabilty
is to add a quadratic penalty term to the continuous relaxation, such that
results from differentiating over quadratic programs can be used. Instead we
investigate the use of the more principled logarithmic barrier term, as widely
used in interior point solvers for linear programming. Specifically, instead of
differentiating the KKT conditions, we consider the homogeneous self-dual
formulation of the LP and we show the relation between the interior point step
direction and corresponding gradients needed for learning. Finally our
empirical experiments demonstrate our approach performs as good as if not
better than the state-of-the-art QPTL (Quadratic Programming task loss)
formulation of Wilder et al. and SPO approach of Elmachtoub and Grigas.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our interest is in scientific problems with the following characteristics:
(1) Data are naturally represented as graphs; (2) The amount of data available
is typically small; and (3) There is significant domain-knowledge, usually
expressed in some symbolic form. These kinds of problems have been addressed
effectively in the past by Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), by virtue of 2
important characteristics: (a) The use of a representation language that easily
captures the relation encoded in graph-structured data, and (b) The inclusion
of prior information encoded as domain-specific relations, that can alleviate
problems of data scarcity, and construct new relations. Recent advances have
seen the emergence of deep neural networks specifically developed for
graph-structured data (Graph-based Neural Networks, or GNNs). While GNNs have
been shown to be able to handle graph-structured data, less has been done to
investigate the inclusion of domain-knowledge. Here we investigate this aspect
of GNNs empirically by employing an operation we term &quot;vertex-enrichment&quot; and
denote the corresponding GNNs as &quot;VEGNNs&quot;. Using over 70 real-world datasets
and substantial amounts of symbolic domain-knowledge, we examine the result of
vertex-enrichment across 5 different variants of GNNs. Our results provide
support for the following: (a) Inclusion of domain-knowledge by
vertex-enrichment can significantly improve the performance of a GNN. That is,
the performance VEGNNs is significantly better than GNNs across all GNN
variants; (b) The inclusion of domain-specific relations constructed using ILP
improves the performance of VEGNNs, across all GNN variants. Taken together,
the results provide evidence that it is possible to incorporate symbolic domain
knowledge into a GNN, and that ILP can play an important role in providing
high-level relationships that are not easily discovered by a GNN.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With more and more event-based neuromorphic hardware systems being developed
at universities and in industry, there is a growing need for assessing their
performance with domain specific measures. In this work, we use the methodology
of converting pre-trained non-spiking to spiking neural networks to evaluate
the performance loss and measure the energy-per-inference for three
neuromorphic hardware systems (BrainScaleS, Spikey, SpiNNaker) and common
simulation frameworks for CPU (NEST) and CPU/GPU (GeNN). For analog hardware we
further apply a re-training technique known as hardware-in-the-loop training to
cope with device mismatch. This analysis is performed for five different
networks, including three networks that have been found by an automated
optimization with a neural architecture search framework. We demonstrate that
the conversion loss is usually below one percent for digital implementations,
and moderately higher for analog systems with the benefit of much lower
energy-per-inference costs.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: LRR-Containing Oncofetal Trophoblast Glycoprotein 5T4 Shapes Neural Circuits in Olfactory and Visual Systems</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In mammals, the sensory experience can regulate the development of various brain structures, including the cortex, hippocampus, retina, and olfactory bulb (OB). Odor experience-evoked neural activity drives the development of dendrites on excitatory projection neurons in the OB, such as mitral and tufted cells, as well as inhibitory interneurons. OB interneurons are generated continuously in the subventricular zone and differentiate into granule cells (GCs) and periglomerular cells (PGCs). However, it remains unknown what role each type of OB interneuron plays in controlling olfactory behaviors. Recent studies showed that among the various types of OB interneurons, a subtype of GCs expressing oncofetal trophoblast glycoprotein 5T4 is required for simple odor detection and discrimination behaviors. Mouse 5T4 (also known as Tpbg) is a type I membrane glycoprotein whose extracellular domain contains seven leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) sandwiched between characteristic LRR-N and LRR-C regions. Recently, it was found that the developmental expression of 5T4 increases dramatically in the retina just before eye-opening. Single-cell transcriptomics further suggests that 5T4 is involved in the development and maintenance of functional synapses in a subset of retinal interneurons, including rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and amacrine cells (ACs). Collectively, 5T4, expressed in interneurons of the OB and retina, plays a key role in sensory processing in the olfactory and visual systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the tissue-resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies based on bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing in mice indicate high relevance of microglia with respect to risk genes and neuro-inflammation in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we investigated microglia transcriptomes at bulk and single-cell levels in non-demented elderly and AD donors using acute human postmortem cortical brain samples. We identified seven human microglial subpopulations with heterogeneity in gene expression. Notably, gene expression profiles and subcluster composition of microglia did not differ between AD donors and non-demented elderly in bulk RNA sequencing nor in single-cell sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Systems Biology: Multimodal Glioma Image Segmentation Using Dual Encoder Structure and Channel Spatial Attention Block</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multimodal medical images provide significant amounts of complementary semantic information. Therefore, multimodal medical imaging has been widely used in the segmentation of gliomas through computational neural networks. However, inputting images from different sources directly to the network does not achieve the best segmentation effect. This paper describes a convolutional neural network called F-S-Net that fuses the information from multimodal medical images and uses the semantic information contained within these images for glioma segmentation. The architecture of F-S-Net is formed by cascading two sub-networks. The first sub-network projects the multimodal medical images into the same semantic space, which ensures they have the same semantic metric. The second sub-network uses a dual encoder structure (DES) and a channel spatial attention block (CSAB) to extract more detailed information and focus on the lesion area. DES and CSAB are integrated into U-Net architectures. A multimodal glioma dataset collected by Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College is used to train and evaluate the network. F-S-Net is found to achieve a dice coefficient of 0.9052 and Jaccard similarity of 0.8280, outperforming several previous segmentation methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Positive Economic, Psychosocial, and Physiological Ecologies Predict Brain Structure and Cognitive Performance in 9–10-Year-Old Children</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578822</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;While low socioeconomic status (SES) introduces risk for developmental outcomes among children, there are an array of proximal processes that determine the ecologies and thus the lived experiences of children. This study examined interrelations between 22 proximal measures in the economic, psychosocial, physiological, and perinatal ecologies of children, in association with brain structure and cognitive performance in a diverse sample of 8,158 9–10-year-old children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. SES was measured by the income-to-needs ratio (INR), a measure used by federal poverty guidelines. Within the ABCD study, in what is one of the largest and most diverse cohorts of children studied in the United States, we replicate associations of low SES with lower total cortical surface area and worse cognitive performance. Associations between low SES (&amp;lt;200% INR) and measures of development showed the steepest increases with INR, with apparent increases still visible beyond the level of economic disadvantage in the range of 200–400% INR. Notably, we found three latent factors encompassing positive ecologies for children across the areas of economic, psychosocial, physiological, and perinatal well-being in association with better cognitive performance and the higher total cortical surface area beyond the effects of SES. Specifically, latent factors encompassing youth perceived social support and perinatal well-being were positive predictors of developmental measures for all children, regardless of SES. Further, we found a general latent factor that explained relationships between 20 of the proximal measures and encompassed a joint ecology of higher social and economic resources relative to low adversity across psychosocial, physiological, and perinatal domains. The association between the resource-to-adversity latent factor and cognitive performance was moderated by SES, such that for children in higher SES households, cognitive performance progressively increased with these latent factor scores, while for lower SES, cognitive performance increased only among children with the highest latent factor scores. Our findings suggest that both positive ecologies of increased access to resources and lower adversity are mutually critical for promoting better cognitive development in children from low SES households. Our findings inform future studies aiming to examine positive factors that influence healthier development in children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Age as a Mediator of tDCS Effects on Pain: An Integrative Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.568306</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.568306</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulatory technique with the potential to decrease pain scores and to improve chronic pain treatment. Although age is an essential factor that might impact the tDCS effect, most studies are solely conducted in adults. Therefore, the age limitation presents a critical research gap in this field and can be shown by only a handful of studies that have included other age groups. To examine the evidence upon the tDCS effect on pain scores on children, adolescents, or elderly, and indirectly, to infer the age-dependent impact on tDCS effects, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic review searching the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, and Science Direct using the following search terms adapted according to MeSh or Entree: [(“Adolescent” OR “Children” OR “Elderly”) AND (“tDCS”) AND (“Pain” OR “Pain threshold”) AND (“dorsolateral prefrontal cortex” OR “Motor cortex)] up to April 20th, 2020. We retrieved 228 articles, 13 were included in the systematic review, and five studies with elderly subjects that had their outcomes assessed by pain score or pain threshold were included in the meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: For the analysis of pain score, 96 individuals received active stimulation, and we found a favorable effect for active tDCS to reduce pain score compared to sham (P = 0.002). The standardized difference was −0.76 (CI 95% = −1.24 to −0.28). For the pain threshold, the analysis showed no significant difference between active and sham tDCS. We reviewed two studies with adolescents: one study using anodal tDCS over the prefrontal cortex reported a reduction in pain scores. However, the second study reported an increase in pain sensitivity for the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our findings suggest tDCS may reduce pain levels in the elderly group. Nevertheless, the small number of studies included in this review—and the considerable heterogeneity for clinical conditions and protocols of stimulation present—limits the support of tDCS use for pain treatment in elderly people. Larger studies on the tDCS effect on pain are needed to be conducted in elderly and adolescents, also evaluating different montages and electrical current intensity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: N-Back Related ERPs Depend on Stimulus Type, Task Structure, Pre-processing, and Lab Factors</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The N-Back, a common working memory (WM) updating task, is increasingly used in basic and applied psychological research. As such, an increasing number of electroencephalogram (EEG) studies have sought to identify the electrophysiological signatures of N-Back task performance. However, stimulus type, task structure, pre-processing methods, and differences in the laboratory environment, including the EEG recording setup employed, greatly vary across studies, which in turn may introduce inconsistencies in the obtained results. Here we address this issue by conducting nine different variations of an N-Back task manipulating stimulus type and task structure. Furthermore, we explored the effect of the pre-processing method used and differences in the laboratory environment. Results reveal significant differences in behavioral and electrophysiological signatures in response to N-Back stimulus type, task structure, pre-processing method, and laboratory environment. In conclusion, we suggest that experimental factors, analysis pipeline, and laboratory differences, which are often ignored in the literature, need to be accounted for when interpreting findings and making comparisons across studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an effective invasive treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) at present. Due to the invasiveness and cost of operations, a reliable tool is required to predict the outcome of therapy in the clinical decision-making process. This work aims to investigate whether the topological network of functional connectivity states can predict the outcome of DBS without medication. Fifty patients were recruited to extract the features of the brain related to the improvement rate of PD after STN-DBS and to train the machine learning model that can predict the therapy's effect. The functional connectivity analyses suggested that the GBRT model performed best with Pearson's correlations of r = 0.65, p = 2.58E−07 in medication-off condition. The connections between middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) contribute most in the GBRT model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Engrams of Fast Learning</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fast learning designates the behavioral and neuronal mechanisms underlying the acquisition of a long-term memory trace after a unique and brief experience. As such it is opposed to incremental, slower reinforcement or procedural learning requiring repetitive training. This learning process, found in most animal species, exists in a large spectrum of natural behaviors, such as one-shot associative, spatial, or perceptual learning, and is a core principle of human episodic memory. We review here the neuronal and synaptic long-term changes associated with fast learning in mammals and discuss some hypotheses related to their underlying mechanisms. We first describe the variety of behavioral paradigms used to test fast learning memories: those preferentially involve a single and brief (from few hundred milliseconds to few minutes) exposures to salient stimuli, sufficient to trigger a long-lasting memory trace and new adaptive responses. We then focus on neuronal activity patterns observed during fast learning and the emergence of long-term selective responses, before documenting the physiological correlates of fast learning. In the search for the engrams of fast learning, a growing body of evidence highlights long-term changes in gene expression, structural, intrinsic, and synaptic plasticities. Finally, we discuss the potential role of the sparse and bursting nature of neuronal activity observed during the fast learning, especially in the induction plasticity mechanisms leading to the rapid establishment of long-term synaptic modifications. We conclude with more theoretical perspectives on network dynamics that could enable fast learning, with an overview of some theoretical approaches in cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neuroprotective Effects of Isosteviol Sodium in Murine Brain Capillary Cerebellar Endothelial Cells (cerebEND) After Hypoxia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It damages neurons and other supporting cellular elements in the brain. However, the impairment is not only confined to the region of assault but the surrounding area as well. Besides, it also brings about damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which in turn leads to microvascular failure and edema. Hence, this necessitates an on-going, continuous search for intervention strategies and effective treatment. Of late, the natural sweetener stevioside proved to exhibit neuroprotective effects and therapeutic benefits against cerebral ischemia-induced injury. Its injectable formulation, isosteviol sodium (STVNA) also demonstrated favorable results. Nonetheless, its effects on the BBB have not yet been investigated to date. As such, this present study was designed to assess the effects of STVNA in our in vitro stroke model of the BBB.The integrity and permeability of the BBB are governed and maintained by tight junction proteins (TJPs) such as claudin-5 and occludin. Our data show increased claudin-5 and occludin expression in oxygen and glucose (OGD)-deprived murine brain capillary cerebellar endothelial cells (cerebEND) after STVNa treatment. Likewise, the upregulation of the transmembrane protein integrin-αv was also observed. Finally, cell volume was reduced with the simultaneous administration of STVNA and OGD in cerebEND cells. In neuropathologies such as stroke, the failure of cell volume control is a major feature leading to loss of cells in the penumbra as well as adverse outcomes. Our initial findings, therefore, point to the neuroprotective effects of STVNA at the BBB in vitro, which warrant further investigation for a possible future clinical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: MiR34a Regulates Neuronal MHC Class I Molecules and Promotes Primary Hippocampal Neuron Dendritic Growth and Branching</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.573208</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.573208</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the immune system, Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) molecules are located on the surface of most nucleated cells in vertebrates where they mediate immune responses. Accumulating evidence indicates that MHC-I molecules are also expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) where they play important roles that are significantly different from their immune functions. Classical MHC-I molecules are temporally and spatially expressed in the developing and adult CNS, where they participate in the synaptic formation, remodeling and plasticity. Therefore, clarifying the regulation of MHC-I expression is necessary to develop an accurate understanding of its function in the CNS. Here, we show that microRNA 34a (miR34a), a brain enriched noncoding RNA, is temporally expressed in developing hippocampal neurons, and its expression is significantly increased after MHC-I protein abundance is decreased in the hippocampus. Computational algorithms identify putative miR34a target sites in the 3′UTR of MHC-I mRNA, and here we demonstrate direct targeting of miR34a to MHC-I mRNA using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. MiR34a targeting can decrease constitutive MHC-I expression in both Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells and primary hippocampal neurons. Finally, miR34a mediated reduction of MHC-I results in increased dendritic growth and branching in cultured hippocampal neurons. Taken together, our findings identify miR34a as a novel regulator of MHC-I for shaping neural morphology in developing hippocampal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Does Cholinergic Stimulation Affect the P2X7 Receptor-Mediated Dye Uptake in Mast Cells and Macrophages?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.548376</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.548376</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Extracellular ATP is a powerful trigger of neuroinflammation by activating immune cells via P2X7 receptors. Acetylcholine and nicotinic agonists inhibit ATP-triggered proinflammatory cytokines via the so-called “cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway” (CAP). However, it remains unclear as to what stage of ATP-induced signaling cholinergic agents provide this anti-inflammatory effect. Using the specific property of P2X7 receptor to open a pathway permeable to large molecules, associated with activation of inflammasome, we studied the action of cholinergic agents on this key event in CAP activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Freshly isolated mouse peritoneal mast cells and primary human macrophages were used. To assess P2X7 channel opening, the permeability to the fluorescent dye YO-PRO1 or ethidium bromide (EtBr) was measured by flow cytometry. Expression of nicotinic receptors was probed in macrophages with the fluorescently labeled α-bungarotoxin or with patch-clamp recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: ATP opened P2X7 ion channels in mast cells and macrophages permeable to YO-PRO1 or EtBr, respectively. This stimulatory effect in mast cells was inhibited by the specific P2X7 antagonist A839977 confirming that YO-PRO1 uptake was mediated via ATP-gated P2X7 ion channels. Cholinergic agents also slightly induced dye uptake to mast cells but not in macrophages, which expressed functional α7 nicotinic receptors. However, both in mast cells and in macrophages, acetylcholine and nicotine failed to inhibit the stimulatory effect of ATP on dye uptake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These data suggest that in immune cells, cholinergic agents do not act on P2X7 receptor-coupled large pore formation but can mediate the anti-inflammatory effect underlying CAP downstream of ATP-driven signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Aging Impacts the Overall Connectivity Strength of Regions Critical for Information Transfer Among Brain Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have demonstrated that connector hubs, regions considered critical for the flow of information across neural systems, are mostly involved in neurodegenerative dementia. Considering that aging can significantly affect the brain’s intrinsic connectivity, identifying aging’s impact on these regions’ overall connection strength is important to differentiate changes associated with healthy aging from neurodegenerative disorders. Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a carefully selected cohort of 175 healthy volunteers aging from 21 to 86 years old, we computed an intrinsic connectivity contrast (ICC) metric, which quantifies a region’s overall connectivity strength, for whole brain, short-range, and long-range connections and examined age-related changes of this metric over the adult lifespan. We have identified a limited number of hub regions with ICC values that showed significant negative relationship with age. These include the medial precentral/midcingulate gyri and insula with both their short-range and long-range (and thus whole-brain) ICC values negatively associated with age, and the angular, middle frontal, and posterior cingulate gyri with their long-range ICC values mainly involved. Seed-based connectivity analyses further confirmed that these regions are connector hubs with connectivity profile that strongly overlapped with multiple large-scale brain networks. General cognitive performance was not associated with these hubs’ ICC values. These findings suggest that even healthy aging could negatively impact the efficiency of regions critical for facilitating information transfer among different functional brain networks. The extent of the regions involved, however, was limited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Related Alterations in Prelimbic Cortical Neuron Arc Expression Vary by Behavioral State and Cortical Layer</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.588297</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prefrontal cortical and medial temporal lobe connectivity is critical for higher cognitive functions that decline in older adults. Likewise, these cortical areas are among the first to show anatomical, functional, and biochemical alterations in advanced age. The prelimbic subregion of the prefrontal cortex and the perirhinal cortex of the medial temporal lobe are densely reciprocally connected and well-characterized as undergoing age-related neurobiological changes that correlate with behavioral impairment. Despite this fact, it remains to be determined how changes within these brain regions manifest as alterations in their functional connectivity. In our previous work, we observed an increased probability of age-related dysfunction for perirhinal cortical neurons that projected to the prefrontal cortex in old rats compared to neurons that were not identified as projection neurons. The current study was designed to investigate the extent to which aged prelimbic cortical neurons also had altered patterns of Arc expression during behavior, and if this was more evident in those cells that had long-range projections to the perirhinal cortex. The expression patterns of the immediate-early gene Arc were quantified in behaviorally characterized rats that also received the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B (CTB) in the perirhinal cortex to identify projection neurons to this region. As in our previous work, the current study found that CTB+ cells were more active than those that did not have the tracer. Moreover, there were age-related reductions in prelimbic cortical neuron Arc expression that correlated with a reduced ability of aged rats to multitask. Unlike the perirhinal cortex, however, the age-related reduction in Arc expression was equally likely in CTB+ and CTB− negative cells. Thus, the selective vulnerability of neurons with long-range projections to dysfunction in old age may be a unique feature of the perirhinal cortex. Together, these observations identify a mechanism involving prelimbic-perirhinal cortical circuit disruption in cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Age is the largest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and contributes to cognitive impairment in otherwise healthy individuals. Thus, it is critical that we better understand the risk aging presents to vulnerable regions of the brain and carefully design therapeutics to address those effects. In this study we examined age-related changes in cAMP-regulatory protein, phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D). Inhibition of PDE4D is currently under investigation as a therapeutic target for AD based on memory-enhancing effects in rodent hippocampus. Therefore, it is important to understand the role of PDE4D in brain regions particularly vulnerable to disease such as the frontal association cortex (FC), where cAMP signaling can impair working memory via opening of potassium channels. We found that PDE4D protein level was decreased in the FC of both moderately and extremely aged rats, and that PDE4D level was correlated with performance on a FC-dependent working memory task. In extremely aged rats, PDE4D was also inversely correlated with levels of phosphorylated tau at serine 214 (S214), a site phosphorylated by protein kinase A. In vitro studies of the PDE4D inhibitor, GEBR-7b, further illustrated that inhibition of PDE4D activity enhanced phosphorylation of tau. pS214-tau phosphorylation is associated with early AD tau pathology, promotes tau dissociation from microtubules and primes subsequent tau hyperphosphorylation at other critical AD-related sites. Age-related loss of PDE4D may thus contribute to the specific vulnerability of the FC to degeneration in AD, and play a critical role in normal cAMP regulation, cautioning against the use of pan-PDE4D inhibitors as therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Connecting Alzheimer’s Disease With Diabetes Mellitus Through Amyloidogenic Evolvability</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been clearlylinked to oxidative stress and amylin amyloidosis in pancreatic β-cells. Yet despite extensive investigation, the biological significance of this is not fully understood. Recently, we proposed that Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-relevant amyloidogenic proteins (APs), such as amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, might be involved in evolvability against diverse stressors in the brain. Given the analogous cellular stress environments shared by both T2DM and AD, the objective of this study is to explore T2DM pathogenesis from the viewpoint of amyloidogenic evolvability. Similar to AD-related APs, protofibrillar amylin might confer resistance against the multiple stressors in β-cells and be transmitted to offspring to deliver stress information, in the absence of which, type 1 DM (T1DM) in offspring might develop. On the contrary, T2DM may be manifested through an antagonistic pleiotropy mechanism during parental aging. Such evolvability-associated processes might be affected by parental diabetic conditions, including T1DM and T2DM. Furthermore, the T2DM-mediated increase in AD risk during aging might be attributed to an interaction of amylin with AD-related APs through evolvability, in which amylin protofibrillar formation presumably caused by adiponectin (APN) resistance could increase protofibril formation of AD-related APs in evolvability and subsequently lead to T2DM promotion of AD through antagonistic pleiotropy in aging. This suggests that targeting APN combined with an anti-T2DM agent might be therapeutic against neurodegeneration. Collectively, T1DM and T2DM might be linked through amylin evolvability, and a better understanding of amyloidogenic evolvability might also reveal clues to therapeutic interventions for AD comorbid with T2DM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Correlation of Serum BACE1 With Emergence Delirium in Postoperative Patients: A Preliminary Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.555594</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.555594</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The mechanism underlying delirium, a common acute fluctuating mental state, may be related to the activation of a neuroinflammatory response. In this study, we attempted to investigate whether plasma inflammatory response markers, vascular and cerebrovascular injury-related markers, and neurodegeneration-associated markers were associated with emergence delirium (ED).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Patients aged 50 years or above who underwent elective laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia were included in this study. Delirium was assessed postoperatively with the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) and the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) scale. Plasma samples were collected from ED patients and non-ED patients to test concentrations of inflammation markers, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1), S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), lipoprotein-associated phospholipase-A2 (Lp-PLA2), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF); vascular and cerebrovascular injury-related markers, including intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1); and neurodegeneration-associated markers, including alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) and β-secretase 1 (BACE1). Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between biomarkers and ED, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyze the diagnostic value of biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 104 patients were included in this study, with an average age of 63.69 ± 7.21. IL-6 (OR = 2.73, 95% CI: 1.66–6.44, P = 0.022), S100B (OR = 4.74, 95% CI: 1.88–11.95, P = 0.001), and BACE1 (OR = 6.54, 95% CI: 2.57–16.65, P &amp;lt; 0.000) were independent biological indicators for the occurrence of ED.CHI3L1, Lp-PLA2, MIF, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and α-Syn were unrelated to ED. Plasma BACE1 level had a possible diagnostic value for ED [area under curve (AUC) = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.66–0.85], whereas plasma IL-6 (AUC = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.51–0.73) and S100B (AUC = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.54–0.76) levels had little diagnostic value for distinguishing ED vs. non-ED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Higher levels of systemic inflammation marker IL-6, cerebral inflammation marker S100B, and neurodegeneration-associated marker BACE1 are related to ED. Plasma BACE1 may be a potential diagnostic biomarker for ED.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Iterative point set registration for aligning scRNA-seq data</title>

Several studies profile similar single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data using different technologies and platforms. A number of alignment methods have been developed to enable the integration and comparison of scRNA-Seq data from such studies. While each performs well on some of the datasets, to date no method was able to both perform the alignment using the original expression space and generalize to new data. To enable such analysis we developed Single Cell Iterative Point set Registration (SCIPR) which extends methods that were successfully applied to align image data to scRNA-Seq. We discuss the required changes needed, the resulting optimization function, and algorithms for learning a transformation function for aligning data. We tested SCIPR on several scRNA-Seq datasets. As we show it successfully aligns data from several different cell types, improving upon prior methods proposed for this task. In addition, we show the parameters learned by SCIPR can be used to align data not used in the training and to identify key cell type-specific genes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Kh5vLl7Cj2I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Modeling flexible behavior in childhood to adulthood shows age-dependent learning mechanisms and less optimal learning in autism in each age group</title>

Flexible behavior is critical for everyday decision-making and has been implicated in restricted, repetitive behaviors (RRB) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, how flexible behavior changes developmentally in ASD remains largely unknown. Here, we used a developmental approach and examined flexible behavior on a probabilistic reversal learning task in 572 children, adolescents, and adults (ASD &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 321; typical development [TD] &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 251). Using computational modeling, we quantified latent variables that index mechanisms underlying perseveration and feedback sensitivity. We then assessed these variables in relation to diagnosis, developmental stage, core autism symptomatology, and associated psychiatric symptoms. Autistic individuals showed on average more perseveration and less feedback sensitivity than TD individuals, and, across cases and controls, older age groups showed more feedback sensitivity than younger age groups. Computational modeling revealed that dominant learning mechanisms underpinning flexible behavior differed across developmental stages and reduced flexible behavior in ASD was driven by less optimal learning on average within each age group. In autistic children, perseverative errors were positively related to anxiety symptoms, and in autistic adults, perseveration (indexed by both task errors and model parameter estimates) was positively related to RRB. These findings provide novel insights into reduced flexible behavior in relation to clinical symptoms in ASD.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/S_PJt9wBHoo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>To unravel the functional properties of the brain, we need to untangle how neurons interact with each other and coordinate in large-scale recurrent networks. One way to address this question is to measure the functional influence of individual neurons on each other by perturbing them in vivo.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Glycine-Histidine-Lysine (GHK) Alleviates Astrocytes Injury of Intracerebral Hemorrhage via the Akt/miR-146a-3p/AQP4 Pathway</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a major type of cerebrovascular disease with poor prognosis. Recent studies have shown that Glycyl-l-histidyl-l-lysine (GHK) is a kind of natural human tripeptide which could inhibit inflammation and against neurodegenerative diseases, but neither its role nor the mechanisms in ICH have yet been explicit. Currently, we investigated the possible strategies of GHK on ICH injury. Neurological deficit scores, brain water content, Nissl staining, and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) immunohistochemistry were detected in different groups of rats. The expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) was examined by real-time PCR. Inflammatory factors were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell viability and cell proliferation were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), MMP9, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1), AQP4 expression were detected/assessed using western blot. We observed that 5 and 10 μg/g of GHK improved neurological recovery by significantly reducing brain water content, improving neurological deficits, and promoting neuron survival. Besides, GHK alleviated inflammatory reaction and downregulated AQP4 expression. Furthermore, the effects of GHK on astrocyte were associated with the upregulation of miRNA-146a-3p, which partially regulated the expression of AQP4. Our results demonstrated that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway participated in the GHK-induced upregulation of miR-146a-3p and miR-146a-3p/AQP4 interaction plays a role in the injury following ICH. These findings suggested that GHK could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for ICH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: BCI learning induces core-periphery reorganization in M/EEG multiplex brain networks. (arXiv:2010.13459v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) constitute a promising tool for
communication and control. However, mastering non-invasive closed-loop systems
remains a learned skill that is difficult to develop for a non-negligible
proportion of users. The involved learning process induces neural changes
associated with a brain network reorganization that remains poorly understood.
To address this inter-subject variability, we adopted a multilayer approach to
integrate brain network properties from electroencephalographic (EEG) and
magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data resulting from a four-session BCI training
program followed by a group of healthy subjects. Our method gives access to the
contribution of each layer to multilayer network that tends to be equal with
time. We show that regardless the chosen modality, a progressive increase in
the integration of somatosensory areas in the alpha band was paralleled by a
decrease of the integration of visual processing and working memory areas in
the beta band. Notably, only brain network properties in multilayer network
correlated with future BCI scores in the alpha2 band: positively in
somatosensory and decision-making related areas and negatively in associative
areas. Our findings cast new light on neural processes underlying BCI training.
Integrating multimodal brain network properties provides new information that
correlates with behavioral performance and could be considered as a potential
marker of BCI learning.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alterations in structural brain laterality are reported in
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, few studies examined
differences within presentations of ADHD. We investigate asymmetry index (AI)
across 13 subcortical and 33 cortical regions from anatomical metrics of
volume, surface area, and thickness. Structural T1-weighted MRI data were
obtained from youths with inattentive (n = 64) and combined (n = 51)
presentations, and aged-matched controls (n = 298). We used a linear mixed
effect model that accounts for data site heterogeneity, while studying
associations between AI and covariates of presentation and age. Our paper
contributes to the functional results seen among ADHD presentations evidencing
disrupted connectivity in motor networks from ADHD-C and cingulo-frontal
networks from ADHD-I, as well as new findings in the temporal cortex and
default mode subnetworks. Age patterns of structural asymmetries vary with
presentation type. Linear mixed effects model is a practical tool for
characterizing associations between brain asymmetries, diagnosis, and
neurodevelopment.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Volume change measures derived from longitudinal MRI (e.g. hippocampal
atrophy) are a well-studied biomarker of disease progression in Alzheimer's
Disease (AD) and are used in clinical trials to track the therapeutic efficacy
of disease-modifying treatments. However, longitudinal MRI change measures can
be confounded by non-biological factors, such as different degrees of head
motion and susceptibility artifact between pairs of MRI scans. We hypothesize
that deep learning methods applied directly to pairs of longitudinal MRI scans
can be trained to differentiate between biological changes and non-biological
factors better than conventional approaches based on deformable image
registration. To achieve this, we make a simplifying assumption that biological
factors are associated with time (i.e. the hippocampus shrinks overtime in the
aging population) whereas non-biological factors are independent of time. We
then formulate deep learning networks to infer the temporal order of
same-subject MRI scans input to the network in arbitrary order; as well as to
infer ratios between interscan intervals for two pairs of same-subject MRI
scans. In the test dataset, these networks perform better in tasks of temporal
ordering (89.3%) and interscan interval inference (86.1%) than a
state-of-the-art deformation-based morphometry method ALOHA (76.6% and 76.1%
respectively) (Das et al., 2012). Furthermore, we derive a disease progression
score from the network that is able to detect a group difference between 58
preclinical AD and 75 beta-amyloid-negative cognitively normal individuals
within one year, compared to two years for ALOHA. This suggests that deep
learning can be trained to differentiate MRI changes due to biological factors
(tissue loss) from changes due to non-biological factors, leading to novel
biomarkers that are more sensitive to longitudinal changes at the earliest
stages of AD.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent research efforts in optical computing have gravitated towards
developing optical neural networks that aim to benefit from the processing
speed and parallelism of optics/photonics in machine learning applications.
Among these endeavors, Diffractive Deep Neural Networks (D2NNs) harness
light-matter interaction over a series of trainable surfaces, designed using
deep learning, to compute a desired statistical inference task as the light
waves propagate from the input plane to the output field-of-view. Although,
earlier studies have demonstrated the generalization capability of diffractive
optical networks to unseen data, achieving e.g., &amp;gt;98% image classification
accuracy for handwritten digits, these previous designs are in general
sensitive to the spatial scaling, translation and rotation of the input
objects. Here, we demonstrate a new training strategy for diffractive networks
that introduces input object translation, rotation and/or scaling during the
training phase as uniformly distributed random variables to build resilience in
their blind inference performance against such object transformations. This
training strategy successfully guides the evolution of the diffractive optical
network design towards a solution that is scale-, shift- and
rotation-invariant, which is especially important and useful for dynamic
machine vision applications in e.g., autonomous cars, in-vivo imaging of
biomedical specimen, among others.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a combinatorial problem
that continues to be studied extensively due to its practical implications in
manufacturing systems and emerging new variants, in order to model and optimize
more complex situations that reflect the current needs of the industry better.
This work presents a new meta-heuristic algorithm called GLNSA (Global-local
neighborhood search algorithm), in which the neighborhood concepts of a
cellular automaton are used, so that a set of leading solutions called
&quot;smart_cells&quot; generates and shares information that helps to optimize instances
of FJSP. The GLNSA algorithm is complemented with a tabu search that implements
a simplified version of the Nopt1 neighborhood defined in [1] to complement the
optimization task. The experiments carried out show a satisfactory performance
of the proposed algorithm, compared with other results published in recent
algorithms and widely cited in the specialized bibliography, using 86 test
problems, improving the optimal result reported in previous works in two of
them.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Skip-Connected Self-Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks with Joint Intrinsic Parameter and Synaptic Weight Training. (arXiv:2010.12691v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12691</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12691</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;As an important class of spiking neural networks (SNNs), recurrent spiking
neural networks (RSNNs) possess great computational power and have been widely
used for processing sequential data like audio and text. However, most RSNNs
suffer from two problems. 1. Due to a lack of architectural guidance, random
recurrent connectivity is often adopted, which does not guarantee good
performance. 2. Training of RSNNs is in general challenging, bottlenecking
achievable model accuracy. To address these problems, we propose a new type of
RSNNs called Skip-Connected Self-Recurrent SNNs (ScSr-SNNs). Recurrence in
ScSr-SNNs is introduced in a stereotyped manner by adding self-recurrent
connections to spiking neurons, which implements local memory. The network
dynamics is enriched by skip connections between nonadjacent layers.
Constructed by simplified self-recurrent and skip connections, ScSr-SNNs are
able to realize recurrent behaviors similar to those of more complex RSNNs
while the error gradients can be more straightforwardly calculated due to the
mostly feedforward nature of the network. Moreover, we propose a new
backpropagation (BP) method called backpropagated intrinsic plasticity (BIP) to
further boost the performance of ScSr-SNNs by training intrinsic model
parameters. Unlike standard intrinsic plasticity rules that adjust the neuron's
intrinsic parameters according to neuronal activity, the proposed BIP methods
optimize intrinsic parameters based on the backpropagated error gradient of a
well-defined global loss function in addition to synaptic weight training.
Based upon challenging speech and neuromorphic speech datasets including
TI46-Alpha, TI46-Digits, and N-TIDIGITS, the proposed ScSr-SNNs can boost
performance by up to 2.55% compared with other types of RSNNs trained by
state-of-the-art BP methods.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Task specific fine-tuning of a pre-trained neural language model using a
custom softmax output layer is the de facto approach of late when dealing with
document classification problems. This technique is not adequate when labeled
examples are not available at training time and when the metadata artifacts in
a document must be exploited. We address these challenges by generating
document representations that capture both text and metadata artifacts in a
task agnostic manner. Instead of traditional auto-regressive or auto-encoding
based training, our novel self-supervised approach learns a soft-partition of
the input space when generating text embeddings. Specifically, we employ a
pre-learned topic model distribution as surrogate labels and construct a loss
function based on KL divergence. Our solution also incorporates metadata
explicitly rather than just augmenting them with text. The generated document
embeddings exhibit compositional characteristics and are directly used by
downstream classification tasks to create decision boundaries from a small
number of labeled examples, thereby eschewing complicated recognition methods.
We demonstrate through extensive evaluation that our proposed cross-model
fusion solution outperforms several competitive baselines on multiple datasets.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To guide behavior, the brain extracts relevant features from high-dimensional
data streamed by sensory organs. Neuroscience experiments demonstrate that the
processing of sensory inputs by cortical neurons is modulated by instructive
signals which provide context and task-relevant information. Here, adopting a
normative approach, we model these instructive signals as supervisory inputs
guiding the projection of the feedforward data. Mathematically, we start with a
family of Reduced-Rank Regression (RRR) objective functions which include
Reduced Rank (minimum) Mean Square Error (RRMSE) and Canonical Correlation
Analysis (CCA), and derive novel offline and online optimization algorithms,
which we call Bio-RRR. The online algorithms can be implemented by neural
networks whose synaptic learning rules resemble calcium plateau potential
dependent plasticity observed in the cortex. We detail how, in our model, the
calcium plateau potential can be interpreted as a backpropagating error signal.
We demonstrate that, despite relying exclusively on biologically plausible
local learning rules, our algorithms perform competitively with existing
implementations of RRMSE and CCA.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning latent features from time series data is an important problem in
both machine learning and brain function. One approach, called Slow Feature
Analysis (SFA), leverages the slowness of many salient features relative to the
rapidly varying input signals. Furthermore, when trained on naturalistic
stimuli, SFA reproduces interesting properties of cells in the primary visual
cortex and hippocampus, suggesting that the brain uses temporal slowness as a
computational principle for learning latent features. However, despite the
potential relevance of SFA for modeling brain function, there is currently no
SFA algorithm with a biologically plausible neural network implementation, by
which we mean an algorithm operates in the online setting and can be mapped
onto a neural network with local synaptic updates. In this work, starting from
an SFA objective, we derive an SFA algorithm, called Bio-SFA, with a
biologically plausible neural network implementation. We validate Bio-SFA on
naturalistic stimuli.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Blind source separation, the problem of separating mixtures of unknown
signals into their distinct sources, is an important problem for both
biological and engineered signal processing systems. Nonnegative Independent
Component Analysis (NICA) is a special case of blind source separation that
assumes the mixture is a linear combination of independent, nonnegative
sources. In this work, we derive a single-layer neural network implementation
of NICA satisfying the following 3 constraints, which are relevant for
biological systems and the design of neuromorphic hardware: (i) the network
operates in the online setting, (ii) the synaptic learning rules are local, and
(iii) the neural outputs are nonnegative.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective. Clinical trials previously demonstrated the spectacular capacity
to elicit visual percepts in blind patients affected with retinal diseases by
electrically stimulating the remaining neurons on the retina. However, these
implants restored very limited visual acuity and required transcutaneous cables
traversing the eyeball, leading to reduced reliability and complex surgery with
high postoperative infection risks. Approach. To overcome the limitations
imposed by cables, a retinal implant architecture in which near-infrared
illumination carries both power and data through the pupil is presented. A high
efficiency multi-junction photovoltaic cell transduces the optical power to a
CMOS stimulator capable of delivering flexible interleaved sequential
stimulation through a diamond microelectrode array. To demonstrate the capacity
to elicit a neural response with this approach while complying with the optical
irradiance safety limit at the pupil, fluorescence imaging with a calcium
indicator is used on a degenerate rat retina. Main results. The power delivered
by the laser at safe irradiance of 4 mW/mm2 is shown to be sufficient to both
power the stimulator ASIC and elicit a response in retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs), with the ability to generate of up to 35 000 pulses per second at the
average stimulation threshold. Significance. This confirms the feasibility of
wirelessly generating a response in RGCs with a digital stimulation controller
that can deliver complex multipolar stimulation patterns at high repetition
rates.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 27 October 2020; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19193-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-020-19193-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Tumour necrosis is associated with tumour aggressiveness and poor outcomes in patients with glioblastomas, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, the authors show that in a xenograft mouse model of glioblastoma, tumour-infiltrating neutrophils amplify necrosis by promoting myeloperoxidase-induced tumour cell ferroptosis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/Vddo5grtaeo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: The Good, the Bad and the Unknown Aspects of Ghrelin in Stress Coping and Stress-Related Psychiatric Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.594484</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.594484</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ghrelin is a peptide hormone released by specialized X/A cells in the stomach and activated by acylation. Following its secretion, it binds to ghrelin receptors in the periphery to regulate energy balance, but it also acts on the central nervous system where it induces a potent orexigenic effect. Several types of stressors have been shown to stimulate ghrelin release in rodents, including nutritional stressors like food deprivation, but also physical and psychological stressors such as foot shocks, social defeat, forced immobilization or chronic unpredictable mild stress. The mechanism through which these stressors drive ghrelin release from the stomach lining remains unknown and, to date, the resulting consequences of ghrelin release for stress coping remain poorly understood. Indeed, ghrelin has been proposed to act as a stress hormone that reduces fear, anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in rodents but some studies suggest that ghrelin may - in contrast - promote such behaviors. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on the role of the ghrelin system in stress coping. We discuss whether ghrelin release is more than a byproduct of disrupted energy homeostasis following stress exposure. Furthermore, we explore the notion that ghrelin receptor signaling in the brain may have effects independent of circulating ghrelin and in what way this might influence stress coping in rodents. Finally, we examine how the ghrelin system could be utilized as a therapeutic avenue in stress-related psychiatric disorders (with a focus on anxiety- and trauma-related disorders), for example to develop novel biomarkers for a better diagnosis or new interventions to tackle relapse or treatment resistance in patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Predicting Sex From EEG: Validity and Generalizability of Deep-Learning-Based Interpretable Classifier</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Explainable artificial intelligence holds a great promise for neuroscience and plays an important role in the hypothesis generation process. We follow-up a recent machine learning-oriented study that constructed a deep convolutional neural network to automatically identify biological sex from EEG recordings in healthy individuals and highlighted the discriminative role of beta-band power. If generalizing, this finding would be relevant not only theoretically by pointing to some specific neurobiological sexual dimorphisms, but potentially also as a relevant confound in quantitative EEG diagnostic practice. To put this finding to test, we assess whether the automatic identification of biological sex generalizes to another dataset, particularly in the presence of a psychiatric disease, by testing the hypothesis of higher beta power in women compared to men on 134 patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder. Moreover, we construct ROC curves and compare the performance of the classifiers in determining sex both before and after the antidepressant treatment. We replicate the observation of a significant difference in beta-band power between men and women, providing classification accuracy of nearly 77%. The difference was consistent across the majority of electrodes, however multivariate classification models did not generally improve the performance. Similar results were observed also after the antidepressant treatment (classification accuracy above 70%), further supporting the robustness of the initial finding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Electrophysiological Dynamics of Visual Speech Processing and the Role of Orofacial Effectors for Cross-Modal Predictions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.538619</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain generates predictions about future events. During face-to-face conversations, visemic information is used to predict upcoming auditory input. Recent studies suggest that the speech motor system plays a role in these cross-modal predictions, however, usually only audio-visual paradigms are employed. Here we tested whether speech sounds can be predicted on the basis of visemic information only, and to what extent interfering with orofacial articulatory effectors can affect these predictions. We registered EEG and employed N400 as an index of such predictions. Our results show that N400's amplitude was strongly modulated by visemic salience, coherent with cross-modal speech predictions. Additionally, N400 ceased to be evoked when syllables' visemes were presented backwards, suggesting that predictions occur only when the observed viseme matched an existing articuleme in the observer's speech motor system (i.e., the articulatory neural sequence required to produce a particular phoneme/viseme). Importantly, we found that interfering with the motor articulatory system strongly disrupted cross-modal predictions. We also observed a late P1000 that was evoked only for syllable-related visual stimuli, but whose amplitude was not modulated by interfering with the motor system. The present study provides further evidence of the importance of the speech production system for speech sounds predictions based on visemic information at the pre-lexical level. The implications of these results are discussed in the context of a hypothesized trimodal repertoire for speech, in which speech perception is conceived as a highly interactive process that involves not only your ears but also your eyes, lips and tongue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated neurological disorder, characterized by central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, and axonal degeneration. Although autoimmunity, inflammatory demyelination and neurodegeneration underlie MS, the initiating event has yet to be clarified. Effective disease modifying therapies need to both regulate the immune system and promote restoration of neuronal function, including remyelination. The challenge in developing an effective long-lived therapy for MS requires that three disease-associated targets be addressed: (1) self-tolerance must be re-established to specifically inhibit the underlying myelin-directed autoimmune pathogenic mechanisms; (2) neurons must be protected from inflammatory injury and degeneration; (3) myelin repair must be engendered by stimulating oligodendrocyte progenitors to remyelinate CNS neuronal axons. The combined use of chronic and relapsing remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (C-EAE, R-EAE) (“outside-in”) as well as progressive diphtheria toxin A chain (DTA) and cuprizone autoimmune encephalitis (CAE) (“inside-out”) mouse models allow for the investigation and specific targeting of all three of these MS-associated disease parameters. The “outside-in” EAE models initiated by myelin-specific autoreactive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells allow for the evaluation of both myelin-specific tolerance in the absence or presence of neuroprotective and/or remyelinating agents. The “inside-out” mouse models of secondary inflammatory demyelination are triggered by toxin-induced oligodendrocyte loss or subtle myelin damage, which allows evaluation of novel therapeutics that could promote remyelination and neuroprotection in the CNS. Overall, utilizing these complementary pre-clinical MS models will open new avenues for developing therapeutic interventions, tackling MS from the “outside-in” and/or “inside-out”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: SARM1 depletion rescues NMNAT1-dependent photoreceptor cell death and retinal degeneration</title>

	<description>Leber congenital amaurosis type nine is an autosomal recessive retinopathy caused by mutations of the NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; synthesis enzyme NMNAT1. Despite the ubiquitous expression of NMNAT1, patients do not manifest pathologies other than retinal degeneration. Here we demonstrate that widespread NMNAT1 depletion in adult mice mirrors the human pathology, with selective loss of photoreceptors highlighting the exquisite vulnerability of these cells to NMNAT1 loss. Conditional deletion demonstrates that NMNAT1 is required within the photoreceptor. Mechanistically, loss of NMNAT1 activates the NADase SARM1, the central executioner of axon degeneration, to trigger photoreceptor death and vision loss. Hence, the essential function of NMNAT1 in photoreceptors is to inhibit SARM1, highlighting an unexpected shared mechanism between axonal degeneration and photoreceptor neurodegeneration. These results define a novel SARM1-dependent photoreceptor cell death pathway and identifies SARM1 as a therapeutic candidate for retinopathies.</description>

	<title>eLife: Uncovering the basis of protein-protein interaction specificity with a combinatorially complete library</title>

	<description>Protein-protein interaction specificity is often encoded at the primary sequence level. However, the contributions of individual residues to specificity are usually poorly understood and often obscured by mutational robustness, sequence degeneracy, and epistasis. Using bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems as a model, we screened a combinatorially complete library of antitoxin variants at three key positions against two toxins. This library enabled us to measure the effect of individual substitutions on specificity in hundreds of genetic backgrounds. These distributions allow inferences about the general nature of interface residues in promoting specificity. We find that positive and negative contributions to specificity are neither inherently coupled nor mutually exclusive. Further, a wild-type antitoxin appears optimized for specificity as no substitutions improve discrimination between cognate and non-cognate partners. By comparing crystal structures of paralogous complexes, we provide a rationale for our observations. Collectively, this work provides a generalizable approach to understanding the logic of molecular recognition.</description>

	<title>eLife: Specificity in glycosylation of multiple flagellins by the modular and cell cycle regulated glycosyltransferase FlmG</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60488</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60488</link>
	<description>How specificity is programmed into post-translational modification of proteins by glycosylation is poorly understood, especially for O-linked glycosylation systems. Here we reconstitute and dissect the substrate specificity underpinning the cytoplasmic O-glycosylation pathway that modifies all six flagellins, five structural and one regulatory paralog, in &lt;i&gt;Caulobacter crescentus&lt;/i&gt;, a monopolarly flagellated alpha-proteobacterium. We characterize the biosynthetic pathway for the sialic acid-like sugar pseudaminic acid and show its requirement for flagellation, flagellin modification and efficient export. The cognate NeuB enzyme that condenses phosphoenolpyruvate with a hexose into pseudaminic acid is functionally interchangeable with other pseudaminic acid synthases. The previously unknown and cell cycle-regulated FlmG protein, a defining member of a new class of cytoplasmic O-glycosyltransferases, is required and sufficient for flagellin modification. The substrate specificity of FlmG is conferred by its N-terminal flagellin-binding domain. FlmG accumulates before the FlaF secretion chaperone, potentially timing flagellin modification, export, and assembly during the cell division cycle.</description>

	<title>eLife: Dot1l interacts with Zc3h10 to activate Ucp1 and other thermogenic genes</title>

	<description>Brown adipose tissue is a metabolically beneficial organ capable of dissipating chemical energy into heat, thereby increasing energy expenditure. Here, we identify Dot1l, the only known H3K79 methyltransferase, as an interacting partner of Zc3h10 that transcriptionally activates the &lt;i&gt;Ucp1 &lt;/i&gt;promoter and other BAT genes. Through a direct interaction, Dot1l is recruited by Zc3h10 to the promoter regions of thermogenic genes to function as a coactivator by methylating H3K79. We also show that Dot1l is induced during brown fat cell differentiation and by cold exposure and that Dot1l and its H3K79 methyltransferase activity is required for thermogenic gene program. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Dot1l ablation in mice using &lt;i&gt;Ucp1&lt;/i&gt;-Cre prevents activation of &lt;i&gt;Ucp1&lt;/i&gt; and other target genes to reduce thermogenic capacity and energy expenditure, promoting adiposity. Hence, Dot1l plays a critical role in the thermogenic program and may present as a future target for obesity therapeutics.</description>

	<description>Multiple studies have reported a male bias in incidence and/or prevalence of malaria infection in males compared to females. To test the hypothesis that sex-based differences in host-parasite interactions affect the epidemiology of malaria, we intensively followed &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; infections in a cohort in a malaria endemic area of eastern Uganda and estimated both force of infection (FOI) and rate of clearance using amplicon deep-sequencing. We found no evidence of differences in behavioral risk factors, incidence of malaria, or FOI by sex. In contrast, females cleared asymptomatic infections at a faster rate than males (hazard ratio [HR]=1.82, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.75 by clone and HR = 2.07, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.47 by infection event) in multivariate models adjusted for age, timing of infection onset, and parasite density. These findings implicate biological sex-based differences as an important factor in the host response to this globally important pathogen.</description>

	<title>eLife: Improving emotional-action control by targeting long-range phase-amplitude neuronal coupling</title>

	<description>Control over emotional action tendencies is essential for everyday interactions. This cognitive function fails occasionally during socially challenging situations, and systematically in social psychopathologies. We delivered dual-site phase-coupled brain stimulation to facilitate theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling between frontal regions known to implement that form of control, while neuropsychologically healthy human male participants were challenged to control their automatic action tendencies in a social–emotional approach/avoidance-task. Participants had increased control over their emotional action tendencies, depending on the relative phase and dose of the intervention. Concurrently measured fMRI effects of task and stimulation indicated that the intervention improved control by increasing the efficacy of anterior prefrontal inhibition over the sensorimotor cortex. This enhancement of emotional action control provides causal evidence for phase-amplitude coupling mechanisms guiding action selection during emotional-action control. Generally, the finding illustrates the potential of physiologically-grounded interventions aimed at reducing neural noise in cerebral circuits where communication relies on phase-amplitude coupling.</description>

	<title>eLife: Drivers and sites of diversity in the DNA adenine methylomes of 93 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex clinical isolates</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58542</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58542</link>
	<description>This study assembles DNA adenine methylomes for 93 &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; complex (MTBC) isolates from seven lineages paired with fully-annotated, finished, de novo assembled genomes. Integrative analysis yielded four key results. First, methyltransferase allele-methylome mapping corrected methyltransferase variant effects previously obscured by reference-based variant calling. Second, heterogeneity analysis of partially active methyltransferase alleles revealed that intracellular stochastic methylation generates a mosaic of methylomes within isogenic cultures, which we formalize as ‘intercellular mosaic methylation’ (IMM). Mutation-driven IMM was nearly ubiquitous in the globally prominent Beijing sublineage. Third, promoter methylation is widespread and associated with differential expression in the &lt;i&gt;ΔhsdM&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome, suggesting promoter HsdM-methylation directly influences transcription. Finally, comparative and functional analyses identified 351 sites hypervariable across isolates and numerous putative regulatory interactions. This multi-omic integration revealed features of methylomic variability in clinical isolates and provides a rational basis for hypothesizing the functions of DNA adenine methylation in MTBC physiology and adaptive evolution.</description>

	<description>Histone modifications deposited by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) play a critical role in the control of growth, development, and adaptation to environmental fluctuations of most multicellular eukaryotes. The catalytic activity of PRC2 is counteracted by Jumonji-type (JMJ) histone demethylases, which shapes the genomic distribution of H3K27me3. Here, we show that two JMJ histone demethylases in Arabidopsis, EARLY FLOWERING 6 (ELF6) and RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6), play distinct roles in H3K27me3 and H3K27me1 homeostasis. We show that failure to reset these chromatin marks during sexual reproduction results in the transgenerational inheritance of histone marks, which cause a loss of DNA methylation at heterochromatic loci and transposon activation. Thus, Jumonji-type histone demethylases play a dual role in plants by helping to maintain transcriptional states through development and safeguard genome integrity during sexual reproduction.</description>

	<title>eLife: Drosophila PDGF/VEGF signaling from muscles to hepatocyte-like cells protects against obesity</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56969</link>
	<description>PDGF/VEGF ligands regulate a plethora of biological processes in multicellular organisms via autocrine, paracrine and endocrine mechanisms. We investigated organ-specific metabolic roles of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; PDGF/VEGF-like factors (Pvfs). We combine genetic approaches and single-nuclei sequencing to demonstrate that muscle-derived Pvf1 signals to the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; hepatocyte-like cells/oenocytes to suppress lipid synthesis by activating the Pi3K/Akt1/TOR signaling cascade in the oenocytes. Functionally, this signaling axis regulates expansion of adipose tissue lipid stores in newly eclosed flies. Flies emerge after pupation with limited adipose tissue lipid stores and lipid level is progressively accumulated via lipid synthesis. We find that adult muscle-specific expression of &lt;i&gt;pvf1&lt;/i&gt; increases rapidly during this stage and that muscle-to-oenocyte Pvf1 signaling inhibits expansion of adipose tissue lipid stores as the process reaches completion. Our findings provide the first evidence in a metazoan of a PDGF/VEGF ligand acting as a myokine that regulates systemic lipid homeostasis by activating TOR in hepatocyte-like cells.</description>

	<title>eLife: Distinct hierarchical alterations of intrinsic neural timescales account for different manifestations of psychosis</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56151</link>
	<description>Hierarchical perceptual-inference models of psychosis may provide a holistic framework for understanding psychosis in schizophrenia including heterogeneity in clinical presentations. Particularly, hypothesized alterations at distinct levels of the perceptual-inference hierarchy may explain why hallucinations and delusions tend to cluster together yet sometimes manifest in isolation. To test this, we used a recently developed resting-state fMRI measure of intrinsic neural timescale (INT), which reflects the time window of neural integration and captures hierarchical brain gradients. In analyses examining extended sensory hierarchies that we first validated, we found distinct hierarchical INT alterations for hallucinations versus delusions in the auditory and somatosensory systems, thus providing support for hierarchical perceptual-inference models of psychosis. Simulations using a large-scale biophysical model suggested local elevations of excitation-inhibition ratio at different hierarchical levels as a potential mechanism. More generally, our work highlights the robustness and utility of INT for studying hierarchical processes relevant to basic and clinical neuroscience.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56098</link>
	<description>Secretory (S) Immunoglobulin (I) A is the predominant mucosal antibody, which binds pathogens and commensal microbes. SIgA is a polymeric antibody, typically containing two copies of IgA that assemble with one joining-chain (JC) to form dimeric (d) IgA that is bound by the polymeric Ig-receptor ectodomain, called secretory component (SC). Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of murine SIgA and dIgA. Structures reveal two IgAs conjoined through four heavy-chain tailpieces and the JC that together form a b-sandwich-like fold. The two IgAs are bent and tilted with respect to each other, forming distinct concave and convex surfaces. In SIgA, SC is bound to one face, asymmetrically contacting both IgAs and JC. The bent and tilted arrangement of complex components limits the possible positions of both sets of antigen binding fragments (Fabs) and preserves steric accessibility to receptor binding sites, likely influencing antigen binding and effector functions.</description>

	<title>eLife: The wtf4 meiotic driver utilizes controlled protein aggregation to generate selective cell death</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55694</link>
	<description>Meiotic drivers are parasitic loci that force their own transmission into greater than half of the offspring of a heterozygote. Many drivers have been identified, but their molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The &lt;i&gt;wtf4&lt;/i&gt; gene is a meiotic driver in &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&lt;/i&gt; that uses a poison-antidote mechanism to selectively kill meiotic products (spores) that do not inherit &lt;i&gt;wtf4&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we show that the Wtf4 proteins can function outside of gametogenesis and in a distantly related species, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. The Wtf4&lt;sup&gt;poison&lt;/sup&gt; protein forms dispersed, toxic aggregates. The Wtf4&lt;sup&gt;antidote&lt;/sup&gt; can co-assemble with the Wtf4&lt;sup&gt;poison&lt;/sup&gt; and promote its trafficking to vacuoles. We show that neutralization of the Wtf4&lt;sup&gt;poison&lt;/sup&gt; requires both co-assembly with the Wtf4&lt;sup&gt;antidote&lt;/sup&gt; and aggregate trafficking, as mutations that disrupt either of these processes result in cell death in the presence of the Wtf4 proteins. This work reveals that &lt;i&gt;wtf&lt;/i&gt; parasites can exploit protein aggregate management pathways to selectively destroy spores.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55130</link>
	<description>Vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP) interneurons in the cortex regulate feedback inhibition of pyramidal neurons through suppression of somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons and, reciprocally, SST neurons inhibit VIP neurons. Although VIP neuron activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mouse is highly correlated with locomotion, the relevance of locomotion-related VIP neuron activity to visual coding is not known. Here we show that VIP neurons in mouse V1 respond strongly to low contrast front-to-back motion that is congruent with self-motion during locomotion but are suppressed by other directions and contrasts. VIP and SST neurons have complementary contrast tuning. Layer 2/3 contains a substantially larger population of low contrast preferring pyramidal neurons than deeper layers, and layer 2/3 (but not deeper layer) pyramidal neurons show bias for front-to-back motion specifically at low contrast. Network modeling indicates that VIP-SST mutual antagonism regulates the gain of the cortex to achieve sensitivity to specific weak stimuli without compromising network stability.</description>

	<description>Cell cycle is a cellular process that is subject to stringent control. In contrast to the wealth of knowledge of proteins controlling the cell cycle, very little is known about the molecular role of lncRNAs (long noncoding RNAs) in cell-cycle progression. By performing genome-wide transcriptome analyses in cell-cycle-synchronized cells, we observed cell-cycle phase-specific induction of &amp;gt;2000 lncRNAs. Further, we demonstrate that an S-phase-upregulated lncRNA, &lt;i&gt;SUNO1&lt;/i&gt;, facilitates cell-cycle progression by promoting YAP1-mediated gene expression. &lt;i&gt;SUNO1&lt;/i&gt; facilitates the cell-cycle-specific transcription of &lt;i&gt;WTIP&lt;/i&gt;, a positive regulator of YAP1, by promoting the co-activator, DDX5-mediated stabilization of RNA polymerase II on chromatin. Finally, elevated &lt;i&gt;SUNO1&lt;/i&gt; levels are associated with poor cancer prognosis and tumorigenicity, implying its pro-survival role. Thus, we demonstrate the role of a S-phase up-regulated lncRNA in cell-cycle progression &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; modulating the expression of genes controlling cell proliferation.</description>

	<description>While multicompartment models have long been used to study the biophysics of neurons, it is still challenging to infer the parameters of such models from data including uncertainty estimates. Here, we performed Bayesian inference for the parameters of detailed neuron models of a photoreceptor and an OFF- and an ON-cone bipolar cell from the mouse retina based on two-photon imaging data. We obtained multivariate posterior distributions specifying plausible parameter ranges consistent with the data and allowing to identify parameters poorly constrained by the data. To demonstrate the potential of such mechanistic data-driven neuron models, we created a simulation environment for external electrical stimulation of the retina and optimized stimulus waveforms to target OFF- and ON-cone bipolar cells, a current major problem of retinal neuroprosthetics.</description>

	<description>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat. A better understanding of how antibiotic use and between-ward patient transfers (or connectivity) impact population-level AMR in hospital networks can help optimize antibiotic stewardship and infection control strategies. Here, we used a metapopulation framework to explain variations in the incidence of infections caused by 7 major bacterial species and their drug-resistant variants in a network of 357 hospital wards. We found that ward-level antibiotic consumption volume had a stronger influence on the incidence of the more resistant pathogens, while connectivity had the most influence on hospital-endemic species and carbapenem-resistant pathogens. Piperacillin-tazobactam consumption was the strongest predictor of the cumulative incidence of infections resistant to empirical sepsis therapy. Our data provide evidence that both antibiotic use and connectivity measurably influence hospital AMR. Finally, we provide a ranking of key antibiotics by their estimated population-level impact on AMR that might help inform antimicrobial stewardship strategies.</description>

	<description>Purpose: To determine if dietary administration of the dual ETA/ETB receptor antagonist, macitentan, could protect retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) following endothelin-1 (ET-1) mediated vasoconstriction in Brown Norway rats. Methods: Adult male and female Brown Norway rats were either untreated or treated with macitentan (5 mg/kg body weight) once a day for 3 days followed by intravitreal injection of either 4 l of 500 M ET-1 (2 nmole/eye) or vehicle in one eye. Imaging of the retinal vasculature using fluorescein angiography was carried out at various time points, including, 5, 10, 15, 25 and 30 minutes. Following the imaging of the vasculature, rats were either treated with macitentan (5 mg/kg/body weight in dietary gels) or untreated (control gels without medication). Following treatments, rats were euthanized, retinal flat mounts were prepared, immunostained for RGC marker Brn3a, imaged and surviving RGCs were counted in a masked manner. Results: Vasoconstrictive effects following intravitreal ET-1 injection were greatly reduced in rats administered with macitentan in the diet prior to the ET-1 administration. ET-1 intravitreal injection produced a 31% loss of RGCs which was significantly reduced in macitentan-treated rats. Following ET-1 administration, GFAP immunostaining was increased in the ganglion cell layer as well as in the retrolaminar region, suggestive of astrocytic activation by ET-1 administration. RGC numbers in macitentan treated and ET-1 injected rats were similar to that observed in control retinas. Conclusions: ET-1-mediated neurodegeneration could occur through both vascular and cellular mechanisms. The endothelin receptor antagonist, macitentan, has neuroprotective effects in retinas of Brown Norway rats that occurs through different mechanisms, including, enhancement of RGC survival and reduction ET-1 mediated vasoconstriction.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Four Salvage NAD+ Biosynthetic Pathway Enzymes Moonlight as Molecular Chaperones to Protect Against Proteotoxicity</title>

	<description>Human neurodegenerative proteinopathies are disorders associated with abnormal protein depositions in brain neurons. They include polyglutamine (polyQ) conditions such as Huntington's disease (HD) and alpha-synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Overexpression of NMNAT/Nma1, an enzyme in the NAD+ biosynthetic salvage pathway, acts as a powerful suppressor of proteotoxicities in yeast, fly, and mouse models. Screens in yeast models of HD and PD in our lab allowed us to identify three additional enzymes of the same pathway that achieve similar protection against proteotoxic stress: Npt1, Pnc1, and Qns1. Here, we report that their ability to maintain proteostasis is independent of their catalytic activity. Furthermore, we show that, under proteotoxic stress, the four proteins are recruited as molecular chaperones with holdase and foldase activities. In yeast cells, the NAD+ salvage proteins act by preventing misfolding and, together with the Hsp90 chaperone, promoting the refolding of extended polyQ domains or alpha-synuclein. For Nma1, we demonstrate that its foldase activity maps to the C-terminal domain of the protein. The proteostasis activity of Nma1, Npt1, Pnc1, and Qns1 does not require cellular protein quality control systems such as the proteasome or autophagy. We conclude that the entire salvage NAD+ biosynthetic pathway links NAD+ metabolism and proteostasis and emerges as a target for therapeutics to combat age-associated neurodegenerative proteotoxicities. Our observations also illustrate the existence of an evolutionarily conserved strategy of repurposing or moonlighting housekeeping enzymes under stress conditions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Oral administration of a dual ETA/ETB receptor antagonist promotes neuroprotection in a rodent model of glaucoma</title>

	<description>Purpose: Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease associated with elevated intraocular pressure and characterized by optic nerve axonal degeneration, cupping of the optic disc and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The endothelin (ET) system of vasoactive peptides (ET-1, ET-2, ET-3) and their G-protein coupled receptors (ETA and ETB receptors) have been shown to be contributors to the pathophysiology of glaucoma. The purpose of this study was to determine if administration of the endothelin receptor antagonist, macitentan, after the onset of IOP elevation, was neuroprotective to retinal ganglion cells in ocular hypertensive rats. Methods: Brown Norway rats were subjected to the Morrison model of ocular hypertension by injection of hypertonic saline through episcleral veins. Macitentan (5 and 10 mg/kg body wt/day) was administered orally following the elevation of IOP and rats with IOP elevation were maintained for 4 weeks. RGC function was determined by pattern electroretinography at 2 and 4 weeks post IOP elevation. Rats were euthanized by approved humane methods and retinal flat-mounts generated were immunostained with RGC-selective markers RBPMS and Brn3a. RGC counts were conducted in a masked manner. Results: A significant protection of retinal ganglion cells against cell loss was found following oral administration of macitentan (5 and 10 mg/kg body wt/day) in rats with elevated intraocular pressure. In addition, treatment with macitentan was able to preserve RGC function as measured by pattern ERG analysis. Conclusions: Macitentan was able to promote neuroprotection independent of IOP-lowering suggesting that this could complement existing treatments to prevent neurodegeneration during ocular hypertension. The findings presented have implications for the use of macitentan as an oral formulation to promote neuroprotection in glaucoma patients.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Identifying the functions of two biomarkers in human oligodendrocyte progenitor cell development</title>

	<description>NG2 and A2B5 are important biological markers of human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. To study their functional differences during the development of human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to oligodendrocytes, we used cell sorting technology and obtained a large number of sterile, high-purity NG2+/- and A2B5+/- cells with high viability. Further research was then conducted via in vitro cell proliferation and migration assays, single-cell sequencing, mRNA sequencing, and cell transplantation into shiverer mice. The results showed that the migration ability of the cells was inversely proportional to the myelination ability. NG2 may be a marker of early oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and is conducive to cell migration and proliferation, while A2B5 may be a marker of slightly mature oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and is conducive to cell differentiation. Further, cell migration, proliferation, and myelination capacity of the negative cell population were stronger than those of the positive cell population. In summary, these results suggest that oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the mid-stage may be more suitable for clinical cell transplantation to treat demyelinating diseases.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Dense movement with embedded sparse action-type representations in the output layer of motor cortex</title>

	<description>Motor cortex generates output necessary for the execution of a wide range of motor behaviours. Although neural representations of movement have been described throughout motor cortex, how population activity in output layers relates to the execution of distinct motor actions is less well explored. To address this, we imaged layer 5B population activity in mice performing a two-action forelimb task. We found most neurons convey a generalised movement signal, with action-type-specific signalling restricted to relatively small, spatially intermingled subpopulations of neurons. Deep layer population dynamics largely reflect dense, action-invariant signals that correlate with movement timing, while embedded sparse action-type representations reflect distinct forelimb actions. We suggest that sparse coding of action-type enhances the number of possible output configurations necessary for behavioural flexibility and the execution of a wide repertoire of behavioural actions.</description>

	<description>Migraines cause significant disability and contribute heavily to healthcare costs. Irritation of the meninges outermost layer (the dura mater), and trigeminal ganglion activation contribute to migraine initiation. Maladaptive changes in central pain-processing regions are also important in maintaining pain. The parabrachial complex (PB) is a central region that mediates chronic pain. PB receives diverse sensory information, including a direct input from the trigeminal ganglion. We hypothesized that PB processes inputs from the dura. Using in vivo electrophysiology recordings from single units in anesthetized rats we identified 58 neurons in lateral PB that respond reliably and with short latency to electrical dura stimulation. After injecting tracer into PB, anatomical examination reveals retrogradely labeled cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion. Neuroanatomical tract-tracing revealed a population of neurons in the trigeminal ganglion that innervate the dura and project directly to PB. These findings indicate that PB is strategically placed to process dura inputs, and suggest that it is directly involved in the pathogenesis of migraine headaches.</description>

	<description>In mammals, fine motor control is essential for skilled behavior, and is subserved by specialized subdivisions of the primary motor cortex (M1) and other components of the brain's motor circuitry. We profiled the epigenomic state of several components of the Rhesus macaque motor system, including subdivisions of M1 corresponding to hand and orofacial control. We compared this to open chromatin data from M1 in rat, mouse, and human. We found broad similarities as well as unique specializations in open chromatin regions (OCRs) between M1 subdivisions and other brain regions, as well as species- and lineage-specific differences reflecting their evolutionary histories. By distinguishing shared mammalian M1 OCRs from primate- and human-specific specializations, we highlight gene regulatory programs that could subserve the evolution of skilled motor behaviors such as speech and tool use.</description>

	<description>Objective: Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitors are often used to monitor depth of general anesthesia. EEG monitoring is less well developed for lighter levels of anesthesia. Here we present an automated method to monitor the depth of anesthesia for office based procedures using EEG spectral features. Methods: We analyze EEG recordings from 30 patients undergoing sedation using a multimodal anesthesia strategy. Level of sedation during the procedure is coded using the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS). The power spectrum from the frontal EEG is used to infer the level of sedation, by training a logistic regression model with elastic net regularization. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) is used to evaluate how well the automated system distinguishes awake from sedated EEG epochs. Results: EEG power spectral characteristics vary systematically and consistently across patients with the levels of light anesthesia and relatively healthy patients encountered during office-based anesthesia procedures. The logistic regression model using spectral EEG features distinguishes awake and sedated states with an AUC of 0.85 ( 0.14). Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that frontal EEG spectral features can reliably monitor sedation levels during office based anesthesia.</description>

	<description>Hand movements are essential for tactile perception of objects. However, why different individuals converge on specific movement patterns is not yet clear. Focusing on planar shape perception, we tracked the hands of 11 participants while they practiced shape recognition. Our results show that planar shape perception is mediated by contour-following movements, either tangential to the contour or spatially-oscillating perpendicular to it, and by scanning movements, crossing between distant parts of the shapes' contour. Both strategies exhibited non-uniform coverage of the shapes' contours. We found that choice of strategy during the first experimental session was strongly correlated with two idiosyncratic parameters: participants with lower tactile resolution tended to move faster; and faster-adapting participants tended to employ oscillatory movements more often. In addition, practicing on isolated geometric features increased the tendency to use the contour-following strategy. These results provide insights into the processes of strategy selection in tactile perception.</description>

	<description>Three-dimensional (3D) cellular scale imaging techniques that improve our understanding of the brain architecture is crucial for structural and functional integration and analysis of normal and pathological conditions in the brain. We have developed a wide-field fluorescent microscope using deep ultra violet (DUV) light emitting diode as the illumination source. This microscope employs oblique illumination of deep UV light and the optical sectioning is obtained on the tissue surface over a few micron thickness; largely attributed to the large absorption and hence low tissue penetration of the DUV light. Fluorescence emissions in the visible range that are spectrally separates allows for multiple channel of fluorophore detection using single or a combination of dyes. The fluorescence signal is captured using water immersion objectives and a color camera. Arduino Mega 2560 controlled 3-axis motorized microscope stage is developed for obtaining the wide-field imaging. To enable 3D imaging, the microscope setup is integrated with vibrating microtome that can slice thin sections for serial block-face imaging. In this paper, we show the versatility of the DUV microscope as a microscopy tool for use in neuroscience labs for a range of 2D brain imaging applications. We also present its applicability for 3D imaging of rodent brain in combination with whole brain staining protocol.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Timing variability and midfrontal ~4 Hz rhythms correlate with cognition in Parkinson's disease</title>

	<description>Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) can have significant cognitive dysfunction; however, the mechanism of these cognitive symptoms are unknown. Here, we used scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the cortical basis for PD-related cognitive impairments during interval timing, which requires participants to estimate temporal intervals of several seconds. Time estimation is an ideal task demand for investigating cognition in PD because it is simple, requires medial frontal cortical areas, and recruits basic executive processes such as working memory and attention. However, interval timing has never been systematically studied in PD patients with cognitive impairments. We report three main findings. First, 71 PD patients had increased temporal variability compared to 37 demographically-matched controls, and this variability correlated with cognitive dysfunction as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA). Second, PD patients had attenuated ~4 Hz EEG oscillatory activity at midfrontal electrodes in response to the interval-onset cue, which was also predictive of MOCA. Finally, trial-by-trial linear mixed-effects modeling demonstrated that cue-triggered ~4 Hz power predicted subsequent temporal estimates as a function of PD and MOCA. Our data suggest that impaired cue-evoked midfrontal ~4 Hz activity predicts increased timing variability that is indicative of cognitive dysfunction in PD. These findings link PD-related cognitive dysfunction with cortical mechanisms of cognitive control, which could advance novel biomarkers and neuromodulation for PD.</description>

	<description>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The treatment of ADHD could potentially be improved with the development of combination therapies targeting multiple systems. Both the number of children diagnosed with ADHD and the use of stimulant medications for its treatment have been rising in recent years, and concern about side-effects and future problems that medication may cause have been increasing. An alternative treatment strategy for ADHD attracting wide interest is the targeting of neuropsychological functioning, such as executive function impairments. Computerized training programs (including video games) have drawn interest as a tool to train improvements in executive function deficits in children with ADHD. Our lab is currently conducting a pilot study to assess the effects of the online game Minecraft as a therapeutic video game (TVG) to train executive function deficits in children with ADHD. The effect of the TVG intervention in combination with stimulants is being investigated to develop a drug-device combination therapy that can address both the dopaminergic dysfunction and executive function deficits present in ADHD. Although the results of this study will be used to guide the clinical development process, additional guidance for the optimization of the executive function training activities will be provided by a computational model of executive functions built with artificial neural networks (ANNs). This model uses ANNs to complete virtual tasks resembling the executive function training activities that the study subjects practice in the Minecraft world, and the schedule of virtual tasks that result in maximum improvements in ANN performance on these tasks will be investigated as a method to inform the selection of training regimens in future clinical studies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The association between pain-induced autonomic reactivity and descending pain control is mediated by the periaqueductal grey</title>

	<description>There is a strict interaction between the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and pain, which might involve descending pain modulatory mechanisms. The periaqueductal grey (PAG) is involved both in descending pain modulation and ANS, but its role in mediating this relationship has not yet been explored. Here, we sought to determine brain regions mediating ANS and descending pain control associations. 30 participants underwent Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM) assessments, in which they rated painful pressure stimuli applied to their thumbnail, either alone or with a painful cold contralateral stimulation. Differences in pain ratings between 'pressure-only' and 'pressure+cold' stimuli provided a measure of descending pain control. In 18 of the 30 participants, structural scans and two functional MRI assessments, one pain-free and one during cold-pain, were acquired. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) was simultaneously recorded. Low frequency HRV (LF-HRV) and the CPM score were negatively correlated; individuals with higher LF-HRV during pain reported reductions in pain during CPM. PAG-frontal medial cortex (FMC) and PAG-rostral ventro-medial medulla (RVM) functional connectivity correlated negatively with the CPM. Importantly, PAG-FMC functional connectivity mediated the strength of HRV-CPM association. CPM response magnitude was also negatively associated with PAG and positively associated with FMC grey matter volumes. Our multi-modal approach, using behavioral, physiological and MRI measures, provides important new evidence of interactions between ANS and descending pain mechanisms. ANS dysregulation and dysfunctional descending pain modulation are characteristics of chronic pain. We suggest that further investigation of body-brain interactions in chronic pain patients may catalyse the development of new treatments.</description>

	<description>Interval timing is a fundamental component action, and is susceptible to motor-related temporal distortions. Previous studies have shown that movement biases temporal estimates, but have primarily considered self-modulated movement only. However, real-world encounters often include situations in which movement is restricted or perturbed by environmental factors. In the following experiments, we introduced viscous movement environments to externally modulate movement and investigated the resulting effects on temporal perception. In two separate tasks, participants timed auditory intervals while moving a robotic arm that randomly applied four levels of viscosity. Results demonstrated that higher viscosity led to shorter perceived durations. Using a drift-diffusion model and a Bayesian observer model, we confirmed these biasing effects arose from perceptual mechanisms, instead of biases in decision making. These findings suggest that environmental perturbations are an important factor in movement-related temporal distortions, and enhance the current understanding of the interactions of motor activity and cognitive processes.</description>

	<description>The physiological mechanisms of corticospinal excitability and factors influencing its measurement with transcranial magnetic stimulation are still poorly understood. A recent study reported an impact of functional connectivity between the primary motor cortex and dorsal premotor cortex on the resting motor threshold of the dominant hemisphere. We aimed to replicate these findings in a larger sample of 38 healthy right-handed subjects with data from both hemispheres. Resting-state functional connectivity was assessed between the primary motor cortex and five a-priori defined motor-relevant regions on each hemisphere as well as interhemispherically between both primary motor cortices. Following the procedure by the original authors, we included age, the cortical grey matter volume and coil to cortex distance as further predictors in the analysis. We report replication models for the dominant hemisphere as well as an extension to data from both hemispheres and support the results with Bayes factors. Functional connectivity between the primary motor cortex and dorsal premotor cortex did not explain variability in the resting motor threshold and we obtained moderate evidence for the absence of this effect. In contrast, coil to cortex distance could be confirmed as an important predictor with strong evidence. These findings contradict the previously proposed effect, thus questioning the notion of the dorsal premotor cortex playing a major role in modifying corticospinal excitability.</description>

	<description>Across the animal kingdom, dopamine plays a crucial role in conferring reinforcement signals that teach animals about the causal structure of the world. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the dopamine system has largely been studied using a rich genetic toolbox. Here, we suggest a complementary pharmacological approach applying the dopamine-synthesis inhibitor 3-Iodo-L-tyrosine (3IY), which causes acute systemic inhibition of dopamine signaling. Using Pavlovian conditioning, across developmental stages (3rd instar larva versus adult), valence domains (reward versus punishment), and types of reinforcement (natural versus optogenetically induced), we find that 3IY feeding specifically impairs associative learning, whereas additional feeding of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), a precursor of dopamine, rescues this impairment. This study establishes a simple, quick, and comparably low-cost approach that can be combined with the available genetic tools to manipulate and clarify the functions of the dopaminergic system - in D. melanogaster and other animals.</description>

	<description>The reproducibility of research results has been a cause of increasing concern to the scientific community. The long-held belief that experimental standardization begets reproducibility has also been recently challenged, with the observation that the reduction of variability within studies can lead to idiosyncratic, lab-specific results that are irreproducible. An alternative approach is to, instead, deliberately introduce heterogeneity; known as &quot;heterogenization&quot; of experimental design. Here, we explore a novel perspective in the heterogenization program in a meta-analysis of variability in observed phenotypic outcomes in both control and experimental animal models of ischaemic stroke. First, by quantifying inter-individual variability across control groups we illustrate that the amount of heterogeneity in disease-state (infarct volume) differs according to methodological approach, for example, in disease-induction methods and disease models. We argue that such methods may improve reproducibility by creating diverse and representative distribution of baseline disease-state in the reference group, against which treatment efficacy is assessed. Second, we illustrate how meta-analysis can be used to simultaneously assess efficacy and stability (i.e., mean effect and among-individual variability). We identify treatments that have efficacy and are generalizable to the population level (i.e. low inter-individual variability), as well as those where there is high inter-individual variability in response; for these latter treatments translation to a clinical setting may require nuance. We argue that by embracing rather than seeking to minimise variability in phenotypic outcomes, we can motivate the shift towards heterogenization and improve both the reproducibility and generalizability of preclinical research.</description>

Substantive changes in gene expression, metabolism, and the proteome are manifested in overall changes in microbial population growth. Quantifying how microbes grow is therefore fundamental to areas such as genetics, bioengineering, and food safety. Traditional parametric growth curve models capture the population growth behavior through a set of summarizing parameters. However, estimation of these parameters from data is confounded by random effects such as experimental variability, batch effects or differences in experimental material. A systematic statistical method to identify and correct for such confounding effects in population growth data is not currently available. Further, our previous work has demonstrated that parametric models are insufficient to explain and predict microbial response under non-standard growth conditions. Here we develop a hierarchical Bayesian non-parametric model of population growth that identifies the latent growth behavior and response to perturbation, while simultaneously correcting for random effects in the data. This model enables more accurate estimates of the biological effect of interest, while better accounting for the uncertainty due to technical variation. Additionally, modeling hierarchical variation provides estimates of the relative impact of various confounding effects on measured population growth.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/42vB0k6S8wI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Nongenetic phenotypic variation can either speed up or slow down adaptive evolution. We show that it can speed up evolution in environments where available carbon and energy sources change over time. To this end, we use an experimentally validated model of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; growth on two alternative carbon sources, glucose and acetate. On the superior carbon source (glucose), all cells achieve high growth rates, while on the inferior carbon source (acetate) only a small fraction of the population manages to initiate growth. Consequently, populations experience a bottleneck when the environment changes from the superior to the inferior carbon source. Growth on the inferior carbon source depends on a circuit under the control of a transcription factor that is repressed in the presence of the superior carbon source. We show that noise in the expression of this transcription factor can increase the probability that cells start growing on the inferior carbon source. In doing so, it can decrease the severity of the bottleneck and increase mean population fitness whenever this fitness is low. A modest amount of noise can also enhance the fitness effects of a beneficial allele that increases the fraction of a population initiating growth on acetate. Additionally, noise can protect this allele from extinction, accelerate its spread, and increase its likelihood of going to fixation. Central to the adaptation-enhancing principle we identify is the ability of noise to mitigate population bottlenecks, particularly in environments that fluctuate periodically. Because such bottlenecks are frequent in fluctuating environments, and because periodically fluctuating environments themselves are common, this principle may apply to a broad range of environments and organisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mXCuIMV9q-4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Significance of trends in gait dynamics</title>

Trends in time series generated by physiological control systems are ubiquitous. Determining whether trends arise from intrinsic system dynamics or originate outside of the system is a fundamental problem of fractal series analysis. In the latter case, it is necessary to filter out the trends before attempting to quantify correlations in the noise (residuals). For over two decades, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) has been used to calculate scaling exponents of stride time (ST), stride length (SL), and stride speed (SS) of human gait. Herein, rather than relying on the very specific form of detrending characteristic of DFA, we adopt Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) to explicitly determine trends in spatio-temporal gait parameters during treadmill walking. Then, we use the madogram estimator to calculate the scaling exponent of the corresponding MARS residuals. The durations of ST and SL trends are determined to be independent of treadmill speed and have distributions with exponential tails. At all speeds considered, the trends of ST and SL are strongly correlated and are statistically independent of their corresponding residuals. The averages of scaling exponents of ST and SL MARS residuals are slightly smaller than 0.5. Thus, contrary to the interpretation prevalent in the literature, the statistical properties of ST and SL time series originate from the superposition of large scale trends and small scale fluctuations. We show that trends serve as the control manifolds about which ST and SL fluctuate. Moreover, the trend speed, defined as the ratio of instantaneous values of SL and ST trends, is tightly controlled about the treadmill speed. The strong coupling between the ST and SL trends ensures that the concomitant changes of their values correspond to movement along the constant speed goal equivalent manifold as postulated by Dingwell et al. 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000856.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZDdeSe_v4k0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Animal behavior is guided by the brain. Therefore, adaptations of brain structure and function are essential for animal survival, and each species differs in such adaptations. The brain of one individual may even differ between life stages, for instance, as adaptation to the divergent needs of larval and adult life of holometabolous insects. All such differences emerge during development, but the cellular mechanisms behind the diversification of brains between taxa and life stages remain enigmatic. In this study, we investigated holometabolous insects in which larvae differ dramatically from the adult in both behavior and morphology. As a consequence, the central complex, mainly responsible for spatial orientation, is conserved between species at the adult stage but differs between larvae and adults of one species as well as between larvae of different taxa. We used genome editing and established transgenic lines to visualize cells expressing the conserved transcription factor &lt;i&gt;retinal homeobox&lt;/i&gt;, thereby marking homologous &lt;i&gt;genetic neural lineages&lt;/i&gt; in both the fly &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; and the beetle &lt;i&gt;Tribolium castaneum&lt;/i&gt;. This approach allowed us for the first time to compare the development of homologous neural cells between taxa from embryo to the adult. We found complex heterochronic changes including shifts of developmental events between embryonic and pupal stages. Further, we provide, to our knowledge, the first example of &lt;i&gt;sequence heterochrony&lt;/i&gt; in brain development, where certain developmental steps changed their position within the ontogenetic progression. We show that through this &lt;i&gt;sequence heterochrony&lt;/i&gt;, an immature developmental stage of the central complex gains functionality in &lt;i&gt;Tribolium&lt;/i&gt; larvae.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ULqRbBSGh1Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) accounts for significant global health burden. Effects of TBI can become chronic even following mild injury. There is a need to develop effective therapies to attenuate the damaging effects of TBI and improve recovery outcomes. This literature review using a priori criteria (PROSPERO; CRD42018100623) summarized 43 studies between January 1998 and July 2019 that investigated nutritional interventions (NUT) delivered with the objective of altering neurophysiological (NP) outcomes following TBI. Risk of bias was assessed for included studies, and NP outcomes recorded. The systematic search resulted in 43 of 3,748 identified studies met inclusion criteria. No studies evaluated the effect of a NUT on NP outcomes of TBI in humans. Biomarkers of morphological changes and apoptosis, oxidative stress, and plasticity, neurogenesis, and neurotransmission were the most evaluated NP outcomes across the 43 studies that used 2,897 animals. The risk of bias was unclear in all reviewed studies due to poorly detailed methodology sections. Taking these limitations into account, anti‐oxidants, branched chain amino acids, and ω‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown the most promising pre‐clinical results for altering NP outcomes following TBI. Refinement of pre‐clinical methodologies used to evaluate effects of interventions on secondary damage of TBI would improve the likelihood of translation to clinical populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Increased prevalence of pathological mitochondria in astrocytic endfeet of Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)

Increased prevalence of pathological mitochondria in neuronal terminals of IIH

The mitochondria–ER contact sites distances are reduced in IIH

The postsynaptic density length is reduced in IIH




&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) primarily affects fertile, overweight women, and presents with the symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. The etiology is unknown but has been thought to relate to cerebrospinal fluid disturbance or cerebral venous stenosis. We have previously found evidence that IIH is also a disease of the brain parenchyma, evidenced by alterations at the neurogliovascular interface, including astrogliosis, pathological changes in the basement membrane and pericytes, and alterations of perivascular aquaporin‐4. The aim of this present electron microscopic study was to examine whether mitochondria phenotype was changed in IIH, particularly focusing on perivascular astrocytic endfeet and neurons (soma and pre‐ and postsynaptic terminals). Cortical brain biopsies of nine reference individuals and eight IIH patients were analyzed for subcellular distribution and phenotypical features of mitochondria using transmission electron microscopy. We found significantly increased prevalence of pathological mitochondria and reduced number of normal mitochondria in astrocytic endfeet of IIH patients. The degree of astrogliosis correlated negatively with the number of normal mitochondria in astrocytic endfoot processes. Moreover, we found significantly increased number of pathological mitochondria in pre‐ and postsynaptic neuronal terminals, as well as significantly shortened distance between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum contacts. Finally, the length of postsynaptic density, a marker of synaptic strength, was on average reduced in IIH. The present data provide evidence of pathological mitochondria in perivascular astrocytes endfeet and neurons of IIH patients, highlighting that impaired metabolism at the neurogliovascular interface may be a facet of IIH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The projections of ipRGCs and conventional RGCs to retinorecipient brain nuclei&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/53c5ba34-b45f-4ce3-bcaa-f36cfc71d2e4/cne25061-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dual recombinase fluorescent reporter strategy reveals that many retinorecipient brain regions associated with non‐image forming vision are innervated by retinal projections from both image and non‐image forming retinal ganglion cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the output neurons of the retina, allow us to perceive our visual environment. RGCs respond to rod/cone input through the retinal circuitry, however, a small population of RGCs are in addition intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs) and project to unique targets in the brain to modulate a broad range of subconscious visual behaviors such as pupil constriction and circadian photoentrainment. Despite the discovery of ipRGCs nearly two decades ago, there is still little information about how or if conventional RGCs (non‐ipRGCs) target ipRGC‐recipient nuclei to influence subconscious visual behavior. Using a dual recombinase fluorescent reporter strategy, we showed that conventional RGCs innervate many subconscious ipRGC‐recipient nuclei, apart from the suprachiasmatic nucleus. We revealed previously unrecognized stratification patterns of retinal innervation from ipRGCs and conventional RGCs in the ventral portion of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Further, we found that the percent innervation of ipRGCs and conventional RGCs across ipsi‐ and contralateral nuclei differ. Our data provide a blueprint to understand how conventional RGCs and ipRGCs innervate different brain regions to influence subconscious visual behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is susceptible to continuous fibrillar beta amyloid plaque deposition in aged APP/PS1 mice. In contrast, after 12 months of age, fibrillar plaque load plateaus in primary motor cortex (M1) and somatosensory cortex (SS2). Midlife (6–12 months of age) environmental enrichment (EE) decreases the accumulation of fibrillar plaque in M1 and SS2, but not in the PFC region.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmentally enriched (EE) housing conditions can increase performance on cognitive tasks in APP/PS1 mice, however, the potential effects of EE on disease modification in terms of pathological change are inconclusive. We hypothesised that previous contrasting findings may be attributable to regional differences in susceptibility to amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque deposition in cortical regions that are functionally associated with EE. We characterised fibrillar plaque deposition in 6, 12, and 18–22 months old APP/PS1 mice in the prefrontal (PFC), somatosensory (SS2) and primary motor cortex (M1). We found a significant increase in plaque load between 6 and 12 months in all regions. In animals over 12 months, only the PFC region continued to significantly accumulate plaques. Additionally, 12 months old animals subjected to 6 months of EE showed improved spatial navigation and had significantly fewer plaques in M1 and SS2, but not in the PFC. These findings suggest that PFC region is selectively susceptible to Aβ deposition and less responsive to the attenuating effects of EE. In contrast, M1 and SS2 regions plateau with respect to Aβ deposition by 12 months of age and are susceptible to amyloid pathology modification by midlife EE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Development and evolution influence the size and branching of visually targeted Mauthner cell dendrites.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mauthner cells are the largest neurons in the hindbrain of teleost fish and most amphibians. Each cell has two major dendrites thought to receive segregated streams of sensory input: the lateral dendrite receives mechanosensory input while the ventral dendrite receives visual input. These inputs, which mediate escape responses to sudden stimuli, may be modulated by the availability of sensory information to the animal. To understand the impact of the absence of visual information on the morphologies of Mauthner cells during developmental and evolutionary time scales, we examined the teleost &lt;i&gt;Astyanax mexicanus&lt;/i&gt;. This species of tetra is found in two morphs: a seeing surface fish and a blind cavefish. We compared the structure of Mauthner cells in surface fish raised under daily light conditions, in surface fish raised in constant darkness, and in two independent lineages of cave populations. The length of ventral dendrites of Mauthner cells in dark‐raised surface fish larvae were longer and more branched, while in both cave morphs the ventral dendrites were smaller or absent. The absence of visual input in surface fish with normal eye development leads to a homeostatic increase in dendrite size, whereas over evolution, the absence of light led to the loss of eyes and a reduction in dendrite size.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;How can neural networks learn to efficiently represent complex and
high-dimensional inputs via local plasticity mechanisms? Classical models of
representation learning assume that input weights are learned via pairwise
Hebbian-like plasticity. Here, we show that pairwise Hebbian-like plasticity
only works under unrealistic requirements on neural dynamics and input
statistics. To overcome these limitations, we derive from first principles a
learning scheme based on voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity rules. Here,
inhibition learns to locally balance excitatory input in individual dendritic
compartments, and thereby can modulate excitatory synaptic plasticity to learn
efficient representations. We demonstrate in simulations that this learning
scheme works robustly even for complex, high-dimensional and correlated inputs,
and with inhibitory transmission delays, where Hebbian-like plasticity fails.
Our results draw a direct connection between dendritic excitatory-inhibitory
balance and voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity as observed in vivo, and
suggest that both are crucial for representation learning.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Quantum brain as a novel hypothesis states that some non-trivial mechanisms
in quantum computation, such as superposition and entanglement, may have
important influence for the formation of brain functions. Inspired by this
idea, we propose Quantum Superposition Spiking Neural Network (QS-SNN), which
introduce quantum superposition to spiking neural network models to handel
challenges which are hard for other state-of-the-art machine learning models.
For human brain, grasping the main information no matter how the background
changes is necessary to interact efficiently with diverse environments. As an
example, it is easy for human to recognize the digits whether it is white
character with black background or inversely black character with white
background. While if the current machine learning models are trained with one
of the cases (e.g. white character with black background), it will be nearly
impossible for them to recognize the color inverted version. To handel this
challenge, we propose two-compartment spiking neural network with superposition
states encoding, which is inspired by quantum information theory and
spatial-temporal spiking property from neuron information encoding in the
brain. Typical network structures like fully-connected ANN, VGG, ResNet and
DenseNet are challenged with the same task. We train these networks on original
image dataset and then invert the background color to test their
generalization. Result shows that artificial neural network can not deal with
this condition while the quantum superposition spiking neural network(QS-SNN)
which we proposed in this paper recognizes the color-inverse image
successfully. Further the QS-SNN shows its robustness when noises are added on
inputs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Feedforward networks (FFN) are ubiquitous structures in neural systems and
have been studied to understand mechanisms of reliable signal and information
transmission. In many FFNs, neurons in one layer have intrinsic properties that
are distinct from those in their pre-/postsynaptic layers, but how this affects
network-level information processing remains unexplored. Here we show that
layer-to-layer heterogeneity arising from lamina-specific cellular properties
facilitates signal and information transmission in FFNs. Specifically, we found
that signal transformations, made by each layer of neurons on an input-driven
spike signal, demodulate signal distortions introduced by preceding layers.
This mechanism boosts information transfer carried by a propagating spike
signal and thereby supports reliable spike signal and information transmission
in a deep FFN. Our study suggests that distinct cell types in neural circuits,
performing different computational functions, facilitate information processing
on the whole.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Fading memory echo state networks are universal. (arXiv:2010.12047v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12047</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Echo state networks (ESNs) have been recently proved to be universal
approximants for input/output systems with respect to various $L ^p$-type
criteria. When $1\leq p&amp;lt; \infty$, only $p$-integrability hypotheses need to be
imposed, while in the case $p=\infty$ a uniform boundedness hypotheses on the
inputs is required. This note shows that, in the last case, a universal family
of ESNs can be constructed that contains exclusively elements that have the
echo state and the fading memory properties. This conclusion could not be drawn
with the results and methods available so far in the literature.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A novel auction system for selecting advertisements in Real-Time bidding. (arXiv:2010.11981v1 [cs.GT])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Real-Time Bidding is a new Internet advertising system that has become very
popular in recent years. This system works like a global auction where
advertisers bid to display their impressions in the publishers' ad slots. The
most popular system to select which advertiser wins each auction is the
Generalized second-price auction in which the advertiser that offers the most
wins the bet and is charged with the price of the second largest bet. In this
paper, we propose an alternative betting system with a new approach that not
only considers the economic aspect but also other relevant factors for the
functioning of the advertising system. The factors that we consider are, among
others, the benefit that can be given to each advertiser, the probability of
conversion from the advertisement, the probability that the visit is
fraudulent, how balanced are the networks participating in RTB and if the
advertisers are not paying over the market price. In addition, we propose a
methodology based on genetic algorithms to optimize the selection of each
advertiser. We also conducted some experiments to compare the performance of
the proposed model with the famous Generalized Second-Price method. We think
that this new approach, which considers more relevant aspects besides the
price, offers greater benefits for RTB networks in the medium and long-term.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Model-based Brain Tumor Detection in Brain MRI Images. (arXiv:2010.11978v1 [eess.IV])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing Brain Tumor with the aid of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has
gained enormous prominence over the years, primarily in the field of medical
science. Detection and/or partitioning of brain tumors solely with the aid of
MR imaging is achieved at the cost of immense time and effort and demands a lot
of expertise from engaged personnel. This substantiates the necessity of
fabricating an autonomous model brain tumor diagnosis. Our work involves
implementing a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for diagnosing brain
tumors from MR images. The dataset used in this paper consists of 253 brain MR
images where 155 images are reported to have tumors. Our model can single out
the MR images with tumors with an overall accuracy of 96%. The model
outperformed the existing conventional methods for the diagnosis of brain tumor
in the test dataset (Precision = 0.93, Sensitivity = 1.00, and F1-score =
0.97). Moreover, the proposed model's average precision-recall score is 0.93,
Cohen's Kappa 0.91, and AUC 0.95. Therefore, the proposed model can help
clinical experts verify whether the patient has a brain tumor and,
consequently, accelerate the treatment procedure.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Temperature and rainfall have a significant impact on economic growth as well
as the outbreak of seasonal diseases in a region. In spite of that inadequate
studies have been carried out for analyzing the weather pattern of Bangladesh
implementing the artificial neural network. Therefore, in this study, we are
implementing a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model to forecast the month-wise
temperature and rainfall by analyzing 115 years (1901-2015) of weather data of
Bangladesh. The LSTM model has shown a mean error of -0.38oC in case of
predicting the month-wise temperature for 2 years and -17.64mm in case of
predicting the rainfall. This prediction model can help to understand the
weather pattern changes as well as studying seasonal diseases of Bangladesh
whose outbreaks are dependent on regional temperature and/or rainfall.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: The Heidelberg spiking datasets for the systematic evaluation of spiking neural networks. (arXiv:1910.07407v3 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07407</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks are the basis of versatile and power-efficient
information processing in the brain. Although we currently lack a detailed
understanding of how these networks compute, recently developed optimization
techniques allow us to instantiate increasingly complex functional spiking
neural networks in-silico. These methods hold the promise to build more
efficient non-von-Neumann computing hardware and will offer new vistas in the
quest of unraveling brain circuit function. To accelerate the development of
such methods, objective ways to compare their performance are indispensable.
Presently, however, there are no widely accepted means for comparing the
computational performance of spiking neural networks. To address this issue, we
introduce two spike-based classification datasets, broadly applicable to
benchmark both software and neuromorphic hardware implementations of spiking
neural networks. To accomplish this, we developed a general audio-to-spiking
conversion procedure inspired by neurophysiology. Further, we applied this
conversion to an existing and a novel speech dataset. The latter is the free,
high-fidelity, and word-level aligned Heidelberg digit dataset that we created
specifically for this study. By training a range of conventional and spiking
classifiers, we show that leveraging spike timing information within these
datasets is essential for good classification accuracy. These results serve as
the first reference for future performance comparisons of spiking neural
networks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 26 October 2020; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19017-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-020-19017-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Game theory has contributed much to the understanding of social evolution. In an elegant combination of experimental tests and modelling, this study suggests that when bacteria face intense competition, repeated retaliation outcompetes a single tit-for-tat response to attack.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/u_mTd6C5Xt8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Epinephrine May Contribute to the Persistence of Traumatic Memories in a Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Animal Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.588802</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.588802</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The importance of catecholamines in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) still needs to be explored. We aimed to evaluate epinephrine’s (EPI) causal role and molecular mechanism for the persistence of PTSD traumatic memories. Wild-type (WT) and EPI-deficient mice (phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase-knockout mice, Pnmt-KO) were induced with PTSD and behavioral tests were performed. Some Pnmt-KO mice were administered with EPI or vehicle. Catecholamines were quantified by HPLC-ED. Nr4a1, Nr4a2, and Nr4a3 mRNA expression were evaluated by real-time PCR in hippocampus samples. It was observed an increase in EPI and freezing behavior, and a decrease in open arm entries in the elevated plus-maze test and time spent in the light in the light–dark test in WT mice in the PTSD-induction group compared to control. After induction of PTSD, Pnmt-KO mice showed a decrease in freezing, as well as an increase in open arm entries and transitions between compartments compared to WT. After PTSD induction, Pnmt-KO mice administered with EPI showed an increase in freezing compared with the vehicle. On day 0 of PTSD induction, it was observed an increase in mRNA expression of Nr4a2 and Nr4a3 genes in the hippocampus of WT mice compared to control, contrary to Pnmt-KO mice. In conclusion, our data suggest that EPI may be involved in the persistence of traumatic memories in PTSD, possibly through enhancement of the expression of Nr4a2 and Nr4a3 genes in the hippocampus. Peripheral administration of EPI restored contextual traumatic memories in Pnmt-KO mice, which suggests a causal role for EPI. The persistence of contextual traumatic memories may contribute to anxiety-like behavior and resistance of traumatic memory extinction in this PTSD mice model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Lack of Desmin in Mice Causes Structural and Functional Disorders of Neuromuscular Junctions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.567084</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.567084</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Desmin, the major intermediate filament (IF) protein in muscle cells, interlinks neighboring myofibrils and connects the whole myofibrillar apparatus to myonuclei, mitochondria, and the sarcolemma. However, desmin is also known to be enriched at postsynaptic membranes of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). The pivotal role of the desmin IF cytoskeletal network is underscored by the fact that over 120 mutations of the human DES gene cause hereditary and sporadic myopathies and cardiomyopathies. A subgroup of human desminopathies comprises autosomal recessive cases resulting in the complete abolition of desmin protein. In these patients, who display a more severe phenotype than the autosomal dominant cases, it has been reported that some individuals also suffer from a myasthenic syndrome in addition to the classical occurrence of myopathy and cardiomyopathy. Since further studies on the NMJ pathology are hampered by the lack of available human striated muscle biopsy specimens, we exploited homozygous desmin knock-out mice which closely mirror the striated muscle pathology of human patients lacking desmin protein. Here, we report on the impact of the lack of desmin on the structure and function of NMJs and the transcription of genes coding for postsynaptic proteins. Desmin knock-out mice display a fragmentation of NMJs in soleus, but not in the extensor digitorum longus muscle. Moreover, soleus muscle fibers show larger NMJs. Further, transcription levels of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) genes are increased in muscles from desmin knock-out mice, especially of the AChRγ subunit, which is known as a marker of muscle fiber regeneration. Electrophysiological recordings depicted a pathological decrement of nerve-dependent endplate potentials and an increased rise time of the nerve-independent miniature endplate potentials. The latter appears related to the fragmentation of NMJs in desmin knockout mice. Our study highlights the essential role of desmin for the structural and functional integrity of mammalian NMJs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: The Dresden Protocol for Multidimensional Walking Assessment (DMWA) in Clinical Practice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.582046</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.582046</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Walking impairments represent one of the most debilitating symptom areas for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). It is important to detect even slightest walking impairments in order to start and optimize necessary interventions in time to counteract further progression of the disability. For this reason, a regular monitoring through gait analysis is highly necessary. At advanced stages of MS with significant walking impairment, this assessment is also necessary to optimize symptomatic treatment, choose the most suitable walking aid and plan individualized rehabilitation. In clinical practice, walking impairment is only assessed at higher levels of the disease using e.g., the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). In contrast to the EDSS, standardized functional tests such as walking speed, walking endurance and balance as well as walking quality and gait-related patient-reported outcomes allow a more holistic and sensitive assessment of walking impairment. In recent years, the MS Center Dresden has established a standardized monitoring procedure for the routine multidimensional assessment of gait and balance disorders. In the following protocol, we present the techniques and procedures for the analysis of gait and balance of people with MS at the MS Center Dresden. Patients are assessed with a multidimensional gait analysis at least once a year. This enables long-term monitoring of walking impairment, which allows early active intervention regarding further progression of disease and improves the current standard clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Excitotoxicity: Still Hammering the Ischemic Brain in 2020</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.579953</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Interest in excitotoxicity expanded following its implication in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain injury in the 1980s, but waned subsequent to the failure of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists in high profile clinical stroke trials. Nonetheless there has been steady progress in elucidating underlying mechanisms. This review will outline the historical path to current understandings of excitotoxicity in the ischemic brain, and suggest that this knowledge should be leveraged now to develop neuroprotective treatments for stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Collagen Nanoparticle-Mediated Brain Silymarin Delivery: An Approach for Treating Cerebral Ischemia and Reperfusion-Induced Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.538404</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Silymarin is a bioactive constituent isolated from milk thistle (Silybum marinum). Since its discovery, silymarin has been considered a gold standard drug in treating ailments related to the liver, resulting from alcohol consumption and viral hepatitis. This hepatoprotective nature of silymarin arises out of antioxidative and tissue-regenerating properties of silymarin. However, several recent studies have established the neuroprotective link of silymarin, too. Thus, the current investigation was aimed at exploring the neuroprotective effect of nanosilymarin (silymarin encapsulated inside collagen-based polymeric nanoparticulate drug delivery system). The study aimed at bringing out the role of nanoparticles in enhancing the therapeutic effect of silymarin against neuronal injury, originating out of oxidative-stress-related brain damages in focal cerebral ischemia. Collagen-based micellar nanoparticles were prepared and stabilized using 3-ethyl carbodiimide-hydrochloride (EDC-Hcl) and malondialdehyde (MDA) as crosslinkers. Nanoparticles were characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy techniques, and the size of nanoparticles was found to be around 48 nm. Male albino Wistar rats were pretreated with three different doses of nanosilymarin of 10, 100, and 1,000 μg/kg b.wt and a dose of free silymarin of 100 mg/kg b.wt intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 7 days. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model on the eighth day for 1 h followed by 24 h reperfusion. The animals were then evaluated for neurobehavioral, infarct analysis, biochemical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical studies. All the above parameters showed remarkable improvement in nanosilymarin-treated groups in comparison to the silymarin-treated group. Nanoparticle encapsulation of drug enhanced neuroprotection by increasing drug bioavailability and targeting. Thus, the present study concluded with satisfactory results, showing the critical role played by nanoparticles in improving the neuroprotection at very low drug doses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Beyond Pairwise Interactions: The Totally Antisymmetric Part of the Bispectrum as Coupling Measure of at Least Three Interacting Sources</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.573750</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.573750</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we make two contributions to the analysis of brain oscillations with CFC techniques. First, we introduce a new bispectral CFC measure which is selective to couplings between three or more brain sources. This measure can be derived from ordinary cross-bispectra by performing a total-antisymmetrization operation on them. Significant coupling values can then be attributed to at least three interacting signals. This selectivity to the number of sources can be helpful to test hypotheses on the number of brain sources involved in the generation of commonly observed brain oscillations, such as the alpha rhythm. In a second step we present the correct empirical distribution for the coupling measure, which is necessary to properly assess the significance of coupling results. More importantly however, this corrected statistic is not limited to our particular measure, but holds for all complex-valued coupling estimators. We illustrate how the very common misassumption of empirical normality of such estimators can lead to a systematic underestimation of p-values, the breakdown of multiple comparison control procedures and in consequence a drastic inflation of the number of false positives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Relationship Between Attention Bias and Psychological Index in Individuals With Chronic Low Back Pain: A Preliminary Event-Related Potential Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561726</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561726</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Attention bias towards pain-related information exists in patients with chronic pain, and recently, attention bias modification (ABM) training has been administered to patients with chronic pain. In this study, we conducted an attention bias modification task in conjunction with event-related potential measurements for individuals with chronic low back pain (LBP) and investigated the relationship between attention bias and psychological assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Eleven women and two men with chronic LBP participated in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The Japanese version of the STarT Back Screening Tool (J-SBST) total score was significantly correlated with the N1 amplitude of Cz. The J-SBST psychological score was significantly correlated with the N1 amplitude of Cz and with reaction time (RT). The Japanese version of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and Japanese version of the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II) scores were significantly correlated with the P2 amplitude at Fz (only PCS), Cz, and Pz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings suggest that J-SBST, which provides a comprehensive evaluation of psychological factors, PCN with measuring of catastrophizing in the context of actual or anticipated pain, and BDI-II, can likely help identify chronic LBP patients with attention bias. For chronic LBP patients who are classified according to J-SBST or PCN pain-related outcome improvement with ABM training can be expected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: White Matter Neuroplasticity: Motor Learning Activates the Internal Capsule and Reduces Hemodynamic Response Variability</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have noted the importance of white matter changes in motor learning, but existing literature only focuses on structural and microstructural MRI changes, as there are limited tools available for in vivo investigations of white matter function. One method that has gained recent prominence is the application of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI to white matter, with high-field scanners now being able to better detect the smaller hemodynamic changes present in this tissue type compared to those in the gray matter. However, fMRI techniques have yet to be applied to investigations of neuroplastic change with motor learning in white matter. White matter function represents an unexplored component of neuroplasticity and is essential for gaining a complete understanding of learning-based changes occurring throughout the whole brain. Twelve healthy, right-handed participants completed fine motor and gross motor tasks with both hands, using an MRI compatible computer mouse. Using a crossover design along with a prior analysis approach to establish WM activation, participants received a baseline scan followed by 2 weeks of training, returning for a midpoint and endpoint scan. The motor tasks were designed to be selectively difficult for the left hand, leading to a training effect only in that condition. Analysis targeted the comparison and detection of training-associated right vs left hand changes. A statistically significant improvement in motor task score was only noted for the left-hand motor condition. A corresponding change in the temporal characteristics of the white matter hemodynamic response was shown within only the right corticospinal tract. The hemodynamic response exhibited a reduction in the dispersion characteristics after the training period. To our knowledge, this is the first report of MRI detectable functional neuroplasticity in white matter, suggesting that modifications in temporal characteristics of white matter hemodynamics may underlie functional neuroplasticity in this tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Cortical Stimulation Induces Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials of Inferior Colliculus Neurons in a Frequency-Specific Manner</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Corticofugal modulation of auditory responses in subcortical nuclei has been extensively studied whereas corticofugal synaptic transmission must still be characterized. This study examined postsynaptic potentials of the corticocollicular system, i.e., the projections from the primary auditory cortex (AI) to the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICc) of the midbrain, in anesthetized C57 mice. We used focal electrical stimulation at the microampere level to activate the AI (ES&lt;sub&gt;AI&lt;/sub&gt;) and in vivo whole-cell current-clamp to record the membrane potentials of ICc neurons. Following the whole-cell patch-clamp recording of 88 ICc neurons, 42 ICc neurons showed ES&lt;sub&gt;AI&lt;/sub&gt;-evoked changes in the membrane potentials. We found that the ES&lt;sub&gt;AI&lt;/sub&gt; induced inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in 6 out of 42 ICc neurons but only when the stimulus current was 96 μA or higher. In the remaining 36 ICc neurons, excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were induced at a much lower stimulus current. The 36 ICc neurons exhibiting EPSPs were categorized into physiologically matched neurons (n = 12) when the characteristic frequencies of the stimulated AI and recorded ICc neurons were similar (≤1 kHz) and unmatched neurons (n = 24) when they were different (&amp;gt;1 kHz). Compared to unmatched neurons, matched neurons exhibited a significantly lower threshold of evoking noticeable EPSP, greater EPSP amplitude, and shorter EPSP latency. Our data allow us to propose that corticocollicular synaptic transmission is primarily excitatory and that synaptic efficacy is dependent on the relationship of the frequency tunings between AI and ICc neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Adaptive Surround Modulation of MT Neurons: A Computational Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.529345</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The classical receptive field (CRF) of a spiking visual neuron is defined as the region in the visual field that can generate spikes when stimulated by a visual stimulus. Many visual neurons also have an extra-classical receptive field (ECRF) that surrounds the CRF. The presence of a stimulus in the ECRF does not generate spikes but rather modulates the response to a stimulus in the neuron's CRF. Neurons in the primate Middle Temporal (MT) area, which is a motion specialist region, can have directionally antagonistic or facilitatory surrounds. The surround's effect switches between directionally antagonistic or facilitatory based on the characteristics of the stimulus, with antagonistic effects when there are directional discontinuities but facilitatory effects when there is directional coherence. Here, we present a computational model of neurons in area MT that replicates this observation and uses computational building blocks that correlate with observed cell types in the visual pathways to explain the mechanism of this modulatory effect. The model shows that the categorization of MT neurons based on the effect of their surround depends on the input stimulus rather than being a property of the neurons. Also, in agreement with neurophysiological findings, the ECRFs of the modeled MT neurons alter their center-surround interactions depending on image contrast.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Cortical Projection From the Premotor or Primary Motor Cortex to the Subthalamic Nucleus in Intact and Parkinsonian Adult Macaque Monkeys: A Pilot Tracing Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Besides the main cortical inputs to the basal ganglia, via the corticostriatal projection, there is another input via the corticosubthalamic projection (CSTP), terminating in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The present study investigated and compared the CSTPs originating from the premotor cortex (PM) or the primary motor cortex (M1) in two groups of adult macaque monkeys. The first group includes six intact monkeys, whereas the second group was made up of four monkeys subjected to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intoxication producing Parkinson’s disease (PD)-like symptoms and subsequently treated with an autologous neural cell ecosystem (ANCE) therapy. The CSTPs were labeled with the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), injected either in PM or in M1. BDA-labeled axonal terminal boutons in STN were charted, counted, and then normalized based on the number of labeled corticospinal axons in each monkey. In intact monkeys, the CSTP from PM was denser than that originating from M1. In two PD monkeys, the CSTP originating from PM or M1 were substantially increased, as compared to intact monkeys. In one other PD monkey, there was no obvious change, whereas the last PD monkey showed a decrease of the CSTP originating from M1. Interestingly, the linear relationship between CSTP density and PD symptoms yielded a possible dependence of the CSTP re-organization with the severity of the MPTP lesion. The higher the PD symptoms, the larger the CSTP densities, irrespective of the origin (from both M1 or PM). Plasticity of the CSTP in PD monkeys may be related to PD itself and/or to the ANCE treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cognitive Reserve, Leisure Activity, and Neuropsychological Profile in the Early Stage of Cognitive Decline</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.590607</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In older adults with normal cognition, cognitive reserve (CR) is known to be associated with the neuropsychological profile. We investigated the association between comprehensive CR and detailed neuropsychological profile in the early stage of cognitive decline. Fifty-five participants with mild cognitive impairment or subjective cognitive decline completed the cognitive reserve index questionnaire (CRIq) that yielded total, education, working activity, and leisure time scores (CRI-Total, CRI-Education, CRI-Working activity, and CRI-Leisure time, respectively). Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and detailed neuropsychological evaluation were performed. Psychiatric symptom scales were applied to measure depression, apathy, positive or negative affect, and quality of life. Correlation and linear regression analyses of the variables were performed. The effect of CR-Education, CRI-Working activity, and CRI-Leisure time on the composite cognitive score was determined using a multivariable regression model. We observed that for CRI-Total (B = 3.00, p = 0.005), CRI-Education (B = 3.39, p = 0.002), and CRI-Leisure time (B = 2.56, p = 0.015), CR correlated with MMSE scores, while only CRI-Leisure time associated with the naming ability (B = 2.20, p = 0.033) in the detailed neuropsychological test results of the participants. Multivariable regression model also indicated that among CRI subscores, CRI-Leisure time directly affects the composite cognitive score (β = 0.32, p = 0.011). We found that in the early stage of cognitive decline in older adults, comprehensive CR was associated with global cognition, and only leisure activity was identified to be associated with the detailed neuropsychological profile including naming ability. These results may imply the positive effect of leisure activity on cognitive function in the early stages of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cognitive and Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of COVID-19 and Effects on Elderly Individuals With Dementia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.588872</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread worldwide and has had unprecedented effects in healthcare systems, economies and society. COVID-19 clinical presentation primarily affects the respiratory system causing bilateral pneumonia, but it is increasingly being recognized as a systemic disease, with neurologic manifestations reported in patients with mild symptoms but, most frequently, in those in a severe condition. Elderly individuals are at high risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 due to factors associated with aging and a higher prevalence of medical comorbidities and, therefore, they are more vulnerable to possible lasting neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairments. Several reports have described insomnia, depressed mood, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and cognitive impairment in a proportion of patients after discharge from the hospital. The potential mechanisms underlying these symptoms are not fully understood but are probably multifactorial, involving direct neurotrophic effect of SARS-CoV-2, consequences of long intensive care unit stays, the use of mechanical ventilation and sedative drugs, brain hypoxia, systemic inflammation, secondary effects of medications used to treat COVID-19 and dysfunction of peripheral organs. Chronic diseases such as dementia are a particular concern not only because they are associated with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality but also because COVID-19 further exacerbates the vulnerability of those with cognitive impairment. In patients with dementia, COVID-19 frequently has an atypical presentation with mental status changes complicating the early identification of cases. COVID-19 has had a dramatical impact in long-term care facilities, where rates of infection and mortality have been very high. Community measures implemented to slow the spread of the virus have forced to social distancing and cancelation of cognitive stimulation programs, which may have contributed to generate loneliness, behavioral symptoms and worsening of cognition in patients with dementia. COVID-19 has impacted the functioning of Memory Clinics, research programs and clinical trials in the Alzheimer’s field, triggering the implementation of telemedicine. COVID-19 survivors should be periodically evaluated with comprehensive cognitive and neuropsychiatric assessments, and specific mental health and cognitive rehabilitation programs should be provided for those suffering long-term cognitive and psychiatric sequelae.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Association of Subcortical Structural Shapes With Tau, Amyloid, and Cortical Atrophy in Early-Onset and Late-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.563559</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The objectives of this study were to compare the topographical subcortical shape and to investigate the effects of tau or amyloid burden on atrophic patterns in early onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD). One hundred and sixty-one participants (53 EOAD, 44 LOAD, 33 young controls, and 31 older controls) underwent [18F]THK5351 positron emission tomography (PET), [18F]flutemetamol (FLUTE) PET, and 3T MRI scans. We used surface-based analysis to evaluate subcortical structural shape, permutation-based statistics for group comparisons, and Spearman’s correlations to determine associations with THK, FLUTE, cortical thickness, and neuropsychological test results. When compared to their age-matched controls, EOAD patients exhibited shape reduction in the bilateral amygdala, hippocampus, caudate, and putamen, while in LOAD patients, the bilateral amygdala and hippocampus showed decreased shapes. In EOAD, widespread subcortical shrinkage, with less association of the hippocampus, correlated with THK retention and cortical thinning, while in LOAD patients, subcortical structures were limited which had significant correlation with THK or mean cortical thickness. Subcortical structural shape showed less correlation with FLUTE global retention in both EOAD and LOAD. Multiple cognitive domains, except memory function, correlated with the bilateral amygdala, caudate, and putamen in EOAD patients, while more restricted regions in the subcortical structures were correlated with neuropsychological test results in LOAD patients. Subcortical structures were associated with AD hallmarks in EOAD. However, the correlation was limited in LOAD. Moreover, relationship between subcortical structural atrophy and cognitive decline were quite different between EOAD and LOAD. These findings suggest that the effects of Alzheimer’s pathologies on subcortical structural changes in EOAD and LOAD and they may have different courses of pathomechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Variation of connectivity across exemplar sensory and associative thalamocortical loops in the mouse</title>

	<description>The thalamus engages in sensation, action, and cognition, but the structure underlying these functions is poorly understood. Thalamic innervation of associative cortex targets several interneuron types, modulating dynamics and influencing plasticity.  Is this structure-function relationship distinct from that of sensory thalamocortical systems? Here, we systematically compared function and structure across a sensory and an associative thalamocortical loop in the mouse. Enhancing excitability of mediodorsal thalamus, an associative structure, resulted in prefrontal activity dominated by inhibition. Equivalent enhancement of medial geniculate excitability robustly drove auditory cortical excitation. Structurally, geniculate axons innervated excitatory cortical targets in a preferential manner and with larger synaptic terminals, providing a putative explanation for functional divergence. The two thalamic circuits also had distinct input patterns, with mediodorsal thalamus receiving innervation from a diverse set of cortical areas. Altogether, our findings contribute to the emerging view of functional diversity across thalamic microcircuits and its structural basis.</description>

	<title>eLife: Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry upon blocking N- and O-glycan elaboration</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61552</link>
	<description>The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, its receptor binding domain (RBD), and its primary receptor ACE2 are extensively glycosylated. The impact of this post-translational modification on viral entry is yet unestablished. We expressed different glycoforms of the Spike-protein and ACE2 in CRISPR-Cas9 glycoengineered cells, and developed corresponding SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. We observed that N- and O-glycans had only minor contribution to Spike-ACE2 binding. However, these carbohydrates played a major role in regulating viral entry. Blocking N-glycan biosynthesis at the oligomannose stage using both genetic approaches and the small molecule kifunensine dramatically reduced viral entry into ACE2 expressing HEK293T cells. Blocking O-glycan elaboration also partially blocked viral entry. Mechanistic studies suggest multiple roles for glycans during viral entry. Among them, inhibition of N-glycan biosynthesis enhanced Spike-protein proteolysis. This could reduce RBD presentation on virus, lowering binding to host ACE2 and decreasing viral entry. Overall, chemical inhibitors of glycosylation may be evaluated for COVID-19.</description>

	<title>eLife: Sonic hedgehog signaling directs patterned cell remodeling during cranial neural tube closure</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60234</link>
	<description>Neural tube closure defects are a major cause of infant mortality, with exencephaly accounting for nearly one-third of cases. However, the mechanisms of cranial neural tube closure are not well understood. Here we show that this process involves a tissue-wide pattern of apical constriction controlled by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Midline cells in the mouse midbrain neuroepithelium are short with large apical surfaces, whereas lateral cells are taller and undergo synchronous apical constriction, driving neural fold elevation. Embryos lacking the Shh effector Gli2 fail to produce appropriate midline cell architecture, whereas embryos with expanded Shh signaling, including the IFT-A complex mutants &lt;i&gt;Ift122&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ttc21b&lt;/i&gt; and embryos expressing activated Smoothened, display apical constriction defects in lateral cells. Disruption of lateral, but not midline, cell remodeling results in exencephaly. These results reveal a morphogenetic program of patterned apical constriction governed by Shh signaling that generates structural changes in the developing mammalian brain.</description>

	<title>eLife: Distinct subpopulations of mechanosensory chordotonal organ neurons elicit grooming of the fruit fly antennae</title>

	<description>Diverse mechanosensory neurons detect different mechanical forces that can impact animal behavior. Yet our understanding of the anatomical and physiological diversity of these neurons and the behaviors that they influence is limited. We previously discovered that grooming of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; antennae is elicited by an antennal mechanosensory chordotonal organ, the Johnston's organ (JO) (Hampel et al., 2015). Here, we describe anatomically and physiologically distinct JO mechanosensory neuron subpopulations that each elicit antennal grooming. We show that the subpopulations project to different, discrete zones in the brain and differ in their responses to mechanical stimulation of the antennae. Although activation of each subpopulation elicits antennal grooming, distinct subpopulations also elicit the additional behaviors of wing flapping or backward locomotion. Our results provide a comprehensive description of the diversity of mechanosensory neurons in the JO, and reveal that distinct JO subpopulations can elicit both common and distinct behavioral responses.</description>

	<description>In fission yeast, the septation initiation network (SIN) ensures temporal coordination between actomyosin ring (CAR) constriction with membrane ingression and septum synthesis. However, questions remain about CAR regulation under stress conditions. We show that Rgf1p (Rho1p GEF), participates in a delay of cytokinesis under cell wall stress (blankophor, BP). BP did not interfere with CAR assembly or the rate of CAR constriction, but did delay the onset of constriction in the wild type cells but not in the &lt;i&gt;rgf1&lt;/i&gt;Δ cells. This delay was also abolished in the absence of Pmk1p, the MAPK of the cell integrity pathway (CIP), leading to premature abscission and a multi-septated phenotype. Moreover, cytokinesis delay correlates with maintained SIN signaling and depends on the SIN to be achieved. Thus, we propose that the CIP participates in a checkpoint, capable of triggering a CAR constriction delay through the SIN pathway to ensure that cytokinesis terminates successfully.</description>

	<title>eLife: How many neurons are sufficient for perception of cortical activity?</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58889</link>
	<description>Many theories of brain function assume that information is encoded and behaviour is controlled through sparse, distributed patterns of activity. It is therefore crucial to place a lower bound on the amount of neural activity that can drive behaviour and to understand how neuronal networks operate within these constraints. We use an all-optical approach to test this lower limit by driving behaviour with targeted two-photon optogenetic activation of small ensembles of L2/3 pyramidal neurons in mouse barrel cortex while using two-photon calcium imaging to record the impact on the local network. By precisely titrating the number of neurons in activated ensembles we demonstrate that the lower bound for detection of cortical activity is ~14 pyramidal neurons. We show that there is a very steep sigmoidal relationship between the number of activated neurons and behavioural output, saturating at only ~37 neurons, and that this relationship can shift with learning. By simultaneously measuring activity in the local network, we show that the activation of stimulated ensembles is balanced by the suppression of neighbouring neurons. This surprising behavioural sensitivity in the face of potent network suppression supports the sparse coding hypothesis and suggests that perception of cortical activity balances a trade-off between minimizing the impact of noise while efficiently detecting relevant signals.</description>

	<description>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a liver tumor that usually arises in patients with cirrhosis. Hepatic stellate cells are key players in the progression of HCC, as they create a fibrotic micro-environment and produce growth factors and cytokines that enhance tumor cell proliferation and migration. We assessed the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the cross-talk between stellate cells and HCC-cells. Mice with a fibrotic HCC were treated with the IRE1α-inhibitor 4μ8C, which reduced tumor burden and collagen deposition. By co-culturing HCC-cells with stellate cells, we found that HCC-cells activate IREα in stellate cells, thereby contributing to their activation. Inhibiting IRE1α blocked stellate cell activation, which then decreased proliferation and migration of tumor cells in different &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; 2D and 3D co-cultures. In addition, we also observed cell-line specific direct effects of inhibiting IRE1α in tumor cells.</description>

	<description>Proteins generated by localized mRNA translation in axons support nerve regeneration through retrograde injury signaling and localized axon growth mechanisms. RNA binding proteins (RBP) are needed for this and other aspects of post-transcriptional control of localized mRNAs, but only a limited number of axonal RBPs have been reported. We used a targeted mass spectrometry approach to profile the axonal RBPs in naive, injured and regenerating PNS axons. We detected 76 axonal proteins that are reported to have RNA binding activity, with the levels of several of these axonal RBPs changing with axonal injury and regeneration. These axonal RBPs with altered axoplasm levels include KHSRP that we previously reported decreases neurite outgrowth in developing CNS neurons. We show that KHSRP levels rapidly increase in sciatic nerve axons after crush injury and remain elevated increasing in levels out to 28 days post-sciatic nerve crush injury. Khsrp mRNA localizes into axons and the rapid increase in axonal KHSRP after axotomy is mediated by the local translation of its mRNA. KHSRP binds to mRNAs with a 3'UTR AU-rich element and targets those mRNAs to the cytoplasmic exosome for degradation. KHSRP knockout mice show increased axonal levels of defined KHSRP target mRNAs, Gap43 and Snap25 mRNAs, following sciatic nerve injury and accelerated nerve regeneration in vivo. These data indicate that axonal translation of Khsrp mRNA following nerve injury serves to destabilize other axonal mRNAs and slow axon regeneration.</description>

	<description>For colour vision, retinal circuits must separate information about intensity and wavelength. This requires circuit level comparison of at least two spectrally distinct photoreceptors. However, many vertebrates use four or more, and in those cases the nature and implementation of this computation remains poorly understood. Here, we establish the complete circuit architecture and function of outer retinal circuits underlying colour processing in the tetrachromatic larval zebrafish. Our findings reveal that the specific spectral tunings of the four cone types near optimally rotate the encoding of natural daylight in a principal component analysis (PCA)-like manner to yield one primary achromatic axis, two colour opponent axes as well as a secondary UV-achromatic axis for prey capture. We note that fruit flies - the only other tetrachromat species where comparable circuit-level information is available - use essentially the same strategy to extract spectral information from their relatively blue-shifted terrestrial visual world. Together, our results suggest that rotating colour space into achromatic and chromatic axes at the eye's first synapse may be a fundamental principle of colour vision when using more than two spectrally well separated photoreceptor types.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: In Vivo two-photon imaging and parasympathetic neuromodulation of pancreatic microvascular dynamics in rats</title>

	<description>The pancreas has long been known to be densely innervated with parasympathetic, sympathetic, and visceral afferent fibers that are believed to exert significant influence on local endocrine activity and vascular function. Yet the extent to which these interactions depend on neurovascular dynamics in the normal and pathological states remain largely unknown. Herein we describe a new method for high resolution functional imaging of the rat pancreas in vivo. The method comprises a number of elements: a stability-optimized preparation in dorsal recumbency immobilizing several square centimeters of intact pancreas for upright fluorescent imaging while leaving access for concurrent manipulation of abdominal nerves, a full-frame two-photon imaging protocol and analysis pipeline supporting high-throughput (100+) monitoring of islet and acinar microvessel diameter dynamics simultaneously, and a first adaptation of random-access linescan imaging to the pancreas capable of tracking internal blood flow speeds up to 5 mm/s at 20 Hz across multiple microvessels. These methods were then deployed in concert to characterize the capacity of parasympathetic fibers to modulate pancreatic microvascular dynamics with compartment specificity. Electrical stimulation was repeatedly applied to the abdominal vagal trunks at various current magnitudes while imaging islet and acinar microvascular populations in the pancreas. Vagal stimulation consistently elicited increases in both islet and acinar capillary population motility in a current-dependent manner, with only acinar responsive vessels trending toward dilation. Further, we found vagal stimulation to profoundly and reversibly disrupt all traces of fast-wave vasomotor oscillation across a lobular arteriole-venule pair, and this was associated with a significant increase in average flow speed. Together, these findings add to mounting evidence that vagal projections exert tangible reversible influence on pancreatic microvascular activity and underscore the potential for new neuromodulation-based strategies to address diabetes, pancreatitis, or other diseases of the pancreas under autonomic nervous influence.</description>

	<description>Disinhibitory neurons throughout the mammalian cortex are powerful enhancers of circuit excitability and plasticity. The differential expression of neuropeptide receptors in disinhibitory, inhibitory and excitatory neurons suggests that each circuit motif is controlled by distinct neuropeptidergic systems. Here, we reveal that a bombesin-like neuropeptide, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), recruits disinhibitory cortical microcircuits through selective targeting and activation of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing cells. Using a newly-developed genetically-encoded GRP sensor and trans-synaptic tracing we reveal that GRP regulates VIP cells via extrasynaptic diffusion from several putative local and long-range sources. In vivo photometry and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the GRP receptor (GRPR) in auditory cortex indicate that VIP cells are strongly recruited by novel sounds and aversive shocks, and that GRP-GRPR signaling enhances auditory fear memories. Our data establish peptidergic recruitment of selective disinhibitory cortical microcircuits as a mechanism to regulate fear memories.</description>

	<description>Analysing the behavior of individuals or groups of animals in complex environments is an important, yet difficult computer vision task. Here we present a novel deep learning architecture for classifying animal behavior and demonstrate how this end-to-end approach can significantly outperform pose estimation-based approaches, whilst requiring no intervention after minimal training. Our behavioral classifier is embedded in a first-of-its-kind pipeline (SIPEC) which performs segmentation, identification, pose-estimation and classification of behavior all automatically. SIPEC successfully recognizes multiple behaviors of freely moving mice as well as socially interacting non-human primates in 3D, using data only from simple mono-vision cameras in home-cage setups.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Which are the central aspects of infant sleep? Thedynamic of sleep composites across infancy</title>

	<description>Sleep is ubiquitous during infancy and important for the well-being of both infant and parent. Therefore, there is large interest to characterize infant sleep with reliable tools, for example by means of combining actigraphy with 24-h-diaries. However, it is critical to select the right variables to characterize sleep. With a principal component analysis, we identified 5 underlying sleep composites from 48 commonly used sleep variables: Sleep Night, Sleep Day, Sleep Activity, Sleep Timing, and Sleep Variability. These composites accurately reflect the known changes of sleep throughout infancy as Sleep Day (representing naps), Sleep Activity (representing sleep efficiency and consolidation), and Sleep Variability (representing day-to-day stability) decrease across infancy, while Sleep Night (representing nighttime sleep) slightly increases and Sleep Timing becomes earlier with increasing age. Additionally, we uncover interesting dynamics between the sleep composites and demonstrate that infant sleep is not only highly variable between infants but also considerably dynamic within infants across time. Interestingly, Sleep Day is associated with behavioral development and therefore a potential marker for maturation. We recommend the use of sleep composites or of those specific single variables, which are solid representatives of the sleep composites for more reliable research.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Functional genomic analyses highlights a shift in Gpr17-regulated cellular processes in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) and underlying myelin dysregulation in the aged forebrain</title>

	<description>Brain aging is characterised by a decline in neuronal function and associated cognitive deficits. There is increasing evidence that myelin disruption is an important factor that contributes to the age-related loss of brain plasticity and repair responses. In the brain, myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes, which are generated throughout life by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Currently, a leading hypothesis points to aging as a major reason for the ultimate breakdown of remyelination in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, an incomplete understanding of the cellular and molecular processes underlying brain aging hinders the development of regenerative strategies. Here, our combined systems biology and neurobiological approach demonstrates that oligodendroglial and myelin genes are amongst the most altered in the aging mouse cortex. This was underscored by the identification of causal links between signaling pathways and their downstream transcriptional networks that define oligodendroglial disruption in aging. The results highlighted that the G-protein coupled receptor GPR17 is central to the disruption of OPC in aging and this was confirmed by genetic fate mapping and cellular analyses. Finally, we used systems biology strategies to identify therapeutic agents that rejuvenate OPC and restore myelination in age-related neuropathological contexts.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The Big Five personality traits and CNS arousal in the resting state</title>

	<description>Based on Eysenck's pioneering work, CNS arousal has long been considered an encouraging biological candidate that may explain individual differences in human personality. Yet, results from empirical studies remained inconclusive. Notably, the vast majority of published results have been derived from small samples, and EEG alpha power has usually served as exclusive indicator for CNS arousal. In this study, we selected N = 468 individuals of the LIFE-Adult cohort and investigated the associations between the Big Five personality traits and CNS arousal by using the low-resolution electromagnetic tomography-based analysis tool VIGALL. Our analyses revealed that subjects who reported higher levels of extraversion and openness to experience, respectively, exhibited lower levels of CNS arousal in the resting state. Bayesian and frequentist analysis results were especially convincing for openness to experience. Among the lower-order personality traits, we obtained strongest evidence for neuroticism facet 'impulsivity' and reduced CNS arousal. We regard these findings as well in line with the postulations of Eysenck and Zuckerman and consistent with the assumptions of the 'arousal regulation model'. Our results also agree with meta-analytically derived effect sizes in the field of individual differences research, highlighting the need for large studies with at least several hundreds of subjects.</description>

	<description>In recent years, zebrafish have become well established for the study of fundamental biology, toxicology and drug discovery. Here we propose fast, standardized protocols for high-throughput and high-content 3D imaging of 5dpf zebrafish EE using a confocal laser scanning microscope. Using a lipophilic fluorescent dye, we generated a reference labeling in cleared fish. We developed a mounting method based on 3D-printed stamps used to create a grid of wells in an agarose cast. We demonstrate that the quality and homogeneity of the fluorescence signal allows an unequivocal segmentation of the whole specimen and the white matter. From there, we built an automated image registration and analysis pipeline for the volumetric analysis of morphological defects. The platform, termed ZeBraInspector, is focused on the analysis of the shape of the whole EE or the white-matter of the central nervous system. A user-friendly software to visualize at large scale registered and segmented 3D images can be downloaded from https://tefor.net/portfolio/zebrainspector. We finally provide two examples of application: the characterization of a phenotype associated with a neuro-developmental mutation, and the defects caused by treatments with a toxic anti-cancer compound. ZeBraInspector can be adapted to a wide variety of high-content analyses.</description>

	<description>Regulation of circadian behavior and physiology by the Drosophila brain clock requires communication from central clock neurons to downstream output regions, but the mechanism by which clock cells regulate downstream targets is not known. We show here that the pars intercerebralis (PI), previously identified as a target of the morning cells in the clock network, also receives input from evening cells. We determined that morning and evening clock neurons have time of day dependent connectivity to the PI, which is regulated by specific peptides as well as by fast neurotransmitters. Interestingly, PI cells that secrete the peptide DH44, and control rest:activity rhythms, are inhibited by clock inputs while insulin-producing cells are activated, indicating that the same clock cells can use different mechanisms to drive cycling in output neurons. Inputs of morning cells to the DILP2+ neurons are relevant for the circadian rhythm of feeding, reinforcing the role of the PI as a circadian relay that controls multiple behavioral outputs. Our findings provide mechanisms by which clock neurons signal to non-clock cells to drive rhythms of behavior.</description>

	<description>Most stroke patients do not use their paretic limb whereas they are able to. The Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) is effective to reverse this non-use behaviour in some patients but is inapplicable or unsuccessful on others. Here, we investigate how much non-use could come from shoulder weakness instead of the behavioural conditioning treated by the CIMT. We asked 26 healthy participants to reach a target while holding a dumbbell. We found that 18/26 participants exhibit proximal arm non-use when loaded and that non-use reduces shoulder torque of final posture. We either found that non-use improves accuracy in a high gravity field. Following optimal control policy, we explain how the non-use could be an adaptative solution when the shoulder is weak. Our results show the need to include muscular strength into cost function used to model human movement. The framework presented here suggests that psychological non-use could be treated effectively with CIMT, while physiological non-use, resulting from shoulder weakness, might respond better to anti-gravity muscles strengthening.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: ALS monocyte-derived microglia reveal cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulation, DNA damage, and cell-specific impairment of phagocytosis associated with disease progression.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.25.354399v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Aims: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease characterised by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons. Neuroinflammation mediated by microglial activation is evident in post-mortem brain tissues, and in brain imaging of patients with ALS. However, the exact role of microglia in ALS remains to be elucidated partly due to the lack of an accurate microglial model system that is able to recapitulate the clinical pathology of ALS. Moreover, direct sampling of microglia from patients with ALS is not feasible, further limiting the study of microglial function in ALS. To address this shortcoming, we describe an approach that generates monocyte-derived microglia (MDMi) that are capable of expressing molecular markers, and functional characteristics similar to resident human brain microglia. Importantly, MDMi can be routinely and reproducibly generated from ALS patient blood, and reveal patient heterogeneity associated with age, sex and disease subgroup. Methods: MDMi were successfully established from all 30 ALS patients, including 15 patients with slow disease progression, 6 with intermediate progression, and 9 with rapid progression, together with 20 non-affected heathy controls (HC). Results: Our ALS MDMi model recapitulated canonical pathological features of ALS including non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated-TDP-43-positive pathological inclusions. We further observed significantly impaired phagocytosis, altered cytokine expression and microglial morphology, as well as elevated DNA damage in ALS compared to HC MDMi. Abnormal phagocytosis was observed in all ALS cases, and was correlated to the progression of disease. Moreover, in-depth analysis of individual microglia revealed cell-specific variation in phagocytic function that was significantly altered, and exacerbated in rapid disease progression. Conclusions: Our approach enabled us to generate ALS patient microglia from peripheral blood samples using a rapid, robust, cost-effective, and reproducible protocol. We have shown that ALS monocyte-derived microglia have significantly altered functional behaviour compared to age-matched HCs, with a major deficit in phagocytic activity. This is also the first demonstration of abnormal TDP-43 localisation in microglia grown from ALS patients. Overall, this approach is highly applicable to monitor disease progression and can be applied as a functional readout in clinical trials for anti-neuroinflammatory agents. Additionally, this model system can be used as a basis for personalised therapeutic treatment for ALS, as well as other neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<description>Sensorimotor adaptation is an important part of our ability to learn to perform novel motor tasks (i.e., learning of motor skills). Efforts to improve adaptation in healthy and clinical patients using non-invasive brain stimulation methods have been hindered by inter-individual and intra-individual variability in brain susceptibility to stimulation. Here, we explore unpredictable loud acoustic stimulation as an alternative method of modulating brain excitability to improve sensorimotor adaptation. In two experiments, participants moved a cursor towards targets, and adapted to a 30 degree rotation of cursor feedback, either with or without unpredictable acoustic stimulation. Acoustic stimulation improved initial adaptation to sensory prediction errors in Study 1, and improved overnight retention of adaptation in Study 2. Unpredictable loud acoustic stimulation might thus be a potent method of modulating sensorimotor adaptation in healthy adults.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Gender inequality in academia: Problems and solutions for women faculty in STEM</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24631?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently there is widespread interest in women's underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); however, progress toward gender equality in these fields is slow. More alarmingly, these gender disparities worsen when examining women's representation within STEM departments in academia. While the number of women receiving postgraduate degrees has increased in recent years, the number of women in STEM faculty positions remains largely unchanged. One explanation for this lack of progress toward gender parity is negative and pervasive gender stereotypes, which may facilitate hiring discrimination and reduce opportunities for women's career advancement. Women in STEM also have lower social capital (e.g., support networks), limiting women's opportunities to earn tenure and learn about grant funding mechanisms. Women faculty in STEM may also perceive their academic climate as unwelcoming and threatening, and report hostility and uncomfortable tensions in their work environments, such as sexual harassment and discrimination. Merely the presence of gender‐biased cues in physical spaces targeted toward men (e.g., “geeky” décor) can foster a sense of not belonging in STEM. We describe the following three factors that likely contribute to gender inequalities and women's departure from academic STEM fields: (a) numeric underrepresentation and stereotypes, (b) lack of supportive social networks, and (c) chilly academic climates. We discuss potential solutions for these problems, focusing on National Science Foundation‐funded ADVANCE organizational change interventions that target (a) recruiting diverse applicants (e.g., training search committees), (b) mentoring, networking, and professional development (e.g., promoting women faculty networks); and (c) improving academic climate (e.g., educating male faculty on gender bias).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Divergent membrane properties of mouse cochlear glial cells around hearing onset</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Divergent membrane properties of mouse cochlear glial cells around hearing onset&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/879cf2dc-4be0-4abe-aab9-2b1b1d01c269/jnr24744-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mouse cochlear glial cells have region‐specific membrane properties. Within dissociated cultures, satellite glial cells (SGCs) have large weak inwardly rectifying currents, likely mediated by Kir4.1 channels. Presumptive Schwann cells lack these currents. Soon after birth, Kir4.1 subunits appear in both glial subtypes, but become restricted to SGCs around hearing onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are the primary afferent neurons of the auditory system, and together with their attendant glia, form the auditory nerve. Within the cochlea, satellite glial cells (SGCs) encapsulate the cell body of SGNs, whereas Schwann cells (SCs) wrap their peripherally‐ and centrally‐directed neurites. Despite their likely importance in auditory nerve function and homeostasis, the physiological properties of auditory glial cells have evaded description. Here, we characterized the voltage‐activated membrane currents of glial cells from the mouse cochlea. We identified a prominent weak inwardly rectifying current in SGCs within cochlear slice preparations (postnatal day P5‐P6), which was also present in presumptive SGCs within dissociated cultures prepared from the cochleae of hearing mice (P14‐P15). Pharmacological block by Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and desipramine suggested that channels belonging to the Kir4 family mediated the weak inwardly rectifying current, and &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; immunofluorescence implicated the involvement of Kir4.1 subunits. Additional electrophysiological profiles were identified for glial cells within dissociated cultures, suggesting that glial subtypes may have specific membrane properties to support distinct physiological roles. Immunofluorescence using fixed cochlear sections revealed that although Kir4.1 is restricted to SGCs after the onset of hearing, these channels are more widely distributed within the glial population earlier in postnatal development (i.e., within both SGCs and SCs). The decrease in Kir4.1 immunofluorescence during SC maturation was coincident with a reduction of Sox2 expression and advancing neurite myelination. The data suggest a diversification of glial properties occurs in preparation for sound‐driven activity in the auditory nerve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Dynamics of perineuronal nets over amphibian metamorphosis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2a9886c2-2c89-4792-8061-5ce5b17ef5c6/cne25055-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate a dramatic, brain‐wide reorganization of perineuronal nets (PNNs) during metamorphosis in an anuran amphibian. A sharp reduction of PNNs precedes the overhaul of amphibian morphology and neural circuitry that transitions the animal from an aquatic to terrestrial lifestyle. In mammals, PNNs regulate neuronal plasticity and maturation. Results suggest PNN temporal dynamics are important to understanding their role in neural development, learning, and memory.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular matrix materials known as perineuronal nets (PNNs) have been shown to have remarkable consequences for the maturation of neural circuits and stabilization of behavior. It has been proposed that, due to the possibly long‐lived biochemical nature of their components, PNNs may be an important substrate by which long‐term memories are stored in the central nervous system. However, little empirical evidence exists that shows that PNNs are themselves stable once established. Thus, the question of their temporal dynamics remains unresolved. We leverage the dramatic morphological and behavioral transformations that occur during amphibian metamorphosis to show that PNNs can be highly dynamic in nature. We used established lectin histochemistry to show that PNNs undergo drastic reconstruction during the metamorphic transition. Pre‐metamorphic tadpoles have abundant lectin‐labeled pericellular material, which we interpret to be PNNs, surrounding neurons throughout the central nervous system. During the metamorphic transition, these structures degrade, and begin to reform in the months following metamorphosis. We show that PNN sizes and staining intensity further change over metamorphosis, suggesting compositional rearrangement. We found PNNs in brain regions with putative homology to regions in mammals with known PNN function, and in other shared regions where PNN function is unknown. Our results suggest that PNNs are susceptible to remodeling by endogenous mechanisms during development. Interpreting the roles of PNNs in circuit maturation and stability requires understanding their temporal relationship with the neurons and synapses they surround. Our work provides further impetus to investigate this relationship in tandem with developmental and behavioral studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Hippocampal spatial memory representations in mice are heterogeneously stable</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The population of hippocampal neurons actively coding space continually changes across days as mice repeatedly perform tasks. Many hippocampal place cells become inactive while other previously silent neurons become active, challenging the idea that stable behaviors and memory representations are supported by stable patterns of neural activity. Active cell replacement may disambiguate unique episodes that contain overlapping memory cues, and could contribute to reorganization of memory representations. How active cell replacement affects the evolution of representations of different behaviors within a single task is unknown. We trained mice to perform a delayed nonmatching to place task over multiple weeks, and performed calcium imaging in area CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus using head‐mounted miniature microscopes. Cells active on the central stem of the maze “split” their calcium activity according to the animal's upcoming turn direction (left or right), the current task phase (study or test), or both task dimensions, even while spatial cues remained unchanged. We found that, among reliably active cells, different splitter neuron populations were replaced at unequal rates, resulting in an increasing number of cells modulated by turn direction and a decreasing number of cells with combined modulation by both turn direction and task phase. Despite continual reorganization, the ensemble code stably segregated these task dimensions. These results show that hippocampal memories can heterogeneously reorganize even while behavior is unchanging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Selective neuromodulation and mutual inhibition within the CA3–CA2 system can prioritize sequences for replay</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make optimal use of previous experiences, important neural activity sequences must be prioritized during hippocampal replay. Integrating insights about the interplay between CA3 and CA2, we propose a conceptual framework that allows the two regions to control which sequences are reactivated. We suggest that neuromodulatory‐gated plasticity and mutual inhibition enable discrete assembly sequences in both regions to support each other while suppressing competing sequences. This perspective provides a coherent interpretation for a variety of seemingly disconnected functional properties of CA2 and paves the way for a more general understanding of CA2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: The ratio of posterior–anterior medial temporal lobe volumes predicts source memory performance in healthy young adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23251?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23251?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A functional gradient has been proposed across the medial temporal lobes (MTL) such that the anterior MTL is thought to support processing of individual items (e.g., item memory and complex object perception), whereas the posterior MTL is thought to support item‐context retrieval (e.g., source memory). Whereas functional imaging studies have provided evidence supporting this anatomical organization, results from structural analyses remain inconclusive. The current study examined the relationship between volume of MTL regions of interest (ROIs), and performance on a source memory task and a fine‐grain complex object perception task, in healthy young adults (mean age = 21.5, range = 18–29). Using a semiautomated procedure, we segmented the parahippocampal and perirhinal cortices (PHC, PRC), posteromedial and anterolateral entorhinal cortices (pmERC, alERC), and posterior and anterior hippocampus (postHC, antHC) on high‐resolution T2‐weighted MRIs. Regional volumes were computed as proportions of intracranial volume, and as posterior–anterior volumetric ratios (PHC:PRC, pmERC:alERC, postHC:antHC). Partial‐least squares regressions were applied to predict source and item memory, and perceptual discrimination accuracy, based on ROI and ratio volumes. In our ROI regressions, we found that postHC volume was positively correlated with a latent factor predicting source memory, and PRC and antHC volumes were negatively correlated to this latent factor. In our ratio regressions, we observed an effect relating the posterior–anterior distribution of gray matter across the MTL with source memory. Our results demonstrate differential associations between anterior and posterior MTL and source memory performance. Findings from this study highlight the importance of considering patterns of structure–behavior associations in the neurobiology of episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Spatial encoding in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus is related during deliberation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23250?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23250?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliberation is thought to involve the internal simulation of the outcomes of candidate actions, the valuation of those outcomes, and the selection of the actions with the highest expected value. While it is known that deliberation involves prefrontal cortical areas, specifically the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), as well as the hippocampus (HPC) and other brain regions, how these areas process prospective information and select actions is not well understood. We recorded simultaneously from ensembles in dmPFC and CA1 of dorsal HPC in rats during performance of a spatial contingency switching task, and examined the relationships between spatial and reward encoding in these two areas during deliberation at the choice point. We found that CA1 and dmPFC represented either goal locations or the current position simultaneously, but that when goal locations were encoded, HPC and dmPFC did not always represent the same goal location. Ensemble activity in dmPFC predicted when HPC would represent goal locations, but on a broad timescale on the order of seconds. Also, reward encoding in dmPFC increased during hippocampal theta cycles where CA1 ensembles represented the goal location. These results suggest that dmPFC and HPC share prospective information during deliberation, that dmPFC may influence whether HPC represents prospective information, and that information recalled about goal locations by HPC may be integrated into dmPFC reward representations on fast timescales.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Optogenetic “low‐theta” pacing of the septohippocampal circuit is sufficient for spatial goal finding and is influenced by behavioral state and cognitive demand</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal theta oscillations show prominent changes in frequency and amplitude depending on behavioral state or cognitive demands. How these dynamic changes in theta oscillations contribute to the spatial and temporal organization of hippocampal cells, and ultimately behavior, remain unclear. We used low‐theta frequency optogenetic stimulation to pace coordination of cellular and network activity between the medial septum (MS) and hippocampus during baseline and MS stimulation while rats were at rest or performing a spatial accuracy task with a visible or hidden goal zone. Hippocampal receptivity to pan‐neuronal septal stimulation at low‐theta frequency was primarily determined by speed and secondarily by task demands. Competition between artificial and endogenous field potentials at theta frequency attenuated hippocampal phase preference relative to local theta, but the spike‐timing activity of hippocampal pyramidal cells was effectively driven by artificial septal output, particularly during the hidden goal task. Notwithstanding temporal reorganization by artificial theta stimulation, place field properties were unchanged and alterations to spatial behavior were limited to goal zone approximation. Our results indicate that even a low‐theta frequency timing signal in the septohippocampal circuit is sufficient for spatial goal finding behavior. The results also advance a mechanistic understanding of how endogenous or artificial somatodendritic timing signals relate to displacement computations during navigation and spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Neur1 and Neur2 are required for hippocampus‐dependent spatial memory and synaptic plasticity</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt;, mouse homologs of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila neur&lt;/i&gt; gene, consist of two neuralized homology repeat domains and a RING domain. Both &lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt; are expressed in the whole adult brain and encode E3 ubiquitin ligases, which play a crucial role in the Notch signaling pathways. A previous study reported that overexpression of &lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; enhances hippocampus‐dependent memory, whereas the role of &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt; remains largely unknown. Here, we aimed to elucidate the respective roles of &lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt; in hippocampus‐dependent memory using three lines of genetically modified mice: &lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; knock‐out, &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt; knock‐out, and &lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt; double knock‐out (D‐KO). Our results showed that spatial memory was impaired when both &lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt; were deleted, but not in the individual knock‐out of either &lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, basal synaptic properties estimated by input–output relationships and paired‐pulse facilitation did not change, but a form of long‐term potentiation that requires protein synthesis was specifically impaired in the D‐KO mice. These results collectively suggest that &lt;i&gt;Neur1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neur2&lt;/i&gt; are crucially involved in hippocampus‐dependent spatial memory and synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Tonic GABA‐activated synaptic and extrasynaptic currents in dentate gyrus granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons along the mouse hippocampal dorsoventral axis</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is a medial temporal lobe structure in the brain and is widely studied for its role in memory and learning, in particular, spacial memory and emotional responses. It was thought to be a homogenous structure but emerging evidence shows differentiation along the dorsoventral axis and even microdomains for functional and cellular markers. We have examined in two cell‐types of the hippocampal projection neurons, the dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons, if the GABA‐activated tonic current density varied between the dorsal (septal) and the ventral (temporal) poles of the male mouse hippocampus. Tonic synaptic currents, arising from spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC, mIPSC), and extrasynaptic tonic currents were evaluated. The results revealed different levels of sIPSC but not mIPSC density between the dorsal and ventral hippocampal neurons for both the DG granule cells and the CA3 pyramidal neurons. The extrasynaptic tonic current density was larger in the DG granule cells as compared to the CA3 pyramidal neurons but did not vary between the dorsal and ventral regions. IPSC bursting was observed in both cell‐types in the ventral hippocampus but was more common in the CA3 pyramidal neurons. Only in the dorsal DG granule cells was the level of the sIPSC and mIPSC density similar. The results indicate that the tonic GABAergic inhibition is particularly strong in the ventral hippocampal DG granule cells and enhanced in the dorsal as compared to the ventral hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anatomy and physiology of monosynaptic connections in rodent hippocampal CA1 have been extensively studied in recent decades. Yet, the resulting knowledge remains disparate and difficult to reconcile. Here, we present a data‐driven approach to integrate the current state‐of‐the‐art knowledge on the synaptic anatomy and physiology of rodent hippocampal CA1, including axo‐dendritic innervation patterns, number of synapses per connection, quantal conductances, neurotransmitter release probability, and short‐term plasticity into a single coherent resource. First, we undertook an extensive literature review of paired recordings of hippocampal neurons and compiled experimental data on their synaptic anatomy and physiology. The data collected in this manner is sparse and inhomogeneous due to the diversity of experimental techniques used by different groups, which necessitates the need for an integrative framework to unify these data. To this end, we extended a previously developed workflow for the neocortex to constrain a unifying &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; reconstruction of the synaptic physiology of CA1 connections. Our work identifies gaps in the existing knowledge and provides a complementary resource toward a more complete quantification of synaptic anatomy and physiology in the rodent hippocampal CA1 region.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Retinal thickness predicts the risk of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To analyze longitudinal changes of retinal thickness and their predictive value as biomarkers of disease progression in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with Lewy body diseases (LBDs) were enrolled and prospectively evaluated at 3 years, including patients with iPD (n=42), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n=4), E46K‐SNCA mutation carriers (n=4) and controls (n=17). All participants underwent Spectralis retinal optical coherence tomography and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score was obtained in patients. Macular ganglion‐inner plexiform layer complex (GCIPL) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness reduction rates were estimated with linear mixed models. Risk ratios were calculated to evaluate the association between baseline GCIPL and pRNFL thickness and the risk of subsequent cognitive and motor worsening, using clinically meaningful cut‐offs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCIPL thickness in the parafoveal region (1‐ to 3‐mm ring) presented the largest reduction rate. The annualized atrophy rate was 0.63 μm in iPD patients and 0.23 μm in controls (p&amp;lt;0.0001). iPD patients with lower parafoveal GCIPL and pRNFL thickness at baseline presented an increased risk of cognitive decline at 3 years (RR 3.49, 95% CI 1.10 – 11.1, p=0.03 and RR 3.28, 95% CI 1.03 – 10.45, p=0.045, respectively). We did not identify significant associations between retinal thickness and motor deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results provide evidence of the potential use of OCT‐measured parafoveal GCIPL thickness to monitor neurodegeneration and to predict the risk of cognitive worsening over time in iPD.&lt;/p&gt;

Detection of community structure has become a fundamental step in the analysis of biological networks with application to protein function annotation, disease gene prediction, and drug discovery. This recent impact creates a need to make these techniques and their accompanying visualization schemes available to a broad range of biologists. Here we present a service-oriented, end-to-end software framework, CDAPS (Community Detection APplication and Service), that integrates the identification, annotation, visualization, and interrogation of multiscale network communities, accessible within the popular Cytoscape network analysis platform. With novel design principles, CDAPS addresses unmet new challenges, such as identifying hierarchical community structures, comparison of outputs generated from diverse network resources, and easy deployment of new algorithms, to facilitate community-sourced science. We demonstrate that the CDAPS framework can be applied to high-throughput protein-protein interaction networks to gain novel insights, such as the identification of putative new members of known protein complexes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_fx4itCnAzY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Epitope-based vaccines have revolutionized vaccine research in the last decades. Due to their complex nature, bioinformatics plays a pivotal role in their development. However, existing algorithms address only specific parts of the design process or are unable to provide formal guarantees on the quality of the solution. We present a unifying formalism of the general epitope vaccine design problem that tackles all phases of the design process simultaneously and combines all prevalent design principles. We then demonstrate how to formulate the developed formalism as an integer linear program, which guarantees optimality of the designs. This makes it possible to explore new regions of the vaccine design space, analyze the trade-offs between the design phases, and balance the many requirements of vaccines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nvLDR88lAFw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Availability of genome sequence, molecular, and clinical phenotype data for large patient cohorts generated by recent technological advances provides an opportunity to dissect the genetic architecture of complex diseases at system level. However, previous analyses of such data have largely focused on the co-localization of SNPs associated with clinical and expression traits, each identified from genome-wide association studies and expression quantitative trait locus mapping. Thus, their description of the molecular mechanisms behind the SNPs influencing clinical phenotypes was limited to the single gene linked to the co-localized SNP. Here we introduce PerturbNet, a statistical framework for learning gene networks that modulate the influence of genetic variants on phenotypes, using genetic variants as naturally occurring perturbation of a biological system. PerturbNet uses a probabilistic graphical model to directly model the cascade of perturbation from genetic variants to the gene network to the phenotype network along with the networks at each layer of the biological system. PerturbNet learns the entire model by solving a single optimization problem with an efficient algorithm that can analyze human genome-wide data within a few hours. PerturbNet inference procedures extract a detailed description of how the gene network modulates the genetic effects on phenotypes. Using simulated and asthma data, we demonstrate that PerturbNet improves statistical power for detecting disease-linked SNPs and identifies gene networks and network modules mediating the SNP effects on traits, providing deeper insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hqvKuf9z9iM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Retinal horizontal cells of goldfish (Carassius auratus) display subtype‐specific differences in spontaneous action potentials in situ</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Retinal horizontal cells of goldfish (Carassius auratus) display subtype‐specific differences in spontaneous action potentials in situ&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7c4c2104-2f26-4f43-a4c3-2d3402272aa4/cne25054-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We measured [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; using fura‐2 imaging in all subtypes (H1–H4) of goldfish retinal horizontal cells in isolated cell and tissue slice preparations, and report spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;‐based action potentials (APs) in every subtype. In both preparations, APs differed by subtype: APs were longer and less frequent in H3/4.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horizontal cells (HCs) are neurons of the outer retina, which provide inhibitory feedback onto photoreceptors and contribute to image processing. HCs in teleosts are classified into four subtypes (H1–H4), each having different roles: H1–H3 feed back onto different sets of cones, H4 feed back onto rods, and only H1 store and release the inhibitory neurotransmitter, γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA). Dissociated HCs exhibit spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;‐based action potentials (APs), yet it is unclear if APs occur in situ, or if all subtypes exhibit APs. We measured intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and report APs in slice preparations of the goldfish retina. In HCs furthest from photoreceptors (i.e., H3/H4), APs were less frequent, with greater duration and area under the curve (a measure of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux). Next, we classified acutely dissociated HCs into subtypes by integrating the ratio of dendritic field size vs. soma size (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;). H1 and H2 subtypes had low &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; values (&amp;lt;8); H3/H4 had high &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;gt;12). To verify this model, H1s were identified by immunoreactivity for GABA and 95% of these cells had an &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 4. In Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging experiments, as &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; increased, AP duration and area under the curve increased, while frequency decreased. Our results demonstrate the presence of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;‐based APs in the goldfish retina in situ and show that HC subtypes H1 through H4 exhibit progressively longer and less frequent spontaneous APs. These results suggest that APs may play an important role in inhibitory feedback, and may have implications for understanding the relative contributions of HC subtypes in the outer retina.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Noninvasive Characterization of Human Glymphatics and Meningeal Lymphatics in an in vivo Model of Blood–Brain Barrier Leakage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25928?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25928?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate human glymphatics and meningeal lymphatics noninvasively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prospective study implemented 3‐dimensional (3D) isotropic contrast‐enhanced T2 fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (CE‐T2‐FLAIR) imaging with a 3T magnetic resonance machine to study cerebral glymphatics and meningeal lymphatics in patients with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) with (n = 92) or without (n = 90) blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and a diseased control group with cluster headache (n = 35). The contrast agent gadobutrol (0.2mmol/kg [0.2ml/kg]) was administered intravenously in all study subjects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, 217 patients (182 RCVS, 35 cluster headache) were analyzed and separated into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of visible gadolinium (Gd) leakage. Para‐arterial tracer enrichment was clearly depicted in those with overt BBB disruption, while paravenous and parasinus meningeal contrast enrichment was evident in both groups. Paravenous and parasinus contrast enrichment remained in RCVS patients in the remission stage and in cluster headache patients, suggesting that these meningeal lymphatic channels were universal anatomical structures rather than being phase‐ or condition‐specific. Additionally, we demonstrated nodular leptomeningeal enhancement in 32.3% of participants, which might represent potential lymphatic reservoirs. Four selected RCVS patients who received consecutive contrasted 3D isotropic FLAIR imaging after gadobutrol administration showed that the Gd persisted for at least 54 minutes and was completely cleared within 18 hours.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This large‐scale in vivo study successfully demonstrated the putative human para‐arterial glymphatic transports and meningeal lymphatics by clear depiction of para‐arterial, parasinus, and paravenous meningeal contrast enrichment using high‐resolution 3D isotropic CE‐T2‐FLAIR imaging noninvasively; this technique may serve as a basis for further studies to delineate clinical relevance of glymphatic clearance.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A Stearoyl–Coenzyme A Desaturase Inhibitor Prevents Multiple Parkinson Disease Phenotypes in α‐Synuclein Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25920?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25920?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson disease (PD) has useful symptomatic treatments that do not slow the neurodegenerative process, and no significant disease‐modifying treatments are approved. A key therapeutic target in PD is α‐synuclein (αS), which is both genetically implicated and accumulates in Lewy bodies rich in vesicles and other lipid membranes. Reestablishing αS homeostasis is a central goal in PD. Based on previous lipidomic analyses, we conducted a mouse trial of a stearoyl–coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) inhibitor (“5b”) that prevented αS‐positive vesicular inclusions and cytotoxicity in cultured human neurons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral dosing and brain activity of 5b were established in nontransgenic mice. 5b in drinking water was given to mice expressing wild‐type human αS (WT) or an amplified familial PD αS mutation (E35K + E46K + E61K [&quot;3K&quot;]) beginning near the onset of nigral and cortical neurodegeneration and the robust PD‐like motor syndrome in 3K. Motor phenotypes, brain cytopathology, and SCD‐related lipid changes were quantified in 5b‐ versus placebo‐treated mice. Outcomes were compared to effects of crossing 3K to SCD1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5b treatment reduced αS hyperphosphorylation in E46K‐expressing human neurons, in 3K neural cultures, and in both WT and 3K αS mice. 5b prevented subtle gait deficits in WT αS mice and the PD‐like resting tremor and progressive motor decline of 3K αS mice. 5b also increased αS tetramers and reduced proteinase K‐resistant lipid‐rich aggregates. Similar benefits accrued from genetically deleting 1 SCD allele, providing target validation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prolonged reduction of brain SCD activity prevented PD‐like neuropathology in multiple PD models. Thus, an orally available SCD inhibitor potently ameliorates PD phenotypes, positioning this approach to treat human α‐synucleinopathies. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Vision adaptation in the laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis, Linnaeus, 1766) inferred from structural, ultrastructural, and genetic characterization&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b22a8fee-1ce5-4e87-855e-3786ccec8218/cne25059-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We characterized the under‐explored retina of the laughing dove, &lt;i&gt;Streptopelia senegalensis&lt;/i&gt;. In addition to light and electron microscopy, we sequenced the short wavelength sensitive opsin SWS1. Using phylogeny and multiple sequence alignment, we found that the SWS1 is a violet sensitive opsin. Our results showed the presence of retinal pigmented epithelium that has plentiful melanosomes. There were various oil droplets, cones, horizontal, amacrine, bipolar, and Müller cells. Oligodendrocytes myelinated the nerve fiber layer. Overall, our data suggests a link between the structural variation and the photic adaptation

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroanatomy of the retina reflects adaptation and acclimation for dark and light conditions. Retinal cells and genes must be functionally adjusted to various environmental luminosities. Opsins are brilliant molecules to assess the adaptations at the genetic and phenotypic levels. Photic adaptations may reveal new mechanisms that enhance vision abilities. Through the investigation of histological, ultra‐structural constituents of the whole retinal layers, and the sequencing of shortwave length sensitive opsin 1 (SWS1) of the laughing dove (&lt;i&gt;Streptopelia senegalensis&lt;/i&gt;), the current study confirms the plasticity of the retina in response to the natural photic conditions. Retinal pigmented epithelium has plentiful melanosomes, signifying a highly adapted eye for maximum light perception and protection. Variously colored oil droplets signify high color vision ability. Stratified outer nuclear layer with many Müller cells suggests high sensitivity to dim conditions and high retinal regeneration. The penetration of outer limiting membrane by photoreceptor nuclei and Müller cell microvilli could minimize the light reflection. Oligodendrocytes establish thick myelination demanded for a keen visual acuity. A functional violet sensitive SWS1 with crucial Ser90 is presumed. Molecular phylogeny showed a secondary loss as color vision was shifted back from UVS to the ancestral avian VS, thus improving visual resolution. However, SWS1 has some UV sensitive residues. These findings implicate not only spectral adaptations with high color vision ability and acuity but also photo‐induced structural reorganizations. Further studies are needed to assess the secrets between photons and the structural genes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Discordant monozygotic Parkinson disease twins: Role of mitochondrial integrity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25942?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25942?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though genetic predisposition has proven to be an important element in Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology, monozygotic (MZ) twins with PD displayed a concordance rate of only about 20% despite their shared identical genetic background&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recruited five pairs of MZ twins discordant for idiopathic PD and established skin fibroblast cultures to investigate mitochondrial phenotypes in these cellular models against the background of a presumably identical genome. To test for genetic differences, we performed whole genome sequencing, deep mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing, and tested for mitochondrial deletions by multiplex real‐time PCR in the fibroblast cultures. Further, the fibroblast cultures were tested for mitochondrial integrity by immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, flow cytometry, and real‐time PCR to quantify gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome sequencing did not identify any genetic difference. We found decreased mitochondrial functionality with reduced cellular ATP levels, altered mitochondrial morphology, elevated protein levels of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), and increased levels of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐gamma coactivator‐α (&lt;i&gt;PPARGC1A)&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in skin fibroblast cultures from the affected compared to the unaffected twins. Further, there was a tendency for a higher number of somatic mtDNA variants among the affected twins.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate disease‐related differences in mitochondrial integrity in the genetically identical twins. Of note, the clinical expression matches functional alterations of the mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;

Here, the authors develop a Galc flox mouse line to model Krabbe disease and unveil that early postnatal GALC neuronal expression is critical for disease pathogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/dVfblptUcKI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Here, the authors perform MD simulations and identify an optimal path for DNA primer strand translocation in the E. coli replicative DNA polymerase III and characterise the kinetics and dynamics of the Pol III pol-to-exo mode transition, which is validated with mutagenesis experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/vPHtb9-FhOs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: The Creatine Transporter Unfolded: A Knotty Premise in the Cerebral Creatine Deficiency Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.588954</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Creatine provides cells with high-energy phosphates for the rapid reconstitution of hydrolyzed adenosine triphosphate. The eponymous creatine transporter (CRT1/SLC6A8) belongs to a family of solute carrier 6 (SLC6) proteins. The key role of CRT1 is to translocate creatine across tissue barriers and into target cells, such as neurons and myocytes. Individuals harboring mutations in the coding sequence of the human CRT1 gene develop creatine transporter deficiency (CTD), one of the pivotal underlying causes of cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome. CTD encompasses an array of clinical manifestations, including severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, autism, development delay, and motor dysfunction. CTD is characterized by the absence of cerebral creatine, which implies an indispensable role for CRT1 in supplying the brain cells with creatine. CTD-associated variants dramatically reduce or abolish creatine transport activity by CRT1. Many of these are point mutations that are known to trigger folding defects, leading to the retention of encoded CRT1 proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and precluding their delivery to the cell surface. Misfolding of several related SLC6 transporters also gives rise to detrimental pathologic conditions in people; e.g., mutations in the dopamine transporter induce infantile parkinsonism/dystonia, while mutations in the GABA transporter 1 cause treatment-resistant epilepsy. In some cases, folding defects are amenable to rescue by small molecules, known as pharmacological and chemical chaperones, which restore the cell surface expression and transport activity of the previously non-functional proteins. Insights from the recent molecular, animal and human case studies of CTD add toward our understanding of this complex disorder and reveal the wide-ranging effects elicited upon CRT1 dysfunction. This grants novel therapeutic prospects for the treatment of patients afflicted with CTD, e.g., modifying the creatine molecule to facilitate CRT1-independent entry into brain cells, or correcting folding-deficient and loss-of-function CTD variants using pharmacochaperones and/or allosteric modulators. The latter justifies a search for additional compounds with a capacity to correct mutation-specific defects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Investigation of MLH1, MGMT, CDKN2A, and RASSF1A Gene Methylation in Thymomas From Patients With Myasthenia Gravis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.567676</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.567676</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A feature of thymomas is their frequent association with myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies directed to different targets at the neuromuscular junction. Indeed, almost 30–40% of thymomas are found in patients with a type of MG termed thymoma-associated MG (TAMG). Recent studies suggest that TAMG-associated thymomas could represent a molecularly distinct subtype of thymic epithelial tumors (TETs), but few data are still available concerning the epigenetic modifications occurring in TAMG tissues. The promoter methylation levels of DNA repair (MLH1 and MGMT) and tumor suppressor genes (CDKN2A and RASSF1A) have been frequently investigated in TETs, but methylation data in TAMG tissues are scarce and controversial. To further address this issue, we investigated MLH1, MGMT, CDKN2A, and RASSF1A methylation levels in blood samples and surgically resected thymomas from 69 patients with TAMG and in the adjacent normal thymus available from 44 of them. Promoter methylation levels of MLH1, MGMT, CDKN2A, and RASSF1A genes were not increased in cancer with respect to healthy tissues and did not correlate with the histological or pathological features of the tumor or with the MG symptoms. The present study suggests that hypermethylation of these genes is not frequent in TAMG tissues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Purpose&lt;p&gt;To develop a method to reconstruct quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) from multi-echo, multi-flip angle data collected using strategically acquired gradient echo (STAGE) imaging.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The proposed QSM reconstruction algorithm, referred to as “structurally constrained Susceptibility Weighted Imaging and Mapping” scSWIM, performs an ℓ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ℓ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; regularization-based reconstruction in a single step. The unique contrast of the T1 weighted enhanced (T1WE) image derived from STAGE imaging was used to extract reliable geometry constraints to protect the basal ganglia from over-smoothing. The multi-echo multi-flip angle data were used for improving the contrast-to-noise ratio in QSM through a weighted averaging scheme. The measured susceptibility values from scSWIM for both simulated and in vivo data were compared to the: original susceptibility model (for simulated data only), the multi orientation COSMOS (for in vivo data only), truncated k-space division (TKD), iterative susceptibility weighted imaging and mapping (iSWIM), and morphology enabled dipole inversion (MEDI) algorithms. Goodness of fit was quantified by measuring the root mean squared error (RMSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM). Additionally, scSWIM was assessed in ten healthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The unique contrast and tissue boundaries from T1WE and iSWIM enable the accurate definition of edges of high susceptibility regions. For the simulated brain model without the addition of microbleeds and calcium, the RMSE was best at 5.21ppb for scSWIM and 8.74ppb for MEDI thanks to the reduced streaking artifacts. However, by adding the microbleeds and calcium, MEDI’s performance dropped to 47.53ppb while scSWIM performance remained the same. The SSIM was highest for scSWIM (0.90) and then MEDI (0.80). The deviation from the expected susceptibility in deep gray matter structures for simulated data relative to the model (and for the in vivo data relative to COSMOS) as measured by the slope was lowest for scSWIM + 1%(−1%); MEDI + 2%(−11%) and then iSWIM −5%(−10%). Finally, scSWIM measurements in the basal ganglia of healthy subjects were in agreement with literature.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study shows that using a data fidelity term and structural constraints results in reduced noise and streaking artifacts while preserving structural details. Furthermore, the use of STAGE imaging with multi-echo and multi-flip data helps to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in QSM data and yields less artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Systematic Review: Anaesthetic Protocols and Management as Confounders in Rodent Blood Oxygen Level Dependent Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (BOLD fMRI)–Part A: Effects of Changes in Physiological Parameters</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.577119</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.577119</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: To understand brain function in health and disease, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used in rodent models. Because animals need to be immobilised for image acquisition, fMRI is commonly performed under anaesthesia. The choice of anaesthetic protocols and may affect fMRI readouts, either directly or via changing physiological balance, and thereby threaten the scientific validity of fMRI in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The present study systematically reviewed the literature investigating the influence of different anaesthesia regimes and changes in physiological parameters as confounders of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI in rats and mice. Four databases were searched, studies selected according to pre-defined criteria, and risk of bias assessed for each study. Results are reported in two separate articles; this part of the review focuses on effects of changes in physiological parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 121 publications was included, of which 49 addressed effects of changes in physiological parameters. Risk of bias was high in all included studies. Blood oxygenation [arterial partial pressure of oxygen (p&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)], ventilation [arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (p&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] and arterial blood pressure affected BOLD fMRI readouts across various experimental paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Blood oxygenation, ventilation and arterial blood pressure should be monitored and maintained at stable physiological levels throughout experiments. Appropriate anaesthetic management and monitoring are crucial to obtain scientifically valid, reproducible results from fMRI studies in rodent models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Dissecting Neuronal Activation on a Brain-Wide Scale With Immediate Early Genes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.569517</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visualizing neuronal activation on a brain-wide scale yet with cellular resolution is a fundamental technical challenge for neuroscience. This would enable analyzing how different neuronal circuits are disrupted in pathology and how they could be rescued by pharmacological treatments. Although this goal would have appeared visionary a decade ago, recent technological advances make it eventually feasible. Here, we review the latest developments in the fields of genetics, sample preparation, imaging, and image analysis that could be combined to afford whole-brain cell-resolution activation mapping. We show how the different biochemical and optical methods have been coupled to study neuronal circuits at different spatial and temporal scales, and with cell-type specificity. The inventory of techniques presented here could be useful to find the tools best suited for a specific experiment. We envision that in the next years, mapping of neuronal activation could become routine in many laboratories, allowing dissecting the neuronal counterpart of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Feasibility of Glutamate and GABA Detection in Pons and Thalamus at 3T and 7T by Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.559314</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.559314</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glutamate detection in pons and thalamus using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS) after an intervention is of interest for studying various brain disorders. However, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS in these brain regions is challenging and time-consuming, especially in longitudinal study designs. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS of more cortical structures at the ultrahigh magnetic field strength of 7T yields an improved spectral output, including separation of the glutamate signal from the glutamine signal, in a shorter and more feasible scan time, as compared to conventional clinical field strengths. For this purpose, we compared the feasibility of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS at 3T and 7T in pons and thalamus by applying a longitudinal study design of repeated measures on same day and three separate days at both field strength in five healthy participants. Total &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS acquisition time was reduced by a factor 3.75 for pons and by a factor 3 for thalamus at 7T as compared to 3T. We found higher spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (p &amp;lt; 0.001), lower linewidth (p = 0.001) and lower Cramér–Rao lower bounds (CRLB) (p &amp;lt; 0.001) for the combined glutamate and glutamine signal (Glx) in thalamus at 7T as compared to 3T. In pons, CRLB of Glx and SNR were lower at 7T (p = 0.002 and p = 0.006), with no differences in linewidth compared to 3T. Mean within-subject variability of Glx concentration estimates was lower at 7T compared to 3T for both pons and thalamus. At 7T, it was possible to assess glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) simultaneously in pons and thalamus. In conclusion, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS at 7T resulted in improved spectral quality while allowing shorter scan times than at 3T as well as estimation of the pure glutamate signal in pons and thalamus. This opens up the opportunity for multimodal study designs and multiregional subcortical &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS research. Glutamate and GABA measurement at 7T in pons and thalamus is advantageous for future investigations of excitatory–inhibitory mechanisms in brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Crossed Corticospinal Facilitation Between Arm and Trunk Muscles Correlates With Trunk Control After Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.583579</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.583579</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate whether crossed corticospinal facilitation between arm and trunk muscles is preserved following spinal cord injury (SCI) and to elucidate these neural interactions for postural control during functional arm movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 22 subjects with incomplete SCI motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the erector spinae (ES) muscle were examined when the contralateral arm was at rest or performed 20% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of biceps brachii (BB) or triceps brachii (TB). Trunk function was assessed with rapid shoulder flexion and forward-reaching tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: MEP amplitudes in ES were increased during elbow flexion in some subjects and this facilitatory effect was more prominent in subjects with thoracic SCI than in the subjects with cervical SCI. Those who showed the increased MEPs during elbow flexion had faster reaction times and quicker anticipatory postural adjustments of the trunk in the rapid shoulder flexion task. The onset of EMG activity in ES during the rapid shoulder flexion task correlated with the trunk excursion in forward-reaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that crossed corticospinal facilitation in the trunk muscles can be preserved after SCI and is reflected in trunk control during functional arm movements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: STN Versus GPi Deep Brain Stimulation for Action and Rest Tremor in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578615</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578615</link>
	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;To investigate the effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internus (GPi), deep brain stimulation (DBS) on individual action tremor/postural tremor (AT) and rest tremor (RT) in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Randomized DBS studies have reported marked benefit in tremor with both GPi and STN and DBS, however, there is a paucity of information available on AT vs RT when separated by the surgical target.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We retrospectively reviewed the 1-year clinical outcome of PD patients treated with STN and GPi DBS at the University of Florida. We specifically selected patients with moderate to severe AT. Eighty-eight patients (57 STN and 31 GPi) were evaluated at 6 and 12 months for changes in AT and RT in the OFF-medication/ON stimulation state. A comparison of “response” was performed and defined as greater than or equal to a 2-point decrease in tremor score.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;STN and GPi DBS both improved AT at 6- and 12-months post-implantation (p &amp;lt; 0.001 and p &amp;lt; 0.001). The STN DBS group experienced a greater improvement in AT at 6 months compared to the GPi group (p = 0.005) but not at the 12 months follow-up (p = 0.301). Both STN and GPi DBS also improved RT at 6- and 12-months post-implantation (p &amp;lt; 0.001 and p &amp;lt; 0.001). There was no difference in RT scores between the two groups at 6 months (p = 0.23) or 12 months (p = 0.74). The STN group had a larger proportion of patients who achieved a “response” in AT at 6 months (p &amp;lt; 0.01), however, this finding was not present at 12 months (p = 0.23). A sub-analysis revealed that in RT, the STN group had a larger percentage of “responders” when followed through 12 months (p &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Both STN and GPi DBS reduced PD associated AT and RT at 12 months follow-up. There was no advantage of either brain target in the management of RT or AT. One nuance of the study was that STN DBS was more effective in suppressing AT in the early postoperative period, however, this effect diminished over time. Clinicians should be aware that it may take longer to achieve a similar tremor outcome when utilizing the GPi target.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Case Report of Dual-Site Neurostimulation and Chronic Recording of Cortico-Striatal Circuitry in a Patient With Treatment Refractory Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.569973</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.569973</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Psychiatric disorders are increasingly understood as dysfunctions of hyper- or hypoconnectivity in distributed brain circuits. A prototypical example is obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), which has been repeatedly linked to hyper-connectivity of cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) loops. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) and lesions of CSTC structures have shown promise for treating both OCD and related disorders involving over-expression of automatic/habitual behaviors. Physiologically, we propose that this CSTC hyper-connectivity may be reflected in high synchrony of neural firing between loop structures, which could be measured as coherent oscillations in the local field potential (LFP). Here we report the results from the pilot patient in an Early Feasibility study (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03184454) in which we use the Medtronic Activa PC+ S device to simultaneously record and stimulate in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS). We hypothesized that frequency-mismatched stimulation should disrupt coherence and reduce compulsive symptoms. The patient reported subjective improvement in OCD symptoms and showed evidence of improved cognitive control with the addition of cortical stimulation, but these changes were not reflected in primary rating scales specific to OCD and depression, or during blinded cortical stimulation. This subjective improvement was correlated with increased SMA and VC/VS coherence in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands, signals which persisted after correcting for stimulation artifacts. We discuss the implications of this research, and propose future directions for research in network modulation in OCD and more broadly across psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Network Oscillations During Gait in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human bipedal walking is a complex motor task that requires supraspinal control for balance and flexible coordination of timing and scaling of many muscles in different environment. Gait impairments are a hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD), reflecting dysfunction of cortico-basal ganglia-brainstem circuits. Recent studies using implanted electrodes and surface electroencephalography have demonstrated gait-related brain oscillations in the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. Here, we review the physiological and pathophysiological roles of (1) basal ganglia oscillations, (2) cortical oscillations, and (3) basal ganglia-cortical interactions during walking. These studies extend a novel framework for movement of disorders where specific patterns of abnormal oscillatory synchronization in the basal ganglia thalamocortical network are associated with specific signs and symptoms. Therefore, we propose that many gait dysfunctions in PD arise from derangements in brain network, and discuss potential therapies aimed at restoring gait impairments through modulation of brain network in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Long-Term Effects of Maternal Deprivation on the Volume of Dopaminergic Nuclei and Number of Dopaminergic Neurons in Substantia Nigra and Ventral Tegmental Area in Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Early life adversities leave long-lasting structural and functional consequences on the brain, which may persist later in life. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is extremely important in mood and motor control. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of maternal deprivation during the ninth postnatal day on the volume of dopaminergic nuclei and the number of dopaminergic neurons in adolescence and adulthood. Maternally deprived and control Wistar rats were sacrificed on postnatal day 35 or 60, and the dopaminergic neurons were stained in coronal histological sections of ventral midbrain with the tyrosine hydroxylase antibody. The volume of dopaminergic nuclei and the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) were analyzed in three representative coordinates. Maternal deprivation caused weight loss on postnatal day 21 (weaning) and corticosterone blood level elevation on postnatal days 35 and 60 in stressed compared to control rats. In maternally deprived animals, the volumes of SN and VTA were increased compared to the controls. This increase was accompanied by an elevation in the number of dopaminergic neurons in both nuclei. Altogether, based on somatic and corticosterone level measurements, maternal deprivation represents a substantial adversity, and the phenotype it causes in adulthood includes increased volume of the dopaminergic nuclei and number of dopaminergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a high incidence rate and complicated pathogenesis. Currently, all anti-AD drugs treat the symptoms of the disease, and with currently no cure for AD. Flavonoid containing natural products, Myricetin (MYR) and Dihydromyricetin (DMY), are abundant in fruits and vegetables, and have been approved as food supplements in some countries. Interestingly, MYR and DMY have been reported to have anti-AD effects. However, the underlying anti-AD mechanism of action of MYR and DMY is complex with many facets being identified. In this review, we explore the benefit of MYR and DMY in AD patients from a molecular level. Their mechanism of action are discussed from various aspects including amyloid β-protein (Aβ) imbalance, neuroinflammation, dyshomeostasis of metal ions, autophagy disorder, and oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Long-Term Running Exercise Delays Age-Related Changes in White Matter in Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Running exercise, one of the strategies to protect brain function, has positive effects on neurons and synapses in the cortex and hippocampus. However, white matter, as an important structure of the brain, is often overlooked, and the effects of long-term running exercise on white matter are unknown. Here, 14-month-old male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were divided into a middle-aged control group (18-month-old control group), an old control group (28-month-old control group), and a long-term runner group (28-month-old runner group). The rats in the runner group underwent a 14-month running exercise regime. Spatial learning ability was tested using the Morris water maze, and white matter volume, myelinated fiber parameters, total mature oligodendrocyte number, and white matter capillary parameters were investigated using stereological methods. The levels of growth factors related to nerve growth and vascular growth in peripheral blood and the level of neurite outgrowth inhibitor-A (Nogo-A) in white matter were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The present results indicated that long-term running exercise effectively delayed the age-related decline in spatial learning ability and the atrophy of white matter by protecting against age-related changes in myelinated fibers and oligodendrocytes in the white matter. Moreover, long-term running exercise prevented age-related changes in capillaries within white matter, which might be related to the protective effects of long-term exercise on aged white matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the neurodegenerative brain disorders inducing nearly half of dementia cases, and the diagnosis and treatment of AD are the primary issues clinically. However, there is a lack of effective biomarkers and drugs for AD diagnosis and therapeutics so far. In this study, bioinformatics analysis combined with an experimental verification strategy was used to identify the biomarkers and the quercetin targets for AD diagnosis and treatment. First, differentially expressed genes in the AD brain were identified by microarray data analysis. Second, quercetin, a predominant flavonoid, was used to screen the target genes. Third, the drug–disease network was determined, and the target genes of quercetin treatment were obtained in AD-related HT-22 cell-based assay. Six genes, including MAPT, PIK3R1, CASP8, DAPK1, MAPK1, and CYCS, were validated by the system pharmacology analysis in the hippocampus samples of AD patients. The results suggested that MAPT, PIK3R1, CASP8, and DAPK1 were significantly increased, but MAPK1 and CYCS were significantly decreased in HT-22 cells after Aβ1-42 treatment. Moreover, MAPK1 and CYCS were markedly increased, but MAPT, PIK3R1, CASP8, and DAPK1 were markedly decreased after quercetin treatment in these HT-22 cells. Altogether, MAPT, PIK3R1, CASP8, DAPK1, MAPK1, and CYCS are all the biomarkers for AD diagnosis and the targets of quercetin treatment, and our findings may provide valuable biomarkers for AD diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: To explore the changes of neuroinflammatory factors in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and their correlation with monoamine neurotransmitters in Parkinson’s disease (PD) with depression (PD-D) patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Neuroinflammatory factors and neurotransmitters in CSF were measured and compared between PD with no depression (PD-ND) and PD-D groups. The relationship between PD-D and neuroinflammatory factors was studied by binary logistic regression equation, and the related factors of PD-D were adjusted. The correlations of the levels of neuroinflammatory factors and neurotransmitters in PD-D group were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in CSF from PD-D group were significantly higher and there were no significant differences in the levels of interleukin-1β, prostaglandin (PG) E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and nitric oxide (NO). The 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-24) score was positively correlated with the level of TNF-α in CSF. Binary logistic regression showed that the OR of CSF TNF-α level was 1.035 (95% CI 1.002–1.069). The level of dopamine (DA) in CSF of PD-D group was significantly lower than that in PD-ND group. TNF-α level was negatively correlated with DA level in CSF from PD patients (r = −0.320, P = 0.003).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Neuroinflammatory factors, especially TNF-α, may play an important role in PD-D. It may cause damage to DA neurons and lead to the depletion of DA, which is related to the occurrence and development of PD-D.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Gut Microbiome Signatures Are Biomarkers for Cognitive Impairment in Patients With Ischemic Stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is a common neuropsychiatric complication of stroke. Mounting evidence has demonstrated a connection between gut microbiota (GM) and neuropsychiatric disease. Our previous study revealed the changes in the GM in a mouse model of vascular dementia. However, the characteristic GM of PSCI remains unclear. This study aimed to characterize the GM of PSCI and explored the potential of GM as PSCI biomarkers. A total of 93 patients with ischemic stroke were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into two groups according to their MoCA scores 3 months after stroke onset. Clinical data and biological variables were recorded. GM composition was analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, and the characteristic GM was identified by linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (Lefse). Our results showed that Proteobacteria was highly increased in the PSCI group compared with the post-stroke non-cognitive impairment (PSNCI) group, the similar alterations were also observed at the class, order, family, and genus levels of Proteobacteria. After age adjustments, the abundance of Firmicutes, and its members, including Clostridia, Clostridiales, Lachnospiraceae, and Lachnospiraceae_other, were significantly decreased in the age-matched PSCI group compared with the PSNCI group. Besides, the GM was closely associated with MoCA scores and the risk factors for PSCI, including higher baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score, higher homocysteine (Hcy) level, higher prevalence of stroke recurrence, leukoaraiosis, and brain atrophy. The KEGG results showed the enriched module for folding, sorting and degradation (chaperones and folding catalysts) and the decreased modules related to metabolisms of cofactors and vitamins, amino acid, and lipid in PSCI patients. A significant correlation was observed between PSCI and the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae after adjustments (P = 0.035). Moreover, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) models based on the characteristic GM and Enterobacteriaceae could distinguish PSCI patients from PSNCI patients [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.840, 0.629, respectively]. Our findings demonstrated that the characteristic GM, especially Enterobacteriaceae, might have the ability to predict PSCI in post-stroke patients, which are expected to be used as clinical biomarkers of PSCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>While long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes have attracted a lot of attention in the last decade, the focus regarding their mechanisms of action has been primarily on the RNA product of these genes. Recent work on several lncRNAs genes demonstrates that not only is the produced RNA species important, but also that transcription of the lncRNA locus alone can have regulatory functions. Like the functions of lncRNA transcripts, the mechanisms that underlie these genome-based functions are varied. Here we highlight some of these examples and provide an outlook on how the functional mechanisms of a lncRNA gene can be determined.</description>

	<title>eLife: SON and SRRM2 are essential for nuclear speckle formation</title>

	<description>The nucleus of higher eukaryotes is a highly compartmentalized and dynamic organelle consisting of several biomolecular condensates that regulate gene expression at multiple levels (Banani et al., 2017; Shin and Brangwynne, 2017). First reported more than 100 years ago by Ramón y Cajal, nuclear speckles (NS) are among the most prominent of such condensates (Spector and Lamond, 2011). Despite their prevalence, research on the function of NS is virtually restricted to colocalization analyses, since an organizing core, without which NS cannot form, remains unidentified (Chen and Belmont, 2019; Galganski et al., 2017). The monoclonal antibody SC35, which was raised against a spliceosomal extract, is a frequently used reagent to mark NS since its debut in 1990 (Fu and Maniatis, 1990). Unexpectedly, we found that this antibody has been misidentified and the main target of SC35 mAb is SRRM2, a large (~300 kDa), spliceosome-associated (Jia and Sun, 2018) protein with prominent intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that sharply localizes to NS (Blencowe et al., 1994). Here we show that, the core of NS is likely formed by SON and SRRM2, since depletion of SON leads only to a partial disassembly of NS as reported previously (Ahn et al., 2011; Fei et al., 2017; Sharma et al., 2010), in contrast, combined depletion of SON together with SRRM2, but not other NS associated factors, or depletion of SON in a cell line where IDRs of SRRM2 are genetically deleted, leads to a near-complete dissolution of NS. This work, therefore, paves the way to study the role of NS under diverse physiological and stress conditions.</description>

	<title>eLife: Telomerase biogenesis requires a novel Mex67 function and a cytoplasmic association with the Sm7 complex</title>

	<description>The templating RNA is the core of the telomerase reverse transcriptase. In &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the complex life cycle and maturation of telomerase includes a cytoplasmic stage. However, timing and reason for this cytoplasmic passage are poorly understood. Here, we use inducible RNA tagging experiments to show that immediately after transcription, newly synthesized telomerase RNAs undergo one round of nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling. Their export depends entirely on Crm1/Xpo1, whereas re-import is mediated by Kap122 plus redundant, kinetically less efficient import pathways. Strikingly, Mex67 is essential to stabilize newly transcribed RNA before Xpo1-mediated nuclear export. The results further show that the Sm&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; complex associates with and stabilizes the telomerase RNA in the cytoplasm and promotes its nuclear re-import. Remarkably, after this cytoplasmic passage, the nuclear stability of telomerase RNA no longer depends on Mex67. These results underscore the utility of inducible RNA tagging and challenge current models of telomerase maturation.</description>

	<description>Exercise has a wide range of systemic effects. In animal models, repeated exertion reduces malignant tumor progression, and clinically, exercise can improve outcome for cancer patients. The etiology of the effects of exercise on tumor progression are unclear, as are the cellular actors involved. We show here that in mice, exercise-induced reduction in tumor growth is dependent on CD8+ T cells, and that metabolites produced in skeletal muscle and excreted into plasma at high levels during exertion in both mice and humans enhance the effector profile of CD8+ T-cells. We found that activated murine CD8+ T cells alter their central carbon metabolism in response to exertion in vivo, and that immune cells from trained mice are more potent antitumor effector cells when transferred into tumor-bearing untrained animals. These data demonstrate that CD8+ T cells are metabolically altered by exercise in a manner that acts to improve their antitumoral efficacy.</description>

	<title>eLife: Structural rearrangement of amyloid-β upon inhibitor binding suppresses formation of Alzheimer disease related oligomers</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59306</link>
	<description>The formation of oligomers of the amyloid-β peptide plays a key role in the onset of Alzheimer's disease. We describe herein the investigation of disease-relevant small amyloid-β oligomers by mass spectrometry and ion mobility spectrometry, revealing functionally relevant structural attributes. In particular we can show that amyloid-β oligomers develop in two distinct arrangements leading to either neurotoxic oligomers and fibrils or non-toxic amorphous aggregates. Comprehending the key-attributes responsible for those pathways on a molecular level is a pre-requisite to specifically target the peptide's tertiary structure with the aim to promote the emergence of non-toxic aggregates. Here we show for two fibril inhibiting ligands, an ionic molecular tweezer and a hydrophobic peptide that despite their different interaction mechanisms, the suppression of the fibril pathway can be deduced from the disappearance of the corresponding structure of the first amyloid-β oligomers.</description>

	<title>eLife: Allosteric mechanism for KCNE1 modulation of KCNQ1 potassium channel activation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57680</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57680</link>
	<description>The function of the voltage-gated KCNQ1 potassium channel is regulated by co-assembly with KCNE auxiliary subunits. KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels generate the slow delayed rectifier current, I&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt;, which contributes to the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. A three amino acid motif (F57-T58-L59, FTL) in KCNE1 is essential for slow activation of KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels. However, how this motif interacts with KCNQ1 to control its function is unknown. Combining computational modeling with electrophysiological studies, we developed structural models of the KCNQ1-KCNE1 complex that suggest how KCNE1 controls KCNQ1 activation. The FTL motif binds at a cleft between the voltage-sensing and pore domains and appears to affect the channel gate by an allosteric mechanism. Comparison with the KCNQ1-KCNE3 channel structure suggests a common transmembrane-binding mode for different KCNEs and illuminates how specific differences in the interaction of their triplet motifs determine the profound differences in KCNQ1 functional modulation by KCNE1 versus KCNE3.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: CystAnalyser: A new software tool for the automatic detection and quantification of cysts in Polycystic Kidney and Liver Disease, and other cystic disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008337</guid>

The Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is characterized by progressive renal cyst development and other extrarenal manifestation including Polycystic Liver Disease (PLD). Phenotypical characterization of animal models mimicking human diseases are commonly used, in order to, study new molecular mechanisms and identify new therapeutic approaches. The main biomarker of disease progression is total volume of kidney and liver in both human and mouse, which correlates with organ function. For this reason, the estimation of the number and area of the tissue occupied by cysts, is critical for the understanding of physiological mechanisms underlying the disease. In this regard, cystic index is a robust parameter commonly used to quantify the severity of the disease. To date, the vast majority of biomedical researchers use ImageJ as a software tool to estimate the cystic index by quantifying the cystic areas of histological images after thresholding. This tool has imitations of being inaccurate, largely due to incorrectly identifying non-cystic regions. We have developed a new software, named CystAnalyser (register by Universidade de Santiago de Compostela–USC, and Fundación Investigación Sanitaria de Santiago—FIDIS), that combines automatic image processing with a graphical user friendly interface that allows investigators to oversee and easily correct the image processing before quantification. CystAnalyser was able to generate a cystic profile including cystic index, number of cysts and cyst size. In order to test the CystAnalyser software, 795 cystic kidney, and liver histological images were analyzed. Using CystAnalyser there were no differences calculating cystic index automatically versus user input, except in specific circumstances where it was necessary for the user to distinguish between mildly cystic from non-cystic regions. The sensitivity and specificity of the number of cysts detected by the automatic quantification depends on the type of organ and cystic severity, with values 76.84–78.59% and 76.96–89.66% for the kidney and 87.29–93.80% and 63.42–86.07% for the liver. CystAnalyser, in addition, provides a new tool for estimating the number of cysts and a more specific measure of the cystic index than ImageJ. This study proposes CystAnalyser is a new robust and freely downloadable software tool for analyzing the severity of disease by quantifying histological images of cystic organs for routine biomedical research. CystAnalyser can be downloaded from https://citius.usc.es/transferencia/software/cystanalyser (for Windows and Linux) for research purposes upon acceptance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8xJi0w6oKS8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have primarily identified trait-associated loci in the non-coding genome. Colocalization analyses of SNP associations from GWAS with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) evidence enable the generation of hypotheses about responsible mechanism, genes and tissues of origin to guide functional characterization. Here, we present a web-based colocalization browsing and testing tool named &lt;i&gt;LocusFocus&lt;/i&gt; (https://locusfocus.research.sickkids.ca). LocusFocus formally tests colocalization using our established &lt;i&gt;Simple Sum&lt;/i&gt; method to identify the most relevant genes and tissues for a particular GWAS locus in the presence of high linkage disequilibrium and/or allelic heterogeneity. We demonstrate the utility of LocusFocus, following up of a genome-wide significant locus from a GWAS of meconium ileus (an intestinal obstruction in cystic fibrosis). Using LocusFocus for colocalization analysis with eQTL data suggests variation in &lt;i&gt;ATP12A&lt;/i&gt; gene expression in the pancreas rather than intestine is responsible for the GWAS locus. LocusFocus has no operating system dependencies and may be installed in a local web server. LocusFocus is available under the MIT license, with full documentation and source code accessible on GitHub at https://github.com/naim-panjwani/LocusFocus.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Eye2vSkG81Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Aggregating forecasts of multiple respiratory pathogens supports more accurate forecasting of influenza-like illness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008301</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sen Pei, Jeffrey Shaman&lt;/p&gt;

Influenza-like illness (ILI) is a commonly measured syndromic signal representative of a range of acute respiratory infections. Reliable forecasts of ILI can support better preparation for patient surges in healthcare systems. Although ILI is an amalgamation of multiple pathogens with variable seasonal phasing and attack rates, most existing process-based forecasting systems treat ILI as a single infectious agent. Here, using ILI records and virologic surveillance data, we show that ILI signal can be disaggregated into distinct viral components. We generate separate predictions for six contributing pathogens (influenza A/H1, A/H3, B, respiratory syncytial virus, and human parainfluenza virus types 1–2 and 3), and develop a method to forecast ILI by aggregating these predictions. The relative contribution of each pathogen to the total ILI signal is estimated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method upon forecast aggregation. We find highly variable overall contributions from influenza type A viruses across seasons, but relatively stable contributions for the other pathogens. Using historical data from 1997 to 2014 at US national and regional levels, the proposed forecasting system generates improved predictions of both seasonal and near-term targets relative to a baseline method that simulates ILI as a single pathogen. The hierarchical forecasting system can generate predictions for each viral component, as well as infer and predict their contributions to ILI, which may additionally help physicians determine the etiological causes of ILI in clinical settings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q8J4nyLD64g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Misuse of the Michaelis–Menten rate law for protein interaction networks and its remedy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008258</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jae Kyoung Kim, John J. Tyson&lt;/p&gt;

For over a century, the Michaelis–Menten (MM) rate law has been used to describe the rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions and gene expression. Despite the ubiquity of the MM rate law, it accurately captures the dynamics of underlying biochemical reactions only so long as it is applied under the right condition, namely, that the substrate is in large excess over the enzyme-substrate complex. Unfortunately, in circumstances where its validity condition is not satisfied, especially so in protein interaction networks, the MM rate law has frequently been misused. In this review, we illustrate how inappropriate use of the MM rate law distorts the dynamics of the system, provides mistaken estimates of parameter values, and makes false predictions of dynamical features such as ultrasensitivity, bistability, and oscillations. We describe how these problems can be resolved with a slightly modified form of the MM rate law, based on the total quasi-steady state approximation (tQSSA). Furthermore, we show that the tQSSA can be used for accurate stochastic simulations at a lower computational cost than using the full set of mass-action rate laws. This review describes how to use quasi-steady state approximations in the right context, to prevent drawing erroneous conclusions from in silico simulations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/281lorH1h3w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A mathematical model of flagellar gene regulation and construction in &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt;</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Kiersten Utsey, James P. Keener&lt;/p&gt;

Millions of people worldwide develop foodborne illnesses caused by &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterica&lt;/i&gt;) every year. The pathogenesis of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterica&lt;/i&gt; depends on flagella, which are appendages that the bacteria use to move through the environment. Interestingly, populations of genetically identical bacteria exhibit heterogeneity in the number of flagella. To understand this heterogeneity and the regulation of flagella quantity, we propose a mathematical model that connects the flagellar gene regulatory network to flagellar construction. A regulatory network involving more than 60 genes controls flagellar assembly. The most important member of the network is the master operon, &lt;i&gt;flhDC&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes the FlhD&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; protein. FlhD&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; controls the construction of flagella by initiating the production of hook basal bodies (HBBs), protein structures that anchor the flagella to the bacterium. By connecting a model of FlhD&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; regulation to a model of HBB construction, we investigate the roles of various feedback mechanisms. Analysis of our model suggests that a combination of regulatory mechanisms at the protein and transcriptional levels induce bistable FlhD&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels and heterogeneous numbers of flagella. Also, the balance of regulatory mechanisms that become active following HBB construction is sufficient to provide a counting mechanism for controlling the total number of flagella produced.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6_R7z65D27k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) is a method that injects rhythmic currents into the human brain via electrodes attached to the scalp of a participant. This technique allows researchers to control naturally occurring brain rhythms and study their causal relevance for cognition. Recent findings, however, cast doubts on the effectiveness of tACS to stimulate the brain and its mode of action. Two new studies by Vieira and colleagues and Marchesotti and colleagues reported in the current issue report promising new results in showing that tACS can entrain single neuron activity and improve reading abilities in dyslexic individuals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Y3Zc15AwZ9I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Interphase-arrested &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryos activate zygotic gene expression and initiate mid-blastula transition events at a low nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio</title>

Externally deposited eggs begin development with an immense cytoplasm and a single overwhelmed nucleus. Rapid mitotic cycles restore normality as the ratio of nuclei to cytoplasm (N/C) increases. A threshold N/C has been widely proposed to activate zygotic genome transcription and onset of morphogenesis at the mid-blastula transition (MBT). To test whether a threshold N/C is required for these events, we blocked N/C increase by down-regulating cyclin/Cdk1 to arrest early cell cycles in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Embryos that were arrested two cell cycles prior to the normal MBT activated widespread transcription of the zygotic genome including genes previously described as N/C dependent. Zygotic transcription of these genes largely retained features of their regulation in space and time. Furthermore, zygotically regulated post-MBT events such as cellularization and gastrulation movements occurred in these cell cycle–arrested embryos. These results are not compatible with models suggesting that these MBT events are directly coupled to N/C. Cyclin/Cdk1 activity normally declines in tight association with increasing N/C and is regulated by N/C. By experimentally promoting the decrease in cyclin/Cdk1, we uncoupled MBT from N/C increase, arguing that N/C-guided down-regulation of cyclin/Cdk1 is sufficient for genome activation and MBT.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/t1cZHiypaIU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Neural speech restoration at the cocktail party: Auditory cortex recovers masked speech of both attended and ignored speakers</title>

Humans are remarkably skilled at listening to one speaker out of an acoustic mixture of several speech sources. Two speakers are easily segregated, even without binaural cues, but the neural mechanisms underlying this ability are not well understood. One possibility is that early cortical processing performs a spectrotemporal decomposition of the acoustic mixture, allowing the attended speech to be reconstructed via optimally weighted recombinations that discount spectrotemporal regions where sources heavily overlap. Using human magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses to a 2-talker mixture, we show evidence for an alternative possibility, in which early, active segregation occurs even for strongly spectrotemporally overlapping regions. Early (approximately 70-millisecond) responses to nonoverlapping spectrotemporal features are seen for both talkers. When competing talkers’ spectrotemporal features mask each other, the individual representations persist, but they occur with an approximately 20-millisecond delay. This suggests that the auditory cortex recovers acoustic features that are masked in the mixture, even if they occurred in the ignored speech. The existence of such noise-robust cortical representations, of features present in attended as well as ignored speech, suggests an active cortical stream segregation process, which could explain a range of behavioral effects of ignored background speech.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_xRbumM9_-o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Predicting how pathogen populations will change over time is challenging. Such has been the case with &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, an important human pathogen, and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), which target only a fraction of the strains in the population. Here, we use the frequencies of accessory genes to predict changes in the pneumococcal population after vaccination, hypothesizing that these frequencies reflect negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) on the gene products. We find that the standardized predicted fitness of a strain, estimated by an NFDS-based model at the time the vaccine is introduced, enables us to predict whether the strain increases or decreases in prevalence following vaccination. Further, we are able to forecast the equilibrium post-vaccine population composition and assess the invasion capacity of emerging lineages. Overall, we provide a method for predicting the impact of an intervention on pneumococcal populations with potential application to other bacterial pathogens in which NFDS is a driving force.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zARsZmyFJpo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Mathematical ability is heritable and related to several genes expressing proteins in the brain. It is unknown, however, which intermediate neural phenotypes could explain how these genes relate to mathematical ability. Here, we examined genetic effects on cerebral cortical volume of 3–6-year-old children without mathematical training to predict mathematical ability in school at 7–9 years of age. To this end, we followed an exploration sample (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 101) and an independent replication sample (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 77). We found that &lt;i&gt;ROBO1&lt;/i&gt;, a gene known to regulate prenatal growth of cerebral cortical layers, is associated with the volume of the right parietal cortex, a key region for quantity representation. Individual volume differences in this region predicted up to a fifth of the behavioral variance in mathematical ability. Our findings indicate that a fundamental genetic component of the quantity processing system is rooted in the early development of the parietal cortex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tfjadx6RtVw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Gradient of tactile properties in the rat whisker pad</title>

The array of vibrissae on a rat’s face is the first stage in a high-resolution tactile sensing system. Progressing from rostral to caudal in any vibrissae row results in an increase in whisker length and thickness. This may, in turn, provide a systematic map of separate tactile channels governed by the mechanical properties of the whiskers. To examine whether this map is expressed in a location-dependent transformation of tactile signals into whisker vibrations and neuronal responses, we monitored whiskers’ movements across various surfaces and edges. We found a robust rostral-caudal (R-C) gradient of tactile information transmission in which rostral shorter vibrissae displayed a higher sensitivity and bigger differences in response to different textures, whereas longer caudal vibrissae were less sensitive. This gradient is evident in several dynamic properties of vibrissae trajectories. As rodents sample the environment with multiple vibrissae, we found that combining tactile signals from multiple vibrissae resulted in an increased sensitivity and bigger differences in response to the different textures. Nonetheless, we found that texture identity is not represented spatially across the whisker pad. Based on the responses of first-order sensory neurons, we found that they adhere to the tactile information conveyed by the vibrissae. That is, neurons innervating rostral vibrissae were better suited for texture discrimination, whereas neurons innervating caudal vibrissae were more suited for edge detection. These results suggest that the whisker array in rodents forms a sensory structure in which different facets of tactile information are transmitted through location-dependent gradient of vibrissae on the rat’s face.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7-Ktmw8sawE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adolescent alcohol drinking, primarily in the form of binge‐drinking episodes, is a serious public health concern. Binge drinking in laboratory animals has been modeled by a procedure involving chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) administration, as compared with chronic intermittent water (CIW). The prolonged effects of adolescent binge alcohol exposure in adults, such as high risk of developing alcohol use disorder, are severe but available treatments in the clinic are limited. One reason is the lack of sufficient understanding about the associated neuronal alterations. The involvement of the insular cortex, particularly the anterior agranular insula (AAI), has emerged as a critical region to explain neuronal mechanisms of substance abuse. This study was designed to evaluate the functional output of the AAI by measuring the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons from male rats 2 or 21 days after adolescent or adult CIE treatment. Decreases in intrinsic excitability in AAI pyramidal neurons were detected 21 days, relative to 2 days, after adolescent CIE. Interestingly, the decreased intrinsic excitability in the AAI pyramidal neurons was observed 2 days after adult CIE, compared to adult CIW, but no difference was found between 2 versus 21 days after adult CIE. These data indicate that, although the AAI is influenced within a limited period after adult but not adolescent CIE, neuronal alterations in AAI are affected during the prolonged period of withdrawal from adolescent but not adult CIE. This may explain the prolonged vulnerability to mental disorders of subjects with an alcohol binge history during their adolescent stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Sex‐specific role of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in cocaine effects on adult neurogenesis has been studied. Results indicate that: (a) cocaine hyperactivity decreases neurogenesis (males) or neuronal maturity (females), and correlates with brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); (b) cocaine does not increase hyperactivity in D1ko females, but increases neuronal maturity and BDNF; (c) cocaine increases hypoactivity in D2ko males, and increases neurogenesis and BDNF in D2ko females; (d) SCH23390 reduces cocaine hyperactivity, and correlates with BDNF; and (e) Raclopride increases cocaine hyperactivity in females, and neurogenesis and BDNF in both sexes. Sex‐specific D1 and D2 signaling on proliferation and neuronal maturity is differentially perturbed by cocaine, and BDNF may contribute to D2 neuroplasticity in cocaine addiction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult neurogenesis in rodents is modulated by dopaminergic signaling and inhibited by cocaine. However, the sex‐specific role of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors (D1R, D2R) in the deleterious effect of cocaine on adult neurogenesis has not been described yet. Here, we explored sex differences in (a) cell proliferation (5′‐bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine [BrdU]), (b) neural precursor (nestin), (c) neuronal phenotype (BrdU/β3‐tubulin), and (d) neuronal maturity (NeuN) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and striatum of mice with genetic deletion (D1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;, D2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) or pharmacological blockage (SCH23390: 0.1 mg/kg/day/5 days; Raclopride: 0.3 mg/kg/day/5 days) of D1R and D2R, and treated (10 mg/kg/day/5 days) and then challenged (5 mg/kg, 48 hr later) with cocaine. Results indicated that hyperactivity responses to cocaine were absent in D1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice and reduced in SCH23390‐treated mice. Activity responses to cocaine were reduced in D2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; males, but absent in D2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; females and increased in Raclopride‐treated females. D1R deletion blocked the deleterious effect of cocaine on SVZ cell proliferation in males. Cocaine‐exposed D1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; males also had reduced neuronal phenotype of SVZ newborn cells and increased striatal neuronal maturity. D2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice had lower proliferative and neural precursor responses. Cocaine in D2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; females or coadministered with Raclopride in wild‐type females improved SVZ cell proliferation, an effect that positively correlated with plasma brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations. In conclusion, the sex‐specific D1R and D2R signaling on SVZ cell proliferation, neural progenitor and neuronal maturity is differentially perturbed by cocaine, and BDNF may be required to link D2R to neuroplasticity in cocaine addiction in females.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the demonstrated implication of the retina in Parkinson disease (PD) pathology and the importance of dopaminergic cells in this tissue, we aimed to analyze the state of the dopaminergic amacrine cells and some of their main postsynaptic neurons in the retina of PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we evaluated morphology, number, and synaptic connections of dopaminergic cells and their postsynaptic cells, AII amacrine and melanopsin‐containing retinal ganglion cells, in control and PD eyes from human donors.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In PD, dopaminergic amacrine cell number was reduced between 58% and 26% in different retinal regions, involving a decline in the number of synaptic contacts with AII amacrine cells (by 60%) and melanopsin cells (by 35%). Despite losing their main synaptic input, AII cells were not reduced in number, but they showed cellular alterations compromising their adequate function: (1) a loss of mitochondria inside their lobular appendages, which may indicate an energetic failure; and (2) a loss of connexin 36, suggesting alterations in the AII coupling and in visual signal transmission from the rod pathway.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dopaminergic system impairment and the affection of the rod pathway through the AII cells may explain and be partially responsible for the reduced contrast sensitivity or electroretinographic response described in PD. Also, dopamine reduction and the loss of synaptic contacts with melanopsin cells may contribute to the melanopsin retinal ganglion cell loss previously described and to the disturbances in circadian rhythm and sleep reported in PD patients. These data support the idea that the retina reproduces brain neurodegeneration and is highly involved in PD pathology. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:893–906&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sensitivity–Specificity of Tau and Amyloid β Positron Emission Tomography in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine associations between tau and amyloid β (Aβ) molecular positron emission tomography (PET) and both Alzheimer‐related pathology and 4‐repeat tau pathology in autopsy‐confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐four patients had [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]‐flortaucipir–PET and died with FTLD (progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP], n = 10; corticobasal degeneration [CBD], n = 10; FTLD‐TDP, n = 3; and Pick disease, n = 1). All but 1 had Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)‐PET. Braak staging, Aβ plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts, and semiquantitative tau lesion scores were performed. Flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated in a temporal meta region of interest (meta‐ROI), entorhinal cortex and cortical/subcortical regions selected to match the tau lesion analysis. Global PiB SUVR was calculated. Autoradiography was performed in 1 PSP patient, with digital pathology used to quantify tau burden.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine cases (37.5%) had Aβ plaques. Global PiB SUVR correlated with Aβ plaque count, with 100% specificity and 50% sensitivity for diffuse plaques. Twenty‐one (87.5%) had Braak stages I to IV. Flortaucipir correlated with neurofibrillary tangle counts in entorhinal cortex, but entorhinal and meta‐ROI SUVRs were not elevated in Braak IV or primary age‐related tauopathy. Flortaucipir uptake patterns differed across FTLD pathologies and could separate PSP and CBD. Flortaucipir correlated with tau lesion score in red nucleus and midbrain tegmentum across patients, but not in cortical or basal ganglia regions. Autoradiography demonstrated minimal uptake of flortaucipir, although flortaucipir correlated with quantitative tau burden across regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular PET shows expected correlations with Alzheimer‐related pathology but lacks sensitivity to detect mild Alzheimer pathology in FTLD. Regional flortaucipir uptake was able to separate CBD and PSP. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1009–1022&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Functional Connectivity Decreases with Metabolic Stress in Sickle Cell Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25891?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25891?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience cognitive deficits even when unaffected by stroke. Using functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a potential biomarker of cognitive function, we tested our hypothesis that children with SCD would have decreased functional connectivity, and that children experiencing the greatest metabolic stress, indicated by elevated oxygen extraction fraction, would have the lowest connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prospectively obtained brain MRIs and cognitive testing in healthy controls and children with SCD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed data from 60 participants (20 controls and 40 with sickle cell disease). There was no difference in global cognition or cognitive subdomains between cohorts. However, we found decreased functional connectivity within the sensory‐motor, lateral sensory‐motor, auditory, salience, and subcortical networks in participants with SCD compared with controls. Further, as white matter oxygen extraction fraction increased, connectivity within the visual (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008, parameter estimate = −0.760 [95% CI = −1.297, −0.224]), default mode (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012, parameter estimate = −0.417 [95% CI = −0.731, −0.104]), and cingulo‐opercular (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009, parameter estimate = −0.883 [95% CI = −1.517, −0.250]) networks decreased.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that there is diminished functional connectivity within these anatomically contiguous networks in children with SCD compared with controls, even when differences are not seen with cognitive testing. Increased white matter oxygen extraction fraction was associated with decreased connectivity in select networks. These data suggest that elevated oxygen extraction fraction and disrupted functional connectivity are potentially presymptomatic neuroimaging biomarkers for cognitive decline in SCD.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Association of Plasma Neurofilament Light with Postoperative Delirium</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25889?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25889?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the association of the plasma neuroaxonal injury markers neurofilament light (NfL), total tau, glial fibrillary acid protein, and ubiquitin carboxyl‐terminal hydrolase L1 with delirium, delirium severity, and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delirium case–no delirium control (n = 108) pairs were matched by age, sex, surgery type, cognition, and vascular comorbidities. Biomarkers were measured in plasma collected preoperatively (PREOP), and 2 days (POD2) and 30 days postoperatively (PO1MO) using Simoa technology (Quanterix, Lexington, MA). The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and CAM‐S (Severity) were used to measure delirium and delirium severity, respectively. Cognitive function was measured with General Cognitive Performance (GCP) scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delirium cases had higher NfL on POD2 and PO1MO (median matched pair difference = 16.2pg/ml and 13.6pg/ml, respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Patients with PREOP and POD2 NfL in the highest quartile (Q4) had increased risk for incident delirium (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 3.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1–12.6] and 4.6 [95% CI = 1.2–18.2], respectively) and experienced more severe delirium, with sum CAM‐S scores 7.8 points (95% CI = 1.6–14.0) and 9.3 points higher (95% CI = 3.2–15.5). At PO1MO, delirium cases had continued high NfL (adjusted OR = 9.7, 95% CI = 2.3–41.4), and those with Q4 NfL values showed a −2.3 point decline in GCP score (−2.3 points, 95% CI = −4.7 to −0.9).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with the highest PREOP or POD2 NfL levels were more likely to develop delirium. Elevated NfL at PO1MO was associated with delirium and greater cognitive decline. These findings suggest NfL may be useful as a predictive biomarker for delirium risk and long‐term cognitive decline, and once confirmed would provide pathophysiological evidence for neuroaxonal injury following delirium.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Surgical Outcomes Can Be Inferred Based on Structural Connectome Hubs: A Machine Learning Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25888?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25888?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of medication‐resistant focal epilepsy in adults. Despite removal of medial temporal structures, more than one‐third of patients continue to have disabling seizures postoperatively. Seizure refractoriness implies that extramedial regions are capable of influencing the brain network and generating seizures. We tested whether abnormalities of structural network integration could be associated with surgical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presurgical magnetic resonance images from 121 patients with drug‐resistant TLE across 3 independent epilepsy centers were used to train feed‐forward neural network models based on tissue volume or graph‐theory measures from whole‐brain diffusion tensor imaging structural connectomes. An independent dataset of 47 patients with TLE from 3 other epilepsy centers was used to assess the predictive values of each model and regional anatomical contributions toward surgical treatment results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve based on regional betweenness centrality was 0.88, significantly higher than a random model or models based on gray matter volumes, degree, strength, and clustering coefficient. Nodes most strongly contributing to the predictive models involved the bilateral parahippocampal gyri, as well as the superior temporal gyri.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network integration in the medial and lateral temporal regions was related to surgical outcomes. Patients with abnormally integrated structural network nodes were less likely to achieve seizure freedom. These findings are in line with previous observations related to network abnormalities in TLE and expand on the notion of underlying aberrant plasticity. Our findings provide additional information on the mechanisms of surgical refractoriness. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:970–983&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Deep Brain Stimulation for Chronic Cluster Headache: Meta‐Analysis of Individual Patient Data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25887?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25887?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment option for refractory chronic cluster headache (CCH). Despite several recent prospective case series reporting a good outcome, the effectiveness and the optimal stimulation target of DBS for CCH remain unclear. We aimed to obtain precise estimates and predictors of long‐term pain relief in an individual patient data meta‐analysis. Furthermore, we aimed to construct a probabilistic stimulation map of effective DBS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invited investigators of published cohorts of patients undergoing DBS for CCH, identified by a systematic review of MEDLINE from inception to Febuary 15, 2019, to provide individual patient data on baseline covariates, pre‐ and postoperative headache scores at median (12‐month) and long‐term follow‐up, in addition to individual imaging data to obtain individual electrode positions. We calculated a stimulation map using voxel‐wise statistical analysis. We used multiple regression analysis to estimate predictors of pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 40 patients from four different cohorts representing ~50% of all previously published cases, we found a significant 77% mean reduction in headache attack frequency over a mean follow‐up of 44 months, with an overall response rate of 75%. Positive outcome was not associated with baseline covariates. We identified 2 hotspots of stimulation covering the midbrain ventral and retrorubral tegmentum.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study supports the hypothesis that DBS provides long‐term pain relief for the majority of CCH patients. Our stimulation map of the region of influence of therapeutic DBS identified an optimal anatomical target site that can help surgeons to guide their surgical planning in the future.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Implantable Cardiac Monitoring in the Secondary Prevention of Cryptogenic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25886?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25886?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we sought to evaluate the impact of implantable cardiac monitoring (ICM) in the prevention of stroke recurrence after a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluated consecutive patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA admitted in a comprehensive stroke center during an 8‐year period. We compared the baseline characteristics and outcomes between patients receiving conventional cardiac monitoring with repeated 24‐hour Holter‐monitoring during the first 5 years in the outpatient setting and those receiving continuous cardiac monitoring with ICM during the last 3 years. Associations on the outcomes of interest were further assessed in multivariable regression models adjusting for potential confounders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a total of 373 patients receiving conventional cardiac monitoring and 123 patients receiving ICM. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) detection was higher in the ICM cohort compared to the conventional cardiac monitoring cohort (21.1% vs 7.5%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). ICM was independently associated with an increased likelihood of PAF detection during follow‐up (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16–3.24) in multivariable analyses. Patients receiving ICM were also found to have significantly higher rates of anticoagulation initiation (18.7% vs 6.4%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and lower risk of stroke recurrence (4.1% vs 11.8%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013). ICM was independently associated with a lower risk of stroke recurrence during follow‐up (HR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.11–0.90) in multivariable analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICM appears to be independently associated with a higher likelihood of PAF detection and anticoagulation initiation after a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA. ICM was also independently related to lower risk of stroke recurrence in our cryptogenic stroke / TIA cohort. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:946–955&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Plasma NT1 Tau is a Specific and Early Marker of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25885?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25885?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an urgent need for sensitive, widely available, blood‐based screening tests to identify presymptomatic individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated whether tau detected in plasma by our in‐house NT1 assay is specifically altered in AD, and when applied to patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can serve to predict progression to AD dementia. The predictive value of NT1 versus tau measured using assays from Quanterix and Roche, and the specificity of NT1 for AD versus a nonspecific marker of neurodegeneration (neurofilament light [NfL]) were also examined.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NT1 tau and NfL were measured in plasma from prospectively followed patients with SCD or MCI who remained cognitively stable, converted to AD dementia, or converted to non‐AD dementias, and in cognitively unimpaired participants. Tau was measured using Quanterix and Roche assays in baseline subjects with SCD and MCI.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasma NT1 tau was specifically elevated in AD, but not in non‐AD dementia compared with controls, whereas NfL was increased in both AD and non‐AD dementias. Baseline specimens from individuals who had SCD or MCI revealed that NT1 tau, but not tau measured using Quanterix or Roche assays, is elevated in subjects who progress to AD dementia. As expected, baseline plasma NfL is elevated in those who progress to AD and non‐AD dementias.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasma NT1 tau is a specific marker of AD, which is elevated early in disease and may prove useful as a first round screen to identify individuals at risk of developing AD. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:878–892&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sleep Disruption in Epilepsy: Ictal and Interictal Epileptic Activity Matter</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25884?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25884?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disturbed sleep is common in epilepsy. The direct influence of nocturnal epileptic activity on sleep fragmentation remains poorly understood. Stereo‐electroencephalography paired with polysomnography is the ideal tool to study this relationship. We investigated whether sleep‐related epileptic activity is associated with sleep disruption.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visually marked sleep stages, arousals, seizures, and epileptic bursts in 36 patients with focal drug‐resistant epilepsy who underwent combined stereo‐electroencephalography/polysomnography during presurgical evaluation. Epileptic spikes were detected automatically. Spike and burst indices (n/sec/channel) were computed across four 3‐second time windows (baseline sleep, pre‐arousal, arousal, and post‐arousal). Sleep stage and anatomic localization were tested as modulating factors. We assessed the intra‐arousal dynamics of spikes and their relationship with the slow wave component of non‐rapid eye‐movement sleep (NR) arousals.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of sleep‐related seizures (82.4%; 76.5% asymptomatic) were followed by awakenings or arousals. The epileptic burst index increased significantly before arousals as compared to baseline and postarousal, irrespective of sleep stage or brain area. A similar pre‐arousal increase was observed for the spike index in NR stage 2 and rapid eye‐movement sleep. In addition, the spike index increased during the arousal itself in neocortical channels, and was strongly correlated with the slow wave component of NR arousals (r = 0.99, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep fragmentation in focal drug‐resistant epilepsy is associated with ictal and interictal epileptic activity. The increase in interictal epileptic activity before arousals suggests its participation in sleep disruption. An additional increase in the spike rate during arousals may result from a sleep–wake boundary instability, suggesting a bidirectional relationship. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:907–920&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Promotes Gait Training in Parkinson Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25881?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25881?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether priming with 1 or 25Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) will enhance the benefits from treadmill training up to 3 months postintervention in people with Parkinson disease (PD), and to evaluate the underlying changes in cortical excitability.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This randomized double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial was conducted between October 2016 and December 2018. Fifty‐one participants with PD were randomized to receive 12 sessions of rTMS (25Hz, 1Hz, or sham) followed by treadmill training. All participants were assessed at baseline and 1 day, 1 month, and 3 months postintervention. Primary outcome was fastest walking speed, and secondary outcomes were timed up‐and‐go test (TUG), dual‐task TUG (DT‐TUG), motor section of the Movement Disorder Society–Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS‐UPDRS‐III), and electrophysiological evaluation of cortical excitability by TMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1 and 25Hz rTMS groups produced a greater improvement in fastest walking speed at 1 day and 3 months postintervention than the sham group. Only the 1 and 25Hz rTMS groups sustained the improvements in TUG, and had a significant improvement in DT‐TUG and MDS‐UPDRS‐III for up to 3 months. Behavioral improvements correlated with increased cortical silent period and short‐interval intracortical inhibition in both groups receiving real rTMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priming with 1 and 25Hz rTMS can augment the benefits of treadmill training and lead to long‐term motor improvement up to 3 months postintervention. The motor improvement at follow‐up was associated with a normalization of cortical excitability, which in turn suggests an alteration of the homeostatic plasticity range. Rebalancing cortical excitability by rTMS appears critical for plasticity induction. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:933–945&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Long‐term exposure to lipid‐lowering drugs might affect Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses where genetic variants indexed expected effects of modulating lipid‐lowering drug targets on PD. Statin exposure was not predicted to increase PD risk, although results were not precise enough to support benefits for prevention clearly (odds ratio [OR] = 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.65, 1.07). Other target results were null, except for variants indicating Apolipoprotein‐A5 or Apolipoprotein‐C3 inhibition might confer protection. These findings suggest peripheral lipid variation may not have a prominent role in PD etiology, but some related drug targets could influence PD via alternate pathways.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Loss‐of‐Function Variants in HOPS Complex Genes VPS16 and VPS41 Cause Early Onset Dystonia Associated with Lysosomal Abnormalities</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25879?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25879?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of people with suspected genetic dystonia remain undiagnosed after maximal investigation, implying that a number of causative genes have not yet been recognized. We aimed to investigate this paucity of diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We undertook weighted burden analysis of whole‐exome sequencing (WES) data from 138 individuals with unresolved generalized dystonia of suspected genetic etiology, followed by additional case‐finding from international databases, first for the gene implicated by the burden analysis (&lt;i&gt;VPS16&lt;/i&gt;), and then for other functionally related genes. Electron microscopy was performed on patient‐derived cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis revealed a significant burden for &lt;i&gt;VPS16&lt;/i&gt; (Fisher's exact test &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; value, 6.9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;). &lt;i&gt;VPS16&lt;/i&gt; encodes a subunit of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex, which plays a key role in autophagosome‐lysosome fusion. A total of 18 individuals harboring heterozygous loss‐of‐function &lt;i&gt;VPS16&lt;/i&gt; variants, and one with a microdeletion, were identified. These individuals experienced early onset progressive dystonia with predominant cervical, bulbar, orofacial, and upper limb involvement. Some patients had a more complex phenotype with additional neuropsychiatric and/or developmental comorbidities. We also identified biallelic loss‐of‐function variants in &lt;i&gt;VPS41&lt;/i&gt;, another HOPS‐complex encoding gene, in an individual with infantile‐onset generalized dystonia. Electron microscopy of patient‐derived lymphocytes and fibroblasts from both patients with &lt;i&gt;VPS16&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;VPS41&lt;/i&gt; showed vacuolar abnormalities suggestive of impaired lysosomal function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study strongly supports a role for HOPS complex dysfunction in the pathogenesis of dystonia, although variants in different subunits display different phenotypic and inheritance characteristics. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:867–877&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sex Mediates Relationships Between Regional Tau Pathology and Cognitive Decline</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25878?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25878?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this study was to examine sex differences in tau distribution across the brain of older adults, using positron emission tomography (PET), and investigate how these differences might associate with cognitive trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were 343 clinically normal individuals (women, 58%; 73.8 [8.5] years) and 55 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; women, 38%; 76.9 [7.3] years) from the Harvard Aging Brain Study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We examined &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐Flortaucipir (FTP)‐positron emission tomography (PET) signal across 41 cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROIs). Linear regression models estimated the effect of sex on FTP‐signal for each ROI after adjusting for age and cohort. We also examined interactions between sex*Aβ‐PET positive / negative (+ / −) and sex*apolipoprotein ε4 (APOEε4) status. Linear mixed models estimated the moderating effect of sex on the relationship between a composite of sex‐differentiated tau ROIs and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women showed significantly higher FTP‐signals than men across multiple regions of the cortical mantle (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.007). β‐amyloid (Aβ)‐moderated sex differences in tau signal were localized to medial and inferio‐lateral temporal regions (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.007); Aβ + women exhibited greater FTP‐signal than other groups. APOEε4‐moderated sex differences in FTP‐signal were only found in the lateral occipital lobe. Women with higher FTP‐signals in composite ROI exhibited faster cognitive decline than men (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tau vulnerability in women is not just limited to the medial temporal lobe and significantly contributed to greater risk of faster cognitive decline. Interactive effects of sex and Aβ were predominantly localized in the temporal lobe, however, sex differences in extra‐temporal tau highlights the possibility of accelerated tau proliferation in women with the onset of clinical symptomatology.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Paramagnetic Rim Lesions are Specific to Multiple Sclerosis: An International Multicenter 3T MRI Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25877?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In multiple sclerosis (MS), a subset of chronic active white matter lesions are identifiable on magnetic resonance imaging by their paramagnetic rims, and increasing evidence supports their association with severity of clinical disease. We studied their potential role in differential diagnosis, screening an international multicenter clinical research‐based sample of 438 individuals affected by different neurological conditions (MS, other inflammatory, infectious, and non‐inflammatory conditions). Paramagnetic rim lesions, rare in other neurological conditions (52% of MS vs 7% of non‐MS cases), yielded high specificity (93%) in differentiating MS from non‐MS. Future prospective multicenter studies should validate their role as a diagnostic biomarker. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1034–1042&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;PPP2R5D‐&lt;/i&gt;related neurodevelopmental disorder is characterized by a range of neurodevelopmental and behavioral manifestations. We report the association of early‐onset parkinsonism with the &lt;i&gt;PPP2R5D&lt;/i&gt; p.E200K mutation. Clinical characterization and exome sequencing were performed on three patients, with postmortem neuropathologic examination for one patient. All patients had mild developmental delay and developed levodopa‐responsive parkinsonism between the ages of 25 and 40 years. The &lt;i&gt;PPP2R5D&lt;/i&gt; c.598G&amp;gt;A (p.E200K) mutation was identified in all patients&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Neuropathologic examination demonstrated uneven, focally severe neuronal loss and gliosis in the substantia nigra pars compacta, without Lewy bodies. Our findings suggest the &lt;i&gt;PPP2R5D&lt;/i&gt; p.E200K mutation to be a possible new cause of early‐onset parkinsonism. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1028–1033&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: High-Resolution Transcriptomic and Proteomic Profiling of Heterogeneity of Brain-Derived Microglia in Multiple Sclerosis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are important for central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and first to respond to tissue damage and perturbations. Microglia are heterogeneous cells; in case of pathology, microglia adopt a range of phenotypes with altered functions. However, how these different microglia subtypes are implicated in CNS disease is largely unresolved. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the CNS, characterized by inflammation and axonal degeneration, ultimately leading to neurological decline. One way microglia are implicated in MS is through stimulation of remyelination. They facilitate efficient remyelination by phagocytosis of myelin debris. In addition, microglia recruit oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to demyelinated areas and stimulate remyelination. The development of high-resolution technologies to profile individual cells has greatly contributed to our understanding of microglia heterogeneity and function under normal and pathological conditions. Gene expression profiling technologies have evolved from whole tissue RNA sequencing toward single-cell or nucleus sequencing. Single microglia proteomic profiles are also increasingly generated, offering another layer of high-resolution data. Here, we will review recent studies that have employed these technologies in the context of MS and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, recent developments that allow for (single) cell profiling while retaining spatial information and tissue context will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Isolation and Characterization of Multi-Protein Complexes Enriched in the K-Cl Co-transporter 2 From Brain Plasma Membranes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Kcc2 plays a critical role in determining the efficacy of synaptic inhibition, however, the cellular mechanisms neurons use to regulate its membrane trafficking, stability and activity are ill-defined. To address these issues, we used affinity purification to isolate stable multi-protein complexes of K-Cl Co-transporter 2 (Kcc2) from the plasma membrane of murine forebrain. We resolved these using blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) coupled to LC-MS/MS and label-free quantification. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD021368. Purified Kcc2 migrated as distinct molecular species of 300, 600, and 800 kDa following BN-PAGE. In excess of 90% coverage of the soluble N- and C-termini of Kcc2 was obtained. In total we identified 246 proteins significantly associated with Kcc2. The 300 kDa species largely contained Kcc2, which is consistent with a dimeric quaternary structure for this transporter. The 600 and 800 kDa species represented stable multi-protein complexes of Kcc2. We identified a set of novel structural, ion transporting, immune related and signaling protein interactors, that are present at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, consistent with the proposed localization of Kcc2. These included spectrins, C1qa/b/c and the IP3 receptor. We also identified interactors more directly associated with phosphorylation; Akap5, Akap13, and Lmtk3. Finally, we used LC-MS/MS on the same purified endogenous plasma membrane Kcc2 to detect phosphorylation sites. We detected 11 sites with high confidence, including known and novel sites. Collectively our experiments demonstrate that Kcc2 is associated with components of the neuronal cytoskeleton and signaling molecules that may act to regulate transporter membrane trafficking, stability, and activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Object Recognition Memory: Distinct Yet Complementary Roles of the Mouse CA1 and Perirhinal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.527543</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.527543</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;While the essential contribution of the hippocampus to spatial memory is well established, object recognition memory has been traditionally attributed to the perirhinal cortex (PRh). However, the results of several studies indicate that under specific procedural conditions, temporary or permanent lesions of the hippocampus affect object memory processes as measured in the Spontaneous Object Recognition (SOR) task. The PRh and hippocampus are considered to contribute distinctly to object recognition memory based on memory strength. Allowing mice more, or less, exploration of novel objects during the encoding phase of the task (i.e., sample session), yields stronger, or weaker, object memory, respectively. The current studies employed temporary local inactivation and immunohistochemistry to determine the differential contributions of neuronal activity in PRh and the CA1 region of the hippocampus to strong and weak object memory. Temporary inactivation of the CA1 immediately after the SOR sample session impaired strong object memory but spared weak object memory; while temporary inactivation of PRh post-sample impaired weak object memory but spared strong object memory. Furthermore, mRNA transcription and de novo protein synthesis are required for the consolidation of episodic memory, and activation patterns of immediate early genes (IEGs), such as c-Fos and Arc, are linked to behaviorally triggered neuronal activation and synaptic plasticity. Analyses of c-Fos and Arc protein expression in PRh and CA1 neurons by immunohistochemistry, and of Arc mRNA by qPCR after distinct stages of SOR, provide additional support that strong object memory is dependent on CA1 neuronal activity, while weak object memory is dependent on PRh neuronal activity. Taken together, the results support the view that both PRh and CA1 are required for object memory under distinct conditions. Specifically, our results are consistent with a model that as the mouse begins to explore a novel object, information about it accumulates within PRh, and a weak memory of the object is encoded. If object exploration continues beyond some threshold, strong memory for the event of object exploration is encoded; the consolidation of which is CA1-dependent. These data serve to reconcile the dissension in the literature by demonstrating functional and complementary roles for CA1 and PRh neurons in rodent object memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Spooky Interaction at a Distance in Cave and Surface Dwelling Electric Fishes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.561524</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glass knifefish (Eigenmannia) are a group of weakly electric fishes found throughout the Amazon basin. Their electric organ discharges (EODs) are energetically costly adaptations used in social communication and for localizing conspecifics and other objects including prey at night and in turbid water. Interestingly, a troglobitic population of blind cavefish Eigenmannia vicentespelea survives in complete darkness in a cave system in central Brazil. We examined the effects of troglobitic conditions, which includes a complete loss of visual cues and potentially reduced food sources, by comparing the behavior and movement of freely behaving cavefish to a nearby epigean (surface) population (Eigenmannia trilineata). We found that the strengths of electric discharges in cavefish were greater than in surface fish, which may result from increased reliance on electrosensory perception, larger size, and sufficient food resources. Surface fish were recorded while feeding at night and did not show evidence of territoriality, whereas cavefish appeared to maintain territories. Surprisingly, we routinely found both surface and cavefish with sustained differences in EOD frequencies that were below 10 Hz despite being within close proximity of about 50 cm. A half century of analysis of electrosocial interactions in laboratory tanks suggest that these small differences in EOD frequencies should have triggered the “jamming avoidance response,” a behavior in which fish change their EOD frequencies to increase the difference between individuals. Pairs of fish also showed significant interactions between EOD frequencies and relative movements at large distances, over 1.5 m, and at high differences in frequencies, often &amp;gt;50 Hz. These interactions are likely “envelope” responses in which fish alter their EOD frequency in relation to higher order features, specifically changes in the depth of modulation, of electrosocial signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: The Effects of Anesthesia on Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.588356</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In animal studies, prolonged sedation with general anesthetics has resulted in cognitive impairments that can last for days to weeks after exposure. One mechanism by which anesthesia may impair cognition is by decreasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Several studies have seen a reduction in cell survival after anesthesia in rodents with most studies focusing on two particularly vulnerable age windows: the neonatal period and old age. However, the extent to which sedation affects neurogenesis in young adults remains unclear. Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) was analyzed in male and female rats 24 h after a 4-h period of sedation with isoflurane, propofol, midazolam, or dexmedetomidine. Three different cell populations were quantified: cells that were 1 week or 1 month old, labeled with the permanent birthdate markers EdU or BrdU, respectively, and precursor cells, identified by their expression of the endogenous dividing cell marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at the time of sacrifice. Midazolam and dexmedetomidine reduced cell proliferation in the adult DG in both sexes but had no effect on postmitotic cells. Propofol reduced the number of relatively mature, 28-day old, neurons specifically in female rats and had no effects on younger cells. Isoflurane had no detectable effects on any of the cell populations examined. These findings show no general effect of sedation on adult-born neurons but demonstrate that certain sedatives do have drug-specific and sex-specific effects. The impacts observed on different cell populations predict that any cognitive effects of these sedatives would likely occur at different times, with propofol producing a rapid but short-lived impairment and midazolam and dexmedetomidine altering cognition after a several week delay. Taken together, these studies lend support to the hypothesis that decreased neurogenesis in the young adult DG may mediate the effects of sedation on cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A Cross-Session Dataset for Collaborative Brain-Computer Interfaces Based on Rapid Serial Visual Presentation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) have been widely used to categorize target and non-target images. However, it is still a challenge to detect single-trial event related potentials (ERPs) from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Besides, the variability of EEG signal over time may cause difficulties of calibration in long-term system use. Recently, collaborative BCIs have been proposed to improve the overall BCI performance by fusing brain activities acquired from multiple subjects. For both individual and collaborative BCIs, feature extraction and classification algorithms that can be transferred across sessions can significantly facilitate system calibration. Although open datasets are highly efficient for developing algorithms, currently there is still a lack of datasets for a collaborative RSVP-based BCI. This paper presents a cross-session EEG dataset of a collaborative RSVP-based BCI system from 14 subjects, who were divided into seven groups. In collaborative BCI experiments, two subjects did the same target image detection tasks synchronously. All subjects participated in the same experiment twice with an average interval of ∼23 days. The results in data evaluation indicate that adequate signal processing algorithms can greatly enhance the cross-session BCI performance in both individual and collaborative conditions. Besides, compared with individual BCIs, the collaborative methods that fuse information from multiple subjects obtain significantly improved BCI performance. This dataset can be used for developing more efficient algorithms to enhance performance and practicality of a collaborative RSVP-based BCI system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Differential Diagnosis of Frontotemporal Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, and Normal Aging Using a Multi-Scale Multi-Type Feature Generative Adversarial Deep Neural Network on Structural Magnetic Resonance Images</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00853</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Methods: Alzheimer's disease and Frontotemporal dementia are the first and third most common forms of dementia. Due to their similar clinical symptoms, they are easily misdiagnosed as each other even with sophisticated clinical guidelines. For disease-specific intervention and treatment, it is essential to develop a computer-aided system to improve the accuracy of their differential diagnosis. Recent advances in deep learning have delivered some of the best performance for medical image recognition tasks. However, its application to the differential diagnosis of AD and FTD pathology has not been explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approach: In this study, we proposed a novel deep learning based framework to distinguish between brain images of normal aging individuals and subjects with AD and FTD. Specifically, we combined the multi-scale and multi-type MRI-base image features with Generative Adversarial Network data augmentation technique to improve the differential diagnosis accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Each of the multi-scale, multitype, and data augmentation methods improved the ability for differential diagnosis for both AD and FTD. A 10-fold cross validation experiment performed on a large sample of 1,954 images using the proposed framework achieved a high overall accuracy of 88.28%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The salient contributions of this study are three-fold: (1) our experiments demonstrate that the combination of multiple structural features extracted at different scales with our proposed deep neural network yields superior performance than individual features; (2) we show that the use of Generative Adversarial Network for data augmentation could further improve the discriminant ability of the network regarding challenging tasks such as differentiating dementia sub-types; (3) and finally, we show that ensemble classifier strategy could make the network more robust and stable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Do Individuals With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder Share Similar Neural Mechanisms of Decision-Making Under Ambiguous Circumstances?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.585086</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.585086</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Impaired decision-making is well documented in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and a range of electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging measures have begun to reveal the pathological mechanisms that underlie the decision-making process. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) has core symptoms that often overlap with OCD, but similarities between these disorders at the behavioral and neurological levels are often unclear, including whether OCPD exhibits similar decision-making deficits and shared neurological dysfunction. To address these issues, we examined 24 cases of OCD, 19 cases of OCPD, and 26 matched normal control (NC) subjects during the revised Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) using event-related potentials (ERPs). The net IGT scores were lower for OCD subjects than for OCPD or NC subjects, thus indicating that OCD subjects chose more disadvantageous options and were “short-sighted” with regards to information. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) waveform (lose-win) was larger in both OCD and OCPD subjects, which suggested that obstacles exist in the feedback process. Consequently, these subjects might share similar neural mechanisms under ambiguous decision-making circumstances. Furthermore, IGT net scores were significantly and negatively correlated with Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scales. This implies that more severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms inspired more negative emotions that led to worse decision-making ability. Therefore, although similar neural mechanisms might exist, this led to different behaviors in which OCPD is associated with better behavioral performance compared to OCD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: High Phase Synchronization in Alpha Band Activity in Older Subjects With High Creativity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.583049</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.583049</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite growing evidence that high creativity leads to mental well-being in older individuals, the neurophysiological bases of creativity remain elusive. Creativity reportedly involves multiple brain areas and their functional interconnections. In particular, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to investigate the role of patterns of functional connectivity between the default network and other networks in creative activity. These interactions among networks play the role of integrating various neural processes to support creative activity and involve attention, cognitive control, and memory. The electroencephalogram (EEG) enables researchers to capture a pattern of band-specific functional connectivity, as well as moment-to-moment dynamics of brain activity; this can be accomplished even in the resting-state by exploiting the excellent temporal resolution of the EEG. Furthermore, the recent advent of functional connectivity analysis in EEG studies has focused on the phase-difference variable because of its fine spatio-temporal resolution. Therefore, we hypothesized that the combining method of EEG signals having high-temporal resolution and the phase synchronization analysis having high-spatio-temporal resolutions brings a new insight of functional connectivity regarding high creative activity of older participants. In this study, we examined the resting-state EEG signal in 20 healthy older participants and estimated functional connectivities using the phase lag index (PLI), which evaluates the phase synchronization of EEG signals. Individual creativity was assessed using the S-A creativity test in a separate session before the EEG recording. In the analysis of associations of EEG measures with the S-A test scores, the covariate effect of the intelligence quotient was evaluated. As a result, higher individual S-A scores were significantly associated with higher node degrees, defined as the average PLI of a node (electrode) across all links with the remaining nodes, across all nodes at the alpha band. A conventional power spectrum analysis revealed no significant association with S-A scores in any frequency band. Older participants with high creativity exhibited high functional connectivity even in the resting-state, irrespective of intelligence quotient, which supports the theory that creativity entails widespread brain connectivity. Thus, PLIs derived from EEG data may provide new insights into the relationship between functional connectivity and creativity in healthy older people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Shared Neural Substrates Underlying Reading and Visual Matching: A Longitudinal Investigation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The role of visual skills in reading acquisition has long been debated and whether there is shared neurobiological basis between visual skills and reading is not clear. This study investigated the relationship between Visual Matching and reading and their shared neuroanatomical basis. Two hundred and ninety-three typically developing Mandarin-speaking children were followed in a longitudinal study from ages 4 to 11 years old. A subsample of 79 children was further followed up at 14 years old when the MRI data were collected. Results showed that the development of Visual Matching from ages 6 to 8 predicted reading accuracy at age 11. In addition, both the development of Visual Matching and reading accuracy were associated with cortical surface area of a cluster located in fusiform gyrus. These findings suggested that the mapping from visual codes to phonological codes is important in learning to read and that left fusiform gyrus provided neural basis for such mapping. Implications of these findings in light of a new approach toward the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying reading development are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the recent progress in AI powered by deep learning in solving narrow tasks, we are not close to human intelligence in its flexibility, versatility, and efficiency. Efficient learning and effective generalization come from inductive biases, and building Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is an exercise in finding the right set of inductive biases that make fast learning possible while being general enough to be widely applicable in tasks that humans excel at. To make progress in AGI, we argue that we can look at the human brain for such inductive biases and principles of generalization. To that effect, we propose a strategy to gain insights from the brain by simultaneously looking at the world it acts upon and the computational framework to support efficient learning and generalization. We present a neuroscience-inspired generative model of vision as a case study for such approach and discuss some open problems about the path to AGI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Hydrogen Sulfide Protects Against Ammonia-Induced Neurotoxicity Through Activation of Nrf2/ARE Signaling in Astrocytic Model of Hepatic Encephalopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.573422</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.573422</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) characterized by neuropsychiatric abnormalities is a major complication of cirrhosis with high mortality. However, the pathogenesis of HE has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to determine endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) in the blood of HE patients and investigate the role of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in an astrocytic model of HE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Patients with and without HE were recruited to determine plasma H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S levels and blood microbial 16S rRNA gene. Rat astrocytes were employed as a model of HE by treatment of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl. Exogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S was preadded. Cell viability was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and cell death was evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Apoptosis was determined by Hoechst 33342/Propidium Iodide (PI) Double Staining and Western blot analysis of apoptosis-related protein expression. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were assessed by flow cytometer. Expressions of Nrf2 and its downstream regulated genes were examined by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot, respectively. Nrf2 gene knockdown was performed by antisense shRNA of Nrf2 gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: There was a significant decrease in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S levels in cirrhotic patients with HE compared with without HE. Blood microbiota analyses revealed that certain strains associated with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S production were negatively correlated with HE. In vitro, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S markedly attenuated NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl-induced cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. This effect was mediated by Nrf2/ARE signaling, and knockdown of Nrf2 expression abolished the antagonistic effect of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S on NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl-induced neurotoxicity in astrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Levels of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and bacteria associated with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S production are decreased in HE, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S functions as the neuroprotector against NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl-induced HE by activating Nrf2/ARE signaling of astrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.600172</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a common and severe neurological disorder and is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity. ICH is associated with old age and underlying conditions such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with neurological symptoms and complications including ICH. For instance, the mechanisms by which COVID-19 may contribute to hemorrhagic stroke may include both depletion of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and overactive immune response. In this study, we herein report three patients (0.25%) out of 1200 admissions with COVID-19 to our center between 1 May and August 4, 2020, who developed ICH. In addition, we will briefly discuss the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of COVID-19 infection in patients with ICH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Graph Theory Analysis Reveals Resting-State Compensatory Mechanisms in Healthy Aging and Prodromal Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.576627</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.576627</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Several theories of cognitive compensation have been suggested to explain sustained cognitive abilities in healthy brain aging and early neurodegenerative processes. The growing number of studies investigating various aspects of task-based compensation in these conditions is contrasted by the shortage of data about resting-state compensatory mechanisms. Using our proposed criterion-based framework for compensation, we investigated 45 participants in three groups: (i) patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and positive biomarkers indicative of Alzheimer’s disease (AD); (ii) cognitively normal young adults; (iii) cognitively normal older adults. To increase reliability, three sessions of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging for each participant were performed on different days (135 scans in total). To elucidate the dimensions and dynamics of resting-state compensatory mechanisms, we used graph theory analysis along with volumetric analysis. Graph theory analysis was applied based on the Brainnetome atlas, which provides a connectivity-based parcellation framework. Comprehensive neuropsychological examinations including the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and the Trail Making Test (TMT) were performed, to relate graph measures of compensatory nodes to cognition. To avoid false-positive findings, results were corrected for multiple comparisons. First, we observed an increase of degree centrality in cognition related brain regions of the middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus and superior parietal lobe despite local atrophy in MCI and healthy aging, indicating a resting-state connectivity increase with positive biomarkers. When relating the degree centrality measures to cognitive performance, we observed that greater connectivity led to better RAVLT and TMT scores in MCI and, hence, might constitute a compensatory mechanism. The detection and improved understanding of the compensatory dynamics in healthy aging and prodromal AD is mandatory for implementing and tailoring preventive interventions aiming at preserved overall cognitive functioning and delayed clinical onset of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Association Between Psoriasis and Dementia: Current Evidence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.570992</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.570992</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Psoriasis and dementia are both inflammatory diseases. The association between psoriasis and dementia has rarely been investigated, and the existing results are conflicting. Thus, we conducted this study to evaluate whether an association exists between psoriasis and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We searched for studies from six databases from inception to July 30, 2020, using subject and free words. RevMan 5.4 was used to calculate the risk ratio (RR) of dementia in the subjects with psoriasis. When heterogeneity was present, a random-effects model was used. Subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression analyses were performed using Stata 15.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Nine studies were identified and included in the study, of which seven that involved a total of 3,638,487 participants were included in the meta-analysis. We found that among the patients with psoriasis (RR: 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06–1.24, p = 0.0009) and psoriatic arthritis (RR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.29–3.78, p = 0.004), the proportions of those with non-vascular dementia (RR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.11–1.15, p &amp;lt; 0.00001) and vascular dementia (RR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.09–1.82, p = 0.009) were higher than that among the patients without psoriasis. Those with dementia were also more likely to develop psoriasis, and those with severe psoriasis were less likely to die from dementia (RR: 1.88, 95% CI: 0.72–4.90, p = 0.020). The meta-regression analysis did not show any significant sources of heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis show high prevalence of different types of dementia. Based on the findings of this study, dementia may not be considered a high-risk factor of death from severe psoriasis. However, identification of this potential risk allows for early intervention, thereby reducing comorbidities and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Metabolomic and Lipidomic Profiling of Preoperative CSF in Elderly Hip Fracture Patients With Postoperative Delirium</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;To investigate dysregulated molecules in preoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of elderly hip fracture patients with postoperative delirium (POD), in order to identify potential pathological mechanisms and biomarkers for pre-stage POD.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;This nested case control study used untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic analysis to profile the preoperative CSF of patients (n = 40) who developed POD undergone hip fracture surgery (n = 10) and those who did not (n = 30). Thirty Non-POD patients were matched to 10 POD patients by age (± 2 years) and Mini Mental State Examination score (± 2 points). CSF was collected after successful spinal anesthesia and banked for subsequent analysis. On the first two postoperative days, patients were assessed twice daily using the Confusion Assessment Method-Chinese Revision. CSF samples from the two groups were analyzed to investigate possible relevant pathological mechanisms and identify candidate biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Demographic characteristics of the groups were matched. Eighteen metabolites and thirty-three lipids were dysregulated in the preoperative CSF of POD patients. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed perturbations in D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism; glycerophospholipid metabolism; alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism; sphingolipid metabolism; histidine metabolism; and arginine biosynthesis at the pre-delirium stage. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE, 40:7e), with an area under the curve value of 0.92, is a potential biomarker for POD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Multiple pathological mechanisms in the POD group were involved before surgery, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and energy metabolism disorders induced by hypoxia, as well as neurotransmitter imbalances such as increased dopamine and glutamate, and decreased glutamine. These metabolic abnormalities potentially increase the fragility of the brain, thus contributing to POD. PE (40:7e) might be a potential biomarker for POD. Not only do our results provide potential biomarkers for POD, but also provide information for deep pathological research.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier ChiCTR1900021533.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social cognition, in particular mindreading, enables the understanding of another individual’s feelings, intentions, desires, and mental states. The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) captures the ability to identify mental states from gaze. We investigated RMET accuracy in the context of age and cognition across the whole adult age-range (19–79 years) in a very large population-based sample (N = 1,603) with linear regression models accounting for cognitive abilities, neurological diseases, and psychiatric disorders. Higher age predicted lower RMET performance in women and men, suggesting difficulties to infer mental states from gaze at older age. Effects remained stable when taking other cognitive abilities and psychiatric disorders or neurological diseases into account. Our results show that RMET performance as a measure of social cognition declines with increasing age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For many species, vision is one of the most important sensory modalities for mediating essential tasks that include navigation, predation and foraging, predator avoidance, and numerous social behaviors. The vertebrate visual process begins when photons of the light interact with rod and cone photoreceptors that are present in the neural retina. Vertebrate visual photopigments are housed within these photoreceptor cells and are sensitive to a wide range of wavelengths that peak within the light spectrum, the latter of which is a function of the type of chromophore used and how it interacts with specific amino acid residues found within the opsin protein sequence. Minor differences in the amino acid sequences of the opsins are known to lead to large differences in the spectral peak of absorbance (i.e. the λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; value). In our prior studies, we developed a new approach that combined homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations to gather structural information associated with chromophore conformation, then used it to generate statistical models for the accurate prediction of λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; values for photopigments derived from Rh1 and Rh2 amino acid sequences. In the present study, we test our novel approach to predict the λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of phylogenetically distant Sws2 cone opsins. To build a model that can predict the λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; using our approach presented in our prior studies, we selected a spectrally-diverse set of 11 teleost Sws2 photopigments for which both amino acid sequence information and experimentally measured λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; values are known. The final first-order regression model, consisting of three terms associated with chromophore conformation, was sufficient to predict the λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of Sws2 photopigments with high accuracy. This study further highlights the breadth of our approach in reliably predicting λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; values of Sws2 cone photopigments, evolutionary-more distant from template bovine RH1, and provided mechanistic insights into the role of known spectral tuning sites.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ejyzi54XZog&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Distribution of the cholinergic nuclei in the brain of the weakly electric fish, Apteronotus leptorhynchus: implications for sensory processing&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a3f9990c-cfd6-4bba-8485-82d7d379a39f/cne25058-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being widespread across different brain systems, the neuromodulatory action of acetylcholine plays a critical role in a vast range of neural processes such as learning and memory, attention, motor control, and sensory processing. In this study, we describe the spatial distribution of cholinergic neurons throughout the brain of the weakly electric fish&lt;i&gt;, Apteronotus leptorhynchus&lt;/i&gt;, using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) mRNA. The presence of ChAT in brain nuclei harboring feedback projections directed to primary centers of the electrosensory pathway supports and extends our previous findings on a neuromodulatory effect of acetylcholine on the early stages of electrosensory processing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acetylcholine acts as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator of many central nervous system processes such as learning and memory, attention, motor control, and sensory processing. The present study describes the spatial distribution of cholinergic neurons throughout the brain of the weakly electric fish, &lt;i&gt;Apteronotus leptorhynchus&lt;/i&gt;, using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization of choline acetyltransferase mRNA. Distinct groups of cholinergic cells were observed in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, and hindbrain. These included cholinergic cell groups typically identified in other vertebrate brains, e. g., motor neurons. Using both &lt;i&gt;in‐vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ex‐vivo&lt;/i&gt; neuronal tracing methods, we identified two new cholinergic connections leading to novel hypotheses on their functional significance. Projections to the nucleus praeeminentialis (nP) arise from isthmic nuclei, possibly including the nucleus lateralis valvulae (nLV) and the isthmic nucleus (nI). The nP is a central component of all electrosensory feedback pathways to the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL). We have previously shown that some neurons in nP, TS, and tectum express muscarinic receptors. We hypothesize that, based on nLV/nI cell responses in other teleosts and isthmic connectivity in &lt;i&gt;A. leptorhynchus&lt;/i&gt;, the isthmic connections to nP, TS, and tectum modulate responses to electrosensory and/or visual motion and, in particular, to looming/receding stimuli. In addition, we found that the octavolateral efferent nucleus (OE) is the likely source of cholinergic fibers innervating the ELL. In other teleosts, OE inhibits octavolateral hair cells during locomotion. In gymnotiform fish, OE may also act on the first central processing stage and, we hypothesize, implement corollary discharge modulation of electrosensory processing during locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Changes in resting‐state functional brain connectivity associated with head impacts over one men’s semi‐professional soccer season&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ddbc37b5-9d91-4d73-8f7f-ca26c9b69e4d/jnr24742-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure to repetitive head impacts without concussion over one season of competitive men's soccer games was associated with increased resting‐state functional connectivity within networks involved in cognitive functions, analyzing a cohort including nine soccer players and 20 other athletes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soccer, as a contact sport, exposes players to repetitive head impacts, especially through heading the ball. The question of a long‐term brain cumulative effect remains. Our objective was to determine whether exposure to head impacts over one soccer season was associated with changes in functional brain connectivity at rest, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this prospective cohort study, 10 semi‐professional men soccer players, aged 18–25 years, and 20 age‐matched men athletes without a concussion history and who do not practice any contact sport were recruited in Bordeaux (France). Exposure to head impacts per soccer player during competitive games over one season was measured using video analysis. Resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired for both groups at two times, before and after the season. With a seed‐based analysis, resting‐state networks that have been intimately associated with aspects of cognitive functioning were investigated. The results showed a mean head impacts of 42 (±33) per soccer player over the season, mainly intentional head‐to‐ball impacts and no concussion. No head impact was found among the other athletes. The number of head impacts between the two MRI acquisitions before and after the season was associated with increased connectivity within the default mode network and the cortico‐cerebellar network. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the brain functioning changes over one soccer season in association with exposure to repetitive head impacts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Calretinin and calbindin architecture of the midline thalamus associated with prefrontal–hippocampal circuitry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23271?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The midline thalamus bidirectionally connects the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HC) creating a unique cortico‐thalamo‐cortical circuit fundamental to memory and executive function. While the anatomical connectivity of midline thalamus has been thoroughly investigated, little is known about its cellular organization within each nucleus. Here we used immunohistological techniques to examine cellular distributions in the midline thalamus based on the calcium binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calretinin (CR), and calbindin (CB). We also examined these calcium binding proteins in a population of reuniens cells known to project to both mPFC and HC using a dual fluorescence retrograde adenoassociated virus‐based tracing approach. These dual reuniens mPFC‐HC projecting cells, in particular, are thought to be important for synchronizing mPFC and HC activity. First, we confirmed the absence of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in the midline thalamus. Second, we found a common pattern of CR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells throughout midline thalamus with CR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells running along the nearby third ventricle (3V) and penetrating the midline. CB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were consistently more lateral and toward the middle of the dorsal‐ventral extent of the midline thalamus. Notably, single‐labeled CR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; zones were partially overlapping and included dual‐labeled CR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. Within RE, we also observed a CR and CB subzone specific diversity. Interestingly, dual mPFC‐HC projecting neurons in RE expressed none of the calcium binding proteins examined, but were contained in nests of CR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. Overall, the midline thalamus was well organized into CR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; rich zones distributed throughout the region, with dual mPFC‐HC projecting cells in reuniens representing a unique cell population. These results provide a cytoarchitectural organization in the midline thalamus based on calcium binding protein expression, and set the stage for future cell‐type specific interrogations of the functional role of these different cell populations in mPFC‐HC interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The traditional cerebellum’s role has been linked to the high computational demands for sensorimotor control. However, several findings have pointed to its involvement in executive and emotional functions in the last decades. First in 2009 and then, in 2016, we raised why we should consider the cerebellum when thinking about drug addiction. A decade later, mounting evidence strongly suggests the cerebellar involvement in this disorder. Nevertheless, direct evidence is still partial and related mainly to drug-induced reward memory, but recent results about cerebellar functions may provide new insights into its role in addiction. The present review does not intend to be a compelling revision on available findings, as we did in the two previous reviews. This minireview focuses on specific findings of the cerebellum’s role in drug-related reward memories and the way ahead for future research. The results discussed here provide grounds for involving the cerebellar cortex’s apical region in regulating behavior driven by drug-cue associations. They also suggest that the cerebellar cortex dysfunction may facilitate drug-induced learning by increasing glutamatergic output from the deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and neural activity in its projecting areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Spinal Cord Imaging Markers and Recovery of Volitional Leg Movement With Spinal Cord Epidural Stimulation in Individuals With Clinically Motor Complete Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.559313</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.559313</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that epidural stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord (scES) can re-enable lower limb volitional motor control in individuals with chronic, clinically motor complete spinal cord injury (SCI). This observation entails that residual supraspinal connectivity to the lumbosacral spinal circuitry still persisted after SCI, although it was non-detectable when scES was not provided. In the present study, we aimed at exploring further the mechanisms underlying scES-promoted recovery of volitional lower limb motor control by investigating neuroimaging markers at the spinal cord lesion site via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Spinal cord MRI was collected prior to epidural stimulator implantation in 13 individuals with chronic, clinically motor complete SCI, and the spared tissue of specific regions of the spinal cord (anterior, posterior, right, left, and total cord) was assessed. After epidural stimulator implantation, and prior to any training, volitional motor control was evaluated during left and right lower limb flexion and ankle dorsiflexion attempts. The ability to generate force exertion and movement was not correlated to any neuroimaging marker. On the other hand, spared tissue of specific cord regions significantly and importantly correlated with some aspects of motor control that include activation amplitude of antagonist (negative correlation) muscles during left ankle dorsiflexion, and electromyographic coordination patterns during right lower limb flexion. The fact that amount and location of spared spinal cord tissue at the lesion site were not related to the ability to generate volitional lower limb movements may suggest that supraspinal inputs through spared spinal cord regions that differ across individuals can result in the generation of lower limb volitional motor output prior to any training when epidural stimulation is provided.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Epileptic activity may induce increases in state-dependent SWA in human brains, therefore, localization of SWA may prove useful in the presurgical workup of epileptic patients. We analyzed high-density electroencephalography (HDEEG) data across vigilance states from a reflex epilepsy patient with a clearly localizable ictal symptomatogenic zone to provide a proof-of-concept for the testability of this hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Overnight HDEEG recordings were obtained in the patient during REM sleep, NREM sleep, wakefulness, and during a right facial motor seizure then compared to 10 controls. After preprocessing, SWA (i.e., delta power; 1–4 Hz) was calculated at each channel. Scalp level and source reconstruction analyses were computed. We assessed for statistical differences in maximum SWA between the patient and controls within REM sleep, NREM sleep, wakefulness, and seizure. Then, we completed an identical statistical comparison after first subtracting intrasubject REM sleep SWA from that of NREM sleep, wakefulness, and seizure SWA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The topographical analysis revealed greater left hemispheric SWA in the patient vs. controls in all vigilance states except REM sleep (which showed a right hemispheric maximum). Source space analysis revealed increased SWA in the left inferior frontal cortex during NREM sleep and wakefulness. Ictal data displayed poor source-space localization. Comparing each state to REM sleep enhanced localization accuracy; the most clearly localizing results were observed when subtracting REM sleep from wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: State-dependent SWA during NREM sleep and wakefulness may help to identify aspects of the potential epileptogenic zone. Future work in larger cohorts may assess the clinical value of sleep SWA to help presurgical planning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The development of methods for the activity-dependent tagging of neurons enabled a new way to tackle the problem of engram identification at the cellular level, giving rise to groundbreaking findings in the field of memory studies. However, the resolution of activity-dependent tagging remains limited to the whole-cell level. Notably, events taking place at the synapse level play a critical role in the establishment of new memories, and strong experimental evidence shows that learning and synaptic plasticity are tightly linked. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the currently available techniques that enable to identify and track the neuronal activity with synaptic spatial resolution. We also present recent technologies that allow to selectively interfere with specific subsets of synapses. Lastly, we discuss how these technologies can be applied to the study of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Functional Interactions of Tau Phosphorylation Sites That Mediate Toxicity and Deficient Learning in Drosophila melanogaster</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.569520</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.569520</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hyperphosphorylated Tau protein is the main component of the neurofibrillary tangles, characterizing degenerating neurons in Alzheimer’s disease and other Tauopathies. Expression of human Tau protein in Drosophila CNS results in increased toxicity, premature mortality and learning and memory deficits. Herein we use novel transgenic lines to investigate the contribution of specific phosphorylation sites previously implicated in Tau toxicity. These three different sites, Ser&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;, Thr&lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;, and Ser&lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt; were tested either by blocking their phosphorylation, by Ser/Thr to Ala substitution, or pseudophosphorylation, by changing Ser/Thr to Glu. We validate the hypothesis that phosphorylation at Ser&lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt; is necessary for Tau-dependent learning deficits and a “facilitatory gatekeeper” to Ser&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt; occupation, which is linked to Tau toxicity. Importantly we reveal that phosphorylation at Thr&lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt; acts as a “suppressive gatekeeper”, preventing phosphorylation of many sites including Ser&lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt; and consequently of Ser&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, we elucidate novel interactions among phosphosites central to Tau mediated neuronal dysfunction and toxicity, likely driven by phosphorylation-dependent conformational plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Brain Computer Interface Treatment for Motor Rehabilitation of Upper Extremity of Stroke Patients—A Feasibility Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.591435</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.591435</link>
	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Numerous recent publications have explored Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) systems as rehabilitation tools to help subacute and chronic stroke patients recover upper extremity movement. Recent work has shown that BCI therapy can lead to better outcomes than conventional therapy. BCI combined with other techniques such as Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) and Virtual Reality (VR) allows to the user restore the neurological function by inducing the neural plasticity through improved real-time detection of motor imagery (MI) as patients perform therapy tasks.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifty-one stroke patients with upper extremity hemiparesis were recruited for this study. All participants performed 25 sessions with the MI BCI and assessment visits to track the functional changes before and after the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The results of this study demonstrated a significant increase in the motor function of the paretic arm assessed by Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-UE), ΔFMA-UE = 4.68 points, P &amp;lt; 0.001, reduction of the spasticity in the wrist and fingers assessed by Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), ΔMAS-wrist = -0.72 points (SD = 0.83), P &amp;lt; 0.001, ΔMAS-fingers = -0.63 points (SD = 0.82), P &amp;lt; 0.001. Other significant improvements in the grasp ability were detected in the healthy hand. All these functional improvements achieved during the BCI therapy persisted 6 months after the therapy ended. Results also showed that patients with Motor Imagery accuracy (MI) above 80% increase 3.16 points more in the FMA than patients below this threshold (95% CI; [1.47–6.62], P = 0.003). The functional improvement was not related with the stroke severity or with the stroke stage.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The BCI treatment used here was effective in promoting long lasting functional improvements in the upper extremity in stroke survivors with severe, moderate and mild impairment. This functional improvement can be explained by improved neuroplasticity in the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: The Application of MR Spectroscopy and MR Perfusion in Cerebral Syphilitic Gumma: A Case Report</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.544802</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.544802</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral syphilitic gumma is a rare disease and can be misdiagnosed as a common brain tumor when only conventional imaging results are adopted. Differentiating between syphilitic gumma and tumors may be achieved by applying advanced magnetic resonance (MR) techniques, such as MR spectroscopy and MR perfusion. However, the MR perfusion characteristics of cerebral syphilitic gumma have not been reported yet. Here, we report a case of cerebral syphilitic gumma in a 52-year-old woman and discuss the imaging features of conventional MR, MR spectroscopy, and MR perfusion. The results suggest that the application of MR spectroscopy and MR perfusion could provide additional information that contributes to the diagnosis of cerebral syphilitic gumma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Determination of the Time Window of Event-Related Potential Using Multiple-Set Consensus Clustering</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.521595</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Clustering is a promising tool for grouping the sequence of similar time-points aimed to identify the attention blocks in spatiotemporal event-related potentials (ERPs) analysis. It is most likely to elicit the appropriate time window for ERP of interest if a suitable clustering method is applied to spatiotemporal ERP. However, how to reliably estimate a proper time window from entire individual subjects’ data is still challenging. In this study, we developed a novel multiset consensus clustering method in which several clustering results of multiple subjects were combined to retrieve the best fitted clustering for all the subjects within a group. Then, the obtained clustering was processed by a newly proposed time-window detection method to determine the most suitable time window for identifying the ERP of interest in each condition/group. Applying the proposed method to the simulated ERP data and real data indicated that the brain responses from the individual subjects can be collected to determine a reliable time window for different conditions/groups. Our results revealed more precise time windows to identify N2 and P3 components in the simulated data compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our proposed method achieved more robust performance and outperformed statistical analysis results in the real data for N300 and prospective positivity components. To conclude, the proposed method successfully estimates the time window for ERP of interest by processing the individual data, offering new venues for spatiotemporal ERP processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: ANSH: Multimodal Neuroimaging Database Including MR Spectroscopic Data From Each Continent to Advance Alzheimer’s Disease Research</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.571039</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.571039</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. The etiology of AD is not known, and intense research involving multimodal neuroimaging data (e.g., MRI, functional MRI, PET etc.) is extensively used to identify the causal molecular process for AD. In this context, various imaging-based databases accessible to researchers globally, are useful for an independent analysis. Apart from MRI-based brain imaging data, the neurochemical data using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provide early molecular processes before the structural or functional changes are manifested. The existing imaging-based databases in AD lack the integration of MRS modality and, thus, limits the availability of neurochemical information to the AD research community. This perspective is an initiative to bring attention to the development of the neuroimaging database, “ANSH,” that includes brain glutathione (GSH), gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, and other neurochemicals along with MRI-based information for AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy subjects. ANSH is supported by a JAVA-based workflow environment and python providing a simple, dynamic, and distributed platform with data security. The platform consists of two-tiered architecture for data collection and management further supporting quality control, report generation for analyzed data, and data backup with a dedicated storage system. The ANSH database aims to present a single neuroimaging data platform incorporating diverse data types from healthy control and patient groups to provide better insights pertaining to disease progression. This data management platform provides flexible data sharing across users with continuous project monitoring. The development of ANSH platform will facilitate collaborative research and multi-site data sharing across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Publication of Study Exit Procedures in Clinical Trials of Deep Brain Stimulation: A Focused Literature Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.581090</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Considerable variability exists in the publication of clinical research study procedures related to study enrollment and participant exit from clinical trials. Despite recent efforts to encourage research data sharing and greater transparency regarding research outcomes, reporting of research procedures remains inconsistent. Transparency about study procedures has important implications for the interpretation of study outcomes and the consistent implementation of best practices in clinical trial design and conduct. This review of publications from clinical trials of deep brain stimulation (DBS) using the MEDLINE database examines the frequency and consistency of publication of research procedures and data related to exit from DBS research. Related considerations, such as device explant or continued use, battery and other device hardware replacements, and post-trial follow-up care are also reviewed. This review finds significant variability in the publication and reporting of study exit procedures. Of the 47 clinical trials included in this review, 19% (9) disclosed procedures related to exit from research. Reporting of other exit-related data and study procedures examined in this review was identified in fewer than half of the included clinical trials. The rate of participant retention and duration of follow-up was reported more than any other category of data included in this review. Results inform efforts to improve consistency in research design, conduct, and publication of results from clinical trials in DBS and related areas of clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Convergent Associative Motor Cortical Plasticity Induced by Conditional Somatosensory and Motor Reaction Afferents</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.576171</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.576171</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Associative motor cortical plasticity can be non-invasively induced by paired median nerve electric stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex (M1). This study investigates whether a simultaneous motor reaction of the other hand advances the associative plasticity in M1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty-four right-handed subjects received conventional paired associative stimulation (PAS) and PAS with simultaneous motor reaction (PASmr) with at least a 1-week interval. The PASmr protocol additionally included left abductor pollicis brevis muscle movement responding to a digital sound. The motor reaction time was individually measured. The M1 excitability was examined by the motor evoked potential (MEP), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) before and after the PAS protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The conventional PAS protocol significantly facilitated MEP and suppressed SICI. A negative correlation between the reaction time and the MEP change, and a positive correlation between the reaction time and the ICF change were found in the PASmr protocol. By subgrouping analysis, we further found significant facilitation of MEP and a reduction of ICF in the subjects with fast reaction times but not in those with slow reaction times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Synchronized motor reaction ipsilateral to the stimulated M1 induces associative M1 motor plasticity through the spike-timing dependent principle. MEP and ICF change could represent this kind of plasticity. The current findings provide a novel insight into designing rehabilitation programs concerning motor function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Impact of Medical Complications in Predicting the Rehabilitation Outcome of Patients With Disorders of Consciousness After Severe Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.570544</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.570544</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we sought to assess the predictors of outcome in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) during neurorehabilitation stay. In total, 96 patients with DOC (vegetative state, minimally conscious state, or emergence from minimally conscious state) were enrolled (69 males; mean age 43.6 ± 20.8 years) and the improvement of the degree of disability, as assessed by the Disability Rating Scale, was considered the main outcome measure. To define the best predictor, a series of demographical and clinical factors were modeled using a twofold approach: (1) logistic regression to evaluate a possible causal effect among variables; and (2) machine learning algorithms (ML), to define the best predictive model. Univariate analysis demonstrated that disability in DOC patients statistically decreased at the discharge with respect to admission. Genitourinary was the most frequent medical complication (MC) emerging during the neurorehabilitation period. The logistic model revealed that the total amount of MCs is a risk factor for lack of functional improvement. ML discloses that the most important prognostic factors are the respiratory and hepatic complications together with the presence of the upper gastrointestinal comorbidities. Our study provides new evidence on the most adverse short-term factors predicting a functional recovery in DOC patients after severe TBI. The occurrence of medical complications during neurorehabilitation stay should be considered to avoid poor outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Impaired Topographical Organization of Functional Brain Networks in Parkinson’s Disease Patients With Freezing of Gait</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.580564</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.580564</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study aimed to explore alterations in the topological properties of the functional brain network in primary Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with freezing of gait (PD-FOG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (Rs-fMRI) data were obtained in 23 PD-FOG patients, 33 PD patients without FOG (PD-nFOG), and 24 healthy control (HC) participants. The whole-brain functional connectome was constructed by thresholding the Pearson correlation matrices of 90 brain regions, and topological properties were analyzed by using graph theory approaches. The network-based statistics (NBS) method was used to determine the suprathreshold connected edges (P &amp;lt; 0.05; threshold T = 2.725), and statistical significance was estimated by using the non-parametric permutation method (5,000 permutations). Statistically significant topological properties were further evaluated for their relationship with clinical neurological scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The topological properties of the functional brain network in PD-FOG and PD-nFOG showed no abnormalities at the global level. However, compared with HCs, PD-FOG patients showed decreased nodal local efficiency in several brain regions, including the bilateral striatum, frontoparietal areas, visual cortex, and bilateral superior temporal gyrus, increased nodal local efficiency in the left gyrus rectus. When compared with PD-nFOG patients and HCs, PD-FOG showed increased betweenness centrality in the left hippocampus. Moreover, compared to HCs, both PD-FOG and PD-nFOG patients displayed reduced network connections by using the NBS method, mainly involving the sensorimotor cortex (SM), visual network (VN), default mode network (DMN), auditory network (AN), dorsal attention network (DAN), subcortical regions, and limbic network (LIM). The local node efficiency of the right temporal pole: superior temporal gyrus in PD-FOG patients was positively correlated with the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ) scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This study demonstrates the disrupted regional topological organization in PD-FOG patients, especially associated with damage to the subcortical regions and multiple cortical regions. Our results provide insights into the dysfunctional mechanisms of the relevant networks and indicate potential neuroimaging biomarkers of PD-FOG.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Icosahedral viruses are under a micrometer in diameter, their infectious genome encapsulated by a shell assembled by a multiscale process, starting from an integer multiple of 60 viral capsid or coat protein (VP) monomers. We predict and validate inter-atomic hotspot interactions between VP monomers that are important for the assembly of 3 types of icosahedral viral capsids: Adeno Associated Virus serotype 2 (AAV2) and Minute Virus of Mice (MVM), both &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; = 1 single stranded DNA viruses, and Bromo Mosaic Virus (BMV), a &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; = 3 single stranded RNA virus. Experimental validation is by in-vitro, site-directed mutagenesis data found in literature. We combine ab-initio predictions at two scales: at the &lt;i&gt;interface-scale&lt;/i&gt;, we predict the importance (&lt;i&gt;cruciality&lt;/i&gt;) of an interaction for successful subassembly across each interface between symmetry-related VP monomers; and at the &lt;i&gt;capsid-scale&lt;/i&gt;, we predict the cruciality of an interface for successful capsid assembly. At the interface-scale, we measure cruciality by changes in the capsid free-energy landscape &lt;i&gt;partition function&lt;/i&gt; when an interaction is removed. The partition function computation uses &lt;i&gt;atlases&lt;/i&gt; of interface subassembly landscapes, rapidly generated by a novel geometric method and curated opensource software EASAL (efficient atlasing and search of assembly landscapes). At the capsid-scale, cruciality of an interface for successful assembly of the capsid is based on combinatorial entropy. Our study goes all the way from resource-light, multiscale computational predictions of crucial hotspot inter-atomic interactions to validation using data on site-directed mutagenesis’ effect on capsid assembly. By reliably and rapidly narrowing down target interactions, (no more than 1.5 hours per interface on a laptop with Intel Core i5-2500K @ 3.2 Ghz CPU and 8GB of RAM) our predictions can inform and reduce time-consuming in-vitro and in-vivo experiments, or more computationally intensive in-silico analyses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TXWLfReOxHg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Over the past two decades, researchers have discovered a special form of alternative splicing that produces a circular form of RNA. Although these circular RNAs (circRNAs) have garnered considerable attention in the scientific community for their biogenesis and functions, the focus of current studies has been on the tissue-specific circRNAs that exist only in one tissue but not in other tissues or on the disease-specific circRNAs that exist in certain disease conditions, such as cancer, but not under normal conditions. This approach was conducted in the relative absence of methods that analyze a group of common circRNAs that exist in both conditions, but are more abundant in one condition relative to another (differentially expressed). Studies of differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) between two conditions would serve as a significant first step in filling this void. Here, we introduce a novel computational tool, seekCRIT (seek for differentially expressed CircRNAs In Transcriptome), that identifies the DECs between two conditions from high-throughput sequencing data. Using rat retina RNA-seq data from ischemic and normal conditions, we show that over 74% of identifiable circRNAs are expressed in both conditions and over 40 circRNAs are differentially expressed between two conditions. We also obtain a high qPCR validation rate of 90% for DECs with a FDR of &amp;lt; 5%. Our results demonstrate that seekCRIT is a novel and efficient approach to detect DECs using rRNA depleted RNA-seq data. seekCRIT is freely downloadable at https://github.com/UofLBioinformatics/seekCRIT.

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Numerical knockouts–In silico assessment of factors predisposing to thoracic aortic aneurysms</title>

Myriad risk factors–including uncontrolled hypertension, aging, and diverse genetic mutations–contribute to the development and enlargement of thoracic aortic aneurysms. Detailed analyses of clinical data and longitudinal studies of murine models continue to provide insight into the natural history of these potentially lethal conditions. Yet, because of the co-existence of multiple risk factors in most cases, it has been difficult to isolate individual effects of the many different factors or to understand how they act in combination. In this paper, we use a data-informed computational model of the initiation and progression of thoracic aortic aneurysms to contrast key predisposing risk factors both in isolation and in combination; these factors include localized losses of elastic fiber integrity, aberrant collagen remodeling, reduced smooth muscle contractility, and dysfunctional mechanosensing or mechanoregulation of extracellular matrix along with superimposed hypertension and aortic aging. In most cases, mild-to-severe localized losses in cellular function or matrix integrity give rise to varying degrees of local dilatations of the thoracic aorta, with enlargement typically exacerbated in cases wherein predisposing risk factors co-exist. The simulations suggest, for the first time, that effects of compromised smooth muscle contractility are more important in terms of dysfunctional mechanosensing and mechanoregulation of matrix than in vessel-level control of diameter and, furthermore, that dysfunctional mechanobiological control can yield lesions comparable to those in cases of compromised elastic fiber integrity. Particularly concerning, therefore, is that loss of constituents such as fibrillin-1, as in Marfan syndrome, can compromise both elastic fiber integrity and mechanosensing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_lLAarBO2Bc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Visual detection is locked to the internal dynamics of cortico-motor control</title>

Movements overtly sample sensory information, making sensory analysis an active-sensing process. In this study, we show that visual information sampling is not just locked to the (overt) movement dynamics but to the internal (covert) dynamics of cortico-motor control. We asked human participants to perform continuous isometric contraction while detecting unrelated and unpredictable near-threshold visual stimuli. The motor output (force) shows zero-lag coherence with brain activity (recorded via electroencephalography) in the beta-band, as previously reported. In contrast, cortical rhythms in the alpha-band systematically forerun the motor output by 200 milliseconds. Importantly, visual detection is facilitated when cortico-motor alpha (not beta) synchronization is enhanced immediately before stimulus onset, namely, at the optimal phase relationship for sensorimotor communication. These findings demonstrate an ongoing coupling between visual sampling and motor control, suggesting the operation of an internal and alpha-cycling visuomotor loop.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/W8V-xDoWiJQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Ultrastructural localization of glutamate delta 1 (GluD1) receptor immunoreactivity in the mouse and monkey striatum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25051?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Ultrastructural localization of glutamate delta 1 (GluD1) receptor immunoreactivity in the mouse and monkey striatum&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1f13d0a1-0cbe-409c-8fde-36545b16bdd3/cne25051-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glutamate delta 1 (GluD1) is more strongly expressed in the striosome than in the matrix compartment of the monkey caudate nucleus. At the subcellular level, GluD1 is found at asymmetric glutamatergic synapses on dendrites and spines. Double immunofluorescence data suggest an association between GluD1 profiles and vGluT2‐containing thalamic terminals in both striatal compartments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glutamate receptor delta 1 (GluD1) is strongly expressed in the striatum. Knockout of GluD1 expression in striatal neurons elicits cognitive deficits and disrupts the thalamostriatal system in mice. To understand the potential role of GluD1 in the primate striatum, we compared the cellular and subcellular localization of striatal GluD1 immunoreactivity (GluD1‐IR) in mice and monkeys. In both species, striatal GluD1‐IR displayed a patchy pattern of distribution in register with the striosome/matrix compartmentation, but in an opposite fashion. While GluD1 was more heavily expressed in the striosomes than the matrix in the monkey caudate nucleus, the opposite was found in the mouse striatum. At the electron microscopic level, GluD1‐IR was preferentially expressed in dendritic shafts (47.9 ± 1.2%), followed by glia (37.7 ± 2.5%), and dendritic spines (14.3 ± 2.6%) in the matrix of the mouse striatum. This pattern was not statistically different from the labeling in the striosome and matrix compartments of the monkey caudate nucleus, with the exception of a small amount of GluD1‐positive unmyelinated axons and axon terminals in the primate striatum. Immunogold staining revealed synaptic and perisynaptic GluD1 labeling at putative axo‐dendritic and axo‐spinous glutamatergic synapses, and intracellular labeling on the surface of mitochondria. Confocal microscopy showed that GluD1 is preferentially colocalized with thalamic over cortical terminals in both the striosome and matrix compartments. These data provide the anatomical substrate for a deeper understanding of GluD1 regulation of striatal glutamatergic synapses, but also suggest possible extrasynaptic, glial, and mitochondrial GluD1 functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The amygdaloid body of two carnivore species: The feliform banded mongoose and the caniform domestic ferret&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/af478414-7d5e-459a-a929-0197f9d69d54/cne25046-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low power photomicrographs of myelin staining in the basolateral amygdala of the banded mongoose (left) and domestic ferret (right). Note the overall lower density of myelin in the domestic ferret, which may relate to either a smaller brain mass or be an effect of the domestication process. Scale bars in each image = 1 mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study provides an analysis of the cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, and chemoarchitecture of the amygdaloid body of the banded mongoose (&lt;i&gt;Mungos mungo&lt;/i&gt;) and domestic ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;). Using architectural and immunohistochemical stains, we observe that the organization of the nuclear and cortical portions of the amygdaloid complex is very similar in both species. The one major difference is the presence of a cortex‐amygdala transition zone observed in the domestic ferret that is absent in the banded mongoose. In addition, the chemoarchitecture is, for the most part, quite similar in the two species, but several variances, such as differing densities of neurons expressing the calcium‐binding proteins in specific nuclei are noted. Despite this, certain aspects of the chemoarchitecture, such as the cholinergic innervation of the magnocellular division of the basal nuclear cluster and the presence of doublecortin expressing neurons in the shell division of the accessory basal nuclear cluster, appear to be consistent features of the Eutherian mammal amygdala. The domestic ferret presented with an overall lower myelin density throughout the amygdaloid body than the banded mongoose, a feature that may reflect artificial selection in the process of domestication for increased juvenile‐like behavior in the adult domestic ferret, such as a muted fear response. The shared, but temporally distant, ancestry of the banded mongoose and domestic ferret allows us to generate observations relevant to understanding the relative influence that phylogenetic constraints, adaptive evolutionary plasticity, and the domestication process may play in the organization and chemoarchitecture of the amygdaloid body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Time‐restricted feeding prevents depressive‐like and anxiety‐like behaviors in male rats exposed to an experimental model of shift‐work</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Time‐restricted feeding prevents depressive‐like and anxiety‐like behaviors in male rats exposed to an experimental model of shift‐work&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6150174f-d86d-40e8-a001-6c3b43ac9922/jnr24741-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In male rats exposed to an experimental model of shift‐work, we reported circadian disruption, depressive and anxiety‐like behaviors as well as neuroinflammation in brain areas associated with mood regulation. Time‐restricted feeding associated with the normal activity phase prevents depressive and anxiety‐like behaviors as well as neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals who regularly shift their sleep timing, like night and/or shift‐workers suffer from circadian desynchrony and are at risk of developing cardiometabolic diseases and cancer. Also, shift‐work is are suggested to be a risk factor for the development of mood disorders such as the burn out syndrome, anxiety, and depression. Experimental and clinical studies provide evidence that food intake restricted to the normal activity phase is a potent synchronizer for the circadian system and can prevent the detrimental health effects associated with circadian disruption. Here, we explored whether adult male Wistar rats exposed to an experimental model of shift‐work (W‐AL) developed depressive and/or anxiety‐like behaviors and whether this was associated with neuroinflammation in brain areas involved with mood regulation. We also tested whether time‐restricted feeding (TRF) to the active phase could ameliorate circadian disruption and therefore would prevent depressive and anxiety‐like behaviors as well as neuroinflammation. In male Wistar rats, W‐AL induced depressive‐like behavior characterized by hypoactivity and anhedonia and induced increased anxiety‐like behavior in the open field test. This was associated with increased number of glial fibrillary acidic protein and IBA‐1‐positive cells in the prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala. Moreover W‐AL caused morphological changes in the microglia in the CA3 area of the hippocampus indicating microglial activation. Importantly, TRF prevented behavioral changes and decreased neuroinflammation markers in the brain. Present results add up evidence about the importance that TRF in synchrony with the light–dark cycle can prevent neuroinflammation leading to healthy mood states in spite of circadian disruptive conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Stress Varies Along the Social Density Continuum</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social stress is ubiquitous in the lives of social animals. While significant research has aimed to understand the specific forms of stress imparted by particular social interactions, less attention has been paid to understanding the behavioral effects and neural underpinnings of stress produced by the presence and magnitude of social interactions. However, in humans and rodents alike, chronically low and chronically high rates of social interaction are associated with a suite of mental health issues, suggesting the need for further research. Here, we review literature examining the behavioral and neurobiological findings associated with changing social density, focusing on research on chronic social isolation and chronic social crowding in rodent models, and synthesize findings in the context of the continuum of social density that can be experienced by social animals. Through this synthesis, we aim to both summarize the state of the field and describe promising avenues for future research that would more clearly define the broad effects of social interaction on the brain and behavior in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Using Minimal-Redundant and Maximal-Relevant Whole-Brain Functional Connectivity to Classify Bipolar Disorder</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;A number of mental illness is often re-diagnosed to be bipolar disorder (BD). Furthermore, the prefronto-limbic-striatal regions seem to be associated with the main dysconnectivity of BD. Functional connectivity is potentially an appropriate objective neurobiological marker that can assist with BD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Health controls (HC; n = 173) and patients with BD who had been diagnosed by experienced physicians (n = 192) were separated into 10-folds, namely, a ninefold training set and a onefold testing set. The classification involved feature selection of the training set using minimum redundancy/maximum relevance. Support vector machine was used for training. The classification was repeated 10 times until each fold had been used as the testing set.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The mean accuracy of the 10 testing sets was 76.25%, and the area under the curve was 0.840. The selected functional within-network/between-network connectivity was mainly in the subcortical/cerebellar regions and the frontoparietal network. Furthermore, similarity within the BD patients, calculated by the cosine distance between two functional connectivity matrices, was smaller than between groups before feature selection and greater than between groups after the feature selection.&lt;/p&gt;Limitations&lt;p&gt;The major limitations were that all the BD patients were receiving medication and that no independent dataset was included.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our approach effectively separates a relatively large group of BD patients from HCs. This was done by selecting functional connectivity, which was more similar within BD patients, and also seems to be related to the neuropathological factors associated with BD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Phosphorylation of the Retinal Ribbon Synapse Specific t-SNARE Protein Syntaxin3B Is Regulated by Light via a Ca2 +-Dependent Pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.587072</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.587072</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurotransmitter release at retinal ribbon-style synapses utilizes a specialized t-SNARE protein called syntaxin3B (STX3B). In contrast to other syntaxins, STX3 proteins can be phosphorylated in vitro at T14 by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+/&lt;/sup&gt;calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This modification has the potential to modulate SNARE complex formation required for neurotransmitter release in an activity-dependent manner. To determine the extent to which T14 phosphorylation occurs in vivo in the mammalian retina and characterize the pathway responsible for the in vivo phosphorylation of T14, we utilized quantitative immunofluorescence to measure the levels of STX3 and STX3 phosphorylated at T14 (pSTX3) in the synaptic terminals of mouse retinal photoreceptors and rod bipolar cells (RBCs). Results demonstrate that STX3B phosphorylation at T14 is light-regulated and dependent upon the elevation of intraterminal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In rod photoreceptor terminals, the ratio of pSTX3 to STX3 was significantly higher in dark-adapted mice, when rods are active, than in light-exposed mice. By contrast, in RBC terminals, the ratio of pSTX3 to STX3 was higher in light-exposed mice, when these terminals are active, than in dark-adapted mice. These results were recapitulated in the isolated eyecup preparation, but only when Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was included in the external medium. In the absence of external Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, pSTX3 levels remained low regardless of light/dark exposure. Using the isolated RBC preparation, we next showed that elevation of intraterminal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; alone was sufficient to increase STX3 phosphorylation at T14. Furthermore, both the non-specific kinase inhibitor staurosporine and the selective CaMKII inhibitor AIP inhibited the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent increase in the pSTX3/STX3 ratio in isolated RBC terminals, while in parallel experiments, AIP suppressed RBC depolarization-evoked exocytosis, measured using membrane capacitance measurements. Our data support a novel, illumination-regulated modulation of retinal ribbon-style synapse function in which activity-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry drives the phosphorylation of STX3B at T14 by CaMKII, which in turn, modulates the ability to form SNARE complexes required for exocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators Can Impair Dendrite Growth of Cortical Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A battery of genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) with different binding kinetics and calcium affinities was developed over the recent years to permit long-term calcium imaging. GECIs are calcium buffers and therefore, expression of GECIs may interfere with calcium homeostasis and signaling pathways important for neuronal differentiation and survival. Our objective was to investigate if the biolistically induced expression of five commonly used GECIs at two postnatal time points (days 14 and 22–25) could affect the morphological maturation of cortical neurons in organotypic slice cultures of rat visual cortex. Expression of GCaMP3 in both time windows, and of GCaMP5G and TN-XXL in the later time window impaired apical and /or basal dendrite growth of pyramidal neurons. With time, the proportion of GECI transfectants with nuclear filling increased, but an only prolonged expression of TN-XXL caused higher levels of neurodegeneration. In multipolar interneurons, only GCaMP3 evoked a transient growth delay during the early time window. GCaMP6m and GCaMP6m-X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; were quite “neuron-friendly.” Since growth-impaired neurons might not have the physiological responses typical of age-matched wildtype neurons the results obtained after prolonged developmental expression of certain GECIs might need to be interpreted with caution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The lncRNA MALAT1/miR-30/Spastin Axis Regulates Hippocampal Neurite Outgrowth</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spastin, a microtubule-severing enzyme, is important for neurite outgrowth. However, the mechanisms underlying the post-transcriptional regulation of spastin during microtubule-related processes are largely unknown. We demonstrated that the spastin expression level is controlled by a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1)/microRNA-30 (miR-30) axis during neurite outgrowth. The miR-30 expression level decreased in hippocampal neurons with increasing days in culture, and miR-30 overexpression suppressed while miR-30 inhibition promoted neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons. Spastin was validated as a target gene of miR-30 using the luciferase reporter assay. The protein expression, microtubule severing activity, and neurite promoting effect of spastin were suppressed by the overexpression of miR-30 mimics and increased by miR-30 inhibitors. MALAT1 expression increased during neurite outgrowth and MALAT1 silencing impaired neurite outgrowth. miR-30 was a sponge target of MALAT1 and MALAT1/miR-30 altered neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons. MALAT1 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-30 on the activity of a luciferase reporter construct containing spastin, as well as spastin mRNA and protein expression, indicating that spastin was a downstream effector of MALAT1/miR-30. The MALAT1/miR-30 cascade also modulated spastin-induced microtubule severing, and the MALAT1/miR-30/spastin axis regulated neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons. This study suggests a new mechanism governing neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons involving MALAT1/miR-30-regulated spastin expression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Hindbrain and Spinal Cord Contributions to the Cutaneous Sensory Innervation of the Larval Zebrafish Pectoral Fin</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vertebrate forelimbs contain arrays of sensory neuron fibers that transmit signals from the skin to the nervous system. We used the genetic toolkit and optical clarity of the larval zebrafish to conduct a live imaging study of the sensory neurons innervating the pectoral fin skin. Sensory neurons in both the hindbrain and the spinal cord innervate the fin, with most cells located in the hindbrain. The hindbrain somas are located in rhombomere seven/eight, laterally and dorsally displaced from the pectoral fin motor pool. The spinal cord somas are located in the most anterior part of the cord, aligned with myomere four. Single cell reconstructions were used to map afferent processes and compare the distributions of processes to soma locations. Reconstructions indicate that this sensory system breaks from the canonical somatotopic organization of sensory systems by lacking a clear organization with reference to fin region. Arborizations from a single cell branch widely over the skin, innervating the axial skin, lateral fin surface, and medial fin surface. The extensive branching over the fin and the surrounding axial surface suggests that these fin sensory neurons report on general conditions of the fin area rather than providing fine location specificity, as has been demonstrated in other vertebrate limbs. With neuron reconstructions that span the full primary afferent arborization from the soma to the peripheral cutaneous innervation, this neuroanatomical study describes a system of primary sensory neurons and lays the groundwork for future functional studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Detection of Cerebrovascular Loss in the Normal Aging C57BL/6 Mouse Brain Using in vivo Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microvascular rarefaction, or the decrease in vascular density, has been described in the cerebrovasculature of aging humans, rats, and, more recently, mice in the presence and absence of age-dependent diseases. Given the wide use of mice in modeling age-dependent human diseases of the cerebrovasculature, visualization, and quantification of the global murine cerebrovasculature is necessary for establishing the baseline changes that occur with aging. To provide in vivo whole-brain imaging of the cerebrovasculature in aging C57BL/6 mice longitudinally, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) was employed using a house-made gadolinium-bearing micellar blood pool agent. Enhancement in the vascular space permitted quantification of the detectable, or apparent, cerebral blood volume (aCBV), which was analyzed over 2 years of aging and compared to histological analysis of the cerebrovascular density. A significant loss in the aCBV was detected by CE-MRA over the aging period. Histological analysis via vessel-probing immunohistochemistry confirmed a significant loss in the cerebrovascular density over the same 2-year aging period, validating the CE-MRA findings. While these techniques use widely different methods of assessment and spatial resolutions, their comparable findings in detected vascular loss corroborate the growing body of literature describing vascular rarefaction aging. These findings suggest that such age-dependent changes can contribute to cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, which are modeled using wild-type and transgenic laboratory rodents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Timescales of motor memory formation in dual-adaptation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008373</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Marion Forano, David W. Franklin&lt;/p&gt;

The timescales of adaptation to novel dynamics are well explained by a dual-rate model with slow and fast states. This model can predict interference, savings and spontaneous recovery, but cannot account for adaptation to multiple tasks, as each new task drives unlearning of the previously learned task. Nevertheless, in the presence of appropriate contextual cues, humans are able to adapt simultaneously to opposing dynamics. Consequently this model was expanded, suggesting that dual-adaptation occurs through a single fast process and multiple slow processes. However, such a model does not predict spontaneous recovery within dual-adaptation. Here we assess the existence of multiple fast processes by examining the presence of spontaneous recovery in two experimental variations of an adaptation-de-adaptation-error-clamp paradigm within dual-task adaptation in humans. In both experiments, evidence for spontaneous recovery towards the initially learned dynamics (A) was found in the error-clamp phase, invalidating the one-fast-two-slow dual-rate model. However, as adaptation is not only constrained to two timescales, we fit twelve multi-rate models to the experimental data. BIC model comparison again supported the existence of two fast processes, but extended the timescales to include a third rate: the ultraslow process. Even within our single day experiment, we found little evidence for decay of the learned memory over several hundred error-clamp trials. Overall, we show that dual-adaptation can be best explained by a two-fast-triple-rate model over the timescales of adaptation studied here. Longer term learning may require even slower timescales, explaining why we never forget how to ride a bicycle.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bqhLxchpz0k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The development of increasingly sophisticated methods to acquire high-resolution images has led to the generation of large collections of biomedical imaging data, including images of tissues and organs. Many of the current machine learning methods that aim to extract biological knowledge from histopathological images require several data preprocessing stages, creating an overhead before the proper analysis. Here we present PyHIST (https://github.com/manuel-munoz-aguirre/PyHIST), an easy-to-use, open source whole slide histological image tissue segmentation and preprocessing command-line tool aimed at tile generation for machine learning applications. From a given input image, the PyHIST pipeline i) optionally rescales the image to a different resolution, ii) produces a mask for the input image which separates the background from the tissue, and iii) generates individual image tiles with tissue content.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/L_5MRMvBd20&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Predicting antimicrobial resistance using conserved genes</title>

A growing number of studies are using machine learning models to accurately predict antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypes from bacterial sequence data. Although these studies are showing promise, the models are typically trained using features derived from comprehensive sets of AMR genes or whole genome sequences and may not be suitable for use when genomes are incomplete. In this study, we explore the possibility of predicting AMR phenotypes using incomplete genome sequence data. Models were built from small sets of randomly-selected core genes after removing the AMR genes. For &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, we report that it is possible to classify susceptible and resistant phenotypes with average F1 scores ranging from 0.80–0.89 with as few as 100 conserved non-AMR genes, with very major error rates ranging from 0.11–0.23 and major error rates ranging from 0.10–0.20. Models built from core genes have predictive power in cases where the primary AMR mechanisms result from SNPs or horizontal gene transfer. By randomly sampling non-overlapping sets of core genes, we show that F1 scores and error rates are stable and have little variance between replicates. Although these small core gene models have lower accuracies and higher error rates than models built from the corresponding assembled genomes, the results suggest that sufficient variation exists in the core non-AMR genes of a species for predicting AMR phenotypes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xSeJuQXGTKo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Fibrillarin evolution through the Tree of Life: Comparative genomics and microsynteny network analyses provide new insights into the evolutionary history of Fibrillarin</title>

Fibrillarin (FIB), a methyltransferase essential for life in the vast majority of eukaryotes, is involved in methylation of rRNA required for proper ribosome assembly, as well as methylation of histone H2A of promoter regions of rRNA genes. RNA viral progression that affects both plants and animals requires FIB proteins. Despite the importance and high conservation of fibrillarins, there little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of this small gene family. We applied a phylogenomic microsynteny-network approach to elucidate the evolutionary history of FIB proteins across the Tree of Life. We identified 1063 non-redundant FIB sequences across 1049 completely sequenced genomes from Viruses, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. FIB is a highly conserved single-copy gene through Archaea and Eukarya lineages, except for plants, which have a gene family expansion due to paleopolyploidy and tandem duplications. We found a high conservation of the FIB genomic context during plant evolution. Surprisingly, FIB in mammals duplicated after the Eutheria split (e.g., ruminants, felines, primates) from therian mammals (e.g., marsupials) to form two main groups of sequences, the FIB and FIB-like groups. The FIB-like group transposed to another genomic context and remained syntenic in all the eutherian mammals. This transposition correlates with differences in the expression patterns of FIB-like proteins and with elevated Ks values potentially due to reduced evolutionary constraints of the duplicated copy. Our results point to a unique evolutionary event in mammals, between FIB and FIB-like genes, that led to non-redundant roles of the vital processes in which this protein is involved.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/80DABC-qKA8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: After the honeymoon, the divorce: Unexpected outcomes of disease control measures against endemic infections</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008292</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Brandon Hollingsworth, Kenichi W. Okamoto, Alun L. Lloyd&lt;/p&gt;

The lack of effective vaccines for many endemic diseases often forces policymakers to rely on non-immunizing control measures, such as vector control, to reduce the massive burden of these diseases. Controls can have well-known counterintuitive effects on endemic infections, including the honeymoon effect, in which partially effective controls cause not only a greater initial reduction in infection than expected, but also large outbreaks during control resulting from accumulation of susceptibles. Unfortunately, many control measures cannot be maintained indefinitely, and the results of cessation are poorly understood. Here, we examine the results of stopped or failed non-immunizing control measures in endemic settings. By using a mathematical model to compare the cumulative number of cases expected with and without control, we show that deployment of control can lead to a larger total number of infections, &lt;i&gt;counting from the time that control started&lt;/i&gt;, than without any control–the &lt;i&gt;divorce effect&lt;/i&gt;. This result is directly related to the population-level loss of immunity resulting from non-immunizing controls and is seen in a variety of models when non-immunizing controls are used against an infection that confers immunity. Finally, we examine three control plans for minimizing the magnitude of the divorce effect in seasonal infections and show that they are incapable of eliminating the divorce effect. While we do not suggest stopping control programs that rely on non-immunizing controls, our results strongly argue that the accumulation of susceptibility should be considered before deploying such controls against endemic infections when indefinite use of the control is unlikely. We highlight that our results are particularly germane to endemic mosquito-borne infections, such as dengue virus, both for routine management involving vector control and for field trials of novel control approaches, and in the context of non-pharmaceutical interventions aimed at COVID-19.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fRsPr52Xn3o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A user ready, well documented software package PyOIF contains an implementation of a robust validated computational model for cell flow modelling. The software is capable of simulating processes involving biological cells immersed in a fluid. The examples of such processes are flows in microfluidic channels with numerous applications such as cell sorting, rare cell isolation or flow fractionation. Besides the typical usage of such computational model in the design process of microfluidic devices, PyOIF has been used in the computer-aided discovery involving mechanical properties of cell membranes. With this software, single cell, many cell, as well as dense cell suspensions can be simulated. Many cell simulations include cell-cell interactions and analyse their effect on the cells. PyOIF can be used to test the influence of mechanical properties of the membrane in flows and in membrane-membrane interactions. Dense suspensions may be used to study the effect of cell volume fraction on macroscopic phenomena such as cell-free layer, apparent suspension viscosity or cell degradation. The PyOIF module is based on the official ESPResSo distribution with few modifications and is available under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence. PyOIF is based on Python objects representing the cells and on the C++ computational core for fluid and interaction dynamics. The source code is freely available at GitHub repository, runs natively under Linux and MacOS and can be used in Windows Subsystem for Linux. The communication among PyOIF users and developers is maintained using active mailing lists. This work provides a basic background to the underlying computational models and to the implementation of interactions within this framework. We provide the prospective PyOIF users with a practical example of simulation script with reference to our publicly available User Guide.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eafUYQgL8qA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

3D macromolecular structural data is growing ever more complex and plentiful in the wake of substantive advances in experimental and computational structure determination methods including macromolecular crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and integrative methods. Efficient means of working with 3D macromolecular structural data for archiving, analyses, and visualization are central to facilitating interoperability and reusability in compliance with the FAIR Principles. We address two challenges posed by growth in data size and complexity. First, data size is reduced by bespoke compression techniques. Second, complexity is managed through improved software tooling and fully leveraging available data dictionary schemas. To this end, we introduce BinaryCIF, a serialization of Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format files that maintains full compatibility to related data schemas, such as PDBx/mmCIF, while reducing file sizes by more than a factor of two versus gzip compressed CIF files. Moreover, for the largest structures, BinaryCIF provides even better compression—factor ten and four versus CIF files and gzipped CIF files, respectively. Herein, we describe CIFTools, a set of libraries in Java and TypeScript for generic and typed handling of CIF and BinaryCIF files. Together, BinaryCIF and CIFTools enable lightweight, efficient, and extensible handling of 3D macromolecular structural data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nJWZnGmXs_E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Intuitive physical reasoning about objects’ masses transfers to a visuomotor decision task consistent with Newtonian physics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007730</guid>

While interacting with objects during every-day activities, e.g. when sliding a glass on a counter top, people obtain constant feedback whether they are acting in accordance with physical laws. However, classical research on intuitive physics has revealed that people’s judgements systematically deviate from predictions of Newtonian physics. Recent research has explained at least some of these deviations not as consequence of misconceptions about physics but instead as the consequence of the probabilistic interaction between inevitable perceptual uncertainties and prior beliefs. How intuitive physical reasoning relates to visuomotor actions is much less known. Here, we present an experiment in which participants had to slide pucks under the influence of naturalistic friction in a simulated virtual environment. The puck was controlled by the duration of a button press, which needed to be scaled linearly with the puck’s mass and with the square-root of initial distance to reach a target. Over four phases of the experiment, uncertainties were manipulated by altering the availability of sensory feedback and providing different degrees of knowledge about the physical properties of pucks. A hierarchical Bayesian model of the visuomotor interaction task incorporating perceptual uncertainty and press-time variability found substantial evidence that subjects adjusted their button-presses so that the sliding was in accordance with Newtonian physics. After observing collisions between pucks, which were analyzed with a hierarchical Bayesian model of the perceptual observation task, subjects transferred the relative masses inferred perceptually to adjust subsequent sliding actions. Crucial in the modeling was the inclusion of a cost function, which quantitatively captures participants’ implicit sensitivity to errors due to their motor variability. Taken together, in the present experiment we find evidence that our participants transferred their intuitive physical reasoning to a subsequent visuomotor control task consistent with Newtonian physics and weighed potential outcomes with a cost functions based on their knowledge about their own variability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/l7qlWyakkm4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genetic diversity in offspring is induced by meiotic recombination, which is initiated between homologs at &amp;gt;200 sites originating from meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs). Of this initial pool, only 1–2 DSBs per homolog pair will be designated to form meiotic crossovers (COs), where reciprocal genetic exchange occurs between parental chromosomes. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) is known to localize to so-called “late recombination nodules” (LRNs) marking incipient CO sites. However, the role of CDK2 kinase activity in the process of CO formation remains uncertain. Here, we describe the phenotype of 2 &lt;i&gt;Cdk2&lt;/i&gt; point mutants with elevated or decreased activity, respectively. Elevated CDK2 activity was associated with increased numbers of LRN-associated proteins, including CDK2 itself and the MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) component of the MutLγ complex, but did not lead to increased numbers of COs. In contrast, reduced CDK2 activity leads to the complete absence of CO formation during meiotic prophase I. Our data suggest an important role for CDK2 in regulating MLH1 focus numbers and that the activity of this kinase is a key regulatory factor in the formation of meiotic COs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jud51SrdahU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;A comparison of cell density and serotonergic innervation of the amygdala among four macaque species&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/31585180-4cde-400d-ad7e-4ef557521b36/cne25048-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high degree of behavioral variation has been observed among macaque species. To investigate the neural basis of this variation, we used stereological methods to compare neural cell density and serotonin transporter‐immunoreactive axon density in the amygdala among four species that differ in social style. We hypothesized that significantly greater serotonergic innervation would be observed in the amygdala of the most socially tolerant species in our sample, the moor macaque. Instead, the pigtailed macaque, which is considered moderately tolerant, possessed significantly greater serotonergic innervation in the amygdala relative to Japanese and moor macaques. Our findings provide insight on the neural substrates of primate sociality from an evolutionary perspective.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genus &lt;i&gt;Macaca&lt;/i&gt; is an ideal model for investigating the biological basis of primate social behavior from an evolutionary perspective. A significant amount of behavioral diversity has been reported among the macaque species, but little is known about the neural substrates that support this variation. The present study compared neural cell density and serotonergic innervation of the amygdala among four macaque species using histological and immunohistochemical methods. The species examined included rhesus (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta)&lt;/i&gt;, Japanese (&lt;i&gt;M. fuscata)&lt;/i&gt;, pigtailed (&lt;i&gt;M. nemestrina)&lt;/i&gt;, and moor macaques (&lt;i&gt;M. maura)&lt;/i&gt;. We anticipated that the more aggressive rhesus and Japanese macaques would have lower serotonergic innervation within the amygdala compared to the more affiliative pigtailed and moor macaques. In contrast to our prediction, pigtailed macaques had higher serotonergic innervation than Japanese and moor macaques in the basal and central amygdala nuclei when controlling for neuron density. Our analysis of neural cell populations revealed that Japanese macaques possess significantly higher neuron and glia densities relative to the other three species, however we observed no glia‐to‐neuron ratio differences among species. The results of this study revealed serotonergic innervation and cell density differences among closely related macaque species, which may play a role in modulating subtle differences in emotional processing and species‐typical social styles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Modifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling in peripheral macrophages, using bone marrow cell replacement, reduces both macrophage and microglia inflammatory response, delays pathology and increases survival in ALS mouse models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/dk8ZQAHZweU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Repeated Restraint Stress Led to Cognitive Dysfunction by NMDA Receptor-Mediated Hippocampal CA3 Dendritic Spine Impairments in Juvenile Sprague-Dawley Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although numerous studies have indicated that chronic stress causes cognitive dysfunction with the impairment of synaptic structures and functions, the relationship between cognitive deficits induced by repeated restraint stress and the level of NMDA receptors in the subregion of the hippocampus has been relatively unknown until now. In this study, 3-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to repeated restraint stress for seven consecutive days, their cognitive functions were evaluated through behavioral tests, and then they were sacrificed for electrophysiological, morphological, and biochemical assays. Chronic repeated restraint stress led to cognitive and electrophysiological impairments, with a reduced density of dendritic spines. We also found that the protein level of NMDA receptors only increased in the hippocampal CA3 region. Nevertheless, repeated restraint stress-induced cognitive and synaptic dysfunction were effectively reversed by Ro25-6981, an inhibitor of the GluN2B receptor. These findings suggest that repeated restraint stress-induced synaptic and cognitive deficits are probably mediated through NMDA receptors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation-Induced Plasticity Mechanisms: TMS-Related Gene Expression and Morphology Changes in a Human Neuron-Like Cell Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.528396</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, used to alter cortical excitability both in research and clinical applications. The intermittent and continuous Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS and cTBS) protocols have been shown to induce opposite after-effects on human cortex excitability. Animal studies have implicated synaptic plasticity mechanisms long-term potentiation (LTP, for iTBS) and depression (LTD, for cTBS). However, the neural basis of TMS effects has not yet been studied in human neuronal cells, in particular at the level of gene expression and synaptogenesis. To investigate responses to TBS in living human neurons, we differentiated human SH-SY5Y cells toward a mature neural phenotype, and stimulated them with iTBS, cTBS, or sham (placebo) TBS. Changes in (a) mRNA expression of a set of target genes (previously associated with synaptic plasticity), and (b) morphological parameters of neurite outgrowth following TBS were quantified. We found no general effects of stimulation condition or time on gene expression, though we did observe a significantly enhanced expression of plasticity genes NTRK2 and MAPK9 24 h after iTBS as compared to sham TBS. This specific effect provides unique support for the widely assumed plasticity mechanisms underlying iTBS effects on human cortex excitability. In addition to this protocol-specific increase in plasticity gene expression 24 h after iTBS stimulation, we establish the feasibility of stimulating living human neuron with TBS, and the importance of moving to more complex human in vitro models to understand the underlying plasticity mechanisms of TBS stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by motor dysfunctions including bradykinesia, tremor at rest and motor instability. These symptoms are associated with the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons originating in the substantia nigra pars compacta and projecting to the corpus striatum, and by accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusions mainly consisting of aggregated alpha-synuclein, called Lewy bodies. PD is a complex, multifactorial disorder and its pathogenesis involves multiple pathways and mechanisms such as α-synuclein proteostasis, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, calcium homeostasis, axonal transport, and neuroinflammation. Motor symptoms manifest when there is already an extensive dopamine denervation. There is therefore an urgent need for early biomarkers to apply disease-modifying therapeutic strategies. Visual defects and retinal abnormalities, including decreased visual acuity, abnormal spatial contrast sensitivity, color vision defects, or deficits in more complex visual tasks are present in the majority of PD patients. They are being considered for early diagnosis together with retinal imaging techniques are being considered as non-invasive biomarkers for PD. Dopaminergic cells can be found in the retina in a subpopulation of amacrine cells; however, the molecular mechanisms leading to visual deficits observed in PD patients are still largely unknown. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the retinal abnormalities observed in PD patients and animal models and of the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in parkinsonian eyes. We will review the role of α-synuclein aggregates in the retina pathology and/or in the onset of visual symptoms in PD suggesting that α-synuclein aggregates are harmful for the retina as well as for the brain. Moreover, we will summarize experimental evidence suggesting that the optic nerve pathology observed in PD resembles that seen in mitochondrial optic neuropathies highlighting the possible involvement of mitochondrial abnormalities in the development of PD visual defects. We finally propose that the eye may be considered as a complementary experimental model to identify possible novel disease’ pathways or to test novel therapeutic approaches for PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This article provides an overview of the study protocol for the Teen Inflammation Glutamate Emotion Research (TIGER) project, a longitudinal study in which we plan to recruit 60 depressed adolescents (ages 13–18 years) and 30 psychiatrically healthy controls in order to examine the inflammatory and glutamatergic pathways that contribute to the recurrence of depression in adolescents. TIGER is the first study to examine the effects of peripheral inflammation on neurodevelopmental trajectories by assessing changes in cortical glutamate in depressed adolescents. Here, we describe the scientific rationale, design, and methods for the TIGER project. This article is intended to serve as an introduction to this project and to provide details for investigators who may be seeking to replicate or extend these methods for other related research endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Pancreatic Polypeptide but Not Other Members of the Neuropeptide Y Family Shows a Moderate Association With Perceived Anxiety in Obese Men</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578578</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuropeptide Y (NPY), peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) are important mediators in the bidirectional communication along the gut-brain-axis. Best known for their role in the regulation of appetite and food intake they are considered to play a crucial role in the development of obesity. Additionally, mounting evidence indicates a regulatory function in anxiety, mood and stress resilience with potential sex differences. In the present study, we examined the associations of NPY, PYY, and PP plasma levels with anxiety, depressiveness and perceived stress in obese patients. We analyzed 144 inpatients (90 female, 54 male, BMI mean: 49.4 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in a naturalistic treatment setting for obesity and its somatic and mental comorbidities. Fasting blood samples were taken, and patients completed psychometric self-assessment questionnaires (GAD-7, PHQ-9, PSQ-20) within the first week after admission and before discharge. Plasma concentrations of the peptides were measured by ELISA. Women showed significant higher anxiety (GAD-7: 8.13 ± 5.67 vs. 5.93 ± 5.42, p = 0.04) and stress scores (PSQ-20: 52.62 ± 23.5 vs. 41.23 ± 22.53, p = 0.01) than men. In the longitudinal analysis women with a clinically relevant improvement of anxiety (≥ 5 points on GAD-7, p &amp;lt; 0.001) also showed significant improvements in depression (PHQ-9: 38%, p = 0.002) and PSQ-20 scores (23%, p = 0.005) while anxiety-improved male patients only improved in the subscale tension of the PSQ-20 (34%, p = 0.02). In men we observed a positive correlation of PP with anxiety scores (GAD-7: r = 0.41, p = 0.007) and with age (r = 0.49, p = 0.001) on admission while NPY negatively correlated with age (r = -0.38, p = 0.01). In contrast, there were no significant associations (p &amp;gt; 0.05) in female subjects in the cross-sectional as well as in the longitudinal analysis. In conclusion, women suffering from morbid obesity showed greater psychological comorbidity and considerable interactions among them. Despite that we solely observed associations of PP with anxiety and age with NPY and PP in men, suggesting a possible influence of sex hormones on the NPY system. However, improvement of anxiety scores did not lead to significant changes in NPY.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Synchronization, Stochasticity, and Phase Waves in Neuronal Networks With Spatially-Structured Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.569644</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Oscillations in the beta/low gamma range (10–45 Hz) are recorded in diverse neural structures. They have successfully been modeled as sparsely synchronized oscillations arising from reciprocal interactions between randomly connected excitatory (E) pyramidal cells and local interneurons (I). The synchronization of spatially distant oscillatory spiking E–I modules has been well-studied in the rate model framework but less so for modules of spiking neurons. Here, we first show that previously proposed modifications of rate models provide a quantitative description of spiking E–I modules of Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (EIF) neurons. This allows us to analyze the dynamical regimes of sparsely synchronized oscillatory E–I modules connected by long-range excitatory interactions, for two modules, as well as for a chain of such modules. For modules with a large number of neurons (&amp;gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;), we obtain results similar to previously obtained ones based on the classic deterministic Wilson-Cowan rate model, with the added bonus that the results quantitatively describe simulations of spiking EIF neurons. However, for modules with a moderate (~ 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) number of neurons, stochastic variations in the spike emission of neurons are important and need to be taken into account. On the one hand, they modify the oscillations in a way that tends to promote synchronization between different modules. On the other hand, independent fluctuations on different modules tend to disrupt synchronization. The correlations between distant oscillatory modules can be described by stochastic equations for the oscillator phases that have been intensely studied in other contexts. On shorter distances, we develop a description that also takes into account amplitude modes and that quantitatively accounts for our simulation data. Stochastic dephasing of neighboring modules produces transient phase gradients and the transient appearance of phase waves. We propose that these stochastically-induced phase waves provide an explanative framework for the observations of traveling waves in the cortex during beta oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Molecular Motor KIF3B Acts as a Key Regulator of Dendritic Architecture in Cortical Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.521199</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons require a well-coordinated intercellular transport system to maintain their normal cellular function and morphology. The kinesin family of proteins (KIFs) fills this role by regulating the transport of a diverse array of cargos in post-mitotic cells. On the other hand, in mitotic cells, KIFs facilitate the fidelity of the cellular division machinery. Though certain mitotic KIFs function in post-mitotic neurons, little is known about them. We studied the role of a mitotic KIF (KIF3B) in neuronal architecture. We find that the RNAi mediated knockdown of KIF3B in primary cortical neurons resulted in an increase in spine density; the number of thin and mushroom spines; and dendritic branching. Consistent with the change in spine density, we observed a specific increase in the distribution of the excitatory post-synaptic protein, PSD-95 in KIF3B knockdown neurons. Interestingly, overexpression of KIF3B produced a reduction in spine density, in particular mushroom spines, and a decrease in dendritic branching. These studies suggest that KIF3B is a key determinant of cortical neuron morphology and that it functions as an inhibitory constraint on structural plasticity, further illuminating the significance of mitotic KIFs in post-mitotic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Mapping Central Projection of Oxytocin Neurons in Unmated Mice Using Cre and Alkaline Phosphatase Reporter</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin, a neuropeptide and peptide hormone, is produced by neurons in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary to control breastfeeding and labor. Recent studies have revealed that oxytocin in the central nervous system is also involved in modulating social interaction. To understand the potential role and innervation pattern of oxytocin neurons before sexual interaction, here we used transgenic mice which have the Cre recombinase under the control of an endogenous oxytocin promoter and Cre-dependent human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) reporter to label the oxytocin neurons in the naive mouse brain. Since AP is located on the membrane of oxytocin neurons, AP histochemistry staining enabled us to observe the fine axonal terminals and the innervation pattern of oxytocin neurons in the thick serial coronal brain slices. Here we show that the number of AP-labeled cells varies with staining reaction time and ranges from 30% of the oxytocin immune-positive cell count to slightly higher than the oxytocin immune-positive cell count. Using AP staining with extended reaction time, which may not label all oxytocin neurons, we confirmed many innervation targets of oxytocin neurons from the anterior olfactory nucleus, some cortex regions, the limbic system, the hypothalamus, and the hindbrain, while the cell bodies were exclusively located in the hypothalamus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Finally, we observe some individual variance at the olfactory area, isocortex, striatum, paraventricular nucleus of thalamus, locus coeruleus, and Barrington’s nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mouse is the most important animal model within neuroscientific research, a position strengthened by the wide-spread use of transgenic mouse models. Discoveries in animals are followed by corroboration in humans, and the interchange between these fields of research is essential to our understanding of the human brain. With the advent of advanced technologies such as single-cell transcriptomics, epigenetic profiling and diffusion MRI, many prominent research institutes and collaborations have emerged, aiming to construct complete human or mouse brain atlases with data on gene expression, connectivity and cell types. These initiatives are indispensable resources, but frequently require extensive, time-consuming development, and rely on updates by the provider. They often come in the shape of applications which require practice or prior technical know-how. Importantly, none of them place the human and the mouse brain next to each other to allow for immediate comparison. We present BrainWiki, a user-friendly, web-based atlas that links the human and the mouse brain together, side-by-side. The platform gives the user a simple overview of brain anatomy along with published articles relating to each brain region that allows the user to delve deeper into the current state of research concerning circuitry, brain functions and pathology. The website relies on interactivity and supports user contributions resulting in a dynamic website that evolves at the pace of neuroscience. It is designed to allow for constant updates and new features in the future which will contain data such as gene expression and neuronal cell types.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Large-Scale Convergence of Receptor Cell Arrays Onto Afferent Terminal Arbors in the Lorenzinian Electroreceptors of Polyodon</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00050</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Certain sensory receptors contain many transducers, converging onto few afferents. Convergence creates star-topology neural networks, of iterative parallel organization, that may yield special functional properties. We quantitated large-scale convergence in electroreceptors on the rostrum of preadult paddlefish, Polyodon spathula (Acipenseriforme vertebrates), and analyzed the afferent terminal branching underlying the convergence. From neurophysiological mapping, a recorded afferent innervated 23.3 ± 9.1 (range 6–45) ampullary organs, and innervated every ampullary organ within the receptive field’s sharp boundary. Ampullary organs each contained ∼665 Lorenzinian receptor cells, from imaging and modeling. We imaged three serial types of afferent branching at electroreceptors, after immunofluorescent labeling for neurite filaments, glial sheaths, or nodal ion channels, or by DiI tracing. (i) Myelinated tree: Each of 3.08 ± 0.51 (2–4) parallel afferents from a cranial nerve (ALLn) entered a receptive field from deeper tissue, then branched into a laminar tree of large myelinated dendrites, parallel to the skin, that branched radially until ∼9 extremities with heminodes, which were candidate sites of spike encoders. (ii) Inline transition: Each myelinated extremity led distally into local unmyelinated arbors originating at inline branching structures covered by terminal (satellite) glia. The unmyelinated transition zones included globular afferent modules, 4–6 microns wide, from which erupted fine fascicles of parallel submicron neurites, a possibly novel type of neuronal branching. The neurite fascicles formed loose bundles projecting ∼105 microns distally to innervate local groups of ∼3 adjacent ampullary organs. (iii) Radial arbors: Receptor cells in an electrosensory neuroepithelium covering the basal pole of each ampullary organ were innervated by bouton endings of radial neurites, unmyelinated and submicron, forming a thin curviplanar lamina distal to the lectin+ basal lamina. The profuse radial neurites diverged from thicker (∼2 micron) basolateral trunks. Overall, an average Polyodon electroreceptor formed a star topology array of ∼9 sensor groups. Total convergence ratios were 15,495 ± 6,052 parallel receptor cells per afferent per mean receptive field, assuming 100% innervation. Large-scale convergence likely increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of stimulus encoding into spiking afferent output, increasing receiver sensitivity. Unmyelinated arbors may also regenerate and repair the afferent innervation of ampullary organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LSID:urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:09BCF04C-3C3C-4B6C-9DC9-A2BF43087369&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is a major public health problem worldwide with a high burden of neurological disability and mortality. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have attracted much attention in the past decades because of their newly discovered roles in pathophysiological processes in many diseases. The abundance of lncRNAs in the nervous system indicates that they may be part of a complex regulatory network governing physiology and pathology of the brain. In particular, lncRNAs have been shown to play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of stroke. In this article, we provide a review of the multifaceted functions of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage, highlighting their promising use as stroke diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutics. To this end, we discuss the potential of stem cells in aiding lncRNA applications in stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Effects of Nordic Walking With Poles With an Integrated Resistance Shock Absorber on Cognitive Abilities and Cardiopulmonary Efficiency in Postmenopausal Women</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Late adulthood is associated with atrophy of brain areas, which contribute to cognitive deterioration and increase the risk of depression. On the other hand, aerobic exercise can improve learning and memory function, ameliorate mood, and prevent neurodegenerative changes. This study demonstrates the effect of Nordic walking (NW) and NW with poles with an integrated resistance shock absorber (NW with RSA) on aerobic capacity and body composition in postmenopausal women. It also measures the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) serum levels and determines correlations with cognitive functions and depression symptoms. These relationships with the use of NW with RSA as a new form of exercise have not been described thus far. In this study, 31 women (NW – 16, NW with RSA – 15) participated in eight weeks of training. The findings showed that only NW with RSA training caused a significant decrease in body mass and body mass index (p &amp;lt; 0.05). There were no significant changes in GDNF levels between groups studied. Regarding BDNF, a significant decrease (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in the NW group and an increase (not statistically significant) in the NW with RSA group was found. A comparative analysis of cognitive and depression outcomes and changes in BDNF and GDNF concentration showed no significant differences in the efficacy of either form of training. Training loads resulted in a significant increase in VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max in both the NW (p &amp;lt; 0.01) and NW with RSA (p &amp;lt; 0.05) groups. This indicates an improvement in cardiopulmonary efficiency of the examined women.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Reliability of P3 Event-Related Potential During Working Memory Across the Spectrum of Cognitive Aging</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Event-related potentials (ERPs) offer unparalleled temporal resolution in tracing distinct electrophysiological processes related to normal and pathological cognitive aging. The stability of ERPs in older individuals with a vast range of cognitive ability has not been established. In this test-retest reliability study, 39 older individuals (age 74.10 (5.4) years; 23 (59%) women; 15 non β-amyloid elevated, 16 β-amyloid elevated, 8 cognitively impaired) with scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) ranging between 3 and 30 completed a working memory (n-back) test with three levels of difficulty at baseline and 2-week follow-up. The main aim was to evaluate stability of the ERP on grand averaged task effects for both visits in the total sample (n = 39). Secondary aims were to evaluate the effect of age, group (non β-amyloid elevated; β-amyloid elevated, cognitively impaired), cognitive status (MOCA), and task difficulty on ERP reliability. P3 peak amplitude and latency were measured in predetermined channels. P3 peak amplitude at Fz, our main outcome variable, showed excellent reliability in 0-back (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), 95% confidence interval = 0.82 (0.67–0.90) and 1-back (ICC = 0.87 (0.76–0.93), however, only fair reliability in 2-back (ICC = 0.53 (0.09–0.75). Reliability of P3 peak latencies was substantially lower, with ICCs ranging between 0.17 for 2-back and 0.54 for 0-back. Generalized linear mixed models showed no confounding effect of age, group, or task difficulty on stability of P3 amplitude and latency of Fz. By contrast, MOCA scores tended to negatively correlate with P3 amplitude of Fz (p = 0.07). We conclude that P3 peak amplitude, and to lesser extent P3 peak latency, provide a stable measure of electrophysiological processes in older individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Learning about rewards and punishments is critical for survival. Classical studies have demonstrated an impressive correspondence between the firing of dopamine neurons in the mammalian midbrain and the reward prediction errors of reinforcement learning algorithms, which express the difference between actual reward and predicted mean reward. However, it may be advantageous to learn not only the mean but also the complete distribution of potential rewards. Recent advances in machine learning have revealed a biologically plausible set of algorithms for reconstructing this reward distribution from experience.</description>

	<description>Kar and DiCarlo show that reversibly inactivating parts of macaque vlPFC results in selective object recognition deficits for specific images that most likely depend on recurrent computations. Their results implicate vlPFC, a recurrently connected circuit node, as critical to producing behaviorally sufficient object representations in the primate ventral visual stream.</description>
