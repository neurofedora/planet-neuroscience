	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: GSplit LBI: Taming the Procedural Bias in Neuroimaging for Disease Prediction. (arXiv:1705.09249v1 [stat.AP])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09249</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09249</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In voxel-based neuroimage analysis, lesion features have been the main focus
in disease prediction due to their interpretability with respect to the related
diseases. However, we observe that there exists another type of features
introduced during the preprocessing steps and we call them &quot;\textbf{Procedural
Bias}&quot;. Besides, such bias can be leveraged to improve classification accuracy.
Nevertheless, most existing models suffer from either under-fit without
considering procedural bias or poor interpretability without differentiating
such bias from lesion ones. In this paper, a novel dual-task algorithm namely
\emph{GSplit LBI} is proposed to resolve this problem. By introducing an
augmented variable enforced to be structural sparsity with a variable splitting
term, the estimators for prediction and selecting lesion features can be
optimized separately and mutually monitored by each other following an
iterative scheme. Empirical experiments have been evaluated on the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative\thinspace(ADNI) database. The advantage of
proposed model is verified by improved stability of selected lesion features
and better classification results.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Firing rate equations require a spike synchrony mechanism to correctly describe fast oscillations in inhibitory networks. (arXiv:1705.09205v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09205</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09205</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recurrently coupled networks of inhibitory neurons robustly generate
oscillations in the gamma band. Nonetheless, the corresponding Wilson-Cowan
type firing rate equation for such an inhibitory population does not generate
such oscillations without an explicit time delay. We show that this discrepancy
is due to a voltage-dependent spike-synchronization mechanism inherent in
networks of spiking neurons which is not captured by standard firing rate
equations. Here we investigate an exact low-dimensional description for a
network of heterogeneous canonical type-I inhibitory neurons which includes the
sub-threshold dynamics crucial for generating synchronous states. In the limit
of slow synaptic kinetics the spike-synchrony mechanism is suppressed and the
standard Wilson-Cowan equations are formally recovered as long as external
inputs are also slow. However, even in this limit synchronous spiking can be
elicited by inputs which fluctuate on a time-scale of the membrane
time-constant of the neurons. Our meanfield equations therefore represent an
extension of the standard Wilson-Cowan equations in which spike synchrony is
also correctly described.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The 'free energy principle' (FEP) has been suggested to provide a unified
theory of the brain, integrating data and theory relating to action,
perception, and learning. The theory and implementation of the FEP combines
insights from Helmholtzian 'perception as inference', machine learning theory,
and statistical thermodynamics. Here, we provide a detailed mathematical
evaluation of a suggested biologically plausible implementation of the FEP that
has been widely used to develop the theory. Our objectives are (i) to describe
within a single article the mathematical structure of this implementation of
the FEP; (ii) provide a simple but complete agent-based model utilising the
FEP; (iii) disclose the assumption structure of this implementation of the FEP
to help elucidate its significance for the brain sciences.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently regained popularity, with major
achievements such as beating the European game of Go champion. Here, for the
first time, we show that RL can be used efficiently to train a spiking neural
network (SNN) to perform object recognition in natural images without using an
external classifier. We used a feedforward convolutional SNN and a temporal
coding scheme where the most strongly activated neurons fire first, while less
activated ones fire later, or not at all. In the highest layers, each neuron
was assigned to an object category, and it was assumed that the stimulus
category was the category of the first neuron to fire. If this assumption was
correct, the neuron was rewarded, i.e. spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)
was applied, which reinforced the neuron's selectivity. Otherwise, anti-STDP
was applied, which encouraged the neuron to learn something else. As
demonstrated on various image datasets (Caltech, ETH-80, and NORB), this reward
modulated STDP (R-STDP) approach extracted particularly discriminative visual
features, whereas classic unsupervised STDP extracts any feature that
consistently repeats. As a result, R-STDP outperformed STDP on these datasets.
Furthermore, R-STDP is suitable for online learning, and can adapt to drastic
changes such as label permutations. Finally, it is worth mentioning that both
feature extraction and classification were done with spikes, using at most one
spike per neuron. Thus the network is hardware friendly and energy efficient.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Computational neuroscience models have been used for understanding neural
dynamics in the brain and how they may be altered when physiological or other
conditions change. We review and develop a data-driven approach to neuroimaging
data called the energy landscape analysis. The methods are rooted in
statistical physics theory, in particular the Ising model, also known as the
(pairwise) maximum entropy model and Boltzmann machine. The methods have been
applied to fitting electrophysiological data in neuroscience for a decade, but
their use in neuroimaging data is still in its infancy. We first review the
methods and discuss some algorithms and technical aspects. Then, we apply the
methods to functional magnetic resonance imaging data recorded from healthy
individuals to inspect the relationship between the accuracy of fitting, the
size of the brain system to be analyzed, and the data length.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/142679v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Mutations in the Golgi SNARE protein Membrin (encoded by the GOSR2 gene) cause progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME). Membrin is a ubiquitously important protein mediating ER-to-Golgi membrane fusion, and hence it is unclear how these mutations result in a disorder restricted to the nervous system. Here we use a multi-layered strategy to elucidate the consequences of Membrin mutations from protein to neuron. We show that the pathogenic mutations cause partial reductions in SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, these alterations were sufficient to profoundly impair dendritic growth in novel Drosophila models of GOSR2-PME. We also observed axonal trafficking abnormalities in this model, as well as synaptic malformations, trans-synaptic instability and hyperactive synaptic transmission. Our study highlights how dendritic growth is vulnerable even to subtle secretory pathway deficits, uncovers a previously uncharacterized role for Membrin in synaptic function, and provides a comprehensive explanatory basis for genotype-phenotype relationships in GOSR2-PME.</description>

	<description>Natural environments convey information through multiple sensory modalities, all of which contribute to our percepts. Although it has been shown that neural representations of visual content can be decoded from the visual cortex, it remains unclear where and how humans represent perceptual information at a conceptual level, not limited to a specific sensory modality. To address this question, we investigated how categories of scene images and sounds are represented in several brain regions. We found that both visual and auditory scene categories can be decoded not only from modality-specific areas, but also from several brain regions in the temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortex. Intriguingly, only in the prefrontal cortex, but not in any other regions, categories of scene images and sounds appear to be represented in similar activation patterns, suggesting that scene representations in prefrontal cortex are modality-independent. Furthermore, the error patterns of neural decoders indicate that the category-specific neural activity patterns in the middle and superior frontal gyri are tightly linked to categorization behavior. Our findings suggest that complex visual information is represented at a conceptual level in prefrontal cortex, regardless of the sensory modality of the stimulus.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Extensive Tonotopic Mapping Across Auditory Cortex Is Recapitulated By Spectrally-Directed Attention, And Systematically Related To Cortical Myeloarchitecture</title>

	<description>Auditory selective attention is vital in natural soundscapes. But, it is unclear how attentional focus on the primary dimension of auditory representation - acoustic frequency - might modulate basic auditory functional topography during active listening. In contrast to visual selective attention, which is supported by motor-mediated optimization of input across saccades and pupil dilation, the primate auditory system has fewer means of differentially sampling the world. This makes spectrally-directed endogenous attention a particularly crucial aspect of auditory attention. Using a novel functional paradigm combined with quantitative MRI, we establish that human frequency-band-selective attention drives activation in both myeloarchitectonically-estimated auditory core, and across the majority of tonotopically-mapped non-primary auditory cortex. The attentionally-driven best-frequency maps show strong concordance with sensory-driven maps in the same subjects across much of the temporal plane, with poor concordance in non-auditory areas. There is significantly greater activation across most of auditory cortex when best frequency is attended, versus ignored. Moreover, the single frequency bands that evoke the least activation and the frequency bands that elicit the least activation when attention is directed to them also correspond closely. Finally, the results demonstrate that there is spatial correspondence between the degree of myelination and the strength of the tonotopic signal across a number of regions in auditory cortex. Strong frequency preferences across tonotopically-mapped auditory cortex spatially correlate with R1-estimated myeloarchitecture, indicating shared functional and anatomical organization that may underlie intrinsic auditory regionalization.</description>

However, it remains unclear how ZIKV gains access to the highly vulnerable population of neural progenitors of the fetal central nervous system (CNS), and which cell types of the CNS may serve as viral reservoirs. To model viral interaction with cells of the fetal CNS in vitro, we investigated the tropism of ZIKV for different iPS-derived human cells, with a particular focus on microglia-like cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells. We show that ZIKV infected isogenic neural progenitors, astrocytes and microglia-like cells, but was only cytotoxic to neural progenitors. Infected glial cells propagated the virus and maintained viral load over time, leading to viral spread to susceptible cells. ZIKV-infected microglia, when co-cultured with pre-established neural spheroids, invaded the tissue and initiated neural infection. Since microglia derive from primitive macrophages originating in anatomical proximity to the maternal vasculature of the placenta, we propose that they may act in vivo as a viral reservoir for ZIKV and, owing to their natural ability to traverse the embryo, can establish infection of the fetal brain. Infection of immature neural stem cells by invading microglia may occur in the early stages of pregnancy, before vascular circulation is established. Our data are also consistent with the virus affecting the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which may allow infection of the brain at later stages.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Oxygen-sensing neurons reciprocally regulate peripheral lipid metabolism via neuropeptide signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>

	<description>The mechanisms by which the sensory environment instructs metabolic homeostasis remains poorly understood. In this report, we show that oxygen, a potent environmental signal, is an important regulator of whole body lipid metabolism. C. elegans oxygen-sensing neurons reciprocally regulate peripheral lipid metabolism under normoxia in the following way: under high oxygen and food absence, URX sensory neurons are activated, and stimulate fat loss in the intestine, the major metabolic organ for C. elegans. Under lower oxygen conditions or when food is present, the BAG sensory neurons respond by repressing the resting properties of the URX neurons. A genetic screen to identify modulators of this effect led to the identification of a BAG-neuron-specific neuropeptide called FLP-17, whose cognate receptor EGL-6 functions in URX neurons. Thus, BAG sensory neurons counterbalance the metabolic effect of tonically active URX neurons via neuropeptide communication. The combined regulatory actions of these neurons serve to precisely tune the rate and extent of fat loss, to the availability of food and oxygen.</description>

Differential expression analysis is one of the most common types of analyses performed on various biological data (e.g. RNA-seq or mass spectrometry proteomics). It is the process that detects features, such as genes or proteins, showing statistically significant differences between the sample groups under comparison. A major challenge in the analysis is the choice of an appropriate test statistic, as different statistics have been shown to perform well in different datasets. To this end, the reproducibility-optimized test statistic (ROTS) adjusts a modified &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-statistic according to the inherent properties of the data and provides a ranking of the features based on their statistical evidence for differential expression between two groups. ROTS has already been successfully applied in a range of different studies from transcriptomics to proteomics, showing competitive performance against other state-of-the-art methods. To promote its widespread use, we introduce here a Bioconductor R package for performing ROTS analysis conveniently on different types of omics data. To illustrate the benefits of ROTS in various applications, we present three case studies, involving proteomics and RNA-seq data from public repositories, including both bulk and single cell data. The package is freely available from Bioconductor (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/ROTS).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DYXIcc0UsEg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Networks are a way to represent interactions among one (e.g., social networks) or more (e.g., plant-pollinator networks) classes of nodes. The ability to predict likely, but unobserved, interactions has generated a great deal of interest, and is sometimes referred to as the &lt;i&gt;link prediction problem&lt;/i&gt;. However, most studies of link prediction have focused on social networks, and have assumed a completely censused network. In biological networks, it is unlikely that all interactions are censused, and ignoring incomplete detection of interactions may lead to biased or incorrect conclusions. Previous attempts to predict network interactions have relied on known properties of network structure, making the approach sensitive to observation errors. This is an obvious shortcoming, as networks are dynamic, and sometimes not well sampled, leading to incomplete detection of links. Here, we develop an algorithm to predict missing links based on conditional probability estimation and associated, node-level features. We validate this algorithm on simulated data, and then apply it to a desert small mammal host-parasite network. Our approach achieves high accuracy on simulated and observed data, providing a simple method to accurately predict missing links in networks without relying on prior knowledge about network structure.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BWP9hhpjUqo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: An agent-based model of leukocyte transendothelial migration during atherogenesis</title>

A vast amount of work has been dedicated to the effects of hemodynamics and cytokines on leukocyte adhesion and trans-endothelial migration (TEM) and subsequent accumulation of leukocyte-derived foam cells in the artery wall. However, a comprehensive mechanobiological model to capture these spatiotemporal events and predict the growth and remodeling of an atherosclerotic artery is still lacking. Here, we present a multiscale model of leukocyte TEM and plaque evolution in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. The approach integrates cellular behaviors via agent-based modeling (ABM) and hemodynamic effects via computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In this computational framework, the ABM implements the diffusion kinetics of key biological proteins, namely Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), Tissue Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α), Interlukin-10 (IL-10) and Interlukin-1 beta (IL-1β), to predict chemotactic driven leukocyte migration into and within the artery wall. The ABM also considers wall shear stress (WSS) dependent leukocyte TEM and compensatory arterial remodeling obeying Glagov’s phenomenon. Interestingly, using fully developed steady blood flow does not result in a representative number of leukocyte TEM as compared to pulsatile flow, whereas passing WSS at peak systole of the pulsatile flow waveform does. Moreover, using the model, we have found leukocyte TEM increases monotonically with decreases in luminal volume. At critical plaque shapes the WSS changes rapidly resulting in sudden increases in leukocyte TEM suggesting lumen volumes that will give rise to rapid plaque growth rates if left untreated. Overall this multi-scale and multi-physics approach appropriately captures and integrates the spatiotemporal events occurring at the cellular level in order to predict leukocyte transmigration and plaque evolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XrRy6p2WmJs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

What does it take to convert a heap of sequencing data into a publishable result? First, common tools are employed to reduce primary data (sequencing reads) to a form suitable for further analyses (i.e., the list of variable sites). The subsequent exploratory stage is much more ad hoc and requires the development of custom scripts and pipelines, making it problematic for biomedical researchers. Here, we describe a hybrid platform combining common analysis pathways with the ability to explore data interactively. It aims to fully encompass and simplify the &quot;raw data-to-publication&quot; pathway and make it reproducible.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kOnvMgs1_PQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Short and random: Modelling the effects of (proto-)neural elongations. (arXiv:1705.08756v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To understand how neurons and nervous systems first evolved, we need an
account of the origins of neural elongations: Why did neural elongations (axons
and dendrites) first originate, such that they could become the central
component of both neurons and nervous systems? Two contrasting conceptual
accounts provide different answers to this question. Braitenberg's vehicles
provide the iconic illustration of the dominant input-output (IO) view. Here
the basic role of neural elongations is to connect sensors to effectors, both
situated at different positions within the body. For this function, neural
elongations are thought of as comparatively long and specific connections,
which require an articulated body involving substantial developmental processes
to build. Internal coordination (IC) models stress a different function for
early nervous systems. Here the coordination of activity across extended parts
of a multicellular body is held central, in particular for the contractions of
(muscle) tissue. An IC perspective allows the hypothesis that the earliest
proto-neural elongations could have been functional even when they were
initially simple short and random connections, as long as they enhanced the
patterning of contractile activity across a multicellular surface. The present
computational study provides a proof of concept that such short and random
neural elongations can play this role. While an excitable epithelium can
generate basic forms of patterning for small body-configurations, adding
elongations allows such patterning to scale up to larger bodies. This result
supports a new, more gradual evolutionary route towards the origins of the very
first full neurons and nervous systems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Experience of time is one of the primordial human experiences which is deeply
tied to human consciousness. But despite this intimate relation of time with
human conscious experience, time has proved to be very elusive. Particularly in
physics, though there is already some understanding of time, there are still so
many paradoxes that plague this understanding. In this paper we take rather a
different route to question of time. We first attempt to come up with a
theoretical understanding of time perception. Quite interestingly we find that
quantum theory provides an algebraic formulation within which we can understand
some essential aspects of time perception by human mind. We then ask whether a
similar formalism can furnish the understanding of time as well and find
connections of our formulation of time with similar works by other researchers.
Our underlying approach to question of time has been inspired by R. W. Hamilton
who considers algebra as science of pure time. Hence our work has an extensive
algebraic flavor. Our work also incorporates another approach based on
Kauffman's iterant algebra which relates time to underlying recursions and
oscillations. We believe that our work will initiate more investigations in
this direction.

	<description>The hippocampus plays a critical role in supporting spatial and episodic memory. Mechanistic models predict that the hippocampal subfields have computational specializations that support memory in different ways. However, there is little empirical evidence to suggest substantial differences between the subfields, particularly in humans. To clarify how hippocampal subfields support human spatial and episodic memory, we used multivariate analyses of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a novel virtual reality paradigm. Multi-voxel pattern similarity analyses revealed that CA1 represented items that shared an episodic context as more similar than those from different episodic contexts. CA23DG showed the opposite pattern, leading to a subfield-by-condition interaction. The complementary characteristics of these subfields explain how we can parse our experiences into cohesive episodes while retaining the specific details that support vivid recollection.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Connecting Brain Responsivity And Real-World Risk Taking: Strengths And Limitations Of Current Methodological Approaches</title>

	<description>In line with the goal of limiting health risk behaviors in adolescence, a growing literature investigates whether individual differences in functional brain responses can be related to vulnerability to engage in risky decision-making. We review this body of work, investigate when and in what way findings converge, and provide best practice recommendations. We identified 23 studies that examined individual differences in brain responsivity and adolescent risk taking. Findings varied widely in terms of the neural regions identified as relating to risky behavior. This heterogeneity is likely due to the abundance of approaches used to assess risk taking, and to the disparity of fMRI tasks. Indeed, brain-behavior correlations were typically found in regions showing a main effect of task. However, results from a test of publication bias suggested that region of interest approaches lacked evidential value. The findings suggest that neural factors differentiating riskier teens are not localized to a single region. Therefore, approaches that utilize data from the entire brain, particularly in predictive analyses, may yield more reliable and applicable results. We discuss several decision points that researchers should consider when designing a study, and emphasize the importance of precise research questions that move beyond a general desire to address adolescent risk taking.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Native KCC2 Interactome Reveals PACSIN1 As A Critical Regulator Of Synaptic Inhibition</title>

	<description>KCC2 is a neuron-specific K+-Cl- cotransporter essential for establishing the Cl- gradient required for hyperpolarizing inhibition. KCC2 is highly localized to excitatory synapses where it regulates spine morphogenesis and AMPA receptor confinement. Aberrant KCC2 function contributes to numerous human neurological disorders including epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Using unbiased functional proteomics, we identified the KCC2-interactome in the mouse brain to determine KCC2-protein interactions that regulate KCC2 function. Our analysis revealed that KCC2 interacts with a diverse set of proteins, and its most predominant interactors play important roles in postsynaptic receptor recycling. The most abundant KCC2 interactor is a neuronal endocytic regulatory protein termed PACSIN1 (SYNDAPIN1). We verified the PACSIN1-KCC2 interaction biochemically and demonstrated that shRNA knockdown of PACSIN1 in hippocampal neurons significantly increases KCC2 expression and hyperpolarizes the reversal potential for Cl-. Overall, our global native-KCC2 interactome and subsequent characterization revealed PACSIN1 as a novel and potent negative regulator of KCC2.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Olfactory Receptors Are Required For Social Behavior And Neural Plasticity In Ants, As Evidenced By CRISPR-Mediated Gene Knockout</title>

	<description>The chemosensory system is key to establishing and maintaining social structure in eusocial insects. Ants exhibit cooperative colonial behaviors reflective of an advanced form of sociality with an extensive dependency on communication. Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) serve as pheromones and cues that regulate multiple aspects of social interactions and behaviors in ants. The perception of CHCs entails odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) that express specific odorant receptors (ORs) encoded by a dramatically expanded Or gene family in ants. Until recently, studies of the biological functions of ORs in eusocial insects were stymied by the lack of genetic tools. In most eusocial insect species, only one or a few queens in a colony can transmit the genetic information to their progeny. In contrast, any worker in the ant Harpegnathos saltator can be converted into a gamergate (pseudo-queen), and used as a foundress to engender an entire new colony and be crossed for genetic experiments. This feature facilitated CRISPR-Cas9 gene targeting to generate a germline mutation in the orco gene that encodes the obligate co-receptor whose mutation should significantly impact ant olfaction. Our results show that Orco exhibits a conserved role in the perception of general odorants but also a role in reproductive physiology and social behavior plasticity in ants. Surprisingly, and in contrast to other insect systems, the loss of OR functionality also dramatically reduces the development of the ant antennal lobe where ORNs project. Taken together, these findings open the possibility of studying the genetics of eusociality and provide inroads towards understanding the function of the expanded ORs family in eusocial insects in regulating caste determination, social communication and neuronal plasticity.</description>

	<description>During the last few years, rich-club (RC) organization has been studied as a possible brain-connectivity organization model for large-scale brain networks. At the same time, empirical and simulated data of neurophysiological models have demonstrated the significant role of intra-frequency and inter-frequency coupling among distinct brain areas. The current study investigates further the importance of these couplings using recordings of resting-state magnetoencephalographic activity obtained from 30 mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) subjects and 50 healthy controls. Intra-frequency and inter-frequency coupling modes are incorporated in a single graph to detect group differences within individual rich-club subnetworks (type I networks) and networks connecting RC nodes with the rest of the nodes (type II networks). Our results show a higher probability of inter-frequency coupling for ({delta}-{gamma}1), ({delta}-{gamma}2), ({theta}-{beta}), ({theta}-{gamma}2), (-{gamma}2), ({gamma}1-{gamma}2) and intra-frequency coupling for ({gamma}1-{gamma}1) and ({delta}-{delta}) for both type I and type II networks in the mTBI group. Additionally, mTBI and control subjects can be correctly classified with high accuracy (98.6%), whereas a general linear regression model can effectively predict the subject group using the ratio of type I and type II coupling in the ({delta}, {theta}), ({delta}, {beta}), ({delta}, {gamma}1), and ({delta}, {gamma}2) frequency pairs. These findings support the presence of an RC organization simultaneously with dominant frequency interactions within a single functional graph. Our results demonstrate a hyperactivation of intrinsic RC networks in mTBI subjects compared to controls, which can be seen as a plausible compensatory mechanism for alternative frequency-dependent routes of information flow in mTBI subjects.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Human Resting-State Electrophysiological Networks In The Alpha Frequency Band: Evidence From Magnetoencephalographic Source Imaging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/142091v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/142091v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In the resting-state, extended regions of the human cortex engage in electrical oscillations within the alpha-frequency band (7-14 Hz) that can be measured outside the head by magnetoencephalography (MEG). Given the accumulating evidence that alpha oscillations play a fundamental role in attentional processing and working memory, it becomes increasingly important to characterize their cortical organization. Event-related studies have demonstrated that attentional allocation can modulate alpha power selectively within the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices, as well as in higher-level regions. Such studies demonstrate the existence of multiple generators by exploiting experimental contrasts and trial-averaging. The identification of alpha generators from resting-state data alone has proven much harder and, consequently, relatively little is known about their organization: Apart from the classical visual, somatosensory, and auditory rhythms, it is unclear how many more generators can be observed with MEG and how they are organized into functional networks. Such knowledge, however, possibly enables to delineate separate cognitive, perceptual, and motor processes that co-occur in the resting-state and is therefore important. In this study we use the resting-state MEG data-set provided by the Human Connectome Project to identify cortical alpha generators and to characterize their organization into functional networks. The large number of subjects (N = 94), multiple scans per subject, and state-of-the-art surface-based cortical registration enable a detailed characterization of alpha in human cortex. By applying non-negative matrix factorization to source-projected power fluctuations, we identify 16 reliable cortical generators in each hemisphere. These include the classical sensory alpha rhythms as well as several additional ones in the lateral occipital and temporal lobes and in inferior parietal cortex. We show that the generators are coordinated across hemispheres and hence form resting-state networks (RSNs), two of which are the default mode network (DMN) and the ventral attention network (VAN). Our study hence provides a further subdivision of RSNs within the alpha frequency band and shows that these RSNs are supported by alpha generators. As such, it links the classical literature on human alpha with more recent research into electrophysiological RNSs.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Spontaneous cortical activity is transiently poised close to criticality</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Gerald Hahn, Adrian Ponce-Alvarez, Cyril Monier, Giacomo Benvenuti, Arvind Kumar, Frédéric Chavane, Gustavo Deco, Yves Frégnac&lt;/p&gt;

Brain activity displays a large repertoire of dynamics across the sleep-wake cycle and even during anesthesia. It was suggested that criticality could serve as a unifying principle underlying the diversity of dynamics. This view has been supported by the observation of spontaneous bursts of cortical activity with scale-invariant sizes and durations, known as neuronal avalanches, in recordings of mesoscopic cortical signals. However, the existence of neuronal avalanches in spiking activity has been equivocal with studies reporting both its presence and absence. Here, we show that signs of criticality in spiking activity can change between synchronized and desynchronized cortical states. We analyzed the spontaneous activity in the primary visual cortex of the anesthetized cat and the awake monkey, and found that neuronal avalanches and thermodynamic indicators of criticality strongly depend on collective synchrony among neurons, LFP fluctuations, and behavioral state. We found that synchronized states are associated to criticality, large dynamical repertoire and prolonged epochs of eye closure, while desynchronized states are associated to sub-criticality, reduced dynamical repertoire, and eyes open conditions. Our results show that criticality in cortical dynamics is not stationary, but fluctuates during anesthesia and between different vigilance states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uSwcz9bYNaM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Feature-Selective Attention Adaptively Shifts Noise Correlations in Primary Auditory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5378?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory environments often contain an overwhelming amount of information, with both relevant and irrelevant information competing for neural resources. Feature attention mediates this competition by selecting the sensory features needed to form a coherent percept. How attention affects the activity of populations of neurons to support this process is poorly understood because population coding is typically studied through simulations in which one sensory feature is encoded without competition. Therefore, to study the effects of feature attention on population-based neural coding, investigations must be extended to include stimuli with both relevant and irrelevant features. We measured noise correlations (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;noise&lt;/sub&gt;) within small neural populations in primary auditory cortex while rhesus macaques performed a novel feature-selective attention task. We found that the effect of feature-selective attention on &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;noise&lt;/sub&gt; depended not only on the population tuning to the attended feature, but also on the tuning to the distractor feature. To attempt to explain how these observed effects might support enhanced perceptual performance, we propose an extension of a simple and influential model in which shifts in &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;noise&lt;/sub&gt; can simultaneously enhance the representation of the attended feature while suppressing the distractor. These findings present a novel mechanism by which attention modulates neural populations to support sensory processing in cluttered environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although feature-selective attention constitutes one of the building blocks of listening in natural environments, its neural bases remain obscure. To address this, we developed a novel auditory feature-selective attention task and measured noise correlations (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;noise&lt;/sub&gt;) in rhesus macaque A1 during task performance. Unlike previous studies showing that the effect of attention on &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;noise&lt;/sub&gt; depends on population tuning to the attended feature, we show that the effect of attention depends on the tuning to the distractor feature as well. We suggest that these effects represent an efficient process by which sensory cortex simultaneously enhances relevant information and suppresses irrelevant information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nicotinic {alpha}4{beta}2 Cholinergic Receptor Influences on Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortical Neuronal Firing during a Working Memory Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5366?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) subserves top-down regulation of attention and working memory abilities. Depletion studies show that the neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh) is essential to dlPFC working memory functions, but the receptor and cellular bases for cholinergic actions are just beginning to be understood. The current study found that nicotinic receptors comprised of α4 and β2 subunits (α4β2-nAChR) enhance the task-related firing of delay and fixation cells in the dlPFC of monkeys performing a working memory task. Iontophoresis of α4β2-nAChR agonists increased the neuronal firing and enhanced the spatial tuning of delay cells, neurons that represent visual space in the absence of sensory stimulation. These enhancing effects were reversed by coapplication of a α4β2-nAChR antagonist, consistent with actions at α4β2-nAChR. Delay cell firing was reduced when distractors were presented during the delay epoch, whereas stimulation of α4β2-nAChR protected delay cells from these deleterious effects. Iontophoresis of α4β2-nAChR agonists also enhanced the firing of fixation cells, neurons that increase firing when the monkey initiates a trial, and maintain firing until the trial is completed. These neurons are thought to contribute to sustained attention and top-down motor control and have never before been the subject of pharmacological inquiry. These findings begin to build a picture of the cellular actions underlying the beneficial effects of ACh on attention and working memory. The data may also help to explain why genetic insults to α4 subunits are associated with working memory and attentional deficits and why α4β2-nAChR agonists may have therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The acetylcholine (ACh) arousal system in the brain is needed for robust attention and working memory functions, but the receptor and cellular bases for its beneficial effects are poorly understood in the newly evolved primate brain. The current study found that ACh stimulation of nicotinic receptors comprised of α4 and β2 subunits (α4β2-nAChR) enhanced the firing of neurons in the primate prefrontal cortex that subserve top-down attentional control and working memory. α4β2-nAChR stimulation also protected neuronal responding from the detrimental effects of distracters presented during the delay epoch, when information is held in working memory. These results illuminate how ACh strengthens higher cognition and help to explain why genetic insults to the α4 subunit weaken cognitive and attentional abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: APLP1 Is a Synaptic Cell Adhesion Molecule, Supporting Maintenance of Dendritic Spines and Basal Synaptic Transmission</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The amyloid precursor protein (APP), a key player in Alzheimer's disease, belongs to the family of synaptic adhesion molecules (SAMs) due to its impact on synapse formation and synaptic plasticity. These functions are mediated by both the secreted APP ectodomain that acts as a neurotrophic factor and full-length APP forming &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cellular dimers. Two homologs of APP exist in mammals: the APP like proteins APLP1 and APLP2, exhibiting functions that partly overlap with those of APP. Here we tested whether APLP1 and APLP2 also show features of SAMs. We found that all three family members were upregulated during postnatal development coinciding with synaptogenesis. We observed presynaptic and postsynaptic localization of all APP family members and could show that heterologous expression of APLP1 or APLP2 in non-neuronal cells induces presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons of cocultured neurons, similar to APP and other SAMs. Moreover, APP/APLPs all bind to synaptic-signaling molecules, such as MINT/X11. Furthermore, we report that aged APLP1 knock-out mice show impaired basal transmission and a reduced mEPSC frequency, likely resulting from reduced spine density. This demonstrates an essential nonredundant function of APLP1 at the synapse. Compared to APP, APLP1 exhibits increased &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cellular binding and elevated cell-surface levels due to reduced endocytosis. In conclusion, our results establish that APLPs show typical features of SAMs and indicate that increased surface expression, as observed for APLP1, is essential for proper synapse formation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and synapse maintenance &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; According to the amyloid-cascade hypothesis, Alzheimer's disease is caused by the accumulation of Aβ peptides derived from sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and -secretase. Here we show that all mammalian APP family members (APP, APLP1, and APLP2) exhibit synaptogenic activity, involving &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-synaptic dimerization, similar to other synaptic cell adhesion molecules, such as Neuroligin/Neurexin. Importantly, our study revealed that the loss of APLP1, which is one of the major substrates of BACE1, causes reduced spine density in aged mice. Because some therapeutic interventions target APP processing (e.g., BACE inhibitors), those strategies may alter APP/APLP physiological function. This should be taken into account for the development of pharmaceutical treatments of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Spatial Attention, Motor Intention, and Bayesian Cue Predictability in the Human Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Predictions about upcoming events influence how we perceive and respond to our environment. There is increasing evidence that predictions may be generated based upon previous observations following Bayesian principles, but little is known about the underlying cortical mechanisms and their specificity for different cognitive subsystems. The present study aimed at identifying common and distinct neural signatures of predictive processing in the spatial attentional and motor intentional system. Twenty-three female and male healthy human volunteers performed two probabilistic cueing tasks with either spatial or motor cues while lying in the fMRI scanner. In these tasks, the percentage of cue validity changed unpredictably over time. Trialwise estimates of cue predictability were derived from a Bayesian observer model of behavioral responses. These estimates were included as parametric regressors for analyzing the BOLD time series. Parametric effects of cue predictability in valid and invalid trials were considered to reflect belief updating by precision-weighted prediction errors. The brain areas exhibiting predictability-dependent effects dissociated between the spatial attention and motor intention task, with the right temporoparietal cortex being involved during spatial attention and the left angular gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex during motor intention. Connectivity analyses revealed that all three areas showed predictability-dependent coupling with the right hippocampus. These results suggest that precision-weighted prediction errors of stimulus locations and motor responses are encoded in distinct brain regions, but that crosstalk with the hippocampus may be necessary to integrate new trialwise outcomes in both cognitive systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The brain is able to infer the environments' statistical structure and responds strongly to expectancy violations. In the spatial attentional domain, it has been shown that parts of the attentional networks are sensitive to the predictability of stimuli. It remains unknown, however, whether these effects are ubiquitous or if they are specific for different cognitive systems. The present study compared the influence of model-derived cue predictability on brain activity in the spatial attentional and motor intentional system. We identified areas with distinct predictability-dependent activation for spatial attention and motor intention, but also common connectivity changes of these regions with the hippocampus. These findings provide novel insights into the generality and specificity of predictive processing signatures in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Variable Action Potential Backpropagation during Tonic Firing and Low-Threshold Spike Bursts in Thalamocortical But Not Thalamic Reticular Nucleus Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) are indispensable in dendritic signaling. Conflicting Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-imaging data and an absence of dendritic recording data means that the extent of backpropagation in thalamocortical (TC) and thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) neurons remains unknown. Because TRN neurons signal electrically through dendrodendritic gap junctions and possibly via chemical dendritic GABAergic synapses, as well as classical axonal GABA release, this lack of knowledge is problematic. To address this issue, we made two-photon targeted patch-clamp recordings from rat TC and TRN neuron dendrites to measure bAPs directly. These recordings reveal that &quot;tonic&quot;' and low-threshold-spike (LTS) &quot;burst&quot; APs in both cell types are always recorded first at the soma before backpropagating into the dendrites while undergoing substantial distance-dependent dendritic amplitude attenuation. In TC neurons, bAP attenuation strength varies according to firing mode. During LTS bursts, somatic AP half-width increases progressively with increasing spike number, allowing late-burst spikes to propagate more efficiently into the dendritic tree compared with spikes occurring at burst onset. Tonic spikes have similar somatic half-widths to late burst spikes and undergo similar dendritic attenuation. In contrast, in TRN neurons, AP properties are unchanged between LTS bursts and tonic firing and, as a result, distance-dependent dendritic attenuation remains consistent across different firing modes. Therefore, unlike LTS-associated global electrical and calcium signals, the spatial influence of bAP signaling in TC and TRN neurons is more restricted, with potentially important behavioral-state-dependent consequences for synaptic integration and plasticity in thalamic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In most neurons, action potentials (APs) initiate in the axosomatic region and propagate into the dendritic tree to provide a retrograde signal that conveys information about the level of cellular output to the locations that receive most input: the dendrites. In thalamocortical and thalamic reticular nucleus neurons, the site of AP generation and the true extent of backpropagation remain unknown. Using patch-clamp recordings, this study measures dendritic propagation of APs directly in these neurons. In either cell type, high-frequency low-threshold spike burst or lower-frequency tonic APs undergo substantial voltage attenuation as they spread into the dendritic tree. Therefore, backpropagating spikes in these cells can only influence signaling in the proximal part of the dendritic tree.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Decreased Motor Neuron Support by SMA Astrocytes due to Diminished MCP1 Secretion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5309?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by severe, often fatal muscle weakness due to loss of motor neurons. SMA patients have deletions and other mutations of the &lt;i&gt;survival of motor neuron 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt;) gene, resulting in decreased SMN protein. Astrocytes are the primary support cells of the CNS and are responsible for glutamate clearance, metabolic support, response to injury, and regulation of signal transmission. Astrocytes have been implicated in SMA as in in other neurodegenerative disorders. Astrocyte-specific rescue of SMN protein levels has been shown to mitigate disease manifestations in mice. However, the mechanism by which SMN deficiency in astrocytes may contribute to SMA is unclear and what aspect of astrocyte activity is lacking is unknown. Therefore, it is worthwhile to identify defects in SMN-deficient astrocytes that compromise normal function. We show here that SMA astrocyte cultures derived from mouse spinal cord of both sexes are deficient in supporting both WT and SMN-deficient motor neurons derived from male, female, and mixed-sex sources and that this deficiency may be mitigated with secreted factors. In particular, SMN-deficient astrocytes have decreased levels of monocyte chemoactive protein 1 (MCP1) secretion compared with controls and MCP1 restoration stimulates outgrowth of neurites from cultured motor neurons. Correction of MCP1 deficiency may thus be a new therapeutic approach to SMA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by the loss of motor neurons, but astrocyte dysfunction also contributes to the disease in mouse models. Monocyte chemoactive protein 1 (MCP1) has been shown to be neuroprotective and is released by astrocytes. Here, we report that MCP1 levels are decreased in SMA mice and that replacement of deficient MCP1 increases differentiation and neurite length of WT and SMN-deficient motor-neuron-like cells in cell culture. This study reveals a novel aspect of astrocyte dysfunction in SMA and indicates a possible approach for improving motor neuron growth and survival in this disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Modulation of Illusory Reversal in Tactile Temporal Order by the Phase of Posterior {alpha} Rhythm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5298?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5298?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The subjective temporal order of tactile stimuli, delivered sequentially to each hand with an interval of 100–300 ms, is often inverted when the arms are crossed. Based on data from behavioral and neuroimaging studies, it has been proposed that the reversal is due to a conflict between anatomical and spatial representations of the tactile signal or to the production of an inverted apparent motion signal. Because the α rhythms, which consist of a few distinct components, reportedly modulate tactile perception and apparent motion and serve as a 10 Hz timer, we hypothesized that the illusory reversal would be regulated by some of the α rhythms. To test this hypothesis, we conducted magnetoencephalographic recordings in both male and female participants during the tactile temporal order judgment task. We decomposed the α rhythms into five independent components and discovered that the illusory reversal was modulated by the phase of one independent component with strong current sources near the parieto-occipital (PO) sulcus (peri-PO component). As expected, the estimated current sources distributed over the human MST implicated to represent tactile apparent motion, in addition to the intraparietal region implicated in mapping tactile signals in space. However, the strongest source was located in the precuneus that occupies a central hub region in the cortical networks and receives tactile inputs through a tecto-thalamic pathway. These results suggest that the peri-PO component plays an essential role in regulating tactile temporal perception by modulating the thalamic nuclei that interconnect the superior colliculus with the cortical networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite a long-held hypothesis that the posterior α rhythm serves as a 10 Hz timer that regulates human temporal perception, the contribution of the α rhythms in temporal perception is still unclear. We examined how the α rhythms influence tactile temporal order judgment. Judgment reversal depended on the phase of one particular α rhythm with its source near the parieto-occipital sulcus. The peri-parieto-occipital α rhythm may play a crucial role in organizing tactile temporal perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Privileged Functional Connectivity between the Visual Word Form Area and the Language System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5288?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The visual word form area (VWFA) is a region in the left occipitotemporal sulcus of literate individuals that is purportedly specialized for visual word recognition. However, there is considerable controversy about its functional specificity and connectivity, with some arguing that it serves as a domain-general, rather than word-specific, visual processor. The VWFA is a critical region for testing hypotheses about the nature of cortical organization, because it is known to develop only through experience (i.e., reading acquisition), and widespread literacy is too recent to have influenced genetic determinants of brain organization. Using a combination of advanced fMRI analysis techniques, including individual functional localization, multivoxel pattern analysis, and high-resolution resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses, with data from 33 healthy adult human participants, we demonstrate that (1) the VWFA can discriminate words from nonword letter strings (pseudowords); (2) the VWFA has preferential RSFC with Wernicke's area and other core regions of the language system; and (3) the strength of the RSFC between the VWFA and Wernicke's area predicts performance on a semantic classification task with words but not other categories of visual stimuli. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the VWFA is specialized for lexical processing of real words because of its functional connectivity with Wernicke's area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The visual word form area (VWFA) is critical for determining the nature of category-related organization of the ventral visual system. However, its functional specificity and connectivity are fiercely debated. Recent work concluded that the VWFA is a domain-general, rather than word-specific, visual processor with no preferential functional connectivity with the language system. Using more advanced techniques, our results stand in stark contrast to these earlier findings. We demonstrate that the VWFA is highly specialized for lexical processing of real words, and that a fundamental factor driving this specialization is its preferential intrinsic functional connectivity with core regions of the language system. Our results support the hypothesis that intrinsic functional connectivity contributes to category-related specialization within the human ventral visual system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Being First Matters: Topographical Representational Similarity Analysis of ERP Signals Reveals Separate Networks for Audiovisual Temporal Binding Depending on the Leading Sense</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5274?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5274?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In multisensory integration, processing in one sensory modality is enhanced by complementary information from other modalities. Intersensory timing is crucial in this process because only inputs reaching the brain within a restricted temporal window are perceptually bound. Previous research in the audiovisual field has investigated various features of the temporal binding window, revealing asymmetries in its size and plasticity depending on the leading input: auditory–visual (AV) or visual–auditory (VA). Here, we tested whether separate neuronal mechanisms underlie this AV–VA dichotomy in humans. We recorded high-density EEG while participants performed an audiovisual simultaneity judgment task including various AV–VA asynchronies and unisensory control conditions (visual-only, auditory-only) and tested whether AV and VA processing generate different patterns of brain activity. After isolating the multisensory components of AV–VA event-related potentials (ERPs) from the sum of their unisensory constituents, we ran a time-resolved topographical representational similarity analysis (tRSA) comparing the AV and VA ERP maps. Spatial cross-correlation matrices were built from real data to index the similarity between the AV and VA maps at each time point (500 ms window after stimulus) and then correlated with two alternative similarity model matrices: AV&lt;sub&gt;maps&lt;/sub&gt; = VA&lt;sub&gt;maps&lt;/sub&gt; versus AV&lt;sub&gt;maps&lt;/sub&gt; = VA&lt;sub&gt;maps&lt;/sub&gt;. The tRSA results favored the AV&lt;sub&gt;maps&lt;/sub&gt; = VA&lt;sub&gt;maps&lt;/sub&gt; model across all time points, suggesting that audiovisual temporal binding (indexed by synchrony perception) engages different neural pathways depending on the leading sense. The existence of such dual route supports recent theoretical accounts proposing that multiple binding mechanisms are implemented in the brain to accommodate different information parsing strategies in auditory and visual sensory systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Intersensory timing is a crucial aspect of multisensory integration, determining whether and how inputs in one modality enhance stimulus processing in another modality. Our research demonstrates that evaluating synchrony of auditory-leading (AV) versus visual-leading (VA) audiovisual stimulus pairs is characterized by two distinct patterns of brain activity. This suggests that audiovisual integration is not a unitary process and that different binding mechanisms are recruited in the brain based on the leading sense. These mechanisms may be relevant for supporting different classes of multisensory operations, for example, auditory enhancement of visual attention (AV) and visual enhancement of auditory speech (VA).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sleep Loss Promotes Astrocytic Phagocytosis and Microglial Activation in Mouse Cerebral Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5263?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5263?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We previously found that &lt;i&gt;Mertk&lt;/i&gt; and its ligand &lt;i&gt;Gas6&lt;/i&gt;, astrocytic genes involved in phagocytosis, are upregulated after acute sleep deprivation. These results suggested that astrocytes may engage in phagocytic activity during extended wake, but direct evidence was lacking. Studies in humans and rodents also found that sleep loss increases peripheral markers of inflammation, but whether these changes are associated with neuroinflammation and/or activation of microglia, the brain's resident innate immune cells, was unknown. Here we used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to obtain 3D volume measurements of synapses and surrounding astrocytic processes in mouse frontal cortex after 6–8 h of sleep, spontaneous wake, or sleep deprivation (SD) and after chronic (~5 d) sleep restriction (CSR). Astrocytic phagocytosis, mainly of presynaptic components of large synapses, increased after both acute and chronic sleep loss relative to sleep and wake. MERTK expression and lipid peroxidation in synaptoneurosomes also increased to a similar extent after short and long sleep loss, suggesting that astrocytic phagocytosis may represent the brain's response to the increase in synaptic activity associated with prolonged wake, clearing worn components of heavily used synapses. Using confocal microscopy, we then found that CSR but not SD mice show morphological signs of microglial activation and enhanced microglial phagocytosis of synaptic elements, without obvious signs of neuroinflammation in the CSF. Because low-level sustained microglia activation can lead to abnormal responses to a secondary insult, these results suggest that chronic sleep loss, through microglia priming, may predispose the brain to further damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We find that astrocytic phagocytosis of synaptic elements, mostly of presynaptic origin and in large synapses, is upregulated already after a few hours of sleep deprivation and shows a further significant increase after prolonged and severe sleep loss, suggesting that it may promote the housekeeping of heavily used and strong synapses in response to the increased neuronal activity of extended wake. By contrast, chronic sleep restriction but not acute sleep loss activates microglia, promotes their phagocytic activity, and does so in the absence of overt signs of neuroinflammation, suggesting that like many other stressors, extended sleep disruption may lead to a state of sustained microglia activation, perhaps increasing the brain's susceptibility to other forms of damage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Seminal studies of the thalamocortical circuit in the visual system of the cat have been central to our understanding of sensory encoding. However, thalamocortical synaptic properties remain poorly understood. We used paired recordings, in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1), to provide the first &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; characterization of sensory-driven thalamocortical potentials in V1. The amplitudes of EPSPs we characterized were smaller than those previously reported &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Consistent with prior findings, connected LGN-V1 pairs were only found when their receptive fields (RFs) overlapped, and the probability of connection increased steeply with degree of RF overlap and response similarity. However, surprisingly, we found no relationship between EPSP amplitudes and the similarity of RFs or responses, suggesting different connectivity models for intracortical and thalamocortical circuits. Putative excitatory regular-spiking (RS) and inhibitory fast-spiking (FS) V1 cells had similar EPSP characteristics, showing that in the visual system, feedforward excitation and inhibition are driven with equal strength by the thalamus. Similar to observations in the somatosensory cortex, FS V1 cells received less specific input from LGN. Finally, orientation tuning in V1 was not inherited from single presynaptic LGN cells, suggesting that it must emerge exclusively from the combined input of all presynaptic LGN cells. Our results help to decipher early visual encoding circuits and have immediate utility in providing physiological constraints to computational models of the visual system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To understand how the brain encodes the visual environment, we must understand the transfer of visual signals between various regions of the brain. Therefore, understanding synaptic dynamics is critical to our understanding of sensory encoding. This study provides the first characterization of visually evoked synaptic potentials between the visual thalamus and visual cortex in an intact animal. To record these potentials, we simultaneously recorded the extracellular potential of presynaptic thalamic cells and the intracellular potential of postsynaptic cortical cells in input layers of primary visual cortex. Our characterization of synaptic potentials &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; disagreed with prior findings &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. This study will increase our understanding of thalamocortical circuits and will improve computational models of visual encoding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Structural Similarities between Neuregulin 1-3 Isoforms Determine Their Subcellular Distribution and Signaling Mode in Central Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/21/5232?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Neuregulin (NRG) family of ErbB ligands is comprised of numerous variants originating from the use of different genes, alternative promoters, and splice variants. NRGs have generally been thought to be transported to axons and presynaptic terminals where they signal via ErbB3/4 receptors in paracrine or juxtacrine mode. However, we recently demonstrated that unprocessed pro-NRG2 accumulates on cell bodies and proximal dendrites, and that NMDAR activity is required for shedding of its ectodomain by metalloproteinases. Here we systematically investigated the subcellular distribution and processing of major NRG isoforms in rat hippocampal neurons. We show that NRG1 isotypes I and II, which like NRG2 are single-pass transmembrane proteins with an Ig-like domain, share the same subcellular distribution and ectodomain shedding properties. We furthermore show that NRG3, like CRD-NRG1, is a dual-pass transmembrane protein that harbors a second transmembrane domain near its amino terminus. Both NRG3 and CRD-NRG1 cluster on axons through juxtacrine interactions with ErbB4 present on GABAergic interneurons. Interestingly, although single-pass NRGs accumulate as unprocessed proforms, axonal puncta of CRD-NRG1 and NRG3 are comprised of processed protein. Mutations of CRD-NRG1 and NRG3 that render them resistant to BACE cleavage, as well as BACE inhibition, result in the loss of axonal puncta and in the accumulation of unprocessed proforms in neuronal soma. Together, these results define two groups of NRGs with distinct membrane topologies and fundamentally different targeting and processing properties in central neurons. The implications of this functional diversity for the regulation of neuronal processes by the NRG/ErbB pathway are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Numerous Neuregulins (NRGs) are generated through the use of different genes, promoters, and alternative splicing, but the functional significance of this evolutionary conserved diversity remains poorly understood. Here we show that NRGs can be categorized by their membrane topologies. Single-pass NRGs, such as NRG1 Types I/II and NRG2, accumulate as unprocessed proforms on cell bodies, and their ectodomains are shed by metalloproteinases in response to NMDA receptor activation. By contrast, dual-pass CRD-NRG1 and NRG3 are constitutively processed by BACE and accumulate on axons where they interact with ErbB4 in juxtacrine mode. These findings reveal a previously unknown functional relationship between membrane topology, protein processing, and subcellular distribution, and suggest that single- and dual-pass NRGs regulate neuronal functions in fundamentally different ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Allometric Analysis Detects Brain Size-Independent Effects of Sex and Sex Chromosome Complement on Human Cerebellar Organization</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cerebellum is a large hindbrain structure that is increasingly recognized for its contribution to diverse domains of cognitive and affective processing in human health and disease. Although several of these domains are sex biased, our fundamental understanding of cerebellar sex differences—including their spatial distribution, potential biological determinants, and independence from brain volume variation—lags far behind that for the cerebrum. Here, we harness automated neuroimaging methods for cerebellar morphometrics in 417 individuals to (1) localize normative male–female differences in raw cerebellar volume, (2) compare these to sex chromosome effects estimated across five rare sex (X/Y) chromosome aneuploidy (SCA) syndromes, and (3) clarify brain size-independent effects of sex and SCA on cerebellar anatomy using a generalizable allometric approach that considers scaling relationships between regional cerebellar volume and brain volume in health. The integration of these approaches shows that (1) sex and SCA effects on raw cerebellar volume are large and distributed, but regionally heterogeneous, (2) human cerebellar volume scales with brain volume in a highly nonlinear and regionally heterogeneous fashion that departs from documented patterns of cerebellar scaling in phylogeny, and (3) cerebellar organization is modified in a brain size-independent manner by sex (relative expansion of total cerebellum, flocculus, and Crus II-lobule VIIIB volumes in males) and SCA (contraction of total cerebellar, lobule IV, and Crus I volumes with additional X- or Y-chromosomes; X-specific contraction of Crus II-lobule VIIIB). Our methods and results clarify the shifts in human cerebellar organization that accompany interwoven variations in sex, sex chromosome complement, and brain size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cerebellar systems are implicated in diverse domains of sex-biased behavior and pathology, but we lack a basic understanding of how sex differences in the human cerebellum are distributed and determined. We leverage a rare neuroimaging dataset to deconvolve the interwoven effects of sex, sex chromosome complement, and brain size on human cerebellar organization. We reveal topographically variegated scaling relationships between regional cerebellar volume and brain size in humans, which (1) are distinct from those observed in phylogeny, (2) invalidate a traditional neuroimaging method for brain volume correction, and (3) allow more valid and accurate resolution of which cerebellar subcomponents are sensitive to sex and sex chromosome complement. These findings advance understanding of cerebellar organization in health and sex chromosome aneuploidy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence in neuroscience suggests that
organisms represent or model their environment by minimizing a variational
free-energy bound on the surprise associated with sensory signals from the
environment. In this paper, we study phase transitions in coupled dissipative
dynamical systems (complex Ginzburg-Landau equations) under a variety of
coupling conditions to model the exchange of a system (agent) with its
environment. We show that arbitrary coupling between sensory signals and the
internal state of a system -- or those between its action and external
(environmental) states -- do not guarantee synchronous dynamics between
external and internal states: the spatial structure and the temporal dynamics
of sensory signals and action (that comprise the system's Markov blanket) have
to be pruned to produce synchrony. This synchrony is necessary for an agent to
infer environmental states -- a pre-requisite for survival. Therefore, such
sentient dynamics, relies primarily on approximate synchronization between the
agent and its niche.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this work we challenge the main conclusions of Gu et al work
(Controllability of structural brain networks. Nature communications 6, 8414,
doi:10.1038/ncomms9414, 2015) on brain controllability. Using the same methods
and analyses on four datasets we find that the minimum set of nodes to control
brain networks is always larger than one. We also find that the relationships
between the average/modal controllability and weighted degrees also hold for
randomized data and the there are not specific roles played by Resting State
Networks in controlling the brain. In conclusion, we show that there is no
evidence that topology plays specific and unique roles in the controllability
of brain networks. Accordingly, Gu et al. interpretation of their results, in
particular in terms of translational applications (e.g. using single node
controllability properties to define target region(s) for neurostimulation)
should be revisited. Though theoretically intriguing, our understanding of the
relationship between controllability and structural brain network remains
elusive.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Connectivity patterns of relevance in neuroscience and systems biology can be
encoded in hierarchical modular networks (HMNs). Moreover, recent studies
highlight the role of hierarchical modular organization in shaping brain
activity patterns, providing an excellent substrate to promote both the
segregation and integration of neural information. Here we propose an extensive
numerical analysis of the critical spreading rate (or &quot;epidemic&quot; threshold)
--separating a phase with endemic persistent activity from one in which
activity ceases-- on diverse HMNs. By employing analytical and computational
techniques we determine the nature of such a threshold and scrutinize how it
depends on general structural features of the underlying HMN. We critically
discuss the extent to which current graph-spectral methods can be applied to
predict the onset of spreading in HMNs, and we propose the network topological
dimension as a relevant and unifying structural parameter, controlling the
epidemic threshold.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quantum probability updating from zero prior (by-passing Cromwell's rule). (arXiv:1705.08128v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08128</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08128</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cromwell's rule (also known as the zero priors paradox) refers to the
constraint of classical probability theory that if one assigns a prior
probability of 0 or 1 to a hypothesis, then the posterior has to be 0 or 1 as
well (this is a straightforward implication of how Bayes's rule works).
Relatedly, hypotheses with a very low prior cannot be updated to have a very
high posterior without a tremendous amount of new evidence to support them (or
to make other possibilities highly improbable). Cromwell's rule appears at odds
with our intuition of how humans update probabilities. In this work, we report
two simple decision making experiments, which seem to be inconsistent with
Cromwell's rule. Quantum probability theory, the rules for how to assign
probabilities from the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, provides an
alternative framework for probabilistic inference. An advantage of quantum
probability theory is that it is not subject to Cromwell's rule and it can
accommodate changes from zero or very small priors to significant posteriors.
We outline a model of decision making, based on quantum theory, which can
accommodate the changes from priors to posteriors, observed in our experiments.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how the brain learns to compute functions reliably, efficiently
and robustly with noisy spiking activity is a fundamental challenge in
neuroscience. Most sensory and motor tasks can be described as dynamical
systems and could presumably be learned by adjusting connection weights in a
recurrent biological neural network. However, this is greatly complicated by
the credit assignment problem for learning in recurrent network, e.g. the
contribution of each connection to the global output error cannot be determined
based only on locally accessible quantities to the synapse. Combining tools
from adaptive control theory and efficient coding theories, we propose that
neural circuits can indeed learn complex dynamic tasks with local synaptic
plasticity rules as long as they associate two experimentally established
neural mechanisms. First, they should receive top-down feedbacks driving both
their activity and their synaptic plasticity. Second, inhibitory interneurons
should maintain a tight balance between excitation and inhibition in the
circuit. The resulting networks could learn arbitrary dynamical systems and
produce irregular spike trains as variable as those observed experimentally.
Yet, this variability in single neurons may hide an extremely efficient and
robust computation at the population level.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how recurrent neural circuits can learn to implement dynamical
systems is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. The credit assignment
problem, i.e. determining the local contribution of each synapse to the
network's global output error, is a major obstacle in deriving biologically
plausible local learning rules. Moreover, spiking recurrent networks
implementing such tasks should not be hugely costly in terms of number of
neurons and spikes, as they often are when adapted from rate models. Finally,
these networks should be robust to noise and neural deaths in order to sustain
these representations in the face of such naturally occurring perturbation. We
approach this problem by fusing the theory of efficient, balanced spiking
networks (EBN) with nonlinear adaptive control theory. Local learning rules are
ensured by feeding back into the network its own error, resulting in a synaptic
plasticity rule depending solely on presynaptic inputs and post-synaptic
feedback. The efficiency and robustness of the network are guaranteed by
maintaining a tight excitatory/inhibitory balance, ensuring that each spike
represents a local projection of the global output error and minimizes a loss
function. The resulting networks can learn to implement complex dynamics with
very small numbers of neurons and spikes, exhibit the same spike train
variability as observed experimentally, and are extremely robust to noise and
neuronal loss.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural time-series data contain a wide variety of prototypical signal
waveforms (atoms) that are of significant importance in clinical and cognitive
research. One of the goals for analyzing such data is hence to extract such
'shift-invariant' atoms. Even though some success has been reported with
existing algorithms, they are limited in applicability due to their heuristic
nature. Moreover, they are often vulnerable to artifacts and impulsive noise,
which are typically present in raw neural recordings. In this study, we address
these issues and propose a novel probabilistic convolutional sparse coding
(CSC) model for learning shift-invariant atoms from raw neural signals
containing potentially severe artifacts. In the core of our model, which we
call $\alpha$CSC, lies a family of heavy-tailed distributions called
$\alpha$-stable distributions. We develop a novel, computationally efficient
Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm for inference. The maximization
step boils down to a weighted CSC problem, for which we develop a
computationally efficient optimization algorithm. Our results show that the
proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art convergence speeds. Besides,
$\alpha$CSC is significantly more robust to artifacts when compared to three
competing algorithms: it can extract spike bursts, oscillations, and even
reveal more subtle phenomena such as cross-frequency coupling when applied to
noisy neural time series.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Avalanches with power-law distributed size parameters have been observed in
neuronal networks. This observation might be a manifestation of the
self-organized criticality (SOC). Yet, the physiological mechanicsm of this
behavior is currently unknown. Describing synaptic noise as transmission
failures mainly originating from the probabilistic nature of neurotransmitter
release, this study investigates the potential of this noise as a mechanism for
driving the functional architecture of the neuronal networks towards SOC. To
this end, a simple finite state neuron model, with activity dependent and
synapse specific failure probabilities, was built based on the known anatomical
connectivity data of the nematode Ceanorhabditis elegans. Beginning from random
values, it was observed that synaptic noise levels picked out a set of synapses
and consequently an active subnetwork which generates power-law distributed
neuronal avalanches. The findings of this study brings up the possibility that
synaptic failures might be a component of physiological processes underlying
SOC in neuronal networks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A key problem with neuroprostheses and brain monitoring interfaces is that
they need extreme energy efficiency. One way of lowering energy is to use the
low power modes avail- able on the processors embedded in these devices. We
present a technique to predict when neuronal activity of interest is likely to
occur, so that the processor can run at nominal operating frequency at those
times, and be placed in low power modes otherwise. To achieve this, we discover
that branch predictors can also predict brain activity. By performing brain
surgeries on awake and anesthetized mice, we evaluate several branch predictors
and find that perceptron branch predictors can predict cerebellar activity with
accuracies as high as 85%. Consequently, we co-opt branch predictors to dictate
when to transition between low power and normal operating modes, saving as much
as 59% of processor energy.

	<description>Coordinated rhythmic movements are ubiquitous in animal locomotory, feeding, and circulatory systems. In many organisms, a chain of neural oscillators underlies the generation of rhythmic waves. In C. elegans, the nature of wave generation has been poorly understood; in particular, it has been unclear where in the locomotor circuit rhythm generation occurs, and whether there exists more than one such generator. We used targeted optogenetic manipulation and laser ablation experiments to probe the nature of rhythm generation in the locomotor circuit. We found that multiple sections of forward locomotor circuitry are capable of independently generating rhythms. By perturbing different components of the motor circuit, we localize the source of multiple secondary rhythm generators to cholinergic motor neurons in the midbody. Using rhythmic optogenetic perturbation we demonstrate a bidirectional entrainment between different sections of the body. These results show that like the vertebrate spinal cord, the C. elegans motor circuit contains multiple oscillators that normally coordinate their activity to generate behavior. Our work opens the possibility of a genetic and neural dissection of how rhythmic locomotion is generated, propagated, and modulated.</description>

	<description>In many social situations, we make a snap judgment about crowds of people relying on their overall mood (termed &quot;crowd emotion&quot;). Although reading crowd emotion is critical for interpersonal dynamics, the sociocultural aspects of this process have not been explored. The current study examined how culture modulates the processing of crowd emotion in Korean and American observers. Korean and American participants were briefly presented with two groups of faces that were individually varying in emotional expressions and asked to choose which group between the two they would rather avoid. We found that Korean participants were more accurate than American participants overall, in line with the framework on cultural viewpoints: Holistic versus analytic processing in East Asians versus Westerners. Moreover, we found a speed advantage for other-race crowds in both cultural groups. Finally, we found different hemispheric lateralization patterns: American participants were more accurate for angry crowds presented in the left visual field and happy crowds presented in the right visual field, replicating previous studies, whereas Korean participants did not show an interaction between emotional valence and visual field. This work suggests that culture plays a role in modulating our crowd emotion perception of groups of faces and responses to them.</description>

	<description>Facial expression and eye gaze provide a shared signal about threats. While averted-gaze fear clearly points to the source of threat, direct-gaze fear renders the source of threat ambiguous. Dual processing routes have been proposed to mediate these processes: reflexive processing via magnocellular (M-) pathway and reflective processing via parvocellular (P-) pathway. We investigated how observers' trait anxiety modulates M- and P-pathway processing of clear and ambiguous threat cues. We performed fMRI on a large cohort (N=108) widely ranging in trait anxiety while they viewed fearful or neutral faces with averted or directed gaze. We adjusted luminance and color of the stimuli to selectively engage M- or P-pathway processing. We found that higher anxiety facilitated processing of averted-gaze fear projected to M-pathway, but impaired perception of direct-gaze fear projected to P-pathway. Increased right amygdala reactivity was associated with higher anxiety, only for averted-gaze fear presented to M-pathway. Conversely, increased left amygdala reactivity was associated with higher anxiety for P-biased, direct-gaze fear. This lateralization was more pronounced with higher anxiety. Our findings suggest that trait anxiety has differential effects on perception of clear and ambiguous facial threat cues via selective engagement of M and P pathways and lateralization of amygdala reactivity.</description>

	<description>Associating stimuli with positive or negative reinforcement is essential for survival, but a complete wiring diagram of a higher-order circuit supporting associative memory has not been previously available. We reconstructed one such circuit at synaptic resolution, the Drosophila larval mushroom body, and found that most Kenyon cells integrate random combinations of inputs but a subset receives stereotyped inputs from single projection neurons. This organization maximizes performance of a model output neuron on a stimulus discrimination task. We also report a novel canonical circuit in each mushroom body compartment with previously unidentified connections: reciprocal Kenyon cell to modulatory neuron connections, modulatory neuron to output neuron connections, and a surprisingly high number of recurrent connections between Kenyon cells. Stereotyped connections between output neurons could enhance the selection of learned responses. The complete circuit map of the mushroom body should guide future functional studies of this learning and memory center.</description>

	<description>People can employ adaptive strategies to increase the likelihood that previously encoded information will be successfully retrieved. One such strategy is to constrain retrieval towards relevant information by re-implementing the neurocognitive processes that were engaged during encoding. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we examined the temporal dynamics with which constraining retrieval towards semantic versus non-semantic information affects the processing of new &quot;foil&quot; information encountered during a memory test. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data acquired during an initial study phase revealed that semantic compared to non-semantic processing was associated with alpha decreases in a left frontal electrode cluster from around 600ms after stimulus onset. Successful encoding of semantic versus non-semantic foils during a subsequent memory test was related to decreases in alpha oscillatory activity in the same left frontal electrode cluster, which emerged relatively late in the trial at around 1000-1600ms after stimulus onset. Across subjects, left frontal alpha power elicited by semantic processing during the study phase correlated significantly with left frontal alpha power associated with semantic foil encoding during the memory test. Furthermore, larger left frontal alpha power decreases elicited by semantic foil encoding during the memory test predicted better subsequent semantic foil recognition in an additional surprise foil memory test. These findings indicate that constraining retrieval towards semantic information involves re-implementing semantic encoding operations that are mediated by alpha oscillations, and that such re-implementation occurs at a late stage of memory retrieval perhaps reflecting additional monitoring processes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Physical And Mental Health Status In Toxoplasma-Infected Women Before And Three Years After They Learn About Their Infection: The Role Of Rh Factor</title>

	<description>Latent toxoplasmosis is known to be associated with specific changes in animal and human behavior and human personality. Many toxoplasmosis-associated shifts, such as an extroversion-introversion shift or a trust-suspicion shift, go in opposite directions in men and women. The stress coping hypothesis suggests that such behavioral effects of toxoplasmosis are side effects of chronic stress caused by lifelong parasitosis and associated health disorders. Several studies have searched for, and typically found, indices of impaired health in infected subjects. However, subjects were always aware of their toxoplasmosis status, which could influence obtained data and cause false-positive results of the studies. Here we searched for differences in physical and mental health status among 39 Toxoplasma-infected and 40 Toxoplasma-free female university students who completed identical questionnaires (N-70, and anamnestic questionnaire), before and 3 years after they were informed of their toxoplasmosis status. Our results showed that infected women showed indices of poorer health status, not only after, but also before they were informed of their infection. In accordance with previously published data, these indices were more numerous and stronger in Rh-negative than in Rh-positive women. Present results suggest that observed indices of poorer health and symptoms of chronic stress in Toxoplasma-infected subjects are real. Due to its high (30%) prevalence, toxoplasmosis could represent an important factor for public health.</description>

	<description>Probabilistic proposals of Language of Thoughts (LoTs) can explain learning across different domains as statistical inference over a compositionally structured hypothesis space. While frameworks may differ on how a LoT may be implemented computationally, they all share the property that they are built from a set of atomic symbols and rules by which these symbols can be combined. In this work we show how the set of productions of a LoT grammar can be effectively selected from a broad repertoire of possible productions by an inferential process starting from experimental data. We then test this method in the language of geometry, a specific LoT model (Amalric et al., 2017). Finally, despite the fact of the geometrical LoT not being a universal (i.e. Turing-complete) language, we show an empirical relation between a sequence's probability and its complexity consistent with the theoretical relationship for universal languages described by the Coding Theorem.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Learning Fast And Slow: Deviations From The Matching Law Can Reflect An Optimal Strategy Under Uncertainty</title>

	<description>Behavior which deviates from our normative expectations often appears irrational. A classic example concerns the question of how choice should be distributed among multiple alternatives. The so called matching law predicts that the fraction of choices made to any option should match the fraction of total rewards earned from the option. This choice strategy can maximize reward in a stationary reward schedule. Empirically, however, behavior often deviates from this ideal. While such deviations have often been interpreted as reflecting noisy, sub-optimal, decision-making, here we instead suggest that they reflect a strategy which is adaptive in non-stationary and uncertain environments. We analyze the results of a dynamic foraging task. Animals exhibited significant deviations from matching, and animals turned out to be able to collect more rewards when deviation was larger. We show that this behavior can be understood if one considers that animals had incomplete information about the environment's dynamics. In particular, using computational models, we show that in such non-stationary environments, learning on both fast and slow timescales is beneficial. Learning on fast timescales means that an animal can react to sudden changes in the environment, though this inevitably introduces large fluctuations variance in value estimates. Concurrently, learning on slow timescales reduces the amplitude of these fluctuations at the price of introducing a bias that causes systematic deviations. We confirm this prediction in data -- animals indeed solved the bias-variance tradeoff by combining learning on both fast and slow timescales. Our work suggests that multi-timescale learning could be a biologically plausible mechanism for optimizing decisions under uncertainty.</description>

	<description>A key challenge for cognitive neuroscience is to decipher the representational schemes of the brain. A recent class of decoding algorithms for fMRI data, stimulus-feature-based encoding models, is becoming increasingly popular for inferring the dimensions of neural representational spaces from stimulus-feature spaces. We argue that such inferences are not always valid, because decoding can occur even if the neural representational space and the stimulus-feature space use different representational schemes. This can happen when there is a systematic mapping between them. In a simulation, we successfully decoded the binary representation of numbers from their decimal features. Since binary and decimal number systems use different representations, we cannot conclude that the binary representation encodes decimal features. The same argument applies to the decoding of neural patterns from stimulus-feature spaces and we urge caution in inferring the nature of the neural code from such methods. We discuss ways to overcome these inferential limitations.</description>

Chromosomal organization in 3D plays a central role in regulating cell-type specific transcriptional and DNA replication timing programs. Yet it remains unclear to what extent the resulting long-range contacts depend on specific molecular drivers. Here we propose a model that comprehensively assesses the influence on contacts of DNA-binding proteins, cis-regulatory elements and DNA consensus motifs. Using real data, we validate a large number of predictions for long-range contacts involving known architectural proteins and DNA motifs. Our model outperforms existing approaches including enrichment test, random forests and correlation, and it uncovers numerous novel long-range contacts in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and human. The model uncovers the orientation-dependent specificity for long-range contacts between CTCF motifs in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, highlighting its conserved property in 3D organization of metazoan genomes. Our model further unravels long-range contacts depending on co-factors recruited to DNA indirectly, as illustrated by the influence of cohesin in stabilizing long-range contacts between CTCF sites. It also reveals asymmetric contacts such as enhancer-promoter contacts that highlight opposite influences of the transcription factors EBF1, EGR1 or MEF2C depending on RNA Polymerase II pausing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oZ3iZ-1Rv7Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Overproduction or deficiency of many chaperones and other cellular components cure the yeast prions [PSI+] (formed by Sup35p) or [URE3] (based on Ure2p). However, at normal expression levels, Btn2p and Cur1p eliminate most newly arising [URE3] variants but do not cure [PSI+], even after overexpression. Deficiency or overproduction of Hsp104...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/E2pBamOInzg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>To investigate the mechanism that drives dramatic mistargeting of active chromatin in NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), we have identified protein interactions unique to the BRD4–NUT fusion oncoprotein compared with wild-type BRD4. Using cross-linking, affinity purification, and mass spectrometry, we identified the EP300 acetyltransferase as uniquely associated with BRD4 through the...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/EspMsfbQfkA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>T-cell receptor (TCR) triggering and subsequent T-cell activation are essential for the adaptive immune response. Recently, multiple lines of evidence have shown that force transduction across the TCR complex is involved during TCR triggering, and that the T cell might use its force-generation machinery to probe the mechanical properties of...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/JUVPGUcat1A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Integrins αVβ6 and αVβ8 are specialized for recognizing pro-TGF-β and activating its growth factor by releasing it from the latency imposed by its surrounding prodomain. The integrin αVβ8 is atypical among integrins in lacking sites in its cytoplasmic domain for binding to actin cytoskeleton adaptors. Here, we examine αVβ8 for...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/sfUdw8IKP0w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels control synaptic neurotransmission by converting chemical signals into electrical signals. Agonist binding leads to rapid signal transduction via an allosteric mechanism, where global protein conformational changes open a pore across the nerve cell membrane. We use all-atom molecular dynamics with a swarm-based string method to solve...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/Z8c7QycK56I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Cell–cell signaling is subject to variability in the extracellular volume, cell number, and dilution that potentially increase uncertainty in the absolute concentrations of the extracellular signaling molecules. To direct cell aggregation, the social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum collectively give rise to oscillations and waves of cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) under a...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/G89r6WMlDMQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

These rats show accumulation of microtubules throughout the cytoplasm as well as arrays along the endoplasmic reticulum of oligodendrocytes, as can be seen in the cytoplasm ringing the nucleus of this cell. The oligodendrocyte is surrounded by hypomyelinated and demyelinated axons, which are also seen in many patients with mutations in TUBB4A.

Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were either directly measured or calculated from total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apoA-I. The cohort was followed until the end of 2011. We used Cox models and mixed-effects models to, first, estimate the associations between these biomarkers and ALS incidence and, second, to assess the changes of these biomarkers during the 20 years before ALS diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24936-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One-unit increase of LDL-C (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02–1.27), apoB (HR = 1.68; 95% CI = 1.17–2.42), and apoB/apoA-I ratio (HR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.29–2.78) was associated with a higher incidence of ALS. High glucose level (≥6.11mmol/L) was associated with a lower incidence (HR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.42–0.93), whereas high LDL-C/HDL-C (≥3.50; HR = 1.50; 95% CI = 1.15–1.96) and high apoB/apoA-I (≥0.90 for men, ≥0.8 for women; HR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.04–1.90) ratios were associated with a higher incidence. During the 10 years before diagnosis, ALS patients had increasing levels of LDL-C, HDL-C, apoB, and apoA-I, whereas gradually decreasing levels of LDL-C/HDL-C and apoB/apoA-I ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24936-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alterations in the carbohydrate, lipid, and apolipoprotein metabolisms are associated with ALS risk and may serve as prodromal symptoms decades before ALS diagnosis. The imbalance between apoB and apoA-I as well as between LDL-C and HDL-C may be an etiological mechanism for ALS and needs to be further studied.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted scans provided data on the extent and dynamics of neuronal tissue damage and midsagittal tissue bridges at the epicenter of traumatic cervical spinal cord lesions in 24 subacute tetraplegic patients. At 1 month postinjury, smaller lesion area and midsagittal tissue bridges identified those patients with lower extremity evoked potentials and better clinical recovery. Wider midsagittal tissue bridges and smaller lesions at 1 month post-injury were associated with neurological and functional recovery at 1-year follow-up. Neuroimaging biomarkers of lesion size and midsagittal tissue bridges are potential outcome predictors and patient stratifiers in both subacute and chronic clinical trials.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Global exosome transcriptome profiling reveals biomarkers for multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24931</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24931-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence supports a role for exosomes in immune regulation. In this study, we investigated the total circulating exosome transcriptome in relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients and healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24931-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to define the global RNA profile of serum exosomes in 19 RRMS patients (9 in relapse, 10 in remission) and 10 HC. We analyzed 5 million reads and &amp;gt;50,000 transcripts per sample, including a detailed analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) differentially expressed in RRMS. The discovery set data were validated by quantification using digital quantitative polymerase chain reaction with an independent cohort of 63 RRMS patients (33 in relapse, 30 in remission) and 32 HC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24931-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exosomal RNA NGS revealed that of 15 different classes of transcripts detected, 4 circulating exosomal sequences within the miRNA category were differentially expressed in RRMS patients versus HC: hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-196b-5p, hsa-miR-301a-3p, and hsa-miR-532-5p. Serum exosomal expression of these miRNAs was significantly decreased during relapse in RRMS. These miRNAs were also decreased in patients with a gadolinium enhancement on brain magnetic resonance imaging. In vitro secretion of these miRNAs by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also significantly impaired in RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24931-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data show that circulating exosomes have a distinct RNA profile in RRMS. Because putative targets for these miRNAs include the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and the cell cycle regulator aryl hydrocarbon receptor, the data suggest a disturbed cell-to-cell communication in this disease. Thus, exosomal miRNAs might represent a useful biomarker to distinguish multiple sclerosis relapse. Ann Neurol 2017;81:703–717&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Tailoring epilepsy surgery with fast ripples in the intraoperative electrocorticogram</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24928</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24928-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) can be used to delineate the resection area in epilepsy surgery. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs; 80–500 Hz) seem better biomarkers for epileptogenic tissue than spikes. We studied how HFOs and spikes in combined pre- and postresection ECoG predict surgical outcome in different tailoring approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24928-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We, retrospectively, marked HFOs, divided into fast ripples (FRs; 250–500 Hz) and ripples (80–250 Hz), and spikes in pre- and postresection ECoG sampled at 2,048 Hz in people with refractory focal epilepsy. We defined four groups of electroencephalography (EEG) event occurrence: pre+post− (+/−), pre+post+ (+/+), pre−post+ (−/+) and pre−post− (−/−). We subcategorized three tailoring approaches: hippocampectomy with tailoring for neocortical involvement; lesionectomy of temporal lesions with tailoring for mesiotemporal involvement; and lesionectomy with tailoring for surrounding neocortical involvement. We compared the percentage of resected pre-EEG events, time to recurrence, and the different tailoring approaches to outcome (seizure-free vs recurrence).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24928-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We included 54 patients (median age, 15.5 years; 25 months of follow-up; 30 seizure free). The percentage of resected FRs, ripples, or spikes in pre-ECoG did not predict outcome. The occurrence of FRs in post-ECoG, given FRs in pre-ECoG (+/−, +/+), predicted outcome (hazard ratio, 3.13; confidence interval = 1.22–6.25; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01). Seven of 8 patients without spikes in pre-ECoG were seizure free. The highest predictive value for seizure recurrence was presence of FRs in post-ECoG for all tailoring approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24928-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRs that persist before and after resection predict poor postsurgical outcome. These findings hold for different tailoring approaches. FRs can thus be used for tailoring epilepsy surgery with repeated intraoperative ECoG measurements.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Randomized clinical trial of deep brain stimulation for poststroke pain</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24927-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience with deep brain stimulation (DBS) for pain is largely based on uncontrolled studies targeting the somatosensory pathways, with mixed results. We hypothesized that targeting limbic neural pathways would modulate the affective sphere of pain and alleviate suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24927-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of DBS targeting the ventral striatum/anterior limb of the internal capsule (VS/ALIC) in 10 patients with poststroke pain syndrome. One month after bilateral DBS, patients were randomized to active DBS or sham for 3 months, followed by crossover for another 3-month period. The primary endpoint was a ≥50% improvement on the Pain Disability Index in 50% of patients with active DBS compared to sham. This 6-month blinded phase was followed by an 18-month open stimulation phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24927-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine participants completed randomization. Although this trial was negative for its primary and secondary endpoints, we did observe significant differences in multiple outcome measures related to the affective sphere of pain (eg, Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Affective Pain Rating Index of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire). Fourteen serious adverse events were recorded and resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24927-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;VS/ALIC DBS to modulate the affective sphere of pain represents a paradigm shift in chronic pain management. Although this exploratory study was negative for its primary endpoint, VS/ALIC DBS demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and statistically significant improvements on multiple outcome measures related to the affective sphere of pain. Therefore, we believe these results justify further work on neuromodulation therapies targeting the affective sphere of pain.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24938-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess prognostic factors for a second clinical attack and a first disability-worsening event in pediatric clinically isolated syndrome (pCIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24938-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cohort of 770 pCIS patients was followed up for at least 10 years. Cox proportional hazard models and Recursive Partitioning and Amalgamation (RECPAM) tree-regression were used to analyze data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24938-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In pCIS, female sex and a multifocal onset were risk factors for a second clinical attack (hazard ratio [HR], 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28, 1.06–1.55; 1.42, 1.10–1.84, respectively), whereas disease-modifying drug (DMD) exposure reduced this risk (HR, 95% CI = 0.75, 0.60–0.95). After pediatric onset MS (POMS) diagnosis, age at onset younger than 15 years and DMD exposure decreased the risk of a first Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)-worsening event (HR, 95% CI = 0.59, 0.42–0.83; 0.75, 0.71–0.80, respectively), whereas the occurrence of relapse increased this risk (HR, 95% CI = 5.08, 3.46–7.46). An exploratory RECPAM analysis highlighted a significantly higher incidence of a first EDSS-worsening event in patients with multifocal or isolated spinal cord or optic neuritis involvement at onset in comparison to those with an isolated supratentorial or brainstem syndrome. A Cox regression model including RECPAM classes confirmed DMD exposure as the most protective factor against EDSS-worsening events and relapses as the most important risk factor for attaining EDSS worsening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24938-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work represents a step forward in identifying predictors of unfavorable course in pCIS and POMS and supports a protective effect of early DMD treatment in preventing MS development and disability accumulation in this population.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24929-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To comprehensively describe the new syndrome of myoclonus epilepsy and ataxia due to potassium channel mutation (MEAK), including cellular electrophysiological characterization of observed clinical improvement with fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24929-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed clinical, electroclinical, and neuroimaging data for 20 patients with MEAK due to recurrent &lt;em&gt;KCNC1&lt;/em&gt; p.R320H mutation. In vitro electrophysiological studies were conducted using whole cell patch-clamp to explore biophysical properties of wild-type and mutant K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1 channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24929-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms began at between 3 and 15 years of age (median = 9.5), with progressively severe myoclonus and rare tonic–clonic seizures. Ataxia was present early, but quickly became overshadowed by myoclonus; 10 patients were wheelchair-bound by their late teenage years. Mild cognitive decline occurred in half. Early death was not observed. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed generalized spike and polyspike wave discharges, with documented photosensitivity in most. Polygraphic EEG–electromyographic studies demonstrated a cortical origin for myoclonus and striking coactivation of agonist and antagonist muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed symmetrical cerebellar atrophy, which appeared progressive, and a prominent corpus callosum. Unexpectedly, transient clinical improvement with fever was noted in 6 patients. To explore this, we performed high-temperature in vitro recordings. At elevated temperatures, there was a robust leftward shift in activation of wild-type K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1, increasing channel availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24929-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEAK has a relatively homogeneous presentation, resembling Unverricht–Lundborg disease, despite the genetic and biological basis being quite different. A remarkable improvement with fever may be explained by the temperature-dependent leftward shift in activation of wild-type K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.1 subunit–containing channels, which would counter the loss of function observed for mutant channels, highlighting &lt;em&gt;KCNC1&lt;/em&gt; as a potential target for precision therapeutics.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Feedback inhibition shapes emergent computational properties of cortical microcircuit motifs. (arXiv:1705.07614v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07614</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07614</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical microcircuits are very complex networks, but they are composed of a
relatively small number of stereotypical motifs. Hence one strategy for
throwing light on the computational function of cortical microcircuits is to
analyze emergent computational properties of these stereotypical microcircuit
motifs. We are addressing here the question how spike-timing dependent
plasticity (STDP) shapes the computational properties of one motif that has
frequently been studied experimentally: interconnected populations of pyramidal
cells and parvalbumin-positive inhibitory cells in layer 2/3. Experimental
studies suggest that these inhibitory neurons exert some form of divisive
inhibition on the pyramidal cells. We show that this data-based form of
feedback inhibition, which is softer than that of winner-take-all models that
are commonly considered in theoretical analyses, contributes to the emergence
of an important computational function through STDP: The capability to
disentangle superimposed firing patterns in upstream networks, and to represent
their information content through a sparse assembly code.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Exponential Capacity in an Autoencoder Neural Network with a Hidden Layer. (arXiv:1705.07441v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07441</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07441</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental aspect of limitations in learning any computation in neural
architectures is characterizing their optimal capacities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important, widely-used neural architecture is known as autoencoders where
the network reconstructs the input at the output layer via a representation at
a hidden layer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though capacities of several neural architectures have been addressed
using statistical physics methods, the capacity of autoencoder neural networks
is not well-explored.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we analytically show that an autoencoder network of binary neurons with
a hidden layer can achieve a capacity that grows exponentially with network
size.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network has fixed random weights encoding a set of dense input patterns
into a dense, expanded (or \emph{overcomplete}) hidden layer representation. A
set of learnable weights decodes the input patters at the output layer. We
perform a mean-field approximation of the model to reduce the model to a
perceptron problem with an input-output dependency. Carrying out Gardner's
\emph{replica} calculation, we show that as the expansion ratio, defined as the
number of hidden units over the number of input units, increases, the
autoencoding capacity grows exponentially even when the sparseness or the
coding level of the hidden layer representation is changed. The
replica-symmetric solution is locally stable and is in good agreement with
simulation results obtained using a local learning rule. In addition, the
degree of symmetry between the encoding and decoding weights monotonically
increases with the expansion ratio.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Self-adjoint eigenvalue problems with low rank perturbations. (arXiv:1705.07360v1 [math.SP])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07360</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07360</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider the problem of finding the spectrum of an operator taking the
form of a low-rank (rank one or two) non-normal perturbation of a self-adjoint
operator, motivated by a number of problems of applied interest which take this
form. We use the fact that the system is a low rank perturbation of a symmetric
problem, together with a simple idea of classical differential geometry (the
envelope of a family of curves) to completely analyze the spectrum of this type
of operator. We use these techniques to analyze three problems of this form: a
model of the oculomotor integrator due to Anastasio and Gad (2007), a continuum
integrator model, and a nonlocal model of phase separation due to Rubinstein
and Sternberg (1992).

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The repetition of behavioral assessments in diagnosis of disorders of consciousness</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24962</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24962</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To determine whether repeated examinations using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised have an impact on diagnostic accuracy of patients with disorders of consciousness and to provide guidelines regarding the number of assessments required for obtaining a reliable diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: 123 adult patients with chronic disorders of consciousness were referred to our tertiary center. They were assessed at least 6 times with the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised within a 10-day period. Clinical diagnoses based on 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Coma Recovery Scale-Revised assessments were compared with a reference diagnosis (i.e., the highest behavioral diagnosis obtained after 6 evaluations) using non-parametric statistics. Results were considered significant at &lt;em&gt;P&amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt;0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: The number of assessments had a significant effect on the clinical diagnosis. Up to the fourth examination, the diagnosis was still statistically different from the reference diagnosis based on 6 CRS-R assessments. Compared to this reference diagnosis, the first evaluation led to 36% of misdiagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: The number of Coma Recovery Scale-Revised assessments has an impact on the clinical diagnosis of patients with chronic disorders of consciousness. Up to the fourth examinations, behavioral fluctuations may still impact the diagnostic accuracy. We here suggest performing at least 5 assessments in each patient with disorders of consciousness within a short time interval (e.g., 2 weeks) to reduce misdiagnosis.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: There is a need for inexpensive non-invasive tests to identify older healthy persons at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) for enrollment in AD prevention trials. Our objective was to examine whether abnormalities in neuroimaging measures of amyloid and neurodegeneration are correlated with odor identification (OI) in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Cognitively normal (CN) participants had olfactory function assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT), underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; n=829) to assess a composite Alzheimer's disease (AD) signature cortical thickness and hippocampal volume (HVa), and, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-Pittsburgh compound B (&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-PiB; n=306) and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;fluorodeoxyglucose (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG; n=305) positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to assess amyloid accumulation and brain hypometabolism, respectively. The association of neuroimaging biomarkers with OI was examined using multinomial logistic regression and simple linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Among 829 CN participants (mean age 79.2 years; 51.5% men), 248 (29.9%) were normosmic and 78 (9.4%) had anosmia (B-SIT score &amp;lt;6). Abnormal AD signature cortical thickness and reduced HVa were associated with decreased OI as a continuous measure (slope=-.43; (95%CI -.77, -.09); p=.01 and slope=-.72; (95%CI -1.15, -.28); &amp;lt;.01, respectively). Reduced HVa, decreased AD signature cortical thickness and increased amyloid accumulation were significantly associated with increased odds of anosmia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our findings suggest that OI may be a non-invasive, inexpensive marker for risk stratification, for identifying participants at the preclinical stage of AD who may be at risk for cognitive impairment, and eligible for inclusion in AD prevention clinical trials. These cross-sectional findings remain to be validated prospectively. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We attempt to correlate the clinical pharmacology of dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) in Parkinson Disease with known features of striatal dopamine actions. Despite its obvious impact, DRT does not normalize motor function, likely due to disrupted phasic dopaminergic signaling. The DRT Short Duration Response is likely a permissive-paracrine effect, possibly resulting from dopaminergic support of corticostriate synaptic plasticity. The DRT Long Duration Response may result from mimicry of tonic dopamine signaling regulation of movement vigor. Our understanding of dopamine actions does not explain important aspects of DRT clinical pharmacology. Reducing these knowledge gaps provides opportunities to improve understanding of dopamine actions and symptomatic treatment of Parkinson disease. This article is protected by copyright.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Rodrigo D. Requião, Luiza Fernandes, Henrique José Araujo de Souza, Silvana Rossetto, Tatiana Domitrovic, Fernando L. Palhano&lt;/p&gt;

As proteins are synthesized, the nascent polypeptide must pass through a negatively charged exit tunnel. During this stage, positively charged stretches can interact with the ribosome walls and slow the translation. Therefore, charged polypeptides may be important factors that affect protein expression. To determine the frequency and distribution of positively and negatively charged stretches in different proteomes, the net charge was calculated for every 30 consecutive amino acid residues, which corresponds to the length of the ribosome exit tunnel. The following annotated and reviewed proteins in the UniProt database (Swiss-Prot) were analyzed: 551,705 proteins from different organisms and a total of 180 million protein segments. We observed that there were more negative than positive stretches and that super-charged positive sequences (i.e., net charges ≥ 14) were underrepresented in the proteomes. Overall, the proteins were more positively charged at their N-termini and C-termini, and this feature was present in most organisms and subcellular localizations. To investigate whether the N-terminal charges affect the elongation rates, previously published ribosomal profiling data obtained from &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, without translation-interfering drugs, were analyzed. We observed a nonlinear effect of the charge on the ribosome occupancy in which values ≥ +5 and ≤ -6 showed increased and reduced ribosome densities, respectively. These groups also showed different distributions across 80S monosomes and polysomes. Basic polypeptides are more common within short proteins that are translated by monosomes, whereas negative stretches are more abundant in polysome-translated proteins. These findings suggest that the nascent peptide charge impacts translation and can be one of the factors that regulate translation efficiency and protein expression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Kxt6p83cHKs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: BacArena: Individual-based metabolic modeling of heterogeneous microbes in complex communities</title>

Recent advances focusing on the metabolic interactions within and between cellular populations have emphasized the importance of microbial communities for human health. Constraint-based modeling, with flux balance analysis in particular, has been established as a key approach for studying microbial metabolism, whereas individual-based modeling has been commonly used to study complex dynamics between interacting organisms. In this study, we combine both techniques into the R package BacArena (https://cran.r-project.org/package=BacArena) to generate novel biological insights into &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; biofilm formation as well as a seven species model community of the human gut. For our &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; model, we found that cross-feeding of fermentation products cause a spatial differentiation of emerging metabolic phenotypes in the biofilm over time. In the human gut model community, we found that spatial gradients of mucus glycans are important for niche formations which shape the overall community structure. Additionally, we could provide novel hypothesis concerning the metabolic interactions between the microbes. These results demonstrate the importance of spatial and temporal multi-scale modeling approaches such as BacArena.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eHxdBudYIgU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Multi-scale computational study of the mechanical regulation of cell mitotic rounding in epithelia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005533</guid>

Mitotic rounding during cell division is critical for preventing daughter cells from inheriting an abnormal number of chromosomes, a condition that occurs frequently in cancer cells. Cells must significantly expand their apical area and transition from a polygonal to circular apical shape to achieve robust mitotic rounding in epithelial tissues, which is where most cancers initiate. However, how cells mechanically regulate robust mitotic rounding within packed tissues is unknown. Here, we analyze mitotic rounding using a newly developed multi-scale subcellular element computational model that is calibrated using experimental data. Novel biologically relevant features of the model include separate representations of the sub-cellular components including the apical membrane and cytoplasm of the cell at the tissue scale level as well as detailed description of cell properties during mitotic rounding. Regression analysis of predictive model simulation results reveals the relative contributions of osmotic pressure, cell-cell adhesion and cortical stiffness to mitotic rounding. Mitotic area expansion is largely driven by regulation of cytoplasmic pressure. Surprisingly, mitotic shape roundness within physiological ranges is most sensitive to variation in cell-cell adhesivity and stiffness. An understanding of how perturbed mechanical properties impact mitotic rounding has important potential implications on, amongst others, how tumors progressively become more genetically unstable due to increased chromosomal aneuploidy and more aggressive.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x6-F3T8uB38&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: PyLDM - An open source package for lifetime density analysis of time-resolved spectroscopic data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005528</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriel F. Dorlhiac, Clyde Fare, Jasper J. van Thor&lt;/p&gt;

Ultrafast spectroscopy offers temporal resolution for probing processes in the femto- and picosecond regimes. This has allowed for investigation of energy and charge transfer in numerous photoactive compounds and complexes. However, analysis of the resultant data can be complicated, particularly in more complex biological systems, such as photosystems. Historically, the dual approach of global analysis and target modelling has been used to elucidate kinetic descriptions of the system, and the identity of transient species respectively. With regards to the former, the technique of lifetime density analysis (LDA) offers an appealing alternative. While global analysis approximates the data to the sum of a small number of exponential decays, typically on the order of 2-4, LDA uses a semi-continuous distribution of 100 lifetimes. This allows for the elucidation of lifetime distributions, which may be expected from investigation of complex systems with many chromophores, as opposed to averages. Furthermore, the inherent assumption of linear combinations of decays in global analysis means the technique is unable to describe dynamic motion, a process which is resolvable with LDA. The technique was introduced to the field of photosynthesis over a decade ago by the Holzwarth group. The analysis has been demonstrated to be an important tool to evaluate complex dynamics such as photosynthetic energy transfer, and complements traditional global and target analysis techniques. Although theory has been well described, no open source code has so far been available to perform lifetime density analysis. Therefore, we introduce a python (2.7) based package, PyLDM, to address this need. We furthermore provide a direct comparison of the capabilities of LDA with those of the more familiar global analysis, as well as providing a number of statistical techniques for dealing with the regularization of noisy data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dEpjjfoGzDo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Here, we present a novel approach to solve the problem of reconstructing
perceived stimuli from brain responses by combining probabilistic inference
with deep learning. Our approach first inverts the linear transformation from
latent features to brain responses with maximum a posteriori estimation and
then inverts the nonlinear transformation from perceived stimuli to latent
features with adversarial training of convolutional neural networks. We test
our approach with a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment and show
that it can generate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perceived faces from
brain activations.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Automatically tracking neurons in a moving and deforming brain</title>

Advances in optical neuroimaging techniques now allow neural activity to be recorded with cellular resolution in awake and behaving animals. Brain motion in these recordings pose a unique challenge. The location of individual neurons must be tracked in 3D over time to accurately extract single neuron activity traces. Recordings from small invertebrates like &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; are especially challenging because they undergo very large brain motion and deformation during animal movement. Here we present an automated computer vision pipeline to reliably track populations of neurons with single neuron resolution in the brain of a freely moving &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; undergoing large motion and deformation. 3D volumetric fluorescent images of the animal’s brain are straightened, aligned and registered, and the locations of neurons in the images are found via segmentation. Each neuron is then assigned an identity using a new time-independent machine-learning approach we call Neuron Registration Vector Encoding. In this approach, non-rigid point-set registration is used to match each segmented neuron in each volume with a set of reference volumes taken from throughout the recording. The way each neuron matches with the references defines a feature vector which is clustered to assign an identity to each neuron in each volume. Finally, thin-plate spline interpolation is used to correct errors in segmentation and check consistency of assigned identities. The Neuron Registration Vector Encoding approach proposed here is uniquely well suited for tracking neurons in brains undergoing large deformations. When applied to whole-brain calcium imaging recordings in freely moving &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, this analysis pipeline located 156 neurons for the duration of an 8 minute recording and consistently found more neurons more quickly than manual or semi-automated approaches.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zRAXjBpewI8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Simultaneous inference of phylogenetic and transmission trees in infectious disease outbreaks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005495</guid>

Whole-genome sequencing of pathogens from host samples becomes more and more routine during infectious disease outbreaks. These data provide information on possible transmission events which can be used for further epidemiologic analyses, such as identification of risk factors for infectivity and transmission. However, the relationship between transmission events and sequence data is obscured by uncertainty arising from four largely unobserved processes: transmission, case observation, within-host pathogen dynamics and mutation. To properly resolve transmission events, these processes need to be taken into account. Recent years have seen much progress in theory and method development, but existing applications make simplifying assumptions that often break up the dependency between the four processes, or are tailored to specific datasets with matching model assumptions and code. To obtain a method with wider applicability, we have developed a novel approach to reconstruct transmission trees with sequence data. Our approach combines elementary models for transmission, case observation, within-host pathogen dynamics, and mutation, under the assumption that the outbreak is over and all cases have been observed. We use Bayesian inference with MCMC for which we have designed novel proposal steps to efficiently traverse the posterior distribution, taking account of all unobserved processes at once. This allows for efficient sampling of transmission trees from the posterior distribution, and robust estimation of consensus transmission trees. We implemented the proposed method in a new R package &lt;i&gt;phybreak&lt;/i&gt;. The method performs well in tests of both new and published simulated data. We apply the model to five datasets on densely sampled infectious disease outbreaks, covering a wide range of epidemiological settings. Using only sampling times and sequences as data, our analyses confirmed the original results or improved on them: the more realistic infection times place more confidence in the inferred transmission trees.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UKIrSUeOxbk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Transcriptomics technologies</title>

Transcriptomics technologies are the techniques used to study an organism’s transcriptome, the sum of all of its RNA transcripts. The information content of an organism is recorded in the DNA of its genome and expressed through transcription. Here, mRNA serves as a transient intermediary molecule in the information network, whilst noncoding RNAs perform additional diverse functions. A transcriptome captures a snapshot in time of the total transcripts present in a cell.
The first attempts to study the whole transcriptome began in the early 1990s, and technological advances since the late 1990s have made transcriptomics a widespread discipline. Transcriptomics has been defined by repeated technological innovations that transform the field. There are two key contemporary techniques in the field: microarrays, which quantify a set of predetermined sequences, and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), which uses high-throughput sequencing to capture all sequences.
Measuring the expression of an organism’s genes in different tissues, conditions, or time points gives information on how genes are regulated and reveals details of an organism’s biology. It can also help to infer the functions of previously unannotated genes. Transcriptomic analysis has enabled the study of how gene expression changes in different organisms and has been instrumental in the understanding of human disease. An analysis of gene expression in its entirety allows detection of broad coordinated trends which cannot be discerned by more targeted assays.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2WsdgJiNTtE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Dreaming was thought to be confined to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which occurs during periods of high-frequency electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, but, more recently, dreaming has been observed during periods of non-REM sleep, which is characterized by low-frequency EEG activity. Monitoring brain activity using high-density &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neocortex is the most recently evolved part of the brain, and, in this study, RNA sequencing was performed on individual layers of the prefrontal cortex from humans, macaques and chimpanzees and revealed that, although the expression of most genes was conserved across all three &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During embryonic development, spinal commissural axons extend towards the floor plate (FP), guided by the axon guidance molecule netrin 1, but the source of netrin 1 is a matter of debate. In the developing spinal cord, netrin 1 is expressed by FP cells and progenitor &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory formation requires representations of new information to be efficiently encoded by the brain memory network. Here, the authors used multivariate classification to determine encoding states that were predictive of later recall and those that were likely to lead to forgetting.

Gene regulatory and metabolic network models have been used successfully in many organisms, but inherent differences between them make networks difficult to integrate. Probabilistic Regulation Of Metabolism (PROM) provides a partial solution, but it does not incorporate network inference and underperforms in eukaryotes. We present an Integrated Deduced And Metabolism (IDREAM) method that combines statistically inferred Environment and Gene Regulatory Influence Network (EGRIN) models with the PROM framework to create enhanced metabolic-regulatory network models. We used IDREAM to predict phenotypes and genetic interactions between transcription factors and genes encoding metabolic activities in the eukaryote, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. IDREAM models contain many fewer interactions than PROM and yet produce significantly more accurate growth predictions. IDREAM consistently outperformed PROM using any of three popular yeast metabolic models and across three experimental growth conditions. Importantly, IDREAM’s enhanced accuracy makes it possible to identify subtle synthetic growth defects. With experimental validation, these novel genetic interactions involving the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex suggested a new role for fatty acid-responsive factor Oaf1 in regulating acetyl-CoA production in glucose grown cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9DmSJoTlfGg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sodium Channel Nav1.8 Underlies TTX-Resistant Axonal Action Potential Conduction in Somatosensory C-Fibers of Distal Cutaneous Nerves</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5204?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Voltage-gated sodium (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) channels are responsible for the initiation and conduction of action potentials within primary afferents. The nine Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channel isoforms recognized in mammals are often functionally divided into tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive (TTX-s) channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1–Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4, Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.6–Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7) that are blocked by nanomolar concentrations and TTX-resistant (TTX-r) channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 and Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.9) inhibited by millimolar concentrations, with Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.5 having an intermediate toxin sensitivity. For small-diameter primary afferent neurons, it is unclear to what extent different Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channel isoforms are distributed along the peripheral and central branches of their bifurcated axons. To determine the relative contribution of TTX-s and TTX-r channels to action potential conduction in different axonal compartments, we investigated the effects of TTX on C-fiber-mediated compound action potentials (C-CAPs) of proximal and distal peripheral nerve segments and dorsal roots from mice and pigtail monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca nemestrina&lt;/i&gt;). In the dorsal roots and proximal peripheral nerves of mice and nonhuman primates, TTX reduced the C-CAP amplitude to 16% of the baseline. In contrast, &amp;gt;30% of the C-CAP was resistant to TTX in distal peripheral branches of monkeys and WT and Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.9&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. In nerves from Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, TTX-r C-CAPs could not be detected. These data indicate that Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 is the primary isoform underlying TTX-r conduction in distal axons of somatosensory C-fibers. Furthermore, there is a differential spatial distribution of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 within C-fiber axons, being functionally more prominent in the most distal axons and terminal regions. The enrichment of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 in distal axons may provide a useful target in the treatment of pain of peripheral origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is unclear whether individual sodium channel isoforms exert differential roles in action potential conduction along the axonal membrane of nociceptive, unmyelinated peripheral nerve fibers, but clarifying the role of sodium channel subtypes in different axonal segments may be useful for the development of novel analgesic strategies. Here, we provide evidence from mice and nonhuman primates that a substantial portion of the C-fiber compound action potential in distal peripheral nerves, but not proximal nerves or dorsal roots, is resistant to tetrodotoxin and that, in mice, this effect is mediated solely by voltage-gated sodium channel 1.8 (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8). The functional prominence of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 within the axonal compartment immediately proximal to its termination may affect strategies targeting pain of peripheral origin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dissociation of Choice Formation and Choice-Correlated Activity in Macaque Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5195?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5195?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Responses of individual task-relevant sensory neurons can predict monkeys' trial-by-trial choices in perceptual decision-making tasks. Choice-correlated activity has been interpreted as evidence that the responses of these neurons are causally linked to perceptual judgments. To further test this hypothesis, we studied responses of orientation-selective neurons in V1 and V2 while two macaque monkeys performed a fine orientation discrimination task. Although both animals exhibited a high level of neuronal and behavioral sensitivity, only one exhibited choice-correlated activity. Surprisingly, this correlation was negative: when a neuron fired more vigorously, the animal was less likely to choose the orientation preferred by that neuron. Moreover, choice-correlated activity emerged late in the trial, earlier in V2 than in V1, and was correlated with anticipatory signals. Together, these results suggest that choice-correlated activity in task-relevant sensory neurons can reflect postdecision modulatory signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When observers perform a difficult sensory discrimination, repeated presentations of the same stimulus can elicit different perceptual judgments. This behavioral variability often correlates with variability in the activity of sensory neurons driven by the stimulus. Traditionally, this correlation has been interpreted as suggesting a causal link between the activity of sensory neurons and perceptual judgments. More recently, it has been argued that the correlation instead may originate in recurrent input from other brain areas involved in the interpretation of sensory signals. Here, we call both hypotheses into question. We show that choice-related activity in sensory neurons can be highly variable across observers and can reflect modulatory processes that are dissociated from perceptual decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multisensory Integration Uses a Real-Time Unisensory-Multisensory Transform</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5183?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/20/5183?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The manner in which the brain integrates different sensory inputs to facilitate perception and behavior has been the subject of numerous speculations. By examining multisensory neurons in cat superior colliculus, the present study demonstrated that two operational principles are sufficient to understand how this remarkable result is achieved: (1) unisensory signals are integrated continuously and in real time as soon as they arrive at their common target neuron and (2) the resultant multisensory computation is modified in shape and timing by a delayed, calibrating inhibition. These principles were tested for descriptive sufficiency by embedding them in a neurocomputational model and using it to predict a neuron's moment-by-moment multisensory response given only knowledge of its responses to the individual modality-specific component cues. The predictions proved to be highly accurate, reliable, and unbiased and were, in most cases, not statistically distinguishable from the neuron's actual instantaneous multisensory response at any phase throughout its entire duration. The model was also able to explain why different multisensory products are often observed in different neurons at different time points, as well as the higher-order properties of multisensory integration, such as the dependency of multisensory products on the temporal alignment of crossmodal cues. These observations not only reveal this fundamental integrative operation, but also identify quantitatively the multisensory transform used by each neuron. As a result, they provide a means of comparing the integrative profiles among neurons and evaluating how they are affected by changes in intrinsic or extrinsic factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Multisensory integration is the process by which the brain combines information from multiple sensory sources (e.g., vision and audition) to maximize an organism's ability to identify and respond to environmental stimuli. The actual transformative process by which the neural products of multisensory integration are achieved is poorly understood. By focusing on the millisecond-by-millisecond differences between a neuron's unisensory component responses and its integrated multisensory response, it was found that this multisensory transform can be described by two basic principles: unisensory information is integrated in real time and the multisensory response is shaped by calibrating inhibition. It is now possible to use these principles to predict a neuron's multisensory response accurately armed only with knowledge of its unisensory responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24954</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/span&gt;: Neurofilament light chains (NfL) are unique to neuronal cells, are shed to the CSF and are detectable at low concentrations in peripheral blood. Various diseases causing neuronal damage have resulted in elevated CSF concentrations. We explored the value of an ultrasensitive single-molecule array (Simoa) serum NfL (sNfL) assay in MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/span&gt;: sNfL levels were measured in healthy controls (HC, n=254) and two independent MS cohorts: (1) cross-sectional with paired serum and CSF samples (n=142); (2) longitudinal with repeated serum sampling (n=246, median (IQR) follow-up 3.1 (2.0-4.0) years). We assessed their relation to concurrent clinical, imaging and treatment parameters and to future clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Results&lt;/span&gt;: sNfL levels were higher in both MS cohorts than in HC (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). We found a strong association between CSF NfL and sNfL (β=0.589, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). Patients with either brain or spinal (43.4 (25.2-65.3) pg/ml) or both brain and spinal gadolinium enhancing lesions (62.5 (42.7-71.4) pg/ml) had higher sNfL than those without (29.6 (20.9-41.8) pg/ml; β=1.461, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.005 and β=1.902, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.002 respectively). sNfL was independently associated with EDSS assessments (β=1.105, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) and presence of relapses (β=1.430, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). sNfL levels were lower under disease modifying treatment (β=0.818, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.003). Patients with sNfL levels above the 80&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 90&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 97.5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 99&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; HC based percentiles had higher risk of relapses (97.5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile: IRR=1.94, 95%CI=1.21-3.10, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.006) and EDSS worsening (97.5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile: OR=2.41, 95%CI=1.07-5.42, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.034).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Interpretation&lt;/span&gt;: These results support the value of sNfL as a sensitive and clinically meaningful blood biomarker to monitor tissue damage and the effects of therapies in MS.

	<description>Astrocytes are the most populous glial subtype and are critical for brain function. Despite this, historically there have been few studies into the role that they may have in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recently, however, several studies have determined that genes known to have a causative role in the development of PD are expressed in astrocytes and have important roles in astrocyte function. Here, we review these recent developments and discuss their impact on our understanding of the pathophysiology of PD, and the implications that this might have for its treatment.</description>

	<description>Synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7) was originally identified as a slow Ca2+ sensor for lysosome fusion, but its function at fast synapses is controversial. The paper by Luo and Südhof (2017) in this issue of Neuron shows that at the calyx of Held in the auditory brainstem Syt7 triggers asynchronous release during stimulus trains, resulting in reliable and temporally precise high-frequency transmission. Thus, a slow Ca2+ sensor contributes to the fast signaling properties of the calyx synapse.</description>

	<description>In the early 1960s, few neuroscientists attempted to model brain function using mathematics. Computers were slow and expensive, so numerical approximations of complex phenomena were out of reach in most cases, and scientists resorted primarily to analytical representations of simpler processes. The study of circuits was not new to Walter J. Freeman. He had started his education studying engineering at MIT (transferring later to the University of Chicago to study English) and was a radio operator in WWII.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: High-order epistasis shapes evolutionary trajectories</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Zachary R. Sailer, Michael J. Harms&lt;/p&gt;

High-order epistasis—where the effect of a mutation is determined by interactions with two or more other mutations—makes small, but detectable, contributions to genotype-fitness maps. While epistasis between pairs of mutations is known to be an important determinant of evolutionary trajectories, the evolutionary consequences of high-order epistasis remain poorly understood. To determine the effect of high-order epistasis on evolutionary trajectories, we computationally removed high-order epistasis from experimental genotype-fitness maps containing all binary combinations of five mutations. We then compared trajectories through maps both with and without high-order epistasis. We found that high-order epistasis strongly shapes the accessibility and probability of evolutionary trajectories. A closer analysis revealed that the magnitude of epistasis, not its order, predicts is effects on evolutionary trajectories. We further find that high-order epistasis makes it impossible to predict evolutionary trajectories from the individual and paired effects of mutations. We therefore conclude that high-order epistasis profoundly shapes evolutionary trajectories through genotype-fitness maps.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NtwkDDZsJfQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: SteadyCom: Predicting microbial abundances while ensuring community stability</title>

Genome-scale metabolic modeling has become widespread for analyzing microbial metabolism. Extending this established paradigm to more complex microbial communities is emerging as a promising way to unravel the interactions and biochemical repertoire of these omnipresent systems. While several modeling techniques have been developed for microbial communities, little emphasis has been placed on the need to impose a time-averaged constant growth rate across all members for a community to ensure co-existence and stability. In the absence of this constraint, the faster growing organism will ultimately displace all other microbes in the community. This is particularly important for predicting steady-state microbiota composition as it imposes significant restrictions on the allowable community membership, composition and phenotypes. In this study, we introduce the SteadyCom optimization framework for predicting metabolic flux distributions consistent with the steady-state requirement. SteadyCom can be rapidly converged by iteratively solving linear programming (LP) problem and the number of iterations is independent of the number of organisms. A significant advantage of SteadyCom is compatibility with flux variability analysis. SteadyCom is first demonstrated for a community of four &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; double auxotrophic mutants and is then applied to a gut microbiota model consisting of nine species, with representatives from the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. In contrast to the direct use of FBA, SteadyCom is able to predict the change in species abundance in response to changes in diets with minimal additional imposed constraints on the model. By randomizing the uptake rates of microbes, an abundance profile with a good agreement to experimental gut microbiota is inferred. SteadyCom provides an important step towards the cross-cutting task of predicting the composition of a microbial community in a given environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aaCKYVh0KtY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: An independent component analysis confounding factor correction framework for identifying broad impact expression quantitative trait loci</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005537</guid>

Genome-wide expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) studies in humans have provided numerous insights into the genetics of both gene expression and complex diseases. While the majority of eQTL identified in genome-wide analyses impact a single gene, eQTL that impact many genes are particularly valuable for network modeling and disease analysis. To enable the identification of such broad impact eQTL, we introduce CONFETI: Confounding Factor Estimation Through Independent component analysis. CONFETI is designed to address two conflicting issues when searching for broad impact eQTL: the need to account for non-genetic confounding factors that can lower the power of the analysis or produce broad impact eQTL false positives, and the tendency of methods that account for confounding factors to model broad impact eQTL as non-genetic variation. The key advance of the CONFETI framework is the use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to identify variation likely caused by broad impact eQTL when constructing the sample covariance matrix used for the random effect in a mixed model. We show that CONFETI has better performance than other mixed model confounding factor methods when considering broad impact eQTL recovery from synthetic data. We also used the CONFETI framework and these same confounding factor methods to identify eQTL that replicate between matched twin pair datasets in the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource (MuTHER), the Depression Genes Networks study (DGN), the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), and multiple tissue types in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium. These analyses identified both &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;eQTL and &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;eQTL impacting individual genes, and CONFETI had better or comparable performance to other mixed model confounding factor analysis methods when identifying such eQTL. In these analyses, we were able to identify and replicate a few broad impact eQTL although the overall number was small even when applying CONFETI. In light of these results, we discuss the broad impact eQTL that have been previously reported from the analysis of human data and suggest that considerable caution should be exercised when making biological inferences based on these reported eQTL.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZIqMhY0aoqQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A predictive coding account of bistable perception - a model-based fMRI study</title>

In bistable vision, subjective perception wavers between two interpretations of a constant ambiguous stimulus. This dissociation between conscious perception and sensory stimulation has motivated various empirical studies on the neural correlates of bistable perception, but the neurocomputational mechanism behind endogenous perceptual transitions has remained elusive. Here, we recurred to a generic Bayesian framework of predictive coding and devised a model that casts endogenous perceptual transitions as a consequence of prediction errors emerging from residual evidence for the suppressed percept. Data simulations revealed close similarities between the model’s predictions and key temporal characteristics of perceptual bistability, indicating that the model was able to reproduce bistable perception. Fitting the predictive coding model to behavioural data from an fMRI-experiment on bistable perception, we found a correlation across participants between the model parameter encoding perceptual stabilization and the behaviourally measured frequency of perceptual transitions, corroborating that the model successfully accounted for participants’ perception. Formal model comparison with established models of bistable perception based on mutual inhibition and adaptation, noise or a combination of adaptation and noise was used for the validation of the predictive coding model against the established models. Most importantly, model-based analyses of the fMRI data revealed that prediction error time-courses derived from the predictive coding model correlated with neural signal time-courses in bilateral inferior frontal gyri and anterior insulae. Voxel-wise model selection indicated a superiority of the predictive coding model over conventional analysis approaches in explaining neural activity in these frontal areas, suggesting that frontal cortex encodes prediction errors that mediate endogenous perceptual transitions in bistable perception. Taken together, our current work provides a theoretical framework that allows for the analysis of behavioural and neural data using a predictive coding perspective on bistable perception. In this, our approach posits a crucial role of prediction error signalling for the resolution of perceptual ambiguities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X6E3z9L-p5o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Working memory (WM) is the ability to remember and manipulate information for short time intervals. Recent studies have proposed that sustained firing encoding the contents of WM is ubiquitous across cortical neurons. We review here the collective evidence supporting this claim. A variety of studies report that neurons in prefrontal, parietal, and inferotemporal association cortices show robust sustained activity encoding the location and features of memoranda during WM tasks. However, reports of WM-related sustained activity in early sensory areas are rare, and typically lack stimulus specificity.</description>

	<description>Brain dynamic changes associated with schizophrenia are largely equivocal, with interpretation complicated by many factors, such as the presence of therapeutic agents and the complex nature of the syndrome itself. Evidence for a brain-wide change in individual network oscillations, shared by all patients, is largely equivocal, but stronger for lower (delta) than for higher (gamma) bands. However, region-specific changes in rhythms across multiple, interdependent, nested frequencies may correlate better with pathology.</description>

	<description>Recently, Wallace et al. (2017) provide an unprecedented view of the layers of molecular, cellular and circuit complexity involving a basal ganglia output structure, the entopeduncular nucleus. Their findings lend order to chaos by revealing how molecularly and functionally defined cellular subsets are organized into distinct circuitry.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: CT Perfusion to Predict Response to Recanalization in Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24953</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24953</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To assess the utility of CT perfusion for selection of patients for endovascular therapy up to 18 hours after symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We conducted a multicenter cohort study of consecutive acute stroke patients scheduled to undergo endovascular therapy within 90 min after a baseline CTP. Patients were classified as ‘target mismatch' if they had a small ischemic core and a large penumbra on their baseline CT perfusion. Reperfusion was defined as &amp;gt;50% reduction in critical hypoperfusion between the baseline CT perfusion and the 36-hour follow-up MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Of the 201 patients enrolled, 190 patients with an adequate baseline CT perfusion study who underwent angiography were included; mean age 66 years, median NIHSS 16, median time from symptom onset to endovascular therapy 5.2 hours. Rate of reperfusion was 89%. In patients with target mismatch (n=131), reperfusion was associated with higher odds of favorable clinical response, defined as an improvement of ≥8 points on the NIH Stroke Scale (83% vs 44%, p=0.002; adjusted OR=6.6; 95% CI 2.1-20.9). This association did not differ between patients treated within 6 hrs (OR = 6.4; 95% CI 1.5-27.8) and those treated beyond 6 hrs after symptom onset (OR = 13.7; 95% CI 1.4-140).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: The robust association between endovascular reperfusion and good outcome among patients with the CT perfusion target mismatch profile treated up to 18 hours after symptom onset supports a randomized trial of endovascular therapy in this patient population.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Nonpublication of Trial Results for New Neurological Drugs: A Systematic Review</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To evaluate nonpublication rates among trials of new successful and unsuccessful neurological drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: ‘Licensed' drugs consisted of all novel agents receiving FDA licensure 2005 to 2012 inclusive in seven neurological disorders. ‘Stalled' drugs included all experimental agents tested in the same domains that had at least one completed phase III trial in the same timeframe but failed to receive FDA approval. Trials of these drugs were included in our sample if their primary outcome collection occurred before October 1, 2010. We determined the publication status of eligible trials using searches of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clinicaltrials.gov&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov&quot;&gt;clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/a&gt;, Google Scholar, PubMed, Embase, sponsor websites, and direct electronic query of trial contacts and sponsors. The primary outcome was time to journal publication (or results reporting in other media) after study completion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: The adjusted hazard ratio for publication was 1.79 (95% confidence interval 1.20 to 2.67) in favour of licensed drugs. Based on the criteria for nonpublication in this report, 14,092 and 33,882 volunteers participated in unpublished trials of licensed and stalled neurological drugs, respectively. Result data were not publicly available in any form for 10% (16/163) and 46% (94/203) of trials of licensed and stalled drugs, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Results of trials for stalled drugs are heavily underreported. This deprives research and care communities of evidence about pathophysiology, drug class effects, and the value of surrogate endpoints in trials. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy: A Current Review</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common dose-limiting side effect experienced by patients receiving treatment for cancer. Approximately 30-40% of patients treated with neurotoxic chemotherapy will develop CIPN and there is considerable variability in its severity between patients. It is often sensory-predominant with pain and can lead to long-term morbidity in survivors. The prevalence and burden of CIPN late effects will likely increase as cancer survival rates continue to improve. In this review, we discuss the approach to peripheral neuropathy in patients with cancer and address the clinical phenotypes and pathomechanisms of specific neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.

	<description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and devastating neurodegeneration, not only as a result of the extracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and intracellular accumulation of tau, but also as a consequence of the dysfunction and loss of synapses. Although significant advances have been made in our understanding of the relationship of the pathological role of Aβ and tau in synapse dysfunction, several questions remain as to how Aβ and tau interdependently cause impairments in synaptic function in AD.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Christoph Anacker &amp;amp; René Hen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in cognitive processes, such as pattern separation, and in the behavioural effects of stress and antidepressants. Young adult-born neurons have been shown to inhibit the overall activity of the dentate gyrus by recruiting local interneurons, which may result in &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein is present at high levels in all neurons and their synapses. We now learn that this protein helps dilate the fusion pore, which forms transiently during vesicle exocytosis, promoting release of certain neurotransmitters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capillary endothelial cells sense neuronal activity-evoked increases in extracellular K+ via KIR2.1 inwardly rectifying K+ channels. The ensuing hyperpolarization travels upstream along the vascular network, reaching arterioles and evoking vasodilation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery that heterozygous and homozygous mutations in the gene encoding progranulin are causally linked to frontotemporal dementia and lysosomal storage disease, respectively, reveals previously unrecognized roles of the progranulin protein in regulating lysosome biogenesis and function. Given the importance of lysosomes in cellular homeostasis, &lt;/p&gt;
