	<description>Publication date: February 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Zilong   Qiu&lt;br /&gt;  MECP2 is a critical gene for neural development, mutations or duplication of which led to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Mary A   Logan&lt;br /&gt; Glial cells are essential for proper formation and maintenance of the nervous system. During development, glia keep neuronal cell numbers in check and ensure that mature neural circuits are appropriately sculpted by engulfing superfluous cells and projections. In the adult brain, glial cells offer metabolic sustenance and provide critical immune support in the face of acute and chronic challenges. Dysfunctional glial immune activity is believed to contribute to age-related cognitive decline, as well as neurodegenerative disease risk, but we still know surprisingly little about the specific molecular pathways that govern glia-neuron communication in the healthy or diseased brain. Drosophila offers a versatile in vivo model to explore the conserved molecular underpinnings of glial cell biology and glial cell contributions to brain function, health, and disease susceptibility. This review addresses recent findings describing how Drosophila glial cells influence neuronal activity in the adult fly brain to support optimal brain function and, importantly, highlights new insights into specific glial defects that may contribute to neuronal demise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Alicia   Hidalgo, Ann   Logan&lt;br /&gt; The regenerative response of ensheating glia to central nervous system (CNS) injury involves proliferation and differentiation, axonal re-enwrapment and some recovery of behaviour. Understanding this limited response could enable the enhancement of it. In Drosophila, the glial progenitor state is maintained by Notch, an activator of cell division and Prospero (Pros), a repressor. Injury provokes the activation of NFκB and up-regulation of Kon-tiki (Kon), driving cell proliferation. Homeostatic switch-off comes about as two negative feedback loops involving Pros terminate the response. Importantly, the functions of the kon and pros homologues NG2 and prox1, respectively, are conserved in mammalian NG2 glia. Controlling these genes is key for therapeutic manipulation of progenitors and stem cells to promote regeneration of the damaged CNS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber&lt;br /&gt; Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Critical to progressing the field is the identification of molecular underpinnings necessary for microglia to carry out these important functions within neural circuits. Here, we focus a review specifically on roles for microglial cytokine signaling within developing and mature neural circuits. We review exciting new studies demonstrating essential roles for microglial cytokine signaling in axon outgrowth, synaptogenesis and synapse maturation during development, as well as synaptic transmission and plasticity in adulthood. Together, these studies identify microglia and cytokines as critical modulators of neural circuits within the healthy brain, with implications for a broad range of neurological disorders with disruptions in synaptic structure and function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S095943881730137X-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The morphological and molecular heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes and their progenitors point to functions beyond establishing saltatory nerve conduction. Here, we review the diversity in the oligodendroglial lineage as well as the classical and new functions identified for oligodendrocytes and their progenitors. Because oligodendroglia remain highly responsive to environmental changes, they likely contribute to various neurological and psychiatric diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Recent work suggests that they play a key role in regulating brain energy supply by increasing blood flow to regions where neurons are active, and setting the baseline level of blood flow. Controversy persists over whether lactate derived from astrocyte glycolysis is used to power oxidative phosphorylation in neurons, but astrocytes sustain neuronal ATP production by recycling neurotransmitter glutamate that would otherwise need to be resynthesised from glucose, and by providing a short-term energy store in the form of glycogen that can be mobilised when neurons are active. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

To achieve these precise shapes, glia and neurons exhibit coordinated morphological changes on the time scale of minutes and on size scales ranging from nanometers to hundreds of microns. Here, we review recent studies that reveal the highly dynamic, localized morphological changes of mammalian neuron–glia contacts. We then explore the power of Drosophila and C. elegans models to study coordinated changes at defined neuron–glia contacts, highlighting the use of innovative genetic and imaging tools to uncover the molecular mechanisms responsible for coordinated morphogenesis of neurons and glia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: December 2017&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 47&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Amy F   Lloyd, Claire L   Davies, Veronique E   Miron&lt;br /&gt; Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), implicated in developmental processes, homeostasis, and responses to injury. Derived from the yolk sac during development, microglia self-renew, self-regulate their numbers during homeostatic conditions, and show a robust proliferative capacity even in adulthood. Together with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), microglia coordinate the regeneration of CNS myelin around axons, termed remyelination. Gene expression analyses and experimental modelling have identified pro-remyelination roles for microglia/MDM in clearance of myelin debris, secretion of growth factors, and remodelling of the extracellular matrix. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms controlling these regenerative functions will reveal novel therapeutic strategies to enhance remyelination, by harnessing the beneficial effects of the innate immune response to injury. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

However, microglia enter the brain during embryogenesis and recent studies have revealed additional early functions of these immune cells in prenatal and perinatal cerebral development. Such findings are of importance since prenatal inflammation and microglia dysfunction have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. This review provides a selective overview of the early roles of microglia, their link with a specific spatiotemporal distribution and how they can be modulated by intrinsic factors or environmental signals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>In most animals, the brain makes behavioral decisions that are transmitted by descending neurons to the nerve cord circuitry that produces behaviors. In insects, only a few descending neurons have been associated with specific behaviors. To explore how descending neurons control insect behavior, we developed a novel method to systematically assay the behavioral effects of 160 descending neurons in freely behaving terrestrial D. melanogaster using optogenetic activation. We calculated a 2-dimensional representation of the entire behavior space explored by these flies and associated descending neurons with specific behaviors by identifying regions of this space that were visited with increased frequency during optogenetic activation. We found, that (1) activation of most of the descending neurons drove stereotyped behaviors, (2) in many cases multiple descending neurons activated similar behaviors, and (3) optogenetically-activated behaviors were often dependent on the behavioral state prior to activation.</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disturbances are associated with future risk of Alzheimer's disease. Disrupted sleep increases soluble amyloid-β, suggesting a mechanism for sleep disturbances to increase Alzheimer's disease risk. We tested this response in humans using indwelling lumbar catheters to serially sample cerebrospinal fluid while participants were sleep-deprived, treated with sodium oxybate, or allowed to sleep normally. All participants were infused with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-leucine to measure amyloid-β kinetics. We found that sleep deprivation increased overnight amyloid-β-38, amyloid-β-40, and amyloid-β-42 levels by 25-30% via increased overnight amyloid-β production relative to sleeping controls. These findings suggest that disrupted sleep increases Alzheimer's disease risk via increased amyloid-β production. This article is protected by copyright.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25101-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality, typically resulting in death preceding age 2. Clinical trials in this population require an understanding of disease progression and identification of meaningful biomarkers to hasten therapeutic development and predict outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25101-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A longitudinal, multicenter, prospective natural history study enrolled 26 SMA infants and 27 control infants aged &amp;lt;6 months. Recruitment occurred at 14 centers over 21 months within the NINDS-sponsored NeuroNEXT (National Network for Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials) Network. Infant motor function scales (Test of Infant Motor Performance Screening Items [TIMPSI], The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test for Neuromuscular Disorders, and Alberta Infant Motor Score) and putative physiological and molecular biomarkers were assessed preceding age 6 months and at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months with progression, correlations between motor function and biomarkers, and hazard ratios analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25101-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motor function scores (MFS) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) decreased rapidly in SMA infants, whereas MFS in all healthy infants rapidly increased. Correlations were identified between TIMPSI and CMAP in SMA infants. TIMPSI at first study visit was associated with risk of combined endpoint of death or permanent invasive ventilation in SMA infants. Post-hoc analysis of survival to combined endpoint in SMA infants with 2 copies of &lt;em&gt;SMN2&lt;/em&gt; indicated a median age of 8 months at death (95% confidence interval, 6, 17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25101-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data of SMA and control outcome measures delineates meaningful change in clinical trials in infantile-onset SMA. The power and utility of NeuroNEXT to provide “real-world,” prospective natural history data sets to accelerate public and private drug development programs for rare disease is demonstrated.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the first section, Introduction, we present our experimental design. In
the second section, we characterize the grand average occipital and temporal
electrical activity correlated with a contrast in access. In the third section,
we characterize the grand average occipital and temporal electrical activity
correlated with a contrast in phenomenology and conclude characterizing the
grand average occipital and temporal electrical activity co-occurring with
unconsciousness.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quantifying how much sensory information in a neural code is relevant for behavior. (arXiv:1712.02449v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02449</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Determining how much of the sensory information carried by a neural code
contributes to behavioral performance is key to understand sensory function and
neural information flow. However, there are as yet no analytical tools to
compute this information that lies at the intersection between sensory coding
and behavioral readout. Here we develop a novel measure, termed the
information-theoretic intersection information $I_{II}(S;R;C)$, that quantifies
how much of the sensory information carried by a neural response R is used for
behavior during perceptual discrimination tasks. Building on the Partial
Information Decomposition framework, we define $I_{II}(S;R;C)$ as the part of
the mutual information between the stimulus S and the response R that also
informs the consequent behavioral choice C. We compute $I_{II}(S;R;C)$ in the
analysis of two experimental cortical datasets, to show how this measure can be
used to compare quantitatively the contributions of spike timing and spike
rates to task performance, and to identify brain areas or neural populations
that specifically transform sensory information into choice.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Drosophila Fezf coordinates laminar-specific connectivity through cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/231399v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/231399v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Laminar arrangement of neural connections is a fundamental feature of neural circuit organization. Identifying mechanisms that coordinate neural connections within correct layers is thus vital for understanding how neural circuits are assembled. In the medulla of the Drosophila visual system neurons form connections within ten parallel layers. The M3 layer receives input from two neuron types that sequentially innervate M3 during development. Here we show that M3-specific innervation by both neurons is coordinated by Drosophila Fezf (dFezf), a conserved transcription factor that is selectively expressed by the earlier targeting input neuron. In this cell, dFezf instructs layer specificity and activates the expression of a secreted molecule (Netrin) that regulates the layer specificity of the other input neuron. We propose that employment of transcriptional modules that cell-intrinsically target neurons to specific layers, and cell-extrinsically recruit other neurons is a general mechanism for building layered networks of neural connections.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Feature-specific awake reactivation in human V1 after visual training</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/231381v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/231381v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Converging human studies have demonstrated that brain activity patterns observed during task performance reemerge in the following restful awake state. Such &quot;awake reactivation&quot; has been demonstrated across higher-order cortex for complex images or associations. However, it remains unclear what specific training components are reactivated in these studies. Here we sought to provide evidence for the reactivation of a particular visual feature -- Gabor orientation. Following extensive training on a visual task, we found robust reactivation in human V1 that lasted at least eight minutes. This effect was not present in higher retinotopic areas such as V2, V3, V3A, or V4v, demonstrating that the effects in V1 are not due to top-down processes such as conscious rehearsal. Furthermore, the amount of awake reactivation predicted the amount of performance improvement on the visual task. These results demonstrate that functionally-relevant awake reactivation of specific visual features occurs in early sensory cortex.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Increased microglial synapse elimination in patient-specific models of schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/231290v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/231290v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Schizophrenia patients display decreased synaptic density in postmortem studies, suggesting aberrant microglial synapse elimination during neurodevelopment. Here, we use cellular reprogramming to create patient-specific in vitro models of microglia-mediated synapse engulfment that demonstrate increased synapse elimination in schizophrenia-derived models compared to healthy controls. We show that excessive synaptic pruning in schizophrenia reflects abnormalities in microglia-like cells as well as synaptic structures. Further, we find that schizophrenia risk-associated variants within the complement component 4 locus contribute to the increased uptake in schizophrenia models. Finally, we demonstrate that the antibiotic minocycline reduces microglia-mediated synapse uptake and show that minocycline treatment for acne is associated with a reduction in incident schizophrenia risk compared to other treatments in a cohort of more than 9,000 young adults drawn from health records. Specific pharmacological interventions targeting excessive pruning merit further study for their capacity to delay or prevent the onset of schizophrenia in high-risk individuals.</description>

	<description>Navigation in natural environments is computationally difficult: Location errors from motion estimation noise accumulate over time, while landmarks can be spatially extended and often look alike, thus providing ambiguous data. The brain contains a number of spatially tuned neurons coding for various navigational variables, but current models do not explain how these circuits could implement navigational computations that involve non-trivial spatial reasoning. We show, using a function-first approach, that neural circuits trained to efficiently solve spatial reasoning problems with performance on par with sequential probabilistic strategies reproduce some key properties of hippocampal coding, including heterogeneous tuning, conjunctive tuning, and low-dimensional dynamics. In addition, the models predict the emergence of tuning to key latent variables that are neither present in the input data nor trained as the end result of the task, and exhibit a spontaneous dynamical reconfiguration of tuning across time during a task as the computational demands evolve, reminiscent of some of the more complex dynamics observed in the hippocampus including a switch between location and displacement coding modes. These results provide a new functional framework for understanding the rich phenomenology and potential capabilities of navigation codes in the hippocampus and associated brain areas.</description>

	<description>Humans have a striking ability to infer meaning from even the sparsest and most abstract forms of narratives. At the same time, flexibility in the form of a narrative is matched by inherent ambiguity in the interpretation of it. How does the brain represent subtle, idiosyncratic differences in the interpretation of abstract and ambiguous narratives? In this fMRI study, we scanned subjects watching a 7-min original animation that depicts a complex narrative through the movement of simple geometric shapes. We additionally scanned two separate groups listening to concrete verbal descriptions of either the social narrative or the physical properties of the movie. After scanning, all subjects freely recalled their interpretation of the stimulus. Using an intersubject representational similarity analysis, we compared the similarity of narrative interpretation across subjects, as measured using text analysis, with the similarity of neural responses, as measured using intersubject correlation (ISC). We found that the more similar two people's interpretations of the abstract shape movie were, the more similar their neural responses were in the default mode network (DMN). Moreover, these shared responses were modality invariant: despite vast differences in stimulus properties, we found that the shapes movie and the verbal interpretation of the movie elicited shared responses in linguistic areas and a subset of the DMN when subjects shared interpretations. Together, these results suggest that the DMN is not only sensitive to subtle individual differences in narrative interpretation, but also resilient to large differences in the modality of the narrative.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Inhibition of Glyoxalase 1 reduces alcohol self-administration in dependent and nondependent rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230995v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230995v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Previous studies showed that the glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) gene modulates anxiety-like behavior, seizure susceptibility, depression-like behavior, and alcohol drinking in the drinking-in-the-dark paradigm in nondependent mice. Administration of the small-molecule GLO1 inhibitor S-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester (pBBG) decreased alcohol drinking in nondependent mice, suggesting a possible therapeutic strategy. However, the preclinical therapeutic efficacy of pBBG in animal models of alcohol dependence remains to be demonstrated. We tested the effect of pBBG (7.5 and 25 mg/kg) on operant alcohol self-administration in alcohol-dependent and nondependent rats. Wistar rats were trained to self-administer 10% alcohol (v/v) and made dependent by chronic intermittent passive exposure to alcohol vapor for 5 weeks. Pretreatment with pBBG dose-dependently reduced alcohol self-administration in both nondependent and dependent animals, without affecting water self-administration. pBBG treatment was more effective in dependent rats than in nondependent rats. These data extend previous findings that implicated Glo1 in alcohol drinking in nondependent mice by showing even more profound effects in alcohol-dependent rats. These results suggest that the pharmacological inhibition of GLO1 is a relevant therapeutic target for the treatment of alcohol use disorders.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Spatio-Temporal Pattern of Appraising Social and Emotional Relevance: Evidence from Event-Related Brain Potentials</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230961v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Social information is highly intrinsically relevant for the human species because of its direct link to guiding physiological responses and behavior. Accordingly, extant functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data suggest that social content may form a unique stimulus dimension. It remains largely unknown, however, how neural activity underlying social (versus nonsocial) information processing temporally unfolds, and how such social information appraisal may interact with the processing of other stimulus characteristics, particularly emotional meaning. Here, we presented complex visual scenes differing in both social (versus nonsocial) and emotional relevance (positive, negative, neutral) intermixed with scrambled versions of these pictures to N= 24 healthy young adults. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to intact pictures were examined for gaining insight to the dynamics of appraisal of both dimensions, implemented within the brain. Our main finding is an early interaction between social and emotional relevance due to enhanced amplitudes of early ERP components to emotionally positive pictures of social compared to nonsocial content, presumably reflecting rapid allocation of attention and counteracting an overall negativity bias. Importantly, our ERP data show high similarity with previously observed fMRI data using the same stimuli, and source estimations located the ERP effects in overlapping occipito-temporal brain areas. Our new data suggest that relevance detection may occur already as early as around 100 ms after stimulus onset and may combine relevance checks not only examining intrinsic pleasantness/emotional valence, but also social content as a unique, highly relevant stimulus dimension.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Integrated analysis of anatomical and electrophysiological human intracranial data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230912v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The exquisite spatiotemporal precision of human intracranial EEG recordings (iEEG) permits characterizing neural processing with a level of detail that is inaccessible to scalp-EEG, MEG, or fMRI. However, the same qualities that make iEEG an exceptionally powerful tool also present unique challenges. Until now, the fusion of anatomical data (MRI and CT images) with the electrophysiological data and its subsequent analysis has relied on technologically and conceptually challenging combinations of software. Here, we describe a comprehensive protocol that addresses the complexities associated with human iEEG, providing complete transparency and flexibility in the evolution of raw data into illustrative representations. The protocol is directly integrated with an open source toolbox for electrophysiological data analysis (FieldTrip). This allows iEEG researchers to build on a continuously growing body of scriptable and reproducible analysis methods that, over the past decade, have been developed and employed by a large research community. We demonstrate the protocol for an example complex iEEG data set to provide an intuitive and rapid approach to dealing with both neuroanatomical information and large electrophysiological data sets. We explain how the protocol can be largely automated, taking under an hour to complete, and readily adjusted to iEEG data sets with other characteristics.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: White Matter Hyperintensities and Cognitive Decline in de Novo Parkinson's Disease Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230896v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230896v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Objective: White Matter Hyperintensities (WMHs) are associated with cognitive decline in normative aging and Alzheimers disease. However, the pathogenesis of cognitive decline in Parkinsons disease (PD) is not directly related to vascular causes, and therefore the role of WMHs in PD remains unclear. If WMH has a higher impact on cognitive decline in PD, vascular pathology should be assessed and treated with a higher priority in this population. Here we investigate whether WMH leads to increased cognitive decline in PD, and if these effects relate to cortical thinning. Methods: To investigate the role of WMHs in PD, it is essential to study recently-diagnosed/non-treated patients. De novo PD patients and age-matched controls (NPD=365, NControl=174) with FLAIR/T2-weighted scans at baseline were selected from Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). WMHs and cortical thickness were measured to analyse the relationship between baseline WMHs and future cognitive decline (follow-up:4.09 years) and cortical thinning (follow-up:1.05 years). Results: High WMH load (WMHL) at baseline in PD was associated with increased cognitive decline, significantly more than i) PDs with low WMHL and ii) controls with high WMHL. Furthermore, PD patients with higher baseline WMHL showed more cortical thinning in right frontal lobe than subjects with low WMHL. Cortical thinning of this region also predicted decline in performance on a cognitive test. Interpretation: Presence of WMHs in de novo PD patients predicts greater future cognitive decline and cortical thinning than in normal aging. Recognizing WMHs as a potential predictor of cognitive deficit in PD provides an opportunity for timely interventions.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230672v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We introduce a source localization method of the MUltiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) family that can locate brain-signal sources robustly and reliably, irrespective of their temporal correlations. The method, double-scanning (DS) MUSIC, is based on projecting out the topographies of source candidates during topographical scanning in a way that breaks the mutual dependence of highly correlated sources, but keeps the uncorrelated sources intact. We also provide a recursive version of DS-MUSIC (RDS-MUSIC), which overcomes the peak detection problem present in the non-recursive methods. We compare DS-MUSIC and RDS-MUSIC with other localization techniques in numerous simulations with varying source configurations, correlations, and signal-to-noise ratios. DS- and RDS-MUSIC were the most robust localization methods; they had a high success rate and localization accuracy for both uncorrelated and highly correlated sources. In addition, we validated RDS-MUSIC by showing that it successfully locates bilateral synchronous activity from measured auditory-evoked MEG.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: To be a Grid Cell: Shuffling procedures for determining 'Gridness'</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230250v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230250v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Grid cells in freely behaving mammals are defined by the strikingly regular periodic spatial distribution of their firing. The standard method of identification calculates the 'Gridness' of the spatial firing pattern, with significance being defined relative to the 95th percentile of a null distribution of the Gridness values found after randomly permuting spike times relative to behaviour. We determined the false-positive rate by applying the method to simulated firing with irregular spatially inhomogeneity (i.e. randomly distributed Gaussian patches). We found surprisingly high false positive rates (potentially approaching 20%), which were strongly dependent on the type of Gridness measure used and the number of spatial fields in the synthetic data. This likely reflects the spatial homogeneity of the distributions of spikes after shuffling compared to the inhomogeneous synthetic data. However, false positive rates were reduced (generally below 8%), and less dependent on other factors, when an alternative spatial field shuffling method was used to generate the null Gridness distribution. For comparison, we analysed single unit recordings made using tetrodes implanted into rat medial entorhinal cortex for the purpose of finding grid cells. We found 24% of active neurons were classified as grid cells via spike shuffling and 22% via field shuffling. These results, and the potentially high false-positive rate when classifying cells with patchy but irregular firing as grid cells, indicate that the proportion of cells with regular grid-like firing patterns can be over-estimated by standard methods.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Effort distribution changes effector choice, behaviour and performance: A visuomotor tracking study using finger forces</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230110v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230110v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Human movement and its associated performance are bounded by a hierarchy of constraints operating over certain control variables. One such variable of both physiological and behavioural importance is the mechanical effort exerted by the participating elements. Here, we explored how motor performance is affected by the distribution of work, and consequently the effort. Using human hand as a model, we employed a visuomotor tracking task to study the associated motor performance when mechanical effort exerted by the fingers are modulated. The subject has to trace a set of ideal paths provided on visual feedback screen to reach a target through a cursor controlled by index and little finger forces. Modulation of these forces allows us to see how the perceived effort requirement affects the tracking performance. In this task demanding two-element coordination, we represent index finger as the independent/dominant element against little finger as the dependent/subjugate counterpart. We study how increasing mechanical effort contribution from the independent element leads to changes in both behaviour and performance. We found that despite higher mechanical requirements of employing index finger to produce larger absolute force, the movement control system continues to prefer it as against little finger which could have produced smaller absolute force. Moreover, the observation of better tracking performance under larger contributions from the independent component reflects to a plausible hierarchy of constraints employed in the motor control system that operates with more than one objective, energy minimisation per se. At least for the behaviour in study, the improved motor performance suggests that the control system prefers higher independence of the participating elements.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Autistic traits, but not schizotypy, predict overweighting of sensory information in Bayesian visual integration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230003v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230003v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Recent theories propose that schizophrenia/schizotypy and autistic spectrum disorder are related to impairments in Bayesian inference i.e. how the brain integrates sensory information (likelihoods) with prior knowledge. However existing accounts fail to clarify: i) how proposed theories differ in accounts of ASD vs. schizophrenia and ii) whether the impairments result from weaker priors or enhanced likelihoods. Here, we directly address these issues by characterising how 91 healthy participants, scored for autistic and schizotypal traits, implicitly learned and combined priors with sensory information. This was accomplished through a visual statistical learning paradigm designed to quantitatively assess variations in individuals' likelihoods and priors. The acquisition of the priors was found to be intact along both traits spectra. However, autistic traits were associated with more veridical perception and weaker influence of expectations. Bayesian modelling revealed that this was due not to weaker prior expectations but to more precise sensory representations.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/226688v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We explore a straightforward method for reconstructing visual stimuli from brain activity. Using large databases of natural images we trained a deep convolutional generative adversarial network capable of generating gray scale photos, similar to stimuli presented during two functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments. Using a linear model we learned to predict the generative model's latent random vector z from measured brain activity. The objective was to create an image similar to the presented stimulus image through the previously trained generator. Using this approach we were able to reconstruct natural images, but not to an equal extent for all images with the same model. A behavioral test showed that subjects were capable of identifying a reconstruction of the original stimulus in 67.6% and 64.4% of the cases in a pairwise test for the two natural image datasets respectively. Our approach does not require end-to-end training of a large generative model on limited neuroimaging data. As the particular GAN model can be replaced with a more powerful variant, the current advances in generative modeling promise further improvements in reconstruction performance.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/225847v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Optogenetic silencing allows time-resolved functional interrogation of defined neuronal populations. However, the limitations of inhibitory optogenetic tools impose stringent constraints on experimental paradigms. The high light power requirement of light-driven ion pumps and their effects on intracellular ion homeostasis pose unique challenges, particularly in experiments that demand inhibition of a widespread neuronal population in vivo. Guillardia theta anion-conducting channelrhodopsins (GtACRs) are promising in this regard, due to their high single-channel conductance and favorable photon-ion stoichiometry. However, GtACRs show poor membrane targeting in mammalian cells, and the activity of such channels can cause transient excitation in the axon due to an excitatory chloride reversal potential in this compartment. Here we address both problems by enhancing membrane targeting and subcellular compartmentalization of GtACRs. The resulting GtACR-based optogenetic tools show improved photocurrents, greatly reduced axonal excitation, high light sensitivity and rapid kinetics, allowing highly efficient inhibition of neuronal activity in the mammalian brain.</description>

Computational biology is an interdisciplinary field, and many computational biology research projects involve distributed teams of scientists. To accomplish their work, these teams must overcome both disciplinary and geographic barriers. Introducing new training paradigms is one way to facilitate research progress in computational biology. Here, we describe a new undergraduate program in biomolecular structure prediction and design in which students conduct research at labs located at geographically-distributed institutions while remaining connected through an online community. This 10-week summer program begins with one week of training on computational biology methods development, transitions to eight weeks of research, and culminates in one week at the Rosetta annual conference. To date, two cohorts of students have participated, tackling research topics including vaccine design, enzyme design, protein-based materials, glycoprotein modeling, crowd-sourced science, RNA processing, hydrogen bond networks, and amyloid formation. Students in the program report outcomes comparable to students who participate in similar in-person programs. These outcomes include the development of a sense of community and increases in their scientific self-efficacy, scientific identity, and science values, all predictors of continuing in a science research career. Furthermore, the program attracted students from diverse backgrounds, which demonstrates the potential of this approach to broaden the participation of young scientists from backgrounds traditionally underrepresented in computational biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tVxiwYI9Ryc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Delphinids produce large numbers of short duration, broadband echolocation clicks which may be useful for species classification in passive acoustic monitoring efforts. A challenge in echolocation click classification is to overcome the many sources of variability to recognize underlying patterns across many detections. An automated unsupervised network-based classification method was developed to simulate the approach a human analyst uses when categorizing click types: Clusters of similar clicks were identified by incorporating multiple click characteristics (spectral shape and inter-click interval distributions) to distinguish within-type from between-type variation, and identify distinct, persistent click types. Once click types were established, an algorithm for classifying novel detections using existing clusters was tested. The automated classification method was applied to a dataset of 52 million clicks detected across five monitoring sites over two years in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Seven distinct click types were identified, one of which is known to be associated with an acoustically identifiable delphinid (Risso’s dolphin) and six of which are not yet identified. All types occurred at multiple monitoring locations, but the relative occurrence of types varied, particularly between continental shelf and slope locations. Automatically-identified click types from autonomous seafloor recorders without verifiable species identification were compared with clicks detected on sea-surface towed hydrophone arrays in the presence of visually identified delphinid species. These comparisons suggest potential species identities for the animals producing some echolocation click types. The network-based classification method presented here is effective for rapid, unsupervised delphinid click classification across large datasets in which the click types may not be known &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a_L8itdWy3E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Targeting hypersensitive corticostriatal terminals in restless legs syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25104</guid>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25104-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first aim was to demonstrate a previously hypothesized increased sensitivity of corticostriatal glutamatergic terminals in the rodent with brain iron deficiency (BID), a pathogenetic model of restless legs syndrome (RLS). The second aim was to determine whether these putative hypersensitive terminals could constitute a significant target for drugs effective in RLS, including dopamine agonists (pramipexole and ropinirole) and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ ligands (gabapentin).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25104-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recently introduced in vivo optogenetic–microdialysis approach was used, which allows the measurement of the extracellular concentration of glutamate upon local light-induced stimulation of corticostriatal glutamatergic terminals. The method also allows analysis of the effect of local perfusion of compounds within the same area being sampled for glutamate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25104-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;BID rats showed hypersensitivity of corticostriatal glutamatergic terminals (lower frequency of optogenetic stimulation to induce glutamate release). Both hypersensitive and control glutamatergic terminals were significant targets for locally perfused pramipexole, ropinirole, and gabapentin, which significantly counteracted optogenetically induced glutamate release. The use of selective antagonists demonstrated the involvement of dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subtypes in the effects of pramipexole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25104-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypersensitivity of corticostriatal glutamatergic terminals can constitute a main pathogenetic mechanism of RLS symptoms. Selective D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonists, by specifically targeting these terminals, should provide a new efficient treatment with fewer secondary effects.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Increasing motor neuron excitability to treat weakness in sepsis</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25105-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weakness induced by critical illness (intensive care unit acquired weakness) is a major cause of disability in patients and is currently untreatable. We recently identified a defect in repetitive firing of lower motor neurons as a novel contributor to intensive care unit acquired weakness. To develop therapy for intensive care unit acquired weakness, it was necessary to determine the mechanism underlying the defect in repetitive firing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25105-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both computer simulation and in vivo dynamic voltage clamp of spinal motor neurons in septic rats were employed to explore potential mechanisms underlying defective repetitive firing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25105-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest alteration in subthreshold voltage-activated currents might be the mechanism underlying defective repetitive firing. It has been shown previously that pharmacologic activation of serotonin receptors on motor neurons increases motor neuron excitability, in part by enhancing subthreshold voltage-activated inward currents. Administration of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved serotonin agonist (lorcaserin) to septic rats greatly improved repetitive firing and motor unit force generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25105-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest activation of serotonin receptors with lorcaserin may provide the first ever therapy for intensive care unit acquired weakness in patients.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sensation, mechanoreceptor, and nerve fiber function after nerve regeneration</title>

However, the relationship between sensory modalities and function of regenerated fibers is uncertain. We have investigated the relationships between touch threshold, tactile gnosis, and mechanoreceptor and sensory fiber function after nerve regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25102-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one median or ulnar nerve lesions were repaired by a collagen nerve conduit or direct suture. Quantitative sensory hand function and sensory conduction studies by near-nerve technique, including tactile stimulation of mechanoreceptors, were followed for 2 years, and results were compared to noninjured hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25102-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At both repair methods, touch thresholds at the finger tips recovered to 81 ± 3% and tactile gnosis only to 20 ± 4% (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) of control. The sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) remained dispersed and areas recovered to 23 ± 2% and the amplitudes only to 7 ± 1% (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The areas of SNAPs after tactile stimulation recovered to 61 ± 11% and remained slowed. Touch sensation correlated with SNAP areas (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.005) and was negatively related to the prolongation of tactile latencies (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01); tactile gnosis was not related to electrophysiological parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25102-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recovered function of regenerated peripheral nerve fibers and reinnervated mechanoreceptors may differentially influence recovery of sensory modalities. Touch was affected by the number and function of regenerated fibers and mechanoreceptors. In contrast, tactile gnosis depends on the input and plasticity of the central nervous system (CNS), which may explain the absence of a direct relation between electrophysiological parameters and poor recovery. Dispersed maturation of sensory nerve fibers with desynchronized inputs to the CNS also contributes to the poor recovery of tactile gnosis.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Maps of Visual Importance. (arXiv:1712.02142v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02142</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02142</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The importance of an element in a visual stimulus is commonly associated with
the fixations during a free-viewing task. We argue that fixations are not
always correlated with attention or awareness of visual objects. We suggest to
filter the fixations recorded during exploration of the image based on the
fixations recorded during recalling the image against a neutral background.
This idea exploits that eye movements are a spatial index into the memory of a
visual stimulus. We perform an experiment in which we record the eye movements
of 30 observers during the presentation and recollection of 100 images. The
locations of fixations during recall are only qualitatively related to the
fixations during exploration. We develop a deformation mapping technique to
align the fixations from recall with the fixation during exploration. This
allows filtering the fixations based on proximity and a threshold on proximity
provides a convenient slider to control the amount of filtering. Analyzing the
spatial histograms resulting from the filtering procedure as well as the set of
removed fixations shows that certain types of scene elements, which could be
considered irrelevant, are removed. In this sense, they provide a measure of
importance of visual elements for human observers.

	<description>Early brain activity is crucial for neurogenesis and the development of brain networks. However, it has been challenging to localize regions in the developing human brain that contribute to spontaneous waves of neuronal activity. Recently, Arichi and colleagues reported that the temporal and heteromodal insular cortices have a central role in propagating these neural instructional signals.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Diminished Cortical Thickness is Associated with Impulsive Choice in Adolescence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230888v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230888v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Adolescence is characterized by both maturation of brain structure and increased risk of negative outcomes from behaviors associated with impulsive decision-making. One important index of impulsive choice is delay discounting (DD), which measures the tendency to prefer smaller rewards available soon over larger rewards delivered after a delay. However, it remains largely unknown how individual differences in structural brain development may be associated with impulsive choice during adolescence. Leveraging a unique large sample of 427 human youths (208 males and 219 females) imaged as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we examined associations between delay discounting and cortical thickness within structural covariance networks. These structural networks were derived using non-negative matrix factorization, an advanced multivariate technique for dimensionality reduction, and analyzed using generalized additive models with penalized splines to capture both linear and nonlinear developmental effects. We found that impulsive choice, as measured by greater discounting, was most strongly associated with diminished cortical thickness in structural brain networks that encompassed the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, temporal pole, and temporoparietal junction. Furthermore, structural brain networks predicted DD above and beyond cognitive performance. Taken together, these results suggest that reduced cortical thickness in regions known to be involved in value-based decision-making is a marker of impulsive choice during the critical period of adolescence.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Low-frequency alternating current stimulation rhythmically suppresses stimulus-induced gamma-band oscillations in visual cortex and impairs perceptual performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230656v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230656v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) are hypothesized to rhythmically gate sensory processing, reflected by activity in the 40-100 Hz gamma band, via the mechanism of pulsed inhibition. We applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (TACS) at individual alpha frequency (IAF) and flanking frequencies (IAF-4 Hz, IAF+4 Hz) to the occipital cortex of healthy human volunteers during concurrent magnetoencephalography (MEG), while participants performed a visual detection task inducing strong gamma-band responses. Occipital (but not frontal) TACS phasically suppressed stimulus-induced gamma oscillations in the visual cortex and impaired target detection, with stronger phase-to-amplitude coupling predicting behavioral impairments. Frontal control TACS ruled out retino-thalamo-cortical entrainment resulting from (subthreshold) retinal stimulation. All TACS frequencies tested were effective, suggesting that visual gamma-band responses can be modulated by a range of low frequency oscillations. We propose that TACS-induced cortical excitability fluctuations mimic the mechanism of pulsed inhibition, which mediates the function of alpha oscillations in gating sensory processing.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation to Investigate Language Production in Healthy Speakers: A Review and Meta-Analysis</title>

	<description>Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has become a common method to study the interrelations between the brain and language functioning. This quantitative review examined the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and direct current stimulation (tDCS) in the study of language production in healthy volunteers. Forty-two effect sizes from 28 studies which investigated the effects of NIBS on picture naming or verbal fluency in healthy participants were meta-analysed. Further sub-analyses investigated potential influences of stimulation type, site, control, and task. Random effects modelling showed a small, but reliable effect of NIBS on language production. Subsequent analyses indicated larger weighted mean effect sizes for TMS as compared to tDCS studies. No statistical differences between stimulation of frontal and temporal regions, or between picture naming and verbal fluency tasks, were observed. We conclude that NIBS is a useful method for neuroscientific studies on language production in healthy volunteers.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Putting Focus on Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Language Production Studies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/230623v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Previous language production studies targeting the inferior frontal and superior temporal gyrus using anodal tDCS have provided mixed results. Part of this heterogeneity may be explained by limited target region focality of conventionally used electrode montages. In this simulation study, the focality of conventionally used and alternative bipolar electrode montages was examined. Specifically, electric field distributions of anodal tDCS targeting IFG and STG in conventional setups (anodal electrode over IFG/STG, reference electrode over right supraorbital region) were compared to a number of alternative electrode montages. Conventional montages showed maximum field strengths that next to the target region included additional neighbouring regions. By contrast, adjustments in electrode size and placement improved focality of anodal tDCS. Thus, the heterogeneity of findings of language production studies deploying conventional tDCS montages may in part be explained by diffuse electric field distributions. Alternative montages improve focality and may yield more unequivocal results.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Reduction of Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex Gray Matter Volume Correlates with Loss of Economic Rationality in Aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/12068?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/12068?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The population of people above 65 years old continues to grow, and there is mounting evidence that as humans age they are more likely to make errors. However, the specific effect of neuroanatomical aging on the efficiency of economic decision-making is poorly understood. We used whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analysis to determine where reduction of gray matter volume in healthy female and male adults over the age of 65 years correlates with a classic measure of economic irrationality: violations of the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference. All participants were functionally normal with Mini-Mental State Examination scores ranging between 26 and 30. While our elders showed the previously reported decline in rationality compared with younger subjects, chronological age per se did not correlate with rationality measures within our population of elders. Instead, reduction of gray matter density in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex correlates tightly with irrational behavior. Interestingly, using a large fMRI sample and meta-analytic tool with Neurosynth, we found that this brain area shows strong coactivation patterns with nearly all of the value-associated regions identified in previous studies. These findings point toward a neuroanatomic locus for economic rationality in the aging brain and highlight the importance of understanding both anatomy and function in the study of aging, cognition, and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Age is a crucial factor in decision-making, with older individuals making more errors in choices. Using whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analysis, we found that reduction of gray matter density in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex correlates with economic irrationality: reduced gray matter volume in this area correlates with the frequency and severity of violations of the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference. Furthermore, this brain area strongly coactivates with other reward-associated regions identified with Neurosynth. These findings point toward a role for neuroscientific discoveries in shaping long-standing economic views of decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Assessing the Role of Inhibition in Stabilizing Neocortical Networks Requires Large-Scale Perturbation of the Inhibitory Population</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/12050?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons within cortical microcircuits are interconnected with recurrent excitatory synaptic connections that are thought to amplify signals (Douglas and Martin, 2007), form selective subnetworks (Ko et al., 2011), and aid feature discrimination. Strong inhibition (Haider et al., 2013) counterbalances excitation, enabling sensory features to be sharpened and represented by sparse codes (Willmore et al., 2011). This balance between excitation and inhibition makes it difficult to assess the strength, or gain, of recurrent excitatory connections within cortical networks, which is key to understanding their operational regime and the computations that they perform. Networks that combine an unstable high-gain excitatory population with stabilizing inhibitory feedback are known as inhibition-stabilized networks (ISNs) (Tsodyks et al., 1997). Theoretical studies using reduced network models predict that ISNs produce paradoxical responses to perturbation, but experimental perturbations failed to find evidence for ISNs in cortex (Atallah et al., 2012). Here, we reexamined this question by investigating how cortical network models consisting of many neurons behave after perturbations and found that results obtained from reduced network models fail to predict responses to perturbations in more realistic networks. Our models predict that a large proportion of the inhibitory network must be perturbed to reliably detect an ISN regime robustly in cortex. We propose that wide-field optogenetic suppression of inhibition under promoters targeting a large fraction of inhibitory neurons may provide a perturbation of sufficient strength to reveal the operating regime of cortex. Our results suggest that detailed computational models of optogenetic perturbations are necessary to interpret the results of experimental paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Many useful computational mechanisms proposed for cortex require local excitatory recurrence to be very strong, such that local inhibitory feedback is necessary to avoid epileptiform runaway activity (an &quot;inhibition-stabilized network&quot; or &quot;ISN&quot; regime). However, recent experimental results suggest that this regime may not exist in cortex. We simulated activity perturbations in cortical networks of increasing realism and found that, to detect ISN-like properties in cortex, large proportions of the inhibitory population must be perturbed. Current experimental methods for inhibitory perturbation are unlikely to satisfy this requirement, implying that existing experimental observations are inconclusive about the computational regime of cortex. Our results suggest that new experimental designs targeting a majority of inhibitory neurons may be able to resolve this question.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Phencyclidine Discoordinates Hippocampal Network Activity But Not Place Fields</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/12031?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/12031?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We used the psychotomimetic phencyclidine (PCP) to investigate the relationships among cognitive behavior, coordinated neural network function, and information processing within the hippocampus place cell system. We report in rats that PCP (5 mg/kg, i.p.) impairs a well learned, hippocampus-dependent place avoidance behavior in rats that requires cognitive control even when PCP is injected directly into dorsal hippocampus. PCP increases 60–100 Hz medium-freguency gamma oscillations in hippocampus CA1 and these increases correlate with the cognitive impairment caused by systemic PCP administration. PCP discoordinates theta-modulated medium-frequency and slow gamma oscillations in CA1 LFPs such that medium-frequency gamma oscillations become more theta-organized than slow gamma oscillations. CA1 place cell firing fields are preserved under PCP, but the drug discoordinates the subsecond temporal organization of discharge among place cells. This discoordination causes place cell ensemble representations of a familiar space to cease resembling pre-PCP representations despite preserved place fields. These findings point to the cognitive impairments caused by PCP arising from neural discoordination. PCP disrupts the timing of discharge with respect to the subsecond timescales of theta and gamma oscillations in the LFP. Because these oscillations arise from local inhibitory synaptic activity, these findings point to excitation–inhibition discoordination as the root of PCP-induced cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Hippocampal neural discharge is temporally coordinated on timescales of theta and gamma oscillations in the LFP and the discharge of a subset of pyramidal neurons called &quot;place cells&quot; is spatially organized such that discharge is restricted to locations called a cell's &quot;place field.&quot; Because this temporal coordination and spatial discharge organization is thought to represent spatial knowledge, we used the psychotomimetic phencyclidine (PCP) to disrupt cognitive behavior and assess the importance of neural coordination and place fields for spatial cognition. PCP impaired the judicious use of spatial information and discoordinated hippocampal discharge without disrupting firing fields. These findings dissociate place fields from spatial cognitive behavior and suggest that hippocampus discharge coordination is crucial to spatial cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: History-Dependent Odor Processing in the Mouse Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/12018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In nature, animals normally perceive sensory information on top of backgrounds. Thus, the neural substrate to perceive under background conditions is inherent in all sensory systems. Where and how sensory systems process backgrounds is not fully understood. In olfaction, just a few studies have addressed the issue of odor coding on top of continuous odorous backgrounds. Here, we tested how background odors are encoded by mitral cells (MCs) in the olfactory bulb (OB) of male mice. Using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon calcium imaging, we studied how MCs responded to odors in isolation versus their responses to the same odors on top of continuous backgrounds. We show that MCs adapt to continuous odor presentation and that mixture responses are different when preceded by background. In a subset of odor combinations, this history-dependent processing was useful in helping to identify target odors over background. Other odorous backgrounds were highly dominant such that target odors were completely masked by their presence. Our data are consistent in both low and high odor concentrations and in anesthetized and awake mice. Thus, odor processing in the OB is strongly influenced by the recent history of activity, which could have a powerful impact on how odors are perceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We examined a basic feature of sensory processing in the olfactory bulb. Specifically, we measured how mitral cells adapt to continuous background odors and how target odors are encoded on top of such background. Our results show clear differences in odor coding based on the immediate history of the stimulus. Our results support the argument that odor coding in the olfactory bulb depends on the recent history of the sensory environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Familiar But Unexpected: Effects of Sound Context Statistics on Auditory Responses in the Songbird Forebrain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rapid discrimination of salient acoustic signals in the noisy natural environment may depend, not only on specific stimulus features, but also on previous experience that generates expectations about upcoming events. We studied the neural correlates of expectation in the songbird forebrain by using natural vocalizations as stimuli and manipulating the category and familiarity of context sounds. In our paradigm, we recorded bilaterally from auditory neurons in awake adult male zebra finches with multiple microelectrodes during repeated playback of a conspecific song, followed by further playback of this test song in different interleaved sequences with other conspecific or heterospecific songs. Significant enhancement in the auditory response to the test song was seen when its acoustic features differed from the statistical distribution of context song features, but not when it shared the same distribution. Enhancement was also seen when the time of occurrence of the test song was uncertain. These results show that auditory forebrain responses in awake animals in the passive hearing state are modulated dynamically by previous auditory experience and imply that the auditory system can identify the category of a sound based on the global features of the acoustic context. Furthermore, this probability-dependent enhancement in responses to surprising stimuli is independent of stimulus-specific adaptation, which tracks familiarity, suggesting that the two processes could coexist in auditory processing. These findings establish the songbird as a model system for studying these phenomena and contribute to our understanding of statistical learning and the origin of human ERP phenomena to unexpected stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Traditional auditory neurophysiology has mapped acoustic features of sounds to the response properties of neurons; however, growing evidence suggests that neurons can also encode the probability of sounds. We recorded responses of songbird auditory neurons in a novel paradigm that presented a familiar test stimulus in a sequence with similar or dissimilar sounds. The responses encode, not only stimulus familiarity, but also the expectation for a class of sounds based on the recent statistics of varying sounds in the acoustic context. Our approach thus provides a model system that uses a controlled stimulus paradigm to understand the mechanisms by which top-down processes (expectation and memory) and bottom-up processes (based on stimulus features) interact in sensory coding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cellular Functions of the Autism Risk Factor PTCHD1 in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The gene &lt;i&gt;patched domain containing 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;PTCHD1&lt;/i&gt;) is mutated in patients with autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disabilities and has been hypothesized to contribute to Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling and synapse formation. We identify a panel of Ptchd1-interacting proteins that include postsynaptic density proteins and the retromer complex, revealing a link to critical regulators of dendritic and postsynaptic trafficking. &lt;i&gt;Ptchd1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out (KO) male mice exhibit cognitive alterations, including defects in a novel object recognition task. To test whether Ptchd1 is required for Shh-dependent signaling, we examined two Shh-dependent cell populations that express high levels of &lt;i&gt;Ptchd1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA: cerebellar granule cell precursors and dentate granule cells in the hippocampus. We found that proliferation of these neuronal precursors was not altered significantly in &lt;i&gt;Ptchd1&lt;/i&gt; KO male mice. We used whole-cell electrophysiology and anatomical methods to assess synaptic function in Ptchd1-deficient dentate granule cells. In the absence of Ptchd1, we observed profound disruption in excitatory/inhibitory balance despite normal dendritic spine density on dentate granule cells. These findings support a critical role of the Ptchd1 protein in the dentate gyrus, but indicate that it is not required for structural synapse formation in dentate granule cells or for Shh-dependent neuronal precursor proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mechanisms underlying neuronal and cellular alterations resulting from &lt;i&gt;patched domain containing 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Ptchd1&lt;/i&gt;) gene mutations are unknown. The results from this study support an association with dendritic trafficking complexes of Ptchd1. Loss-of-function experiments do not support a role in sonic hedgehog-dependent signaling, but reveal a disruption of synaptic transmission in the mouse dentate gyrus. The findings will help to guide ongoing efforts to understand the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders arising from Ptchd1 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sleep Deprivation Promotes Habitual Control over Goal-Directed Control: Behavioral and Neuroimaging Evidence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11979?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep is one of the most fundamental processes of life, playing an important role in the regulation of brain function. The long-term lack of sleep can cause memory impairments, declines in learning ability, and executive dysfunction. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of sleep deprivation on instrumental learning behavior, particularly goal-directed and habitual actions in humans, and investigated the underlying neural mechanisms. Healthy college students of either gender were enrolled and randomly divided into sleep deprivation group and sleep control group. fMRI data were collected. We found that one night of sleep deprivation led to greater responsiveness to stimuli that were associated with devalued outcomes in the slips-of-action test, indicating a deficit in the formation of goal-directed control and an overreliance on habits. Furthermore, sleep deprivation had no effect on the expression of acquired goal-directed action. The level of goal-directed action after sleep deprivation was positively correlated with baseline working memory capacity. The neuroimaging data indicated that goal-directed learning mainly recruited the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), the activation of which was less pronounced during goal-directed learning after sleep deprivation. Activation of the vmPFC during goal-directed learning during training was positively correlated with the level of goal-directed action performance. The present study suggests that people rely predominantly on habits at the expense of goal-directed control after sleep deprivation, and this process involves the vmPFC. These results contribute to a better understanding of the effects of sleep loss on decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the cognitive consequences of sleep deprivation has become extremely important over the past half century, given the continued decline in sleep duration in industrialized societies. Our results provide novel evidence that goal-directed action may be particularly vulnerable to sleep loss, and the brain mechanism underlying this effect was explored. Elucidation of the effects of sleep deprivation on decision-making will deepen our understanding of the function of sleep, emphasizing the role of sleep in cognitive impairments and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Abrogated Freud-1/Cc2d1a Repression of 5-HT1A Autoreceptors Induces Fluoxetine-Resistant Anxiety/Depression-Like Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11967?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Freud-1/Cc2d1a represses the gene transcription of serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) autoreceptors, which negatively regulate 5-HT tone. To test the role of Freud-1 &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we generated mice with adulthood conditional knock-out of Freud-1 in 5-HT neurons (&lt;i&gt;cF1ko&lt;/i&gt;). In &lt;i&gt;cF1ko&lt;/i&gt; mice, 5-HT1A autoreceptor protein, binding and hypothermia response were increased, with reduced 5-HT content and neuronal activity in the dorsal raphe. The &lt;i&gt;cF1ko&lt;/i&gt; mice displayed increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior that was resistant to chronic antidepressant (fluoxetine) treatment. Using conditional Freud-1/5-HT1A double knock-out (&lt;i&gt;cF1/1A dko&lt;/i&gt;) to disrupt both Freud-1 and 5-HT1A genes in 5-HT neurons, no increase in anxiety- or depression-like behavior was seen upon knock-out of Freud-1 on the 5-HT1A autoreceptor-negative background; rather, a reduction in depression-like behavior emerged. These studies implicate transcriptional dysregulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors by the repressor Freud-1 in anxiety and depression and provide a clinically relevant genetic model of antidepressant resistance. Targeting specific transcription factors, such as Freud-1, to restore transcriptional balance may augment response to antidepressant treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Altered regulation of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor has been implicated in human anxiety, major depression, suicide, and resistance to antidepressants. This study uniquely identifies a single transcription factor, Freud-1, as crucial for 5-HT1A autoreceptor expression &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Disruption of Freud-1 in serotonin neurons in mice links upregulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors to anxiety/depression-like behavior and provides a new model of antidepressant resistance. Treatment strategies to reestablish transcriptional regulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors could provide a more robust and sustained antidepressant response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Human Brain-Derived A{beta} Oligomers Bind to Synapses and Disrupt Synaptic Activity in a Manner That Requires APP</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11947?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Compelling genetic evidence links the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and several theories have been advanced to explain the relationship. A leading hypothesis proposes that a small amphipathic fragment of APP, the amyloid β-protein (Aβ), self-associates to form soluble aggregates that impair synaptic and network activity. Here, we used the most disease-relevant form of Aβ, protein isolated from AD brain. Using this material, we show that the synaptotoxic effects of Aβ depend on expression of APP and that the Aβ-mediated impairment of synaptic plasticity is accompanied by presynaptic effects that disrupt the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. The net increase in the E/I ratio and inhibition of plasticity are associated with Aβ localizing to synapses and binding of soluble Aβ aggregates to synapses requires the expression of APP. Our findings indicate a role for APP in AD pathogenesis beyond the generation of Aβ and suggest modulation of APP expression as a therapy for AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here, we report on the plasticity-disrupting effects of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) isolated from Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain and the requirement of amyloid precursor protein (APP) for these effects. We show that Aβ-containing AD brain extracts block hippocampal LTP, augment glutamate release probability, and disrupt the excitatory/inhibitory balance. These effects are associated with Aβ localizing to synapses and genetic ablation of APP prevents both Aβ binding and Aβ-mediated synaptic dysfunctions. Our results emphasize the importance of APP in AD and should stimulate new studies to elucidate APP-related targets suitable for pharmacological manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: CK2 Oppositely Modulates L-DOPA-Induced Dyskinesia via Striatal Projection Neurons Expressing D1 or D2 Receptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11930?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11930?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We have previously shown that casein kinase 2 (CK2) negatively regulates dopamine D1 and adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor signaling in the striatum. Ablation of CK2 in D1 receptor-positive striatal neurons caused enhanced locomotion and exploration at baseline, whereas CK2 ablation in D2 receptor-positive neurons caused increased locomotion after treatment with A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; antagonist, caffeine. Because both, D1 and A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, play major roles in the cellular responses to l-DOPA in the striatum, these findings prompted us to examine the impact of CK2 ablation on the effects of l-DOPA treatment in the unilateral 6-OHDA lesioned mouse model of Parkinson's disease. We report here that knock-out of CK2 in striatonigral neurons reduces the severity of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID), a finding that correlates with lowered pERK but unchanged pPKA substrate levels in D1 medium spiny neurons as well as in cholinergic interneurons. In contrast, lack of CK2 in striatopallidal neurons enhances LID and ERK phosphorylation. Coadministration of caffeine with a low dose of l-DOPA reduces dyskinesia in animals with striatopallidal knock-out to wild-type levels, suggesting a dependence on adenosine receptor activity. We also detect reduced G&lt;sub&gt;olf&lt;/sub&gt; levels in the striatonigral but not in the striatopallidal knock-out in response to l-DOPA treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our work shows, in a rodent model of PD, that treatment-induced dyskinesia and striatal ERK activation are bidirectionally modulated by ablating CK2 in D1- or D2-positive projection neurons, in male and female mice. The results reveal that CK2 regulates signaling events critical to LID in each of the two main populations of striatal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To date, l-DOPA is the most effective treatment for PD. Over time, however, its efficacy decreases, and side effects including l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) increase, affecting up to 78% of patients within 10 years of therapy (Hauser et al., 2007). It is understood that supersensitivity of the striatonigral pathway underlies LID, however, D2 agonists were also shown to induce LID (Bezard et al., 2001; Delfino et al., 2004). Our work implicates a novel player in the expression of LID, the kinase CK2: knock-out of CK2 in striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons has opposing effects on LID. The bidirectional modulation of dyskinesia reveals a central role for CK2 in striatal physiology and indicates that both pathways contribute to LID.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Transient Hypoxemia Chronically Disrupts Maturation of Preterm Fetal Ovine Subplate Neuron Arborization and Activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11912?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11912?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Preterm infants are at risk for a broad spectrum of neurobehavioral disabilities associated with diffuse disturbances in cortical growth and development. During brain development, subplate neurons (SPNs) are a largely transient population that serves a critical role to establish functional cortical circuits. By dynamically integrating into developing cortical circuits, they assist in consolidation of intracortical and extracortical circuits. Although SPNs reside in close proximity to cerebral white matter, which is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress, the susceptibility of SPNs remains controversial. We determined SPN responses to two common insults to the preterm brain: hypoxia-ischemia and hypoxia. We used a preterm fetal sheep model using both sexes that reproduces the spectrum of human cerebral injury and abnormal cortical growth. Unlike oligodendrocyte progenitors, SPNs displayed pronounced resistance to early or delayed cell death from hypoxia or hypoxia-ischemia. We thus explored an alternative hypothesis that these insults alter the maturational trajectory of SPNs. We used DiOlistic labeling to visualize the dendrites of SPNs selectively labeled for complexin-3. SPNs displayed reduced basal dendritic arbor complexity that was accompanied by chronic disturbances in SPN excitability and synaptic activity. SPN dysmaturation was significantly associated with the level of fetal hypoxemia and metabolic stress. Hence, despite the resistance of SPNs to insults that trigger white matter injury, transient hypoxemia disrupted SPN arborization and functional maturation during a critical window in cortical development. Strategies directed at limiting the duration or severity of hypoxemia during brain development may mitigate disturbances in cerebral growth and maturation related to SPN dysmaturation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The human preterm brain commonly sustains blood flow and oxygenation disturbances that impair cerebral cortex growth and cause life-long cognitive and learning disabilities. We investigated the fate of subplate neurons (SPNs), which are a master regulator of brain development that plays critical roles in establishing cortical connections to other brain regions. We used a preterm fetal sheep model that reproduces key features of brain injury in human preterm survivors. We analyzed the responses of fetal SPNs to transient disturbances in fetal oxygenation. We discovered that SPNs are surprisingly resistant to cell death from low oxygen states but acquire chronic structural and functional changes that suggest new strategies to prevent learning problems in children and adults that survive preterm birth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Extinction of Contextual Cocaine Memories Requires Cav1.2 within D1R-Expressing Cells and Recruits Hippocampal Cav1.2-Dependent Signaling Mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11894?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11894?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to cocaine-associated contextual cues contributes significantly to relapse. Extinction of these contextual associations, which involves a new form of learning, reduces cocaine-seeking behavior; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unknown. We report that extinction, but not acquisition, of cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) in male mice increased Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel mRNA and protein in postsynaptic density (PSD) fractions of the hippocampus, a brain region involved in drug–context associations. Moreover, viral-mediated deletion of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 in the dorsal hippocampus attenuated extinction of cocaine CPP. Molecular studies examining downstream Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 targets revealed that extinction recruited calcium/calmodulin (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/CaMK)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to the hippocampal PSD. This occurred in parallel with an increase in phosphorylation of the AMPA GluA1 receptor subunit at serine 831 (S831), a CaMKII site, along with an increase in total PSD GluA1. The necessity of S831 GluA1 was further demonstrated by the lack of extinction in S831A GluA1 phosphomutant mice. Of note hippocampal GluA1 levels remained unaltered at the PSD, but were reduced near the PSD and at perisynaptic sites of dendritic spines in extinction-resistant S831A mutant mice. Finally, conditional knock-out of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 in dopamine D1 receptor (D1R)-expressing cells resulted in attenuation of cocaine CPP extinction and lack of extinction-dependent changes in hippocampal PSD CaMKII expression and S831 GluA1 phosphorylation. In summary, we demonstrate an essential role for the hippocampal Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2/CaMKII/S831 GluA1 pathway in cocaine CPP extinction, with data supporting contribution of hippocampal D1R-expressing cells in this process. These findings demonstrate a novel role for Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 channels in extinction of contextual cocaine-associated memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Continued drug-seeking behavior, a defining characteristic of cocaine addiction, can be precipitated by contextual cues, yet the molecular mechanisms required for extinction of these context-specific memories remain poorly understood. Here, we have uncovered a novel and selective role of the Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel and its downstream signaling pathway in the hippocampus that mediate extinction of cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP). We additionally provide evidence that supports a role of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 within dopamine D1 receptor-expressing cells of the hippocampus for extinction of cocaine CPP. Therefore, these findings reveal a previously unknown role of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 channels within the hippocampus and in D1 receptor-expressing cells in extinction of cocaine-associated memories, providing a framework for further exploration of mechanisms underlying extinction of cocaine-seeking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Glial Draper Rescues A{beta} Toxicity in a Drosophila Model of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11881?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and reactive gliosis. Glial cells offer protection against AD by engulfing extracellular Aβ peptides, but the repertoire of molecules required for glial recognition and destruction of Aβ are still unclear. Here, we show that the highly conserved glial engulfment receptor Draper/MEGF10 provides neuroprotection in an AD model of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; (both sexes). Neuronal expression of human Aβ42&lt;sup&gt;arc&lt;/sup&gt; in adult flies results in robust Aβ accumulation, neurodegeneration, locomotor dysfunction, and reduced lifespan. Notably, all of these phenotypes are more severe in &lt;i&gt;draper&lt;/i&gt; mutant animals, whereas enhanced expression of glial Draper reverses Aβ accumulation, as well as behavioral phenotypes. We also show that the signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat92E), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/AP-1 signaling, and expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (Mmp1) are activated downstream of Draper in glia in response to Aβ42&lt;sup&gt;arc&lt;/sup&gt; exposure. Furthermore, Aβ42-induced upregulation of the phagolysosomal markers Atg8 and p62 was notably reduced in &lt;i&gt;draper&lt;/i&gt; mutant flies. Based on our findings, we propose that glia clear neurotoxic Aβ peptides in the AD model &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; brain through a Draper/STAT92E/JNK cascade that may be coupled to protein degradation pathways such as autophagy or more traditional phagolysosomal destruction methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Alzheimer's disease (AD) and similar dementias are common incurable neurodegenerative disorders in the aging population. As the primary immune responders in the brain, glial cells are implicated as key players in the onset and progression of AD and related disorders. Here we show that the glial engulfment receptor Draper is protective in a &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; model of AD, reducing levels of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides, reversing locomotor defects, and extending lifespan. We further show that protein degradation pathways are induced downstream of Draper in AD model flies, supporting a model in which glia engulf and destroy Aβ peptides to reduce amyloid-associated toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Area-Specific Regulation of Quiescent Neural Stem Cells by Notch3 in the Adult Mouse Subependymal Zone</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11867?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11867?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the adult mammalian brain, neural stem cells (NSCs) generate new neurons throughout the mammal's lifetime. The balance between quiescence and active cell division among NSCs is crucial in producing appropriate numbers of neurons while maintaining the stem cell pool for a long period. The Notch signaling pathway plays a central role in both maintaining quiescent NSCs (qNSCs) and promoting cell division of active NSCs (aNSCs), although no one knows how this pathway regulates these apparently opposite functions. Notch1 has been shown to promote proliferation of aNSCs without affecting qNSCs in the adult mouse subependymal zone (SEZ). In this study, we found that Notch3 is expressed to a higher extent in qNSCs than in aNSCs while Notch1 is preferentially expressed in aNSCs and transit-amplifying progenitors in the adult mouse SEZ. Furthermore, Notch3 is selectively expressed in the lateral and ventral walls of the SEZ. Knockdown of Notch3 in the lateral wall of the adult SEZ increased the division of NSCs. Moreover, deletion of the &lt;i&gt;Notch3&lt;/i&gt; gene resulted in significant reduction of qNSCs specifically in the lateral and ventral walls, compared with the medial and dorsal walls, of the lateral ventricles. Notch3 deletion also reduced the number of qNSCs activated after antimitotic cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (Ara-C) treatment. Importantly, Notch3 deletion preferentially reduced specific subtypes of newborn neurons in the olfactory bulb derived from the lateral walls of the SEZ. These results indicate that Notch isoforms differentially control the quiescent and proliferative steps of adult SEZ NSCs in a domain-specific manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the adult mammalian brain, the subependymal zone (SEZ) of the lateral ventricles is the largest neurogenic niche, where neural stem cells (NSCs) generate neurons. In this study, we found that Notch3 plays an important role in the maintenance of quiescent NSCs (qNSCs), while Notch1 has been reported to act as a regulator of actively cycling NSCs. Furthermore, we found that Notch3 is specifically expressed in qNSCs located in the lateral and ventral walls of the lateral ventricles and regulates neuronal production of NSCs in a region-specific manner. Our results indicate that Notch3, by maintaining the quiescence of a subpopulation of NSCs, confers a region-specific heterogeneity among NSCs in the adult SEZ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Presynaptic Regulation of Leptin in a Defined Lateral Hypothalamus-Ventral Tegmental Area Neurocircuitry Depends on Energy State</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11854?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11854?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic transmission controls brain activity and behaviors, including food intake. Leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, acts on neurons located in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) to maintain energy homeostasis and regulate food intake behavior. The specific synaptic mechanisms, cell types, and neural projections mediating this effect remain unclear. In male mice, using pathway-specific retrograde tracing, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; cell type identification, we found that leptin reduces excitatory synaptic strength onto both melanin-concentrating hormone- and orexin-expressing neurons projecting from the LHA to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which may affect dopamine signaling and motivation for feeding. A presynaptic mechanism mediated by distinct intracellular signaling mechanisms may account for this regulation by leptin. The regulatory effects of leptin depend on intact leptin receptor signaling. Interestingly, the synaptic regulatory function of leptin in the LHA-to-VTA neuronal pathway is highly sensitive to energy states: both energy deficiency (acute fasting) and excessive energy storage (high-fat diet-induced obesity) blunt the effect of leptin. These data revealed that leptin may regulate synaptic transmission in the LHA-to-VTA neurocircuitry in an inverted &quot;U-shape&quot; fashion dependent on plasma glucose levels and related to metabolic states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) to ventral tegmental area (VTA) projection is an important neural pathway involved in balancing whole-body energy states and reward. We found that the excitatory synaptic inputs to both orexin- and melanin-concentrating hormone expressing LHA neurons projecting to the VTA were suppressed by leptin, a peptide hormone derived from adipocytes that signals peripheral energy status to the brain. Interestingly, energy states seem to affect how leptin regulates synaptic transmission since both the depletion of energy induced by acute food deprivation and excessive storage of energy by high-fat diet feeding dampen the suppressive effect of leptin on synaptic transmission. Together, these data show that leptin regulates synaptic transmission and might be important for maintaining energy homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many lines of evidence suggest that the Parkinson's disease (PD)-related protein α-synuclein (α-SYN) can propagate from cell to cell in a prion-like manner. However, the cellular mechanisms behind the spreading remain elusive. Here, we show that human astrocytes derived from embryonic stem cells actively transfer aggregated α-SYN to nearby astrocytes via direct contact and tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). Failure in the astrocytes' lysosomal digestion of excess α-SYN oligomers results in α-SYN deposits in the trans-Golgi network followed by endoplasmic reticulum swelling and mitochondrial disturbances. The stressed astrocytes respond by conspicuously sending out TNTs, enabling intercellular transfer of α-SYN to healthy astrocytes, which in return deliver mitochondria, indicating a TNT-mediated rescue mechanism. Using a pharmacological approach to inhibit TNT formation, we abolished the transfer of both α-SYN and mitochondria. Together, our results highlight the role of astrocytes in α-SYN cell-to-cell transfer, identifying possible pathophysiological events in the PD brain that could be of therapeutic relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Astrocytes are the major cell type in the brain, yet their role in Parkinson's disease progression remains elusive. Here, we show that human astrocytes actively transfer aggregated α-synuclein (α-SYN) to healthy astrocytes via direct contact and tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), rather than degrade it. The astrocytes engulf large amounts of oligomeric α-SYN that are subsequently stored in the trans-Golgi network region. The accumulation of α-SYN in the astrocytes affects their lysosomal machinery and induces mitochondrial damage. The stressed astrocytes respond by sending out TNTs, enabling intercellular transfer of α-SYN to healthy astrocytes. Our findings highlight an unexpected role of astrocytes in the propagation of α-SYN pathology via TNTs, revealing astrocytes as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Glutamate Activates AMPA Receptor Conductance in the Developing Schwann Cells of the Mammalian Peripheral Nerves</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11818?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11818?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Schwann cells (SCs) are myelinating cells of the PNS. Although SCs are known to express different channels and receptors on their surface, little is known about the activation and function of these proteins. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are thought to play an essential role during development of SC lineage and during peripheral nerve injury, so we sought to study their functional properties. We established a novel preparation of living peripheral nerve slices with preserved cellular architecture and used a patch-clamp technique to study AMPA-receptor (AMPAR)-mediated currents in SCs for the first time. We found that the majority of SCs in the nerves dissected from embryonic and neonatal mice of both sexes respond to the application of glutamate with inward current mediated by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable AMPARs. Using stationary fluctuation analysis (SFA), we demonstrate that single-channel conductance of AMPARs in SCs is 8–11 pS, which is comparable to that in neurons. We further show that, when SCs become myelinating, they downregulate functional AMPARs. This study is the first to demonstrate AMPAR-mediated conductance in SCs of vertebrates, to investigate elementary properties of AMPARs in these cells, and to provide detailed electrophysiological and morphological characterization of SCs at different stages of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We provide several important conceptual and technical advances in research on the PNS. We pioneer the first description of AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated currents in the PNS glia of vertebrates and provide new insights into the properties of AMPAR channels in peripheral glia; for example, their Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeability and single-channel conductance. We describe for the first time the electrophysiological and morphological properties of Schwann cells (SCs) at different stages of development and show that functional AMPARs are expressed only in developing, not mature, SCs. Finally, we introduce a preparation of peripheral nerve slices for patch-clamp recordings. This preparation opens new possibilities for studying the physiology of SCs in animal models and in surgical human samples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Determining the Neural Substrate for Encoding a Memory of Human Pain and the Influence of Anxiety</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11806?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To convert a painful stimulus into a briefly maintainable construct when the painful stimulus is no longer accessible is essential to guide human behavior and avoid dangerous situations. Because of the aversive nature of pain, this encoding process might be influenced by emotional aspects and could thus vary across individuals, but we have yet to understand both the basic underlying neural mechanisms as well as potential interindividual differences. Using fMRI in combination with a delayed-discrimination task in healthy volunteers of both sexes, we discovered that brain regions involved in this working memory encoding process were dissociable according to whether the to-be-remembered stimulus was painful or not, with the medial thalamus and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex encoding painful and the primary somatosensory cortex encoding nonpainful stimuli. Encoding of painful stimuli furthermore significantly enhanced functional connectivity between the thalamus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). With regards to emotional aspects influencing encoding processes, we observed that more anxious participants showed significant performance advantages when encoding painful stimuli. Importantly, only during the encoding of pain, the interindividual differences in anxiety were associated with the strength of coupling between medial thalamus and mPFC, which was furthermore related to activity in the amygdala. These results indicate not only that there is a distinct signature for the encoding of a painful experience in humans, but also that this encoding process involves a strong affective component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To convert the sensation of pain into a briefly maintainable construct is essential to guide human behavior and avoid dangerous situations. Although this working memory encoding process is implicitly contained in the majority of studies, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Using fMRI in a delayed-discrimination task, we found that the encoding of pain engaged the activation of the medial thalamus and the functional connectivity between the thalamus and medial prefrontal cortex. These fMRI data were directly and indirectly related to participants' self-reported trait and state anxiety. Our findings indicate that the mechanisms responsible for the encoding of noxious stimuli differ from those for the encoding of innocuous stimuli, and that these mechanisms are shaped by an individual's anxiety levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hippocampal-Prefrontal Reactivation during Learning Is Stronger in Awake Compared with Sleep States</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11789?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/49/11789?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events occur during both behavior (awake SWRs) and slow-wave sleep (sleep SWRs). Awake and sleep SWRs both contribute to spatial learning and memory, thought to be mediated by the coordinated reactivation of behavioral experiences in hippocampal-cortical circuits seen during SWRs. Current hypotheses suggest that reactivation contributes to memory consolidation processes, but whether awake and sleep reactivation are suited to play similar or different roles remains unclear. Here we addressed that issue by examining the structure of hippocampal (area CA1) and prefrontal (PFC) activity recorded across behavior and sleep stages in male rats learning a spatial alternation task. We found a striking state difference: prefrontal modulation during awake and sleep SWRs was surprisingly distinct, with differing patterns of excitation and inhibition. CA1-PFC synchronization was stronger during awake SWRs, and spatial reactivation, measured using both pairwise and ensemble measures, was more structured for awake SWRs compared with post-task sleep SWRs. Stronger awake reactivation was observed despite the absence of coordination between network oscillations, namely hippocampal SWRs and cortical delta and spindle oscillations, which is prevalent during sleep. Finally, awake CA1-PFC reactivation was enhanced most prominently during initial learning in a novel environment, suggesting a key role in early learning. Our results demonstrate significant differences in awake and sleep reactivation in the hippocampal-prefrontal network. These findings suggest that awake SWRs support accurate memory storage and memory-guided behavior, whereas sleep SWR reactivation is better suited to support integration of memories across experiences during consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) occur both in the awake state during behavior and in the sleep state after behavior. Awake and sleep SWRs are associated with memory reactivation and are important for learning, but their specific memory functions remain unclear. Here, we found profound differences in hippocampal-cortical reactivation during awake and sleep SWRs, with key implications for their roles in memory. Awake reactivation is a higher-fidelity representation of behavioral experiences, and is enhanced during early learning, without requiring coordination of network oscillations that is seen during sleep. Our findings suggest that awake reactivation is ideally suited to support initial memory formation, retrieval and planning, whereas sleep reactivation may play a broader role in integrating memories across experiences during consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous lifelong development and learning is a fundamental capability of
humans, differentiating them from current deep learning systems. However, other
branches of artificial intelligence have designed crucial ingredients towards
autonomous learning: curiosity and intrinsic motivation, social learning and
natural interaction with peers, and embodiment. These mechanisms guide
exploration and autonomous choice of goals, and integrating them with deep
learning opens stimulating perspectives. Deep learning (DL) approaches made
great advances in artificial intelligence, but are still far away from human
learning. As argued convincingly by Lake et al., differences include human
capabilities to learn causal models of the world from very little data,
leveraging compositional representations and priors like intuitive physics and
psychology. However, there are other fundamental differences between current DL
systems and human learning, as well as technical ingredients to fill this gap,
that are either superficially, or not adequately, discussed by Lake et al.
These fundamental mechanisms relate to autonomous development and learning.
They are bound to play a central role in artificial intelligence in the future.
Current DL systems require engineers to manually specify a task-specific
objective function for every new task, and learn through off-line processing of
large training databases. On the contrary, humans learn autonomously open-ended
repertoires of skills, deciding for themselves which goals to pursue or value,
and which skills to explore, driven by intrinsic motivation/curiosity and
social learning through natural interaction with peers. Such learning processes
are incremental, online, and progressive. Human child development involves a
progressive increase of complexity in a curriculum of learning where skills are
explored, acquired, and built on each other, through particular ordering and
timing. Finally, human learning happens in the physical world, and through
bodily and physical experimentation, under severe constraints on energy, time,
and computational resources. In the two last decades, the field of
Developmental and Cognitive Robotics (Cangelosi and Schlesinger, 2015, Asada et
al., 2009), in strong interaction with developmental psychology and
neuroscience, has achieved significant advances in computational

	<description>Bioprinting is a method by which a cell-encapsulating bioink is patterned to create complex tissue architectures. Given the potential impact of this technology on neural research, we review the current state-of-the-art approaches for bioprinting neural tissues. While 2D neural cultures are ubiquitous for studying neural cells, 3D cultures can more accurately replicate the microenvironment of neural tissues. By bioprinting neuronal constructs, one can precisely control the microenvironment by specifically formulating the bioink for neural tissues, and by spatially patterning cell types and scaffold properties in three dimensions.</description>

	<description>Mateo et al. demonstrate that glutamate and acetylcholine-driven dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens is modulated by CB1 receptors on prefrontal cortical afferents. Endogenous activation of these receptors modifies dopamine-dependent reward-driven behavior sustained by optical activation of prefrontal cortical terminals.</description>

	<description>Iwata et al. demonstrate that phase coding, but not rate coding, in mitral cells is useful for concentration-invariant odor identity coding. They also found that mechanosensation in olfactory sensory neurons facilitates, rather than masks, the robust phase coding of odors.</description>

	<description>Stereoscopic vision depends on correct matching of corresponding features between the two eyes. It is unclear where the brain solves this binocular correspondence problem. Although our visual system is able to make correct global matches, there are many possible false matches between any two images. Here, we use optical imaging...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/hOFnLDytol4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focal seizures are assumed to arise from a hypersynchronous activity affecting a circumscribed brain region. Using microelectrodes in seizure-generating deep mesial regions of 9 patients, we investigated the firing of hundreds of single-neurons before, during and after ictal EEG discharges. Neuronal spiking activity at seizure initiation was highly heterogeneous and not hypersynchronous. Furthermore, groups of neurons showed significant changes in activity minutes before the seizure with no concomitant changes in the corresponding macroscopic EEG recordings. Altogether, our findings suggest that only limitedsubsets of neurons in epileptic depth regions initiate the seizure-onset and that ictogenic mechanisms operate in sub-millimeter-scale microdomains.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meta-analysis of 142 positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography studies that have investigated striatal presynaptic dopamine function in Parkinson disease (PD) was performed. Subregional estimates of striatal dopamine metabolism are presented. The aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase (AADC) defect appears to be consistently smaller than the dopamine transporter and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 defects, suggesting upregulation of AADC function in PD. The correlation between disease severity and dopamine loss appears linear, but the majority of longitudinal studies point to a negative exponential progression pattern of dopamine loss in PD.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A localized pallidal physiomarker in cervical dystonia</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25095-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) allows for direct recordings of neuronal activity from the human basal ganglia. In Parkinson's disease, a disease-specific physiomarker was identified that is now used to investigate adaptive closed-loop stimulation in first studies. In dystonia, such a physiomarker is missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25095-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pallidal oscillations were recorded from 153 contact pairs in 27 patients. We investigated whether power amplitudes in theta and beta bands correlate with dystonic symptom severity across patients. We then projected theta power from each contact pair onto standard subcortical anatomy. In this way, we defined a theta hot spot on a group level and investigated whether proximity of the active DBS contacts to it correlated with clinical improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25095-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dystonic symptom severity significantly correlated with theta but not beta oscillatory amplitudes (ρ = 0.4, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.009) and interhemispheric coherence (ρ = 0.5, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002). The sweet spot of theta activity localized to the posterior third of the internal pallidum and theta power correlated with proximity to this location (ρ = 0.23, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002), which coincided with 3 previously published coordinates describing optimal stimulation targets. Finally, motor improvement through pallidal long-term DBS correlated with theta peak amplitude (ρ = 0.38, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.018).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25095-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that theta oscillations in the internal pallidum are robustly associated with dystonic symptoms in cervical dystonia and may be a useful biomarker for adaptive closed-loop stimulation. Furthermore, theta oscillatory activity may have a predictive value for the clinical benefit after chronic DBS that could be used to improve intraoperative neurophysiological target mapping during electrode implantation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Coupled Molecular Feedback Loops Maintain Synaptic Long-Term Potentiation: A Computational Model. (arXiv:1712.00683v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00683</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00683</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain stores memories by adjusting the strengths of connections between
neurons. Such synaptic plasticity comes in different forms that strengthen or
weaken synapses and range from very short-lived to long-lasting. One of the
most well-studied forms of plasticity is long-term potentiation, LTP, a
phenomenon whereby synaptic strength is persistently increased in response to
stimulation. Different forms of LTP are known to play important roles in both
short-term and long-term memory.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many different proteins have been identified in the sub-cellular molecular
processes that are involved in LTP. An important question is how these
proteins, with lifetimes measured in hours or days, can maintain memories for
months or years. We present a computational model that shows how this problem
can be solved by two interconnected feedback loops of molecular reactions, one
involving the atypical protein kinase PKM{\zeta} and its messenger RNA, the
other involving PKM{\zeta} and GluR2-containing AMPA receptors. The model
demonstrates that robust bistability - stable equilibria in the synapse's
potentiated and unpotentiated states - can arise from simple molecular
reactions. Our simulations are able to account for a wide range of empirical
results, including induction and maintenance of late-phase LTP, cellular memory
reconsolidation and the effect of different pharmaceutical interventions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Functional brain networks reveal the existence of cognitive reserve and the interplay between network topology and dynamics. (arXiv:1712.00462v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00462</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00462</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigated how the organization of functional brain networks was related
to cognitive reserve (CR) during a memory task in healthy aging. We obtained
the magnetoencephalographic functional networks of 20 elders with a high or low
CR level to analyse the differences at network features. We reported a negative
correlation between synchronization of the whole network and CR, and observed
differences both at the node and at the network level in: the average shortest
path and the network outreach. Individuals with high CR required functional
networks with lower links to successfully carry out the memory task. These
results may indicate that those individuals with low CR level exhibited a dual
pattern of compensation and network impairment, since their functioning was
more energetically costly to perform the task as the high CR group.
Additionally, we evaluated how the dynamical properties of the different brain
regions were correlated to the network parameters obtaining that entropy was
positively correlated with the strength and clustering coefficient, while
complexity behaved conversely. Consequently, highly connected nodes of the
functional networks showed a more stochastic and less complex signal. We
consider that network approach may be a relevant tool to better understand
brain functioning in aging.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: pSSAlib: The partial-propensity stochastic chemical network simulator</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005865</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Oleksandr Ostrenko, Pietro Incardona, Rajesh Ramaswamy, Lutz Brusch, Ivo F. Sbalzarini&lt;/p&gt;

Chemical reaction networks are ubiquitous in biology, and their dynamics is fundamentally stochastic. Here, we present the software library pSSAlib, which provides a complete and concise implementation of the most efficient partial-propensity methods for simulating exact stochastic chemical kinetics. pSSAlib can import models encoded in Systems Biology Markup Language, supports time delays in chemical reactions, and stochastic spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion systems. It also provides tools for statistical analysis of simulation results and supports multiple output formats. It has previously been used for studies of biochemical reaction pathways and to benchmark other stochastic simulation methods. Here, we describe pSSAlib in detail and apply it to a new model of the endocytic pathway in eukaryotic cells, leading to the discovery of a stochastic counterpart of the cut-out switch motif underlying early-to-late endosome conversion. pSSAlib is provided as a stand-alone command-line tool and as a developer API. We also provide a plug-in for the SBMLToolbox.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Efficient encoding of motion is mediated by gap junctions in the fly visual system</title>

Understanding the computational implications of specific synaptic connectivity patterns is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. In particular, the computational role of ubiquitous electrical synapses operating via gap junctions remains elusive. In the fly visual system, the cells in the vertical-system network, which play a key role in visual processing, primarily connect to each other via axonal gap junctions. This network therefore provides a unique opportunity to explore the functional role of gap junctions in sensory information processing. Our information theoretical analysis of a realistic VS network model shows that within 10 ms following the onset of the visual input, the presence of axonal gap junctions enables the VS system to efficiently encode the axis of rotation, θ, of the fly’s ego motion. This encoding efficiency, measured in bits, is near-optimal with respect to the physical limits of performance determined by the statistical structure of the visual input itself. The VS network is known to be connected to downstream pathways via a subset of triplets of the vertical system cells; we found that because of the axonal gap junctions, the efficiency of this subpopulation in encoding θ is superior to that of the whole vertical system network and is robust to a wide range of signal to noise ratios. We further demonstrate that this efficient encoding of motion by this subpopulation is necessary for the fly's visually guided behavior, such as banked turns in evasive maneuvers. Because gap junctions are formed among the axons of the vertical system cells, they only impact the system’s readout, while maintaining the dendritic input intact, suggesting that the computational principles implemented by neural circuitries may be much richer than previously appreciated based on point neuron models. Our study provides new insights as to how specific network connectivity leads to efficient encoding of sensory stimuli.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gB67vf_2z4E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A model of the onset of the senescence associated secretory phenotype after DNA damage induced senescence</title>

Cells and tissues are exposed to stress from numerous sources. Senescence is a protective mechanism that prevents malignant tissue changes and constitutes a fundamental mechanism of aging. It can be accompanied by a senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that causes chronic inflammation. We present a Boolean network model-based gene regulatory network of the SASP, incorporating published gene interaction data. The simulation results describe current biological knowledge. The model predicts different &lt;i&gt;in-silico&lt;/i&gt; knockouts that prevent key SASP-mediators, IL-6 and IL-8, from getting activated upon DNA damage. The NF-κB Essential Modulator (NEMO) was the most promising &lt;i&gt;in-silico&lt;/i&gt; knockout candidate and we were able to show its importance in the inhibition of IL-6 and IL-8 following DNA-damage in murine dermal fibroblasts &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We strengthen the speculated regulator function of the NF-κB signaling pathway in the onset and maintenance of the SASP using &lt;i&gt;in-silico&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; approaches. We were able to mechanistically show, that DNA damage mediated SASP triggering of IL-6 and IL-8 is mainly relayed through NF-κB, giving access to possible therapy targets for SASP-accompanied diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zqDR2IVRyVA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Ischemic core thresholds change with time to reperfusion: A case control study</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction&lt;/b&gt;: We aimed to identify if acute ischemic stroke patients with known complete reperfusion after thrombectomy had the same baseline CTP ischemic core threshold to predict infarction as thrombolysis patients with complete reperfusion. &lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Patients who underwent thrombectomy were matched by age, clinical severity, occlusion location, and baseline perfusion lesion volume to patients who were treated with intravenous alteplase alone from the International Stroke Perfusion Imaging Registry. A pixel-based analysis of co-registered pre-treatment CT perfusion (CTP) and 24 hour diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was then undertaken to define the optimum CTP thresholds for the ischemic core. &lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: There were 132 eligible thrombectomy patients and 132 matched controls treated with alteplase alone. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Score (median 15, IQR 11-19), age (median 65, IQR 59 - 80) and time to IV treatment (median 153min, IQR 82- 315min) were well-matched (all p&amp;gt;0.05). Despite similar baseline CTP ischemic core volumes using the previously validated measure (rCBF &amp;lt;30%), thrombectomy patients had a smaller median 24 hour infarct core of 17.3mL (IQR 11.3-32.8mL) versus 24.3 mL (IQR 16.7-42.2mL, p=0.011) in alteplase-treated controls. As a result, the optimal threshold to define the ischemic core in thrombectomy patients was rCBF &amp;lt;20% (AUC 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84, 0.94), while in alteplase controls the optimal ischemic core threshold remained rCBF &amp;lt;30% (AUC 0.83, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.85). &lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Thrombectomy salvaged tissue with lower CBF, likely due to earlier reperfusion. For patients who achieve rapid reperfusion, a stricter rCBF threshold to estimate the ischemic core should be considered. This article is protected by copyright.

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25096-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migraine aura is sparsely studied due to the highly challenging task of capturing patients during aura. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is likely the underlying phenomenon of aura. The possible correlation between the multifaceted phenomenology of aura symptoms and the effects of CSD on the brain has not been ascertained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25096-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five migraine patients were studied during various forms of aura symptoms induced by hypoxia, sham hypoxia, or physical exercise with concurrent photostimulation. The blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal response to visual stimulation was measured in retinotopic mapping–defined visual cortex areas V1 to V4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25096-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found reduced BOLD response in patients reporting scotoma and increased response in patients who only experienced positive symptoms. Furthermore, patients with bilateral visual symptoms had corresponding bihemispherical changes in BOLD response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25096-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that different aura symptoms reflect different types of cerebral dysfunction, which correspond to specific changes in BOLD signal reactivity. Furthermore, we provide evidence of bilateral CSD recorded by fMRI during bilateral aura symptoms. Ann Neurol 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Parkinson disease (PD), mitochondrial dysfunction associates with nigral dopaminergic neuronal loss. Cholinergic neuronal loss co-occurs, particularly within a brainstem structure, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). We isolated single cholinergic neurons from postmortem PPNs of aged controls and PD patients. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and mtDNA deletions were increased significantly in PD patients compared to controls. Furthermore, compared to controls the PD patients had significantly more PPN cholinergic neurons containing mtDNA deletion levels exceeding 60%, a level associated with deleterious effects on oxidative phosphorylation. The current results differ from studies reporting mtDNA depletion in nigral dopaminergic neurons of PD patients. Ann Neurol 2017;00:000–000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

We aimed to use decline in PCC glucose metabolism as a proxy for the development and progression of AD to discover common genetic variants associated with disease vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25094-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of decline in PCC fludeoxyglucose F 18 ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F] FDG) positron emission tomography measured in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants (n = 606). We then performed follow-up analyses to assess the impact of significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on disease risk and longitudinal cognitive performance in a large independent data set (n = 870). Last, we assessed whether significant SNP influence gene expression using two RNA sequencing data sets (n = 210 and n = 159).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In a follow-up analysis using an independent data set, we demonstrate a protective effect of this variant against risk of conversion to MCI or AD (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.038) and against cognitive decline in individuals who develop dementia (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 3.41 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, this variant is associated with altered gene expression in peripheral blood and altered &lt;em&gt;PPPP4R3A&lt;/em&gt; transcript expression in temporal cortex, suggesting a role at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article examines the serious shortcomings that characterize the current taxonomy of postcomatose disorders of consciousness (DoC), and it provides guidelines for how an improved DoC taxonomy might be developed. In particular, it is argued that behavioral criteria for the application of DoC categories should be supplemented with brain-based criteria (eg, information derived from electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging), and that the categorical framework that currently characterizes DoC should be replaced by a multidimensional framework that better captures the performance of patients across a range of cognitive and behavioural tasks.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Relation between firing statistics of spiking neuron with delayed fast inhibitory feedback and without feedback. (arXiv:1712.00359v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00359</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00359</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider a class of spiking neuronal models, defined by a set of
conditions typical for basic threshold-type models, such as the leaky
integrate-and-fire or the binding neuron model and also for some artificial
neurons. A neuron is fed with a renewal process. Each output impulse is applied
to the neuron itself after a finite delay $\Delta$. This impulse acts as being
delivered through a fast Cl-type inhibitory synapse. We derive a general
relation which allows calculating exactly the probability density function
(pdf) $p(t)$ of output interspike intervals of a neuron with feedback based on
known pdf $p^0(t)$ for the same neuron without feedback and on the properties
of the feedback line (the $\Delta$ value). Similar relations between
corresponding moments are derived. Furthermore, we prove that initial segment
of pdf $p^0(t)$ for a neuron with a fixed threshold level is the same for any
neuron satisfying the imposed conditions and is completely determined by the
input stream. For the Poisson input stream, we calculate that initial segment
exactly and, based on it, obtain exactly the initial segment of pdf $p(t)$ for
a neuron with feedback. That is the initial segment of $p(t)$ is
model-independent as well. The obtained expressions are checked by means of
Monte Carlo simulation. The course of $p(t)$ has a pronounced peculiarity,
which makes it impossible to approximate $p(t)$ by Poisson or another simple
stochastic process.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Interplay of activation kinetics and the derivative conductance determines the resonance properties of neurons. (arXiv:1712.00306v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00306</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00306</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a neuron with hyperpolarization activated current ($I_h$), the correct
input frequency leads to an enhancement of the output response. This behavior
is known as resonance and is well described by the neuronal impedance. In a
simple neuron model we derive equations for the neuron's resonance and we link
its frequency and existence with the biophysical properties of $I_h$. For a
small voltage change, the component of the ratio of current change to voltage
change ($dI/dV$) due to the voltage-dependent conductance change ($dg/dV$) is
known as derivative conductance ($G_h^{Der}$). We show that both $G_h^{Der}$
and the current activation kinetics (characterized by the activation time
constant $\tau_h$) are mainly responsible for controlling the frequency and
existence of resonance. The increment of both factors ($G_h^{Der}$ and
$\tau_h$) greatly contributes to the appearance of resonance. We also
demonstrate that resonance is voltage dependent due to the voltage dependence
of $G_h^{Der}$. Our results have important implications and can be used to
predict and explain resonance properties of neurons with the $I_h$ current.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is one of the most complex living structures in the known
Universe. It consists of billions of neurons and synapses. Due to its intrinsic
complexity, it can be a formidable task to accurately depict brain's structure
and functionality. In the past, numerous studies have been conducted on
modeling brain disease, structure, and functionality. Some of these studies
have employed Agent-based approaches including multiagent-based simulation
models as well as brain complex networks. While these models have all been
developed using agent-based computing, however, to our best knowledge, none of
them have employed the use of Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)
methodologies in developing the brain or disease model. This is a problem
because without due process, developed models can miss out on important
requirements. AOSE has the unique capability of merging concepts from
multiagent systems, agent-based modeling, artificial intelligence, besides
concepts from distributed systems. AOSE involves the various tested software
engineering principles in various phases of the model development ranging from
analysis, design, implementation, and testing phases. In this paper, we employ
the use of three different AOSE methodologies for modeling the Multiple
Sclerosis brain disease namely GAIA, TROPOS, and MASE. After developing the
models, we further employ the use of Exploratory Agent-based Modeling (EABM) to
develop an actual model replicating previous results as a proof of concept. The
key objective of this study is to demonstrate and explore the viability and
effectiveness of AOSE methodologies in the development of complex brain
structure and cognitive process models. Our key finding include demonstration
that AOSE methodologies can be considerably helpful in modeling various living
complex systems, in general, and the human brain, in particular.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: 3-MEthylGlutaconic aciduria, Dystonia-Deafness, Hepatopathy, Encephalopathy, Leigh-like syndrome (MEGDHEL) syndrome is caused by biallelic variants in &lt;em&gt;SERAC1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Multi centre study concerning the course of disease for each organ system, together with metabolic, neuroradiological and genetic findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: 67 individuals (39 previously unreported) from 59 families were included (age range 5 days - 33.4 years, median age 9 years). A total of 41 different &lt;em&gt;SERAC1&lt;/em&gt; variants were identified, including 20 that have not been reported before. With exception of two families with a milder phenotype, all affected individuals show a strikingly homogeneous phenotype and time course. Severe, reversible neonatal liver dysfunction and hypoglycemia was seen in more than 40% of all cases. Starting at a median age of six months muscular hypotonia (91%) was seen, followed by progressive spasticity (82%, median onset 15 months) and dystonia (82%, 18 months). The majority of affected individuals never learnt to walk (68%). 79% suffered hearing loss, 58% never learnt to speak, nearly all had significant intellectual disability (88%). MRI features were accordingly homogenous with bilateral basal ganglia involvement (98%), the characteristic “putaminal eye” was seen in 53%. The urinary marker 3-methylglutaconic aciduria is virtually present in all patients (98%). Supportive treatment focused on spasticity and drooling, was effective in individuals treated, hearing aids or cochlear implants did not improve communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: MEGDHEL syndrome is as a progressive deafness-dystonia syndrome with frequent and reversible neonatal liver involvement and a strikingly homogenous course of disease.

While nucleosome positioning on eukaryotic genome play important roles for genetic regulation, molecular mechanisms of nucleosome positioning and sliding along DNA are not well understood. Here we investigated thermally-activated spontaneous nucleosome sliding mechanisms developing and applying a coarse-grained molecular simulation method that incorporates both long-range electrostatic and short-range hydrogen-bond interactions between histone octamer and DNA. The simulations revealed two distinct sliding modes depending on the nucleosomal DNA sequence. A uniform DNA sequence showed frequent sliding with one base pair step in a rotation-coupled manner, akin to screw-like motions. On the contrary, a strong positioning sequence, the so-called 601 sequence, exhibits rare, abrupt transitions of five and ten base pair steps without rotation. Moreover, we evaluated the importance of hydrogen bond interactions on the sliding mode, finding that strong and weak bonds favor respectively the rotation-coupled and -uncoupled sliding movements.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a3QV103gjno&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Long-distance olfactory search behaviors depend on odor detection dynamics. Due to turbulence, olfactory signals travel as bursts of variable concentration and spacing and are characterized by long-tail distributions of odor/no-odor events, challenging the computing capacities of olfactory systems. How animals encode complex olfactory scenes to track the plume far from the source remains unclear. Here we focus on the coding of the plume temporal dynamics in moths. We compare responses of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs) to sequences of pheromone stimuli either with white-noise patterns or with realistic turbulent temporal structures simulating a large range of distances (8 to 64 m) from the odor source. For the first time, we analyze what information is extracted by the olfactory system at large distances from the source. Neuronal responses are analyzed using linear–nonlinear models fitted with white-noise stimuli and used for predicting responses to turbulent stimuli. We found that neuronal firing rate is less correlated with the dynamic odor time course when distance to the source increases because of improper coding during long odor and no-odor events that characterize large distances. Rapid adaptation during long puffs does not preclude however the detection of puff transitions in PNs. Individual PNs but not individual ORNs encode the onset and offset of odor puffs for any temporal structure of stimuli. A higher spontaneous firing rate coupled to an inhibition phase at the end of PN responses contributes to this coding property. This allows PNs to decode the temporal structure of the odor plume at any distance to the source, an essential piece of information moths can use in their tracking behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9shIb_kQ8HI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We experimentally and numerically investigate the evolutionary dynamics of four competing strains of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; with differing expansion velocities in radially expanding colonies. We compare experimental measurements of the average fraction, correlation functions between strains, and the relative rates of genetic domain wall annihilations and coalescences to simulations modeling the population as a one-dimensional ring of annihilating and coalescing random walkers with deterministic biases due to selection. The simulations reveal that the evolutionary dynamics can be collapsed onto master curves governed by three essential parameters: (1) an expansion length beyond which selection dominates over genetic drift; (2) a characteristic angular correlation describing the size of genetic domains; and (3) a dimensionless constant quantifying the interplay between a colony’s curvature at the frontier and its selection length scale. We measure these parameters with a new technique that precisely measures small selective differences between spatially competing strains and show that our simulations accurately predict the dynamics without additional fitting. Our results suggest that the random walk model can act as a useful predictive tool for describing the evolutionary dynamics of range expansions composed of an arbitrary number of genotypes with different fitnesses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9wSVg0-w_-k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A metabolome-wide genome-wide association study (mGWAS) aims to discover the effects of genetic variants on metabolome phenotypes. Most mGWASes use as phenotypes concentrations of limited sets of metabolites that can be identified and quantified from spectral information. In contrast, in an &lt;i&gt;untargeted&lt;/i&gt; mGWAS both identification and quantification are forgone and, instead, all measured metabolome features are tested for association with genetic variants. While the untargeted approach does not discard data that may have eluded identification, the interpretation of associated features remains a challenge. To address this issue, we developed &lt;i&gt;metabomatching&lt;/i&gt; to identify the metabolites underlying significant associations observed in untargeted mGWASes on proton NMR metabolome data. Metabomatching capitalizes on &lt;i&gt;genetic spiking&lt;/i&gt;, the concept that because metabolome features associated with a genetic variant tend to correspond to the peaks of the NMR spectrum of the underlying metabolite, genetic association can allow for identification. Applied to the untargeted mGWASes in the SHIP and CoLaus cohorts and using 180 reference NMR spectra of the urine metabolome database, metabomatching successfully identified the underlying metabolite in 14 of 19, and 8 of 9 associations, respectively. The accuracy and efficiency of our method make it a strong contender for facilitating or complementing metabolomics analyses in large cohorts, where the availability of genetic, or other data, enables our approach, but targeted quantification is limited.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Yt1iJ6VP9SY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The identity of information: how deterministic dependencies constrain information synergy and redundancy. (arXiv:1711.11408v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11408</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11408</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how different information sources together transmit information
is crucial in many domains. For example, understanding the neural code requires
characterizing how different neurons contribute unique, redundant, or
synergistic pieces of information about sensory or behavioral variables.
Williams and Beer (2010) proposed a partial information decomposition (PID)
which separates the mutual information that a set of sources contains about a
set of targets into nonnegative terms interpretable as these pieces.
Quantifying redundancy requires assigning an identity to different information
pieces, to assess when information is common across sources. Harder et al.
(2013) proposed an identity axiom stating that there cannot be redundancy
between two independent sources about a copy of themselves. However,
Bertschinger et al. (2012) showed that with a deterministically related
sources-target copy this axiom is incompatible with ensuring PID nonnegativity.
Here we study systematically the effect of deterministic target-sources
dependencies. We introduce two synergy stochasticity axioms that generalize the
identity axiom, and we derive general expressions separating stochastic and
deterministic PID components. Our analysis identifies how negative terms can
originate from deterministic dependencies and shows how different assumptions
on information identity, implicit in the stochasticity and identity axioms,
determine the PID structure. The implications for studying neural coding are
discussed.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Frequent Subgraphs of the Connectome of the Human Brain. (arXiv:1711.11314v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11314</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11314</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In mapping the human structural connectome, we are in a very fortunate
situation: one can compute and compare graphs, describing the cerebral
connections between the very same, anatomically identified small regions of the
gray matter among hundreds of human subjects. The comparison of these graphs
has led to numerous recent results, as the (i) discovery that women's
connectomes have deeper and richer connectivity-related graph parameters like
those of men, or (ii) the description of more and less conservatively connected
lobes and cerebral regions, and (iii) the discovery of the phenomenon of the
Consensus Connectome Dynamics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today one of the greatest challenges of brain science is the description and
modeling of the circuitry of the human brain. For this goal, we need to
identify sub-circuits that are present in almost all human subjects and those,
which are much less frequent: the former sub-circuits most probably have
functions with general importance, the latter sub-circuits are probably related
to the individual variability of the brain structure and functions. The present
contribution describes the frequent connected subgraphs (instead of
sub-circuits) of at most 6 edges in the human brain. We analyze these frequent
graphs and also examine sex differences in these graphs: we demonstrate
numerous connected sub-graphs that are more frequent in female or the male
connectome. While our results describe subgraphs, instead of sub-circuits, we
need to note that all macroscopic sub-circuits correspond to an underlying
connected subgraph.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data source is the public release of the Human Connectome Project, and we
are applying the data of 426 human subjects in this study.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A network diffusion approach to inferring sample-specific function reveals functional changes associated with breast cancer</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005793</guid>

&lt;i&gt;Guilt-by-association&lt;/i&gt; codifies the empirical observation that a gene’s function is informed by its neighborhood in a biological network. This would imply that when a gene’s network context is altered, for instance in disease condition, so could be the gene’s function. Although context-specific changes in biological networks have been explored, the potential changes they may induce on the functional roles of genes are yet to be characterized. Here we analyze, for the first time, the network-induced potential functional changes in breast cancer. Using transcriptomic samples for 1047 breast tumors and 110 healthy breast tissues from TCGA, we derive sample-specific protein interaction networks and assign sample-specific functions to genes via a diffusion strategy. Testing for significant changes in the inferred functions between normal and cancer samples, we find several functions to have significantly gained or lost genes in cancer, not due to differential expression of genes known to perform the function, but rather due to changes in the network topology. Our predicted functional changes are supported by mutational and copy number profiles in breast cancers. Our diffusion-based functional assignment provides a novel characterization of a tumor that is complementary to the standard approach based on functional annotation alone. Importantly, this characterization is effective in predicting patient survival, as well as in predicting several known histopathological subtypes of breast cancer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S_U61W1bmfg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Early processing of consonance and dissonance in human auditory cortex. (arXiv:1711.10991v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10991</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10991</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pitch is the perceptual correlate of sound's periodicity and a fundamental
property of the auditory sensation. The interaction of two or more pitches
gives rise to a sensation that can be characterized by its degree of consonance
or dissonance. In the current study, we investigated the neuromagnetic
representations of consonant and dissonant musical dyads using a new model of
cortical activity, in an effort to assess the possible involvement of
pitch-specific neural mechanisms in consonance processing at early cortical
stages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first step of the study, we developed a novel model of cortical pitch
processing designed to explain the morphology of the pitch onset response
(POR), a pitch-specific subcomponent of the auditory evoked N100 component in
the human auditory cortex. The model explains the neural mechanisms underlying
the generation of the POR and quantitatively accounts for the relation between
its peak latency and the perceived pitch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we applied magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record the POR as elicited
by six consonant and dissonant dyads. The peak latency of the POR was strongly
modulated by the degree of consonance within the stimuli; specifically, the
most dissonant dyad exhibited a POR with a latency that was about 30ms longer
than that of the most consonant dyad, an effect that greatly exceeds the
expected latency difference induced by a single pitch sound.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our model was able to predict the POR latency pattern observed in the
neuromagnetic data, and to generalize this prediction to additional dyads.
These results indicate that the neural mechanisms responsible for pitch
processing exhibit an intrinsic differential response to concurrent consonant
and dissonant pitch combinations, suggesting that the perception of consonance
and dissonance might be an emergent property of the pitch processing system in
human auditory cortex.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural networks with tightly balanced excitatory and inhibitory coupling show
high computational performance. They operate close to a critical point
characterized by the joint activation of large populations of neurons. Yet,
macaque motor cortex shows very different dynamics with weak fluctuations on
macroscopic scales. In this light motor cortex seems to operate in a
sub-optimal regime. Here we show the opposite: The large dispersion of
correlations across neurons is a signature of a rich dynamical repertoire,
hidden from macroscopic brain signals, but essential for high performance in
such concepts as reservoir computing. Our findings suggest a refinement of the
view on criticality in neural systems: network topology and heterogeneity endow
the brain with two complementary substrates for critical dynamics of largely
different complexity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A new fMRI data analysis method using cross validation: Negative BOLD responses may be the deactivations of interneurons. (arXiv:1711.10814v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10814</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10814</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used for the
study of brain functions, the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effect
is incompletely understood. Particularly, negative BOLD responses(NBRs) is
controversial. This paper presents a new fMRI data analysis method, which is
more accurate than the typical conventional method. The authors conducted the
experiments of simple repetition, and analyzed the data by the new method. The
results strongly suggest that the deactivations(NBRs) detected by the new
method are the deactivations of interneurons, because the deactivation ratios
obtained by the new method approximately equals the deactivation ratios of
interneurons obtained by the study of interneurons. The (de)activations
detected by the new method are largely different from those detected by the
conventional method. The new method is more accurate than the conventional
method, and therefore the (de)activations detected by the new method may be
correct and the (de)activations detected by the conventional method may be
incorrect. A large portion of the deactivations of inhibitory interneurons is
also considered to be activations. Therefore, the right-tailed t-test, which is
usually performed in the conventional method, does not detect the whole
activation, because the right-tailed t-test only detects the activations of
excitatory neurons, and neglect the deactivations of inhibitory interneurons. A
lot of fMRI studies so far by the conventional method should be re-examined by
the new method, and many results obtained so far will be modified.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Effect of fixation target on the contrast sensitivity in the foveal and parafoveal area. (arXiv:1711.10586v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10586</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10586</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Purpose
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the influence on the contrast sensitivity when the stimulus
contains a fixation target in two retinal locations, foveal and parafoveal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four young adults with 0.0 logMar acuity participated in this study. The
stimulus was based on vertical sinusoidal gratings masked by a circular (for
foveal area) or a ring (for parafoveal area). To increase the luminance
resolution of the display a bit-stealing technique was used. Four different
sets of stimuli were generated, two for exploring the foveal sensitivity and
two for the parafoveal area. The difference between the sets designed for the
same area was the presence, or absence, of a fixation target (a white cross) in
the centre of the stimulus. A modified staircase method was implemented.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results show a drop in the contrast sensitivity when the fixation target
was present on the stimulus for frequencies smaller than 4 cycles per degree.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of fixation targets diminishes the contrast sensitivity for low
to mid frequencies over different concentric areas of the retina. This could be
due to the fixational eye movements, different patterns of eye movements were
found using an eye tracker. The relationship between the sensitivity in the
foveal area and the parafoveal agrees with those reported by other authors
using different designs confirming that the new stimulus design is suitable to
measure the contrast sensitivity outside the foveal area.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging meta-analysis is an area of growing interest in statistics. The
special characteristics of neuroimaging data render classical meta-analysis
methods inapplicable and therefore new methods have been developed. We review
existing methodologies, explaining the benefits and drawbacks of each. A
demonstration on a real dataset of emotion studies is included. We discuss some
still-open problems in the field to highlight the need for future research.

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Polarity Sorting of Microtubules in the Axon</title>

	<description>A longstanding question in cellular neuroscience is how microtubules in the axon become organized with their plus ends out, a pattern starkly different from the mixed orientation of microtubules in vertebrate dendrites. Recent attention has focused on a mechanism called polarity sorting, in which microtubules of opposite orientation are spatially separated by molecular motor proteins. Here we discuss this mechanism, and conclude that microtubules are polarity sorted in the axon by cytoplasmic dynein but that additional factors are also needed.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Dynamical compensation and structural identifiability of biological models: Analysis, implications, and reconciliation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005878</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alejandro F. Villaverde, Julio R. Banga&lt;/p&gt;

The concept of dynamical compensation has been recently introduced to describe the ability of a biological system to keep its output dynamics unchanged in the face of varying parameters. However, the original definition of dynamical compensation amounts to lack of structural identifiability. This is relevant if model parameters need to be estimated, as is often the case in biological modelling. Care should we taken when using an unidentifiable model to extract biological insight: the estimated values of structurally unidentifiable parameters are meaningless, and model predictions about unmeasured state variables can be wrong. Taking this into account, we explore alternative definitions of dynamical compensation that do not necessarily imply structural unidentifiability. Accordingly, we show different ways in which a model can be made identifiable while exhibiting dynamical compensation. Our analyses enable the use of the new concept of dynamical compensation in the context of parameter identification, and reconcile it with the desirable property of structural identifiability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s5puXhenAZ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Complex network analysis of brain functional connectivity under a multi-step cognitive task. (arXiv:1711.10376v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional brain network has been widely studied to understand the
relationship between brain organization and behavior. In this paper, we aim to
explore the functional connectivity of brain network under a \emph{multi-step}
cognitive task involving with consecutive behaviors, and further understand the
effect of behaviors on the brain organization. The functional brain networks
are constructed base on a high spatial and temporal resolution fMRI dataset and
analyzed via complex network based approach. We find that at voxel level the
functional brain network shows robust small-worldness and scale-free
characteristics, while its assortativity and rich-club organization are
slightly restricted to order of behaviors performed. More interestingly, the
functional connectivity of brain network in activated ROIs strongly correlates
with behaviors and behaves obvious differences restricted to order of behaviors
performed. These empirical results suggest that the brain organization has the
generic properties of small-worldness and scale-free characteristics, and its
diverse function connectivity emerging from activated ROIs is strongly driven
by these behavioral activities via the plasticity of brain.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: EEG-assisted Modulation of Sound Sources in the Auditory Scene. (arXiv:1612.00703v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Noninvasive EEG (electroencephalography) based auditory attention detection
could be useful for improved hearing aids in the future. This work is a novel
attempt to investigate the feasibility of online modulation of sound sources by
probabilistic detection of auditory attention, using a noninvasive EEG-based
brain computer interface. Proposed online system modulates the upcoming sound
sources through gain adaptation which employs probabilistic decisions (soft
decisions) from a classifier trained on offline calibration data. In this work,
calibration EEG data were collected in sessions where the participants listened
to two sound sources (one attended and one unattended). Cross-correlation
coefficients between the EEG measurements and the attended and unattended sound
source envelope (estimates) are used to show differences in sharpness and
delays of neural responses for attended versus unattended sound source. Salient
features to distinguish attended sources from the unattended ones in the
correlation patterns have been identified, and later they have been used to
train an auditory attention classifier. Compared to the existing results in the
literature, in this paper we have two main contributions. First, using the
auditory attention classifier, we have shown high offline detection performance
with single channel EEG measurements of shorter duration compared to the
existing approaches in the literature which employ large number of channels
with longer EEG measurements. Second, using the classifier trained offline in
the calibration session, we have shown the performance of the online sound
source modulation system. We observe that online sound source modulation system
is able to keep the level of attended sound source higher than the unattended
source.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Complex architectures of biological neural circuits, such as parallel
processing pathways, has been behaviorally implicated in many cognitive
studies. However, the theoretical consequences of circuit complexity on neural
computation have only been explored in limited cases. Here, we introduce a
mechanism by which direct and indirect pathways from cortex to the CA3 region
of the hippocampus can balance both contextual gating of memory formation and
driving network activity. We implement this concept in a deep artificial neural
network by enabling a context-sensitive bias. The motivation for this is to
improve performance of a size-constrained network. Using direct knowledge of
the superclass information in the CIFAR-100 and Fashion-MNIST datasets, we show
a dramatic increase in performance without an increase in network size.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In cognitive network neuroscience, the connectivity and community structure
of the brain network is related to cognition. Much of this research has focused
on two measures of connectivity - modularity and flexibility - which frequently
have been examined in isolation. By using resting state fMRI data from 52 young
adults, we investigate the relationship between modularity, flexibility and
performance on cognitive tasks. We show that flexibility and modularity are
highly negatively correlated. However, we also demonstrate that flexibility and
modularity make unique contributions to explain task performance, with
modularity predicting performance for simple tasks and flexibility predicting
performance on complex tasks that require cognitive control and executive
functioning. The theory and results presented here allow for stronger links
between measures of brain network connectivity and cognitive processes.

The rate of this change depends on its relative cost and utility. Variants identified uniquely through WGS may reveal novel biological pathways underlying complex disorders and provide high-resolution insight into when, where, and in which cell type these pathways are affected. Alternatively, cheaper and less computationally intensive approaches may yield equivalent insights. Understanding the role of rare variants in the noncoding gene-regulating genome through pilot WGS projects will be critical to determining which of these two extremes best represents reality. With large cohorts, well-defined risk loci, and a compelling need to understand the underlying biology, psychiatric disorders have a role to play in this preliminary WGS assessment. The Whole Genome Sequencing for Psychiatric Disorders Consortium will integrate data for 18,000 individuals with psychiatric disorders, beginning with autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, along with over 150,000 controls.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/lduqf_2TMTE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Suzan Farhang-Sardroodi, Amir H. Darooneh, Moladad Nikbakht, Natalia L. Komarova, Mohammad Kohandel&lt;/p&gt;

The mean conditional fixation time of a mutant is an important measure of stochastic population dynamics, widely studied in ecology and evolution. Here, we investigate the effect of spatial randomness on the mean conditional fixation time of mutants in a constant population of cells, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. Specifically, we assume that fitness values of wild type cells and mutants at different locations come from given probability distributions and do not change in time. We study spatial arrangements of cells on regular graphs with different degrees, from the circle to the complete graph, and vary assumptions on the fitness probability distributions. Some examples include: identical probability distributions for wild types and mutants; cases when only one of the cell types has random fitness values while the other has deterministic fitness; and cases where the mutants are advantaged or disadvantaged. Using analytical calculations and stochastic numerical simulations, we find that randomness has a strong impact on fixation time. In the case of complete graphs, randomness accelerates mutant fixation for all population sizes, and in the case of circular graphs, randomness delays mutant fixation for &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; larger than a threshold value (for small values of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;, different behaviors are observed depending on the fitness distribution functions). These results emphasize fundamental differences in population dynamics under different assumptions on cell connectedness. They are explained by the existence of randomly occurring “dead zones” that can significantly delay fixation on networks with low connectivity; and by the existence of randomly occurring “lucky zones” that can facilitate fixation on networks of high connectivity. Results for death-birth and birth-death formulations of the Moran process, as well as for the (haploid) Wright Fisher model are presented.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3sCQG2z-mIQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Strawberry: Fast and accurate genome-guided transcript reconstruction and quantification from RNA-Seq</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Ruolin Liu, Julie Dickerson&lt;/p&gt;

We propose a novel method and software tool, Strawberry, for transcript reconstruction and quantification from RNA-Seq data under the guidance of genome alignment and independent of gene annotation. Strawberry consists of two modules: assembly and quantification. The novelty of Strawberry is that the two modules use different optimization frameworks but utilize the same data graph structure, which allows a highly efficient, expandable and accurate algorithm for dealing large data. The assembly module parses aligned reads into splicing graphs, and uses network flow algorithms to select the most likely transcripts. The quantification module uses a latent class model to assign read counts from the nodes of splicing graphs to transcripts. Strawberry simultaneously estimates the transcript abundances and corrects for sequencing bias through an EM algorithm. Based on simulations, Strawberry outperforms Cufflinks and StringTie in terms of both assembly and quantification accuracies. Under the evaluation of a real data set, the estimated transcript expression by Strawberry has the highest correlation with Nanostring probe counts, an independent experiment measure for transcript expression. Availability: Strawberry is written in C++14, and is available as open source software at https://github.com/ruolin/strawberry under the MIT license.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2lhGlr9xQ2s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Recent research has identified late-latency, long-lasting neural activity as a robust correlate of conscious perception. Yet, the dynamical nature of this activity is poorly understood, and the mechanisms governing its presence or absence and the associated conscious perception remain elusive. We applied dynamic-pattern analysis to whole-brain slow (&amp;lt; 5 Hz) cortical dynamics recorded by magnetoencephalography (MEG) in human subjects performing a threshold-level visual perception task. Up to 1 second before stimulus onset, brain activity pattern across widespread cortices significantly predicted whether a threshold-level visual stimulus was later consciously perceived. This initial state of brain activity interacts nonlinearly with stimulus input to shape the evolving cortical activity trajectory, with seen and unseen trials following well separated trajectories. We observed that cortical activity trajectories during conscious perception are fast evolving and robust to small variations in the initial state. In addition, spontaneous brain activity pattern prior to stimulus onset also influences unconscious perceptual making in unseen trials. Together, these results suggest that brain dynamics underlying conscious visual perception belongs to the class of initial-state-dependent, robust, transient neural dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rsm671pHq5I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Altered responses to social chemosignals in autism spectrum disorder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altered responses to social chemosignals in autism spectrum disorder, Published online: 27 November 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0024-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0024-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Like all terrestrial mammals, humans emit body odors that subtly communicate emotions. This study suggests that adults with autism may be misreading these chemical signals and that this may explain a portion of their social difficulties.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/TQuzsRRPXts&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accumbal D2 cells orchestrate innate risk-avoidance according to orexin signals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accumbal D2 cells orchestrate innate risk-avoidance according to orexin signals, Published online: 27 November 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0023-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0023-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Most species exhibit instinctive risk-avoidance, e.g., lab mice avoid predator smells despite having never encountered predators. Here the authors show how innate risk-avoidance arises from accumbal dopamine receptor neurons tuned by orexin signals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/S1ii_ucdG3Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mutant huntingtin protein expression and blood-spinal cord barrier dysfunction in Huntington's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25107</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25107</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: The aim of the study was to assess the distribution, frequency and specific location of mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) aggregates - the pathological hallmark of HD - within the various compartments of the spinal cord and their potential impact on the local vasculature and BSCB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We performed a series of post-mortem immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent stainings, as well as western blot analyses, on cervical and lumbar sections of the spinal cord in patients diagnosed with HD (n=11 of all grades of disease severity) along with sex and age-matched healthy controls (n=9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We observed that mHTT was preferably expressed within the anterior horn of the grey matter, in both cervical and lumbar sections. At the cellular level, mHTT aggregates were more often encountered in the extracellular matrix but could also be observed within cell bodies, neurites as well as within the endothelium of blood vessels with an increase in the density of small blood vessels in cervical sections of HD cases. These vasculature changes were accompanied with features of BSCB leakage, as assessed by the presence of increased levels of fibrinogen in the surrounding parenchyma and enhanced leukocyte infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: This alteration in BSCB integrity may be explained, in part, by the dysregulation we found in some of the main proteins associated with it such as the junctional adhesion molecule-1 (JAM-1) and vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin). These observations have important implications for our understanding of HD pathology and may also have significant therapeutic implications. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Fragmentation modes and the evolution of life cycles</title>

Reproduction is a defining feature of living systems. To reproduce, aggregates of biological units (e.g., multicellular organisms or colonial bacteria) must fragment into smaller parts. Fragmentation modes in nature range from binary fission in bacteria to collective-level fragmentation and the production of unicellular propagules in multicellular organisms. Despite this apparent ubiquity, the adaptive significance of fragmentation modes has received little attention. Here, we develop a model in which groups arise from the division of single cells that do not separate but stay together until the moment of group fragmentation. We allow for all possible fragmentation patterns and calculate the population growth rate of each associated life cycle. Fragmentation modes that maximise growth rate comprise a restrictive set of patterns that include production of unicellular propagules and division into two similar size groups. Life cycles marked by single-cell bottlenecks maximise population growth rate under a wide range of conditions. This surprising result offers a new evolutionary explanation for the widespread occurrence of this mode of reproduction. All in all, our model provides a framework for exploring the adaptive significance of fragmentation modes and their associated life cycles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wDROTWJQqu0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Choose, rate or squeeze: Comparison of economic value functions elicited by different behavioral tasks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alizée Lopez-Persem, Lionel Rigoux, Sacha Bourgeois-Gironde, Jean Daunizeau, Mathias Pessiglione&lt;/p&gt;

A standard view in neuroeconomics is that to make a choice, an agent first assigns subjective values to available options, and then compares them to select the best. In choice tasks, these cardinal values are typically inferred from the preference expressed by subjects between options presented in pairs. Alternatively, cardinal values can be directly elicited by asking subjects to place a cursor on an analog scale (rating task) or to exert a force on a power grip (effort task). These tasks can vary in many respects: they can notably be more or less costly and consequential. Here, we compared the value functions elicited by choice, rating and effort tasks on options composed of two monetary amounts: one for the subject (gain) and one for a charity (donation). Bayesian model selection showed that despite important differences between the three tasks, they all elicited a same value function, with similar weighting of gain and donation, but variable concavity. Moreover, value functions elicited by the different tasks could predict choices with equivalent accuracy. Our finding therefore suggests that comparable value functions can account for various motivated behaviors, beyond economic choice. Nevertheless, we report slight differences in the computational efficiency of parameter estimation that may guide the design of future studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iy3NDzd9fuo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Tracking urban human activity from mobile phone calling patterns</title>

Timings of human activities are marked by circadian clocks which in turn are entrained to different environmental signals. In an urban environment the presence of artificial lighting and various social cues tend to disrupt the natural entrainment with the sunlight. However, it is not completely understood to what extent this is the case. Here we exploit the large-scale data analysis techniques to study the mobile phone calling activity of people in large cities to infer the dynamics of urban daily rhythms. From the calling patterns of about 1,000,000 users spread over different cities but lying inside the same time-zone, we show that the onset and termination of the calling activity synchronizes with the east-west progression of the sun. We also find that the onset and termination of the calling activity of users follows a yearly dynamics, varying across seasons, and that its timings are entrained to solar midnight. Furthermore, we show that the average mid-sleep time of people living in urban areas depends on the age and gender of each cohort as a result of biological and social factors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nTki-D4ps3g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Identifying influential neighbors in animal flocking</title>

Schools of fish and flocks of birds can move together in synchrony and decide on new directions of movement in a seamless way. This is possible because group members constantly share directional information with their neighbors. Although detecting the directionality of other group members is known to be important to maintain cohesion, it is not clear how many neighbors each individual can simultaneously track and pay attention to, and what the spatial distribution of these influential neighbors is. Here, we address these questions on shoals of &lt;i&gt;Hemigrammus rhodostomus&lt;/i&gt;, a species of fish exhibiting strong schooling behavior. We adopt a data-driven analysis technique based on the study of short-term directional correlations to identify which neighbors have the strongest influence over the participation of an individual in a collective U-turn event. We find that fish mainly react to one or two neighbors at a time. Moreover, we find no correlation between the distance rank of a neighbor and its likelihood to be influential. We interpret our results in terms of fish allocating sequential and selective attention to their neighbors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3M1-zYlXyOc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reducing the RNA binding protein TIA1 protects against tau-mediated neurodegeneration in vivo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing the RNA binding protein TIA1 protects against tau-mediated neurodegeneration in vivo, Published online: 20 November 2017; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0022-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-017-0022-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Apicco and colleagues show that reducing TIA1 inhibits tau-mediated neurodegeneration and improves survival in a mouse model of tauopathy. This rescue occurs with a transition in tau aggregation from oligomeric to fibrillar forms of tau. These findings suggest a key role for RNA binding proteins in the pathophysiology of tau.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/MfulZMZVa8Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: The Emerging Neurobiology of Bipolar Disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30212-6?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30212-6?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Bipolar disorder (BD) is a leading cause of global disability. Its biological basis is unknown, and its treatment unsatisfactory. Here, we review two recent areas of progress. First, the discovery of risk genes and their implications, with a focus on voltage-gated calcium channels as part of the disease process and as a drug target. Second, facilitated by new technologies, it is increasingly apparent that the bipolar phenotype is more complex and nuanced than simply one of recurring manic and depressive episodes.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Flexible Roles for Proteoglycan Sulfation and Receptor Signaling</title>

	<description>Proteoglycans (PGs) in the extracellular matrix (ECM) play vital roles in axon growth and navigation, plasticity, and regeneration of injured neurons. Different classes of PGs may support or inhibit cell growth, and their functions are determined in part by highly specific structural features. Among these, the pattern of sulfation on the PG sugar chains is a paramount determinant of a diverse and flexible set of outcomes. Recent studies of PG sulfation illustrate the challenges of attributing biological actions to specific sulfation patterns, and suggest ways in which highly similar molecules may exert opposing effects on neurons.</description>

Using chronic two-photon Ca2+imaging of individual thalamic boutons, Jaepel et al. now report that dLGN cells projecting to mouse visual cortex show pronounced ocular dominance plasticity after monocular deprivation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/gKxDYGzWOwc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

This monosynaptic pathway is both sufficient and necessary for craniofacial-pain-activated aversive behaviors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/eh7QEfg1seA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>
