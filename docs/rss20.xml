	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Up-down biphasic volume response of human red blood cells to PIEZO1 activation during capillary transits</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Simon Rogers, Virgilio L. Lew&lt;/p&gt;

In this paper we apply a novel JAVA version of a model on the homeostasis of human red blood cells (RBCs) to investigate the changes RBCs experience during single capillary transits. In the companion paper we apply a model extension to investigate the changes in RBC homeostasis over the approximately 200000 capillary transits during the ~120 days lifespan of the cells. These are topics inaccessible to direct experimentation but rendered mature for a computational modelling approach by the large body of recent and early experimental results which robustly constrain the range of parameter values and model outcomes, offering a unique opportunity for an in depth study of the mechanisms involved. Capillary transit times vary between 0.5 and 1.5s during which the red blood cells squeeze and deform in the capillary stream transiently opening stress-gated PIEZO1 channels allowing ion gradient dissipation and creating minuscule quantal changes in RBC ion contents and volume. Widely accepted views, based on the effects of experimental shear stress on human RBCs, suggested that quantal changes generated during capillary transits add up over time to develop the documented changes in RBC density and composition during their long circulatory lifespan, the quantal hypothesis. Applying the new red cell model (RCM) we investigated here the changes in homeostatic variables that may be expected during single capillary transits resulting from transient PIEZO1 channel activation. The predicted quantal volume changes were infinitesimal in magnitude, biphasic in nature, and essentially irreversible within inter-transit periods. A sub-second transient PIEZO1 activation triggered a sharp swelling peak followed by a much slower recovery period towards lower-than-baseline volumes. The peak response was caused by net CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and fluid gain via PIEZO1 channels driven by the steep electrochemical inward Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; gradient. The ensuing dehydration followed a complex time-course with sequential, but partially overlapping contributions by KCl loss via Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated Gardos channels, restorative Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; extrusion by the plasma membrane calcium pump, and chloride efflux by the Jacobs-Steward mechanism. The change in relative cell volume predicted for single capillary transits was around 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;, an infinitesimal volume change incompatible with a functional role in capillary flow. The biphasic response predicted by the RCM appears to conform to the quantal hypothesis, but whether its cumulative effects could account for the documented changes in density during RBC senescence required an investigation of the effects of myriad transits over the full four months circulatory lifespan of the cells, the subject of the next paper.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Lj1OPWU3UrY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Neuronal heterogeneity modulates phase-synchronization between unidirectionally coupled populations with excitation-inhibition balance. (arXiv:2103.01790v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Several experiments and models have highlighted the importance of neuronal
heterogeneity in brain dynamics and function. However, how such a cell-to-cell
diversity can affect cortical computation, synchronization, and neuronal
communication is still under debate. Previous studies have focused on the
effect of neuronal heterogeneity in one neuronal population. Here we are
specifically interested in the effect of neuronal variability on the phase
relations between two populations, which can be related to different cortical
communication hypotheses. It has been recently shown that two spiking neuron
populations unidirectionally connected in a sender-receiver configuration can
exhibit anticipated synchronization (AS), which is characterized by a negative
phase-lag. This phenomenon has been reported in electrophysiological data of
non-human primates and human EEG during a visual discrimination cognitive task.
In experiments, the unidirectional coupling could be accessed by Granger
causality and can be accompanied by both positive or negative phase difference
between cortical areas. Here we propose a model of two coupled populations in
which the neuronal heterogeneity can determine the dynamical relation between
the sender and the receiver and can reproduce phase relations reported in
experiments. Depending on the distribution of parameters characterizing the
neuronal firing patterns, the system can exhibit both AS and the usual delayed
synchronization regime (DS, with positive phase) as well as a zero-lag
synchronization regime and phase bistability between AS and DS. Furthermore, we
show that our network can present diversity in their phase relations
maintaining the excitation-inhibition balance.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spatiotemporal data can be represented as a process over a graph, which
captures their spatial relationships either explicitly or implicitly. How to
leverage such a structure for learning representations is one of the key
challenges when working with graphs. In this paper, we represent the
spatiotemporal relationships through product graphs and develop a first
principle graph-time convolutional neural network (GTCNN). The GTCNN is a
compositional architecture with each layer comprising a graph-time
convolutional module, a graph-time pooling module, and a nonlinearity. We
develop a graph-time convolutional filter by following the shift-and-sum
principles of the convolutional operator to learn higher-level features over
the product graph. The product graph itself is parametric so that we can learn
also the spatiotemporal coupling from data. We develop a zero-pad pooling that
preserves the spatial graph (the prior about the data) while reducing the
number of active nodes and the parameters. Experimental results with synthetic
and real data corroborate the different components and compare with baseline
and state-of-the-art solutions.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: The LOB Recreation Model: Predicting the Limit Order Book from TAQ History Using an Ordinary Differential Equation Recurrent Neural Network. (arXiv:2103.01670v1 [q-fin.TR])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In an order-driven financial market, the price of a financial asset is
discovered through the interaction of orders - requests to buy or sell at a
particular price - that are posted to the public limit order book (LOB).
Therefore, LOB data is extremely valuable for modelling market dynamics.
However, LOB data is not freely accessible, which poses a challenge to market
participants and researchers wishing to exploit this information. Fortunately,
trades and quotes (TAQ) data - orders arriving at the top of the LOB, and
trades executing in the market - are more readily available. In this paper, we
present the LOB recreation model, a first attempt from a deep learning
perspective to recreate the top five price levels of the LOB for small-tick
stocks using only TAQ data. Volumes of orders sitting deep in the LOB are
predicted by combining outputs from: (1) a history compiler that uses a Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU) module to selectively compile prediction relevant quote
history; (2) a market events simulator, which uses an Ordinary Differential
Equation Recurrent Neural Network (ODE-RNN) to simulate the accumulation of net
order arrivals; and (3) a weighting scheme to adaptively combine the
predictions generated by (1) and (2). By the paradigm of transfer learning, the
source model trained on one stock can be fine-tuned to enable application to
other financial assets of the same class with much lower demand on additional
data. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two real world intraday LOB
datasets demonstrate that the proposed model can efficiently recreate the LOB
with high accuracy using only TAQ data as input.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental task for artificial intelligence is learning. Deep Neural
Networks have proven to cope perfectly with all learning paradigms, i.e.
supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, traditional
deep learning approaches make use of cloud computing facilities and do not
scale well to autonomous agents with low computational resources. Even in the
cloud, they suffer from computational and memory limitations, and they cannot
be used to model adequately large physical worlds for agents which assume
networks with billions of neurons. These issues are addressed in the last few
years by the emerging topic of sparse training, which trains sparse networks
from scratch. This paper discusses sparse training state-of-the-art, its
challenges and limitations while introducing a couple of new theoretical
research directions which has the potential of alleviating sparse training
limitations to push deep learning scalability well beyond its current
boundaries. Nevertheless, the theoretical advancements impact in complex
multi-agents settings is discussed from a real-world perspective, using the
smart grid case study.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The activations of language transformers like GPT2 have been shown to
linearly map onto brain activity during speech comprehension. However, the
nature of these activations remains largely unknown and presumably conflate
distinct linguistic classes. Here, we propose a taxonomy to factorize the
high-dimensional activations of language models into four combinatorial
classes: lexical, compositional, syntactic, and semantic representations. We
then introduce a statistical method to decompose, through the lens of GPT2's
activations, the brain activity of 345 subjects recorded with functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the listening of ~4.6 hours of
narrated text. The results highlight two findings. First, compositional
representations recruit a more widespread cortical network than lexical ones,
and encompass the bilateral temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices. Second,
contrary to previous claims, syntax and semantics are not associated with
separated modules, but, instead, appear to share a common and distributed
neural substrate. Overall, this study introduces a general framework to isolate
the distributed representations of linguistic constructs generated in
naturalistic settings.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Convergence Rate of the (1+1)-Evolution Strategy with Success-Based Step-Size Adaptation on Convex Quadratic Functions. (arXiv:2103.01578v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01578</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01578</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The (1+1)-evolution strategy (ES) with success-based step-size adaptation is
analyzed on a general convex quadratic function and its monotone
transformation, that is, $f(x) = g((x - x^*)^\mathrm{T} H (x - x^*))$, where
$g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is a strictly increasing function, $H$ is a
positive-definite symmetric matrix, and $x^* \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the optimal
solution of $f$. The convergence rate, that is, the decrease rate of the
distance from a search point $m_t$ to the optimal solution $x^*$, is proven to
be in $O(\exp( - L / \mathrm{Tr}(H) ))$, where $L$ is the smallest eigenvalue
of $H$ and $\mathrm{Tr}(H)$ is the trace of $H$. This result generalizes the
known rate of $O(\exp(- 1/d ))$ for the case of $H = I_{d}$ ($I_d$ is the
identity matrix of dimension $d$) and $O(\exp(- 1/ (d\cdot\xi) ))$ for the case
of $H = \mathrm{diag}(\xi \cdot I_{d/2}, I_{d/2})$. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study in which the convergence rate of the
(1+1)-ES is derived explicitly and rigorously on a general convex quadratic
function, which depicts the impact of the distribution of the eigenvalues in
the Hessian $H$ on the optimization and not only the impact of the condition
number of $H$.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, a multi-objective approach for the design of composite
data-driven mathematical models is proposed. It allows automating the
identification of graph-based heterogeneous pipelines that consist of different
blocks: machine learning models, data preprocessing blocks, etc. The
implemented approach is based on a parameter-free genetic algorithm (GA) for
model design called GPComp@Free. It is developed to be part of automated
machine learning solutions and to increase the efficiency of the modeling
pipeline automation. A set of experiments was conducted to verify the
correctness and efficiency of the proposed approach and substantiate the
selected solutions. The experimental results confirm that a multi-objective
approach to the model design allows achieving better diversity and quality of
obtained models. The implemented approach is available as a part of the
open-source AutoML framework FEDOT.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Real-time scene reconstruction from depth data inevitably suffers from
occlusion, thus leading to incomplete 3D models. Partial reconstructions, in
turn, limit the performance of algorithms that leverage them for applications
in the context of, e.g., augmented reality, robotic navigation, and 3D mapping.
Most methods address this issue by predicting the missing geometry as an
offline optimization, thus being incompatible with real-time applications. We
propose a framework that ameliorates this issue by performing scene
reconstruction and semantic scene completion jointly in an incremental and
real-time manner, based on an input sequence of depth maps. Our framework
relies on a novel neural architecture designed to process occupancy maps and
leverages voxel states to accurately and efficiently fuse semantic completion
with the 3D global model. We evaluate the proposed approach quantitatively and
qualitatively, demonstrating that our method can obtain accurate 3D semantic
scene completion in real-time.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The machine learning community has become increasingly interested in the
energy efficiency of neural networks. The Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is a
promising approach to energy-efficient computing, since its activation levels
are quantized into temporally sparse, one-bit values (i.e., &quot;spike&quot; events),
which additionally converts the sum over weight-activity products into a simple
addition of weights (one weight for each spike). However, the goal of
maintaining state-of-the-art (SotA) accuracy when converting a non-spiking
network into an SNN has remained an elusive challenge, primarily due to spikes
having only a single bit of precision. Adopting tools from signal processing,
we cast neural activation functions as quantizers with temporally-diffused
error, and then train networks while smoothly interpolating between the
non-spiking and spiking regimes. We apply this technique to the Legendre Memory
Unit (LMU) to obtain the first known example of a hybrid SNN outperforming SotA
recurrent architectures -- including the LSTM, GRU, and NRU -- in accuracy,
while reducing activities to at most 3.74 bits on average with 1.26 significant
bits multiplying each weight. We discuss how these methods can significantly
improve the energy efficiency of neural networks.

	<description>Open Practical Laboratories in Neurosciences are outreach activities aimed towards middle schoo students in the Brazilian Amazon, discussing neuroscience topics. The outreach led to immediate benefits on attitudes towards science and scientists, which led to better understanding of the neurosciences.

Abstract
The Open Practical Laboratory in the Neurosciences is an outreach program that seeks to improve the knowledge of the neurosciences by elementary school students and to promote better attitudes in relation to neuroscience, science in general, and scientists. It consists in practical and demonstration activities on the theme of the neurosciences. This outreach strategy was applied in four public schools in a municipality in Southeastern Pará, Brazil characterized by low performance in educational reviews in Brazil. Students from both sexes from 9th grade (last grade before high school) were enrolled in the program. The outreach program improved students’ knowledge about the neurosciences, and promoted better attitudes in relation to science and scientists, in comparison to students who did not go through the activities. Results suggest that scientific outreach strategies can produce results beyond immediate increases in knowledge, promoting better attitudes in relation to science.</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Altered Cerebro-Cerebellar Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Alcohol Use Disorder: a Resting-State fMRI Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-021-01241-y</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is widely associated with cerebellar dysfunction and altered cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity (FC) that lead to cognitive impairments. Evidence for this association comes from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies that assess time-averaged measures of FC across the duration of a typical scan. This approach, however, precludes the assessment of potentially FC dynamics happening at faster timescales. In this study, using rsfMRI data, we aim at exploring cerebro-cerebellar FC dynamics in AUD patients (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 18) and age- and sex-matched controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 18). In particular, we quantified group-level differences in the temporal variability of FC between the posterior cerebellum and large-scale cognitive systems, and we investigated the role of the cerebellum in large-scale brain dynamics in terms of the temporal flexibility and integration of its regions. We found that, relative to controls, the AUD group exhibited significantly greater FC variability between the cerebellum and both the frontoparietal executive control (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1,31&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.01, p(FDR) = 0.028) and ventral attention (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1,31&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.35, p(FDR) = 0.028) networks. Moreover, the AUD group exhibited significantly less flexibility (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1,31&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.61, p(FDR) = 0.028) and greater integration (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1,31&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.11, p(FDR) = 0.028) in the cerebellum. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we found distributed changes in the dynamics of canonical large-scale networks in AUD. Overall, this study brings evidence of AUD-related alterations in dynamic FC within major cerebro-cerebellar networks. This pattern has implications for explaining the development and maintenance of this disorder and improving our understating of the cerebellum’s involvement in addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;There is now robust evidence that the cerebellum—apart from its well-established role in motor control—is crucially involved in a wide spectrum of cognitive and affective functions. Clinical and neuropsychological studies together with evidence from anatomical studies and advanced neuroimaging have yielded significant insights into the specific features and clinical relevance of cerebellar involvement in normal cognition and mood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Voltage-Gated Ca2+-Channel α1-Subunit de novo Missense Mutations: Gain or Loss of Function – Implications for Potential Therapies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.634760</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This review summarizes our current knowledge of human disease-relevant genetic variants within the family of voltage gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channelopathies cover a wide spectrum of diseases including epilepsies, autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities, developmental delay, cerebellar ataxias and degeneration, severe cardiac arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, eye disease and endocrine disorders such as congential hyperinsulinism and hyperaldosteronism. A special focus will be on the rapidly increasing number of de novo missense mutations identified in the pore-forming α1-subunits with next generation sequencing studies of well-defined patient cohorts. In contrast to likely gene disrupting mutations these can not only cause a channel loss-of-function but can also induce typical functional changes permitting enhanced channel activity and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling. Such gain-of-function mutations could represent therapeutic targets for mutation-specific therapy of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channelopathies with existing or novel Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channel inhibitors. Moreover, many pathogenic mutations affect positive charges in the voltage sensors with the potential to form gating-pore currents through voltage sensors. If confirmed in functional studies, specific blockers of gating-pore currents could also be of therapeutic interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcriptionally profiling minor cellular populations remains an ongoing challenge in molecular genomics. Single-cell RNA sequencing has provided valuable insights into a number of hypotheses, but practical and analytical challenges have limited its widespread adoption. A similar approach, which we term single-cell type RNA sequencing (sctRNA-seq), involves the enrichment and sequencing of a pool of cells, yielding cell type-level resolution transcriptomes. While this approach offers benefits in terms of mRNA sampling from targeted cell types, it is potentially affected by off-target contamination from surrounding cell types. Here, we leveraged single-cell sequencing datasets to apply a computational approach for estimating and controlling the amount of off-target cell type contamination in sctRNA-seq datasets. In datasets obtained using a number of technologies for cell purification, we found that most sctRNA-seq datasets tended to show some amount of off-target mRNA contamination from surrounding cells. However, using covariates for cellular contamination in downstream differential expression analyses increased the quality of our models for differential expression analysis in case/control comparisons and typically resulted in the discovery of more differentially expressed genes. In general, our method provides a flexible approach for detecting and controlling off-target cell type contamination in sctRNA-seq datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Diffusion Tensor Imaging of the Sciatic Nerve as a Surrogate Marker for Nerve Functionality of the Upper and Lower Limb in Patients With Diabetes and Prediabetes</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Nerve damage in diabetic neuropathy (DN) is assumed to begin in the distal legs with a subsequent progression to hands and arms at later stages. In contrast, recent studies have found that lower limb nerve lesions in DN predominate at the proximal sciatic nerve and that, in the upper limb, nerve functions can be impaired at early stages of DN.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;In this prospective, single-center cross-sectional study, participants underwent diffusion-weighted 3 Tesla magnetic resonance neurography in order to calculate the sciatic nerve’s fractional anisotropy (FA), a surrogate parameter for structural nerve integrity. Results were correlated with clinical and electrophysiological assessments of the lower limb and an examination of hand function derived from the Purdue Pegboard Test.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Overall, 71 patients with diabetes, 11 patients with prediabetes and 25 age-matched control subjects took part in this study. In patients with diabetes, the sciatic nerve’s FA showed positive correlations with tibial and peroneal nerve conduction velocities (r = 0.62; p &amp;lt; 0.001 and r = 0.56; p &amp;lt; 0.001, respectively), and tibial and peroneal nerve compound motor action potentials (r = 0.62; p &amp;lt; 0.001 and r = 0.63; p &amp;lt; 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the sciatic nerve’s FA was correlated with the Pegboard Test results in patients with diabetes (r = 0.52; p &amp;lt; 0.001), prediabetes (r = 0.76; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and in controls (r = 0.79; p = 0.007).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to show that the sciatic nerve’s FA is a surrogate marker for functional and electrophysiological parameters of both upper and lower limbs in patients with diabetes and prediabetes, suggesting that nerve damage in these patients is not restricted to the level of the symptomatic limbs but rather affects the entire peripheral nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: The Associations of Cerebrospinal Fluid ApoE and Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease: Exploring Interactions With Sex</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Sex-related difference in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been proposed, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) isoforms have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;We aimed to explore whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ApoE is associated with AD biomarkers and whether the associations are different (between sexes).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Data of 309 participants [92 with normal cognition, 148 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 69 with AD dementia] from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were cross-sectionally evaluated with the multiple linear regression model and longitudinally with the multivariate linear mixed-effects model for the associations of CSF ApoE with AD biomarkers. Sex–ApoE interaction was used to estimate whether sex moderates the associations of CSF ApoE and AD biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Significant interactions between CSF ApoE and sex on AD biomarkers were observed [amyloid-β (Aβ): p = 0.0169 and phosphorylated-tau (p-tau): p = 0.0453]. In women, baseline CSF ApoE levels were significantly associated with baseline Aβ (p = 0.0135) and total-tau (t-tau) (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) as well as longitudinal changes of the biomarkers (Aβ: p = 0.0104; t-tau: p = 0.0110). In men, baseline CSF ApoE levels were only correlated with baseline p-tau (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and t-tau (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and did not aggravate AD biomarkers longitudinally.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The associations between CSF ApoE and AD biomarkers were sex-specific. Elevated CSF ApoE was associated with longitudinal changes of AD biomarkers in women, which indicates that CSF ApoE might be involved in the pathogenesis of AD pathology in a sex-specific way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Word Detection in Individual Subjects Is Difficult to Probe With Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.602798</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.602798</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Measuring cognition in single subjects presents unique challenges. On the other hand, individually sensitive measurements offer extraordinary opportunities, from informing theoretical models to enabling truly individualised clinical assessment. Here, we test the robustness of fast, periodic, and visual stimulation (FPVS), an emerging method proposed to elicit detectable responses to written words in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of individual subjects. The method is non-invasive, passive, and requires only a few minutes of testing, making it a potentially powerful tool to test comprehension in those who do not speak or who struggle with long testing procedures. In an initial study, Lochy et al. (2015) used FPVS to detect word processing in eight out of 10 fluent French readers. Here, we attempted to replicate their study in a new sample of 10 fluent English readers. Participants viewed rapid streams of pseudo-words with words embedded at regular intervals, while we recorded their EEG. Based on Lochy et al. (2015) we expected that words would elicit a steady-state response at the word-presentation frequency (2 Hz) over parieto-occipital electrode sites. However, across 40 datasets (10 participants, two conditions, and two regions of interest–ROIs), only four datasets met the criteria for a unique response to words. This corresponds to a 10% detection rate. We conclude that FPVS should be developed further before it can serve as an individually-sensitive measure of written word processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Baseline Differences in Anxiety Affect Attention and tDCS-Mediated Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.541369</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Variable responses to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) protocols across individuals are widely reported, but the reasons behind this variation are unclear. This includes tDCS protocols meant to improve attention. Attentional control is impacted by top-down and bottom-up processes, and this relationship is affected by state characteristics such as anxiety. According to Attentional Control Theory, anxiety biases attention towards bottom-up and stimulus-driven processing. The goal of this study was to explore the extent to which differences in state anxiety and related measures affect visual attention and category learning, both with and without the influence of tDCS. Using discovery learning, participants were trained to classify pictures of European streets into two categories while receiving 30 min of 2.0 mA anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS over the rVLPFC. The pictures were classifiable according to two separate rules, one stimulus and one hypothesis-driven. The Remote Associates Test (RAT), Profile of Mood States, and Attention Networks Task (ANT) were used to understand the effects of individual differences at baseline on subsequent tDCS-mediated learning. Multinomial logistic regression was fit to predict rule learning based on the baseline measures, with subjects classified according to whether they used the stimulus-driven or hypothesis-driven rule to classify the pictures. The overall model showed a classification accuracy of 74.1%. The type of tDCS stimulation applied, attentional orienting score, and self-reported mood were significant predictors of different categories of rule learning. These results indicate that anxiety can influence the quality of subjects’ attention at the onset of the task and that these attentional differences can influence tDCS-mediated category learning during the rapid assessment of visual scenes. These findings have implications for understanding the complex interactions that give rise to the variability in response to tDCS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Widespread Decreases in Cerebral Copper Are Common to Parkinson's Disease Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease Dementia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.641222</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Several studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) have reported dysregulation of cerebral metals, particularly decreases in copper and increases in iron in substantia nigra (SN). However, few studies have investigated regions outside the SN, fewer have measured levels of multiple metals across different regions within the same brains, and there are no currently-available reports of metal levels in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). This study aimed to compare concentrations of nine essential metals across nine different brain regions in cases of PDD and controls. Investigated were: primary motor cortex (MCX); cingulate gyrus (CG); primary visual cortex (PVC); hippocampus (HP); cerebellar cortex (CB); SN; locus coeruleus (LC); medulla oblongata (MED); and middle temporal gyrus (MTG), thus covering regions with severe, moderate, or low levels of neuronal loss in PDD. Levels of eight essential metals and selenium were determined using an analytical methodology involving the use of inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and compared between cases and controls, to better understand the extent and severity of metal perturbations. Findings were also compared with those from our previous study of sporadic Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD), which employed equivalent methods, to identify differences and similarities between these conditions. Widespread copper decreases occurred in PDD in seven of nine regions (exceptions being LC and CB). Four PDD-affected regions showed similar decreases in ADD: CG, HP, MTG, and MCX. Decreases in potassium and manganese were present in HP, MTG and MCX; decreased manganese was also found in SN and MED. Decreased selenium and magnesium were present in MCX, and decreased zinc in HP. There was no evidence for increased iron in SN or any other region. These results identify alterations in levels of several metals across multiple regions of PDD brain, the commonest being widespread decreases in copper that closely resemble those in ADD, pointing to similar disease mechanisms in both dementias.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Preanalytical Stability of CSF Total and Oligomeric Alpha-Synuclein</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.638718</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.638718</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alpha-synuclein as a potential biomarker has been challenged mainly due to variable preanalytical measures between laboratories. To evaluate the impact of the preanalytical factors contributing to such variability, the different subforms of alpha-synuclein need to be studied individually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: We investigated the effect of exposing CSF samples to several preanalytical sources of variability: (1) different polypropylene (PP) storage tubes; (2) use of non-ionic detergents; (3) multiple tube transfers; (4) multiple freeze-thaw cycles; and (5) delayed storage. CSF oligomeric- and total-alpha-synuclein levels were estimated using our in-house sandwich-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Siliconized tubes provided the optimal preservation of CSF alpha-synuclein proteins among other tested polypropylene tubes. The use of tween-20 detergent significantly improved the recovery of oligomeric-alpha-synuclein, while multiple freeze-thaw cycles significantly lowered oligomeric-alpha-synuclein in CSF. Interestingly, oligomeric-alpha-synuclein levels remained relatively stable over multiple tube transfers and upon delayed storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our study showed for the first-time distinct impact of preanalytical factors on the different forms of CSF alpha-synuclein. These findings highlight the need for special considerations for the different forms of alpha-synuclein during CSF samples’ collection and processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Ipsilateral Motor Evoked Potentials as a Measure of the Reticulospinal Tract in Age-Related Strength Changes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.612352</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.612352</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The reticulospinal tract (RST) is essential for balance, posture, and strength, all functions which falter with age. We hypothesized that age-related strength reductions might relate to differential changes in corticospinal and reticulospinal connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We divided 83 participants (age 20–84) into age groups &amp;lt;50 (n = 29) and ≥50 (n = 54) years; five of which had probable sarcopenia. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) was applied to the left cortex, inducing motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the biceps muscles bilaterally. Contralateral (right, cMEPs) and ipsilateral (left, iMEPs) MEPs are carried by mainly corticospinal and reticulospinal pathways respectively; the iMEP/cMEP amplitude ratio (ICAR) therefore measured the relative importance of the two descending tracts. Grip strength was measured with a dynamometer and normalized for age and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found valid iMEPs in 74 individuals (n = 44 aged ≥50, n = 29 &amp;lt; 50). Younger adults had a significant negative correlation between normalized grip strength and ICAR (r = −0.37, p = 0.045); surprisingly, in older adults, the correlation was also significant, but positive (r = 0.43, p = 0.0037).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: Older individuals who maintain or strengthen their RST are stronger than their peers. We speculate that reduced RST connectivity could predict those at risk of age-related muscle weakness; interventions that reinforce the RST could be a candidate for treatment or prevention of sarcopenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Intact synapse structure and function after combined knockout of PTPδ, PTPσ and LAR</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66638</link>
	<description>It has long been proposed that Leukocyte common Antigen-Related Receptor Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs) are cell-adhesion proteins that control synapse assembly. Their synaptic nanoscale localization, however, is not established, and synapse fine structure after knockout of the three vertebrate LAR-RPTPs (PTPδ, PTPσ and LAR) has not been tested. Here, superresolution microscopy reveals that PTPδ localizes to the synaptic cleft precisely apposed to postsynaptic scaffolds of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We next assessed synapse structure in newly generated triple-conditional knockout mice for PTPδ, PTPσ and LAR, complementing a recent independent study of synapse function after LAR-RPTP ablation (Sclip and Südhof, 2020). While mild effects on synaptic vesicle clustering and active zone architecture were detected, synapse numbers and their overall structure were unaffected, membrane anchoring of the active zone persisted, and vesicle docking and release were normal. Hence, despite their localization at synaptic appositions, LAR-RPTPs are dispensable for presynapse structure and function.</description>

	<title>eLife: A mobile genetic element increases bacterial host fitness by manipulating development</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65924</link>
	<description>Horizontal gene transfer is a major force in bacterial evolution. Mobile genetic elements are responsible for much of horizontal gene transfer and also carry beneficial cargo genes. Uncovering strategies used by mobile genetic elements to benefit host cells is crucial for understanding their stability and spread in populations. We describe a benefit that ICE&lt;i&gt;Bs1&lt;/i&gt;, an integrative and conjugative element of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, provides to its host cells. Activation of ICE&lt;i&gt;Bs1&lt;/i&gt; conferred a frequency-dependent selective advantage to host cells during two different developmental processes: biofilm formation and sporulation. These benefits were due to inhibition of biofilm-associated gene expression and delayed sporulation by ICE&lt;i&gt;Bs1&lt;/i&gt;-containing cells, enabling them to exploit their neighbors and grow more prior to development. A single ICE&lt;i&gt;Bs1&lt;/i&gt; gene, &lt;i&gt;devI &lt;/i&gt;(formerly &lt;i&gt;ydcO&lt;/i&gt;), was both necessary and sufficient for inhibition of development. Manipulation of host developmental programs allows ICE&lt;i&gt;Bs1&lt;/i&gt; to increase host fitness, thereby increasing propagation of the element.</description>

	<title>eLife: Dynamic Na+/H+ Exchanger 1 (NHE1):Calmodulin complexes of varying stoichiometry and structure regulate Ca2+-dependent NHE1 activation</title>

	<description>Calmodulin (CaM) engages in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent interactions with numerous proteins, including a still incompletely understood physical and functional interaction with the human Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-exchanger NHE1. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, and fibroblasts stably expressing wildtype and mutant NHE1, we discovered multiple accessible states of this functionally important complex existing in different NHE1:CaM stoichiometries and structures. We determined the NMR solution structure of a ternary complex in which CaM links two NHE1 cytosolic tails. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, stoichiometries and affinities could be tuned by variations in NHE1:CaM ratio and calcium ([Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]) and by phosphorylation of S648 in the first CaM-binding a-helix&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; In cells, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-CaM-induced NHE1 activity was reduced by mimicking S648 phosphorylation and by mutation of the first CaM-binding a-helix&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; whereas it was unaffected by inhibition of Akt, one of several kinases phosphorylating S648. Our results demonstrate a diversity of NHE1:CaM interaction modes and suggest that CaM may contribute to NHE1 dimerization and thereby augment NHE1 regulation. We propose that a similar structural diversity is of relevance to many other CaM complexes.</description>

	<description>Aggregation and accumulation of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. To study microglial responses to A{beta}, we applied exogenous A{beta} peptide, in either oligomeric or fibrillar conformation, to primary mouse microglial cultures and evaluated system level transcriptional changes and then compared these to transcriptomic changes in the brains of CRND8 APP mice. We find that primary microglial cultures have rapid and massive transcriptional change to in response to A{beta}. Transcriptomic responses to oligomeric or fibrillar A{beta} in primary microglia, though partially overlapping, are distinct and are not recapitulated in vivo where A{beta} progressively accumulates. Furthermore, though classic immune mediators show massive transcriptional changes in the primary microglial cultures, these changes are not observed in the mouse model. Together, these data extend previous studies which demonstrate that microglia responses ex vivo are poor proxies for in vivo responses. Finally, these data demonstrate the potential utility of using microglia as biosensors of different aggregate conformation, as the transcriptional responses to oligomeric and fibrillar A{beta} can be distinguished.</description>

Microbes can metabolize more chemical compounds than any other group of organisms. As a result, their metabolism is of interest to investigators across biology. Despite the interest, information on metabolism of specific microbes is hard to access. Information is buried in text of books and journals, and investigators have no easy way to extract it out. Here we investigate if neural networks can extract out this information and predict metabolic traits. For proof of concept, we predicted two traits: whether microbes carry one type of metabolism (fermentation) or produce one metabolite (acetate). We collected written descriptions of 7,021 species of bacteria and archaea from &lt;i&gt;Bergey’s Manual&lt;/i&gt;. We read the descriptions and manually identified (labeled) which species were fermentative or produced acetate. We then trained neural networks to predict these labels. In total, we identified 2,364 species as fermentative, and 1,009 species as also producing acetate. Neural networks could predict which species were fermentative with 97.3% accuracy. Accuracy was even higher (98.6%) when predicting species also producing acetate. Phylogenetic trees of species and their traits confirmed that predictions were accurate. Our approach with neural networks can extract information efficiently and accurately. It paves the way for putting more metabolic traits into databases, providing easy access of information to investigators.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NvmhGOIwmeU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In the last two decades rodents have been on the rise as a dominant model for visual neuroscience. This is particularly true for earlier levels of information processing, but a number of studies have suggested that also higher levels of processing such as invariant object recognition occur in rodents. Here we provide a quantitative and comprehensive assessment of this claim by comparing a wide range of rodent behavioral and neural data with convolutional deep neural networks. These networks have been shown to capture hallmark properties of information processing in primates through a succession of convolutional and fully connected layers. We find that performance rodent object vision tasks can be captured using low to mid-level convolutional layers only, without any convincing evidence for the need of higher layers known to simulate complex object recognition in primates. Our approach also reveals surprising insights on assumptions made before, for example, that the best performing animals would be the ones using the most abstract representations–which we show to likely be incorrect. Our findings suggest a road ahead for further studies aiming at quantifying and establishing the richness of representations underlying information processing in animal models at large.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DH-8i_4KE7Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Alternative splicing can expand the diversity of proteomes. Homologous mutually exclusive exons (MXEs) originate from the same ancestral exon and result in polypeptides with similar structural properties but altered sequence. Why would some genes switch homologous exons and what are their biological impact? Here, we analyse the extent of sequence, structural and functional variability in MXEs and report the first large scale, structure-based analysis of the biological impact of MXE events from different genomes. MXE-specific residues tend to map to single domains, are highly enriched in surface exposed residues and cluster at or near protein functional sites. Thus, MXE events are likely to maintain the protein fold, but alter specificity and selectivity of protein function. This comprehensive resource of MXE events and their annotations is available at: http://gene3d.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/mxemod/. These findings highlight how small, but significant changes at critical positions on a protein surface are exploited in evolution to alter function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sYPzhby_lWI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We present DeepMIB, a new software package that is capable of training convolutional neural networks for segmentation of multidimensional microscopy datasets on any workstation. We demonstrate its successful application for segmentation of 2D and 3D electron and multicolor light microscopy datasets with isotropic and anisotropic voxels.

There are two distinct classes of cells in the primary visual cortex (V1): simple cells and complex cells. One defining feature of complex cells is their spatial phase invariance; they respond strongly to oriented grating stimuli with a preferred orientation but with a wide range of spatial phases. A classical model of complete spatial phase invariance in complex cells is the energy model, in which the responses are the sum of the squared outputs of two linear spatially phase-shifted filters. However, recent experimental studies have shown that complex cells have a diverse range of spatial phase invariance and only a subset can be characterized by the energy model. While several models have been proposed to explain how complex cells could learn to be selective to orientation but invariant to spatial phase, most existing models overlook many biologically important details. We propose a biologically plausible model for complex cells that learns to pool inputs from simple cells based on the presentation of natural scene stimuli. The model is a three-layer network with rate-based neurons that describes the activities of LGN cells (layer 1), V1 simple cells (layer 2), and V1 complex cells (layer 3). The first two layers implement a recently proposed simple cell model that is biologically plausible and accounts for many experimental phenomena. The neural dynamics of the complex cells is modeled as the integration of simple cells inputs along with response normalization. Connections between LGN and simple cells are learned using Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity. Connections between simple and complex cells are learned using a modified version of the Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro (BCM) rule. Our results demonstrate that the learning rule can describe a diversity of complex cells, similar to those observed experimentally.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DTbVhPHbb3w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Evolutionary innovations underlie the rise of diversity and complexity—the 2 long-term trends in the history of life. How does natural selection redesign multiple interacting parts to achieve a new emergent function? We investigated the evolution of a biomechanical innovation, the latch-spring mechanism of trap-jaw ants, to address 2 outstanding evolutionary problems: how form and function change in a system during the evolution of new complex traits, and whether such innovations and the diversity they beget are repeatable in time and space. Using a new phylogenetic reconstruction of 470 species, and X-ray microtomography and high-speed videography of representative taxa, we found the trap-jaw mechanism evolved independently 7 to 10 times in a single ant genus (&lt;i&gt;Strumigenys&lt;/i&gt;), resulting in the repeated evolution of diverse forms on different continents. The trap mechanism facilitates a 6 to 7 order of magnitude greater mandible acceleration relative to simpler ancestors, currently the fastest recorded acceleration of a resettable animal movement. We found that most morphological diversification occurred after evolution of latch-spring mechanisms, which evolved via minor realignments of mouthpart structures. This finding, whereby incremental changes in form lead to a change of function, followed by large morphological reorganization around the new function, provides a model for understanding the evolution of complex biomechanical traits, as well as insights into why such innovations often happen repeatedly.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rs2fK7Oquks&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We recently developed original electroencephalogram indices focusing on
microwaves of flattish period (named $\tau$), which correlated with volatile
anesthesia concentration in dogs. However, this mechanism remains unclear.
$\tau$ was defined as a subthreshold wave and burst wave was defined as an
above-threshold wave. This study shows that these indices well quantified the
morphological features of local field potential waveforms in mice, and made it
possible to discriminate the specific waveforms of the state of consciousness;
awake, shallow sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, and non-rapid eye movement
sleep. In addition, examination of $\tau$ suggested that microwaves are local
fluctuations of the electrode that can be formed for each data sampling, and
that its amplitude may increase with the degree of arousal.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Inductive biases, pretraining and fine-tuning jointly account for brain responses to speech. (arXiv:2103.01032v1 [cs.CL])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01032</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01032</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our ability to comprehend speech remains, to date, unrivaled by deep learning
models. This feat could result from the brain's ability to fine-tune generic
sound representations for speech-specific processes. To test this hypothesis,
we compare i) five types of deep neural networks to ii) human brain responses
elicited by spoken sentences and recorded in 102 Dutch subjects using
functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Each network was either trained
on an acoustics scene classification, a speech-to-text task (based on Bengali,
English, or Dutch), or not trained. The similarity between each model and the
brain is assessed by correlating their respective activations after an optimal
linear projection. The differences in brain-similarity across networks revealed
three main results. First, speech representations in the brain can be accounted
for by random deep networks. Second, learning to classify acoustic scenes leads
deep nets to increase their brain similarity. Third, learning to process
phonetically-related speech inputs (i.e., Dutch vs English) leads deep nets to
reach higher levels of brain-similarity than learning to process
phonetically-distant speech inputs (i.e. Dutch vs Bengali). Together, these
results suggest that the human brain fine-tunes its heavily-trained auditory
hierarchy to learn to process speech.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Modelling brain based on canonical ensemble with functional MRI: A thermodynamic exploration on neural system. (arXiv:2103.01026v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01026</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01026</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective. Modelling is an important way to study the working mechanism of
brain. While the characterization and understanding of brain are still
inadequate. This study tried to build a model of brain from the perspective of
thermodynamics at system level, which brought a new thinking to brain
modelling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approach. Regarding brain regions as systems, voxels as particles, and
intensity of signals as energy of particles, the thermodynamic model of brain
was built based on canonical ensemble theory. Two pairs of activated regions
and two pairs of inactivated brain regions were selected for comparison in this
study, and the analysis on thermodynamic properties based on the model proposed
were performed. In addition, the thermodynamic properties were also extracted
as input features for the detection of Alzheimer's disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main results. The experiment results verified the assumption that the brain
also follows the thermodynamic laws. It demonstrated the feasibility and
rationality of brain thermodynamic modelling method proposed, indicating that
thermodynamic parameters could be applied to describe the state of neural
system. Meanwhile, the brain thermodynamic model achieved much better accuracy
in detection of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting the potential application of
thermodynamic model in auxiliary diagnosis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significance. (1) Instead of applying some thermodynamic parameters to
analyze neural system, a brain model at system level was proposed from
perspective of thermodynamics for the first time in this study. (2) The study
discovered that the neural system also follows the laws of thermodynamics,
which leads to increased internal energy, increased free energy and decreased
entropy when system is activated. (3) The detection of neural disease was
demonstrated to be benefit from thermodynamic model, implying the immense
potential of thermodynamics in auxiliary diagnosis.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Suppression of synchronous spiking in two interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons. (arXiv:2103.00867v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00867</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Collective oscillations and their suppression by external stimulation are
analyzed in a large-scale neural network consisting of two interacting
populations of excitatory and inhibitory quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons.
In the limit of an infinite number of neurons, the microscopic model of this
network can be reduced to an exact low-dimensional system of mean-field
equations. Bifurcation analysis of these equations reveals three different
dynamic modes in a free network: a stable resting state, a stable limit cycle,
and bistability with a coexisting resting state and a limit cycle. We show that
in the limit cycle mode, high-frequency stimulation of an inhibitory population
can stabilize an unstable resting state and effectively suppress collective
oscillations. We also show that in the bistable mode, the dynamics of the
network can be switched from a stable limit cycle to a stable resting state by
applying an inhibitory pulse to the excitatory population. The results obtained
from the mean-field equations are confirmed by numerical simulation of the
microscopic model.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We expand from a spontaneous to an evoked potentials (EP) data set of brain
electrical activities as electrocorticogram (ECoG) and electrothalamogram
(EThG) in juvenile pig under various sedation, ischemia and recovery states.
This EP data set includes three stimulation paradigms: auditory (AEP, 40 and
2000 Hz), sensory (SEP, left and right maxillary nerve) and high-frequency
oscillations (HFO) SEP. This permits derivation of electroencephalogram (EEG)
biomarkers of corticothalamic communication under these conditions. The data
set is presented in full band sampled at 2000 Hz. We provide technical
validation of the evoked responses for the states of sedation, ischemia and
recovery. This extended data set now permits mutual inferences between
spontaneous and evoked activities across the recorded modalities. Future
studies on the dataset may contribute to the development of new brain
monitoring technologies, which will facilitate the prevention of neurological
injuries.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00481</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained to solve low-level visual tasks
have been shown to develop biological-like features. Examples include
human-like receptive fields and being subject to human-like visual illusions.
In this work we report that these artificial systems may also develop
human-like Contrast Sensitivity Functions (CSFs).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the interest in accurate comparison between humans and ANNs, we use
psychophysical ideas to extend a recently proposed eigenanalysis to define the
CSFs of such artificial systems. Results show that low-pass sensitivity to
chromatic gratings and wider band-pass sensitivity to achromatic gratings may
appear in convolutional autoencoders trained to enhance the retinal signals.
Similarly, 3D versions of these networks may develop a spatio-temporal CSF with
the basic diamond shape and bandwidth of the human window of visibility.
Moreover, masking-like saturated responses to the contrast of spatio-chromatic
and spatio-temporal gratings may emerge in these autoencoders.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the consideration of a range of ANN models trained for the same
statistical goal shows that deeper architectures or better accuracy in the goal
do not necessarily lead to more human CSFs or more human masking-like
saturations. We argue that the nontrivial interplay between goal and
architecture in the optimization prevents against premature conclusions about
the organization principles of the visual system if sensible architectures are
not adopted. This suggests that goal-driven derivations of psychophysical
phenomena should include more realistic units than those considered in
conventional CNNs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Semantic diversity in Genetic Programming has proved to be highly beneficial
in evolutionary search. We have witnessed a surge in the number of scientific
works in the area, starting first in discrete spaces and moving then to
continuous spaces. The vast majority of these works, however, have focused
their attention on single-objective genetic programming paradigms, with a few
exceptions focusing on Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization (EMO). The
latter works have used well-known robust algorithms, including the
Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II and the Strength Pareto Evolutionary
Algorithm, both heavily influenced by the notion of Pareto dominance. These
inspiring works led us to make a step forward in EMO by considering
Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D). We
show, for the first time, how we can promote semantic diversity in MOEA/D in
Genetic Programming.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are biology-inspired artificial neural
networks (ANNs) that comprise of spiking neurons to process asynchronous
discrete signals. While more efficient in power consumption and inference speed
on the neuromorphic hardware, SNNs are usually difficult to train directly from
scratch with spikes due to the discreteness. As an alternative, many efforts
have been devoted to converting conventional ANNs into SNNs by copying the
weights from ANNs and adjusting the spiking threshold potential of neurons in
SNNs. Researchers have designed new SNN architectures and conversion algorithms
to diminish the conversion error. However, an effective conversion should
address the difference between the SNN and ANN architectures with an efficient
approximation \DSK{of} the loss function, which is missing in the field. In
this work, we analyze the conversion error by recursive reduction to layer-wise
summation and propose a novel strategic pipeline that transfers the weights to
the target SNN by combining threshold balance and soft-reset mechanisms. This
pipeline enables almost no accuracy loss between the converted SNNs and
conventional ANNs with only $\sim1/10$ of the typical SNN simulation time. Our
method is promising to get implanted onto embedded platforms with better
support of SNNs with limited energy and memory.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00475</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Diverse cognitive processes set different demands on locally segregated and
globally integrated brain activity. However, it remains unclear how resting
brains configure their functional organization to balance the demands on
network segregation and integration to best serve cognition. Here, we use an
eigenmode-based approach to identify hierarchical modules in functional brain
networks, and quantify the functional balance between network segregation and
integration. In a large sample of healthy young adults (n=991), we combine the
whole-brain resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data
with a mean-filed model on the structural network derived from diffusion tensor
imaging and demonstrate that resting brain networks are on average close to a
balanced state. This state allows for a balanced time dwelling at segregated
and integrated configurations, and highly flexible switching between them.
Furthermore, we employ structural equation modelling to estimate general and
domain-specific cognitive phenotypes from nine tasks, and demonstrate that
network segregation, integration and their balance in resting brains predict
individual differences in diverse cognitive phenotypes. More specifically,
stronger integration is associated with better general cognitive ability,
stronger segregation fosters crystallized intelligence and processing speed,
and individual's tendency towards balance supports better memory. Our findings
provide a comprehensive and deep understanding of the brain's functioning
principles in supporting diverse functional demands and cognitive abilities,
and advance modern network neuroscience theories of human cognition.

neuropsychological performance testing that can establish a link between
cognition and emotion. It comprises a portable device used to interact with a
cloud service which stores user information under username and is logged into
by user through the portable device; the user information is directly captured
through the device and is processed by artificial neural network; and the
tridimensional user information comprises user cognitive reactions, user
emotional responses and user chronometrics. The multivariate situational risk
assessment is used to evaluate the performance of the subject by capturing the
3 dimensions of each reaction to a series of 30 dichotomous questions
describing various situations of daily life and challenging the user's
knowledge, values, ethics, and principles. In industrial application, the
timing of this assessment will depend on the user's need to obtain a service
from a provider such as opening a bank account, getting a mortgage or an
insurance policy, authenticating clearance at work or securing online payments.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) bear the potential of efficient unsupervised
and continual learning capabilities because of their biological plausibility,
but their complexity still poses a serious research challenge to enable their
energy-efficient design for resource-constrained scenarios (like embedded
systems, IoT-Edge, etc.). We propose SpikeDyn, a comprehensive framework for
energy-efficient SNNs with continual and unsupervised learning capabilities in
dynamic environments, for both the training and inference phases. It is
achieved through the following multiple diverse mechanisms: 1) reduction of
neuronal operations, by replacing the inhibitory neurons with direct lateral
inhibitions; 2) a memory- and energy-constrained SNN model search algorithm
that employs analytical models to estimate the memory footprint and energy
consumption of different candidate SNN models and selects a Pareto-optimal SNN
model; and 3) a lightweight continual and unsupervised learning algorithm that
employs adaptive learning rates, adaptive membrane threshold potential, weight
decay, and reduction of spurious updates. Our experimental results show that,
for a network with 400 excitatory neurons, our SpikeDyn reduces the energy
consumption on average by 51% for training and by 37% for inference, as
compared to the state-of-the-art. Due to the improved learning algorithm,
SpikeDyn provides on avg. 21% accuracy improvement over the state-of-the-art,
for classifying the most recently learned task, and by 8% on average for the
previously learned tasks.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: SparkXD: A Framework for Resilient and Energy-Efficient Spiking Neural Network Inference using Approximate DRAM. (arXiv:2103.00421v1 [cs.AR])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00421</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00421</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have the potential for achieving low energy
consumption due to their biologically sparse computation. Several studies have
shown that the off-chip memory (DRAM) accesses are the most energy-consuming
operations in SNN processing. However, state-of-the-art in SNN systems do not
optimize the DRAM energy-per-access, thereby hindering achieving high
energy-efficiency. To substantially minimize the DRAM energy-per-access, a key
knob is to reduce the DRAM supply voltage but this may lead to DRAM errors
(i.e., the so-called approximate DRAM). Towards this, we propose SparkXD, a
novel framework that provides a comprehensive conjoint solution for resilient
and energy-efficient SNN inference using low-power DRAMs subjected to
voltage-induced errors. The key mechanisms of SparkXD are: (1) improving the
SNN error tolerance through fault-aware training that considers bit errors from
approximate DRAM, (2) analyzing the error tolerance of the improved SNN model
to find the maximum tolerable bit error rate (BER) that meets the targeted
accuracy constraint, and (3) energy-efficient DRAM data mapping for the
resilient SNN model that maps the weights in the appropriate DRAM location to
minimize the DRAM access energy. Through these mechanisms, SparkXD mitigates
the negative impact of DRAM (approximation) errors, and provides the required
accuracy. The experimental results show that, for a target accuracy within 1%
of the baseline design (i.e., SNN without DRAM errors), SparkXD reduces the
DRAM energy by ca. 40% on average across different network sizes.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Speech sound disorders are a common communication impairment in childhood.
Because speech disorders can negatively affect the lives and the development of
children, clinical intervention is often recommended. To help with diagnosis
and treatment, clinicians use instrumented methods such as spectrograms or
ultrasound tongue imaging to analyse speech articulations. Analysis with these
methods can be laborious for clinicians, therefore there is growing interest in
its automation. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of ultrasound
tongue imaging for the automatic detection of speech articulation errors. Our
systems are trained on typically developing child speech and augmented with a
database of adult speech using audio and ultrasound. Evaluation on typically
developing speech indicates that pre-training on adult speech and jointly using
ultrasound and audio gives the best results with an accuracy of 86.9%. To
evaluate on disordered speech, we collect pronunciation scores from experienced
speech and language therapists, focusing on cases of velar fronting and gliding
of /r/. The scores show good inter-annotator agreement for velar fronting, but
not for gliding errors. For automatic velar fronting error detection, the best
results are obtained when jointly using ultrasound and audio. The best system
correctly detects 86.6% of the errors identified by experienced clinicians. Out
of all the segments identified as errors by the best system, 73.2% match errors
identified by clinicians. Results on automatic gliding detection are harder to
interpret due to poor inter-annotator agreement, but appear promising. Overall
findings suggest that automatic detection of speech articulation errors has
potential to be integrated into ultrasound intervention software for
automatically quantifying progress during speech therapy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Symmetry in biological and physical systems is a product of self organization
driven by evolutionary processes, or mechanical systems under constraints.
Symmetry based feature extrac-tion or representation by neural networks may
unravel the most informative contents in large image databases. Despite
significant achievements of artificial intelligence in recognition and
classification of regular patterns, the problem of uncertainty remains a major
challenge in ambiguous data. In this study, we present an artificial neural
network that detects symmetry uncertainty states in human observers. To this
end, we exploit a neural network metric in the output of a biologically
inspired Self Organizing Map, the Quantization Error (SOM QE). Shape pairs with
perfect geometric mirror symmetry but a non-homogenous appearance, caused by
local variations in hue, saturation, or lightness within or across the shapes
in a given pair produce, as shown here, longer choice RT for yes responses
relative to symmetry. These data are consistently mirrored by the variations in
the SOM QE from unsupervised neural network analysis of the same stimulus
images. The neural network metric is thus capable of detecting and scaling
human symmetry uncertainty in response to patterns. Such capacity is tightly
linked to the metrics proven selectivity to local contrast and color variations
in large and highly complex image data.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, Neural Networks represent a major expectation for the realization
of powerful Deep Learning algorithms, which can determine several physical
systems' behaviors and operations. Computational resources required for model,
training, and running are large, especially when related to the amount of data
that Neural Networks typically need to generalize. The latest TinyML
technologies allow integrating pre-trained models on embedded systems, allowing
making computing at the edge faster, cheaper, and safer. Although these
technologies originated in the consumer and industrial worlds, many sectors can
greatly benefit from them, such as the automotive industry. In this paper, we
present a framework for implementing Neural Network-based models on a family of
automotive Microcontrollers, showing their efficiency in two case studies
applied to vehicles: intrusion detection on the Controller Area Network bus and
residual capacity estimation in Lithium-Ion batteries, widely used in Electric
Vehicles.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a survey of ways in which domain-knowledge has been included when
constructing models with neural networks. The inclusion of domain-knowledge is
of special interest not just to constructing scientific assistants, but also,
many other areas that involve understanding data using human-machine
collaboration. In many such instances, machine-based model construction may
benefit significantly from being provided with human-knowledge of the domain
encoded in a sufficiently precise form. This paper examines two broad
approaches to encode such knowledge--as logical and numerical constraints--and
describes techniques and results obtained in several sub-categories under each
of these approaches.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00134</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Among the versatile forms of dynamical patterns of activity exhibited by the
brain, oscillations are one of the most salient and extensively studied, yet
are still far from being well understood. In this paper, we provide various
structural characterizations of the existence of oscillatory behavior in neural
networks using a classical neural mass model of mesoscale brain activity called
the linear-threshold model. Exploiting the switched-affine nature of
linear-threshold dynamics, we obtain various necessary and/or sufficient
conditions for the existence of oscillations in (i) two-dimensional
excitatory-inhibitory networks (E-I pairs), (ii) networks with one inhibitory
but arbitrary number of excitatory nodes, (iii) purely inhibitory networks with
an arbitrary number of nodes, and (iv) networks of E-I pairs. Throughout our
treatment, and given the arbitrary dimensionality of the considered dynamics,
we rely on the lack of stable equilibria as a system-based proxy for the
existence of oscillations, and provide extensive numerical results to support
its tight relationship with the more standard, signal-based definition of
oscillations in computational neuroscience.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present an alternative derivation of the LTI system underlying the
Legendre Delay Network (LDN). To this end, we first construct an LTI system
that generates the Legendre polynomials. We then dampen the system by
approximating a windowed impulse response, using what we call a &quot;delay
re-encoder&quot;. The resulting LTI system is equivalent to the LDN system. The same
technique can be applied to arbitrary polynomial bases, although there
typically is no set of closed form equations that can be used to construct the
corresponding LTI systems.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: ASBSO: An Improved Brain Storm Optimization With Flexible Search Length and Memory-Based Selection. (arXiv:2101.11275v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11275</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11275</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain storm optimization (BSO) is a newly proposed population-based
optimization algorithm, which uses a logarithmic sigmoid transfer function to
adjust its search range during the convergent process. However, this adjustment
only varies with the current iteration number and lacks of flexibility and
variety which makes a poor search effciency and robustness of BSO. To alleviate
this problem, an adaptive step length structure together with a success memory
selection strategy is proposed to be incorporated into BSO. This proposed
method, adaptive step length based on memory selection BSO, namely ASBSO,
applies multiple step lengths to modify the generation process of new
solutions, thus supplying a flexible search according to corresponding problems
and convergent periods. The novel memory mechanism, which is capable of
evaluating and storing the degree of improvements of solutions, is used to
determine the selection possibility of step lengths. A set of 57 benchmark
functions are used to test ASBSO's search ability, and four real-world problems
are adopted to show its application value. All these test results indicate the
remarkable improvement in solution quality, scalability, and robustness of
ASBSO.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: A Technical Critique of Some Parts of the Free Energy Principle. (arXiv:2001.06408v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06408</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06408</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We summarize the original formulation of the free energy principle, and
highlight some technical issues. We discuss how these issues affect related
results involving generalised coordinates and, where appropriate, mention
consequences for and reveal, up to now unacknowledged, differences to newer
formulations of the free energy principle. In particular, we reveal that
various definitions of the &quot;Markov blanket&quot; proposed in different works are not
equivalent. We show that crucial steps in the free energy argument which
involve rewriting the equations of motion of systems with Markov blankets, are
not generally correct without additional (previously unstated) assumptions. We
prove by counterexample that the original free energy lemma, when taken at face
value, is wrong. We show further that this free energy lemma, when it does
hold, implies equality of variational density and ergodic conditional density.
The interpretation in terms of Bayesian inference hinges on this point, and we
hence conclude that it is not sufficiently justified. Additionally, we
highlight that the variational densities presented in newer formulations of the
free energy principle and lemma are parameterised by different variables than
in older works, leading to a substantially different interpretation of the
theory. Note that we only highlight some specific problems in the discussed
publications. These problems do not rule out conclusively that the general
ideas behind the free energy principle are worth pursuing.

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type 1 (ARCA-1) or spinocerebellar ataxia autosomal recessive type 8 (SCAR8) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder that occurs due to mutations in the spectrin repeat containing nuclear envelope protein 1 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SYNE1&lt;/em&gt;) gene. Previously considered a rare cause of ARCA, related to French-Canadian patients from Beauce, Quebec, Canada, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SYNE1&lt;/em&gt; ataxia is now known to be of worldwide distribution. We present the case report of a 54-year-old male patient with the genetic diagnosis of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SYNE1&lt;/em&gt; ataxia, presenting with a &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SYNE1&lt;/em&gt; gene mutation never described in Chilean population before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Decomposition of Reaching Movements Enables Detection and Measurement of Ataxia</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Technologies that enable frequent, objective, and precise measurement of ataxia severity would benefit clinical trials by lowering participation barriers and improving the ability to measure disease state and change. We hypothesized that analyzing characteristics of sub-second movement profiles obtained during a reaching task would be useful for objectively quantifying motor characteristics of ataxia. Participants with ataxia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;=88), participants with parkinsonism (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;=44), and healthy controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;=34) performed a computer tablet version of the finger-to-nose test while wearing inertial sensors on their wrists. Data features designed to capture signs of ataxia were extracted from participants’ decomposed wrist velocity time-series. A machine learning regression model was trained to estimate overall ataxia severity, as measured by the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS). Classification models were trained to distinguish between ataxia participants and controls and between ataxia and parkinsonism phenotypes. Movement decomposition revealed expected and novel characteristics of the ataxia phenotype. The distance, speed, duration, morphology, and temporal relationships of decomposed movements exhibited strong relationships with disease severity. The regression model estimated BARS with a root mean square error of 3.6 points, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.69, and moderate-to-excellent reliability. Classification models distinguished between ataxia participants and controls and ataxia and parkinsonism phenotypes with areas under the receiver-operating curve of 0.96 and 0.89, respectively. Movement decomposition captures core features of ataxia and may be useful for objective, precise, and frequent assessment of ataxia in home and clinic environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: KRIT1 Gene in Patients with Cerebral Cavernous Malformations: Clinical Features and Molecular Characterization of Novel Variants</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-021-01814-w</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are vascular malformations that may result in headaches, seizures, focal neurological deficits, and hemorrhage. CCMs occur sporadically (80%) or in familial form (20%), with autosomal dominant inheritance. Among the three CCM-related genes, mutations in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KRIT1&lt;/em&gt; account for 53–65% of familial cases and more than 100 different mutations have been identified so far. In the present work, we describe the clinical, neuroradiological, and genetic findings of sixteen CCM Italian patients, 13 belonging to 4 unrelated families and 3 sporadic cases. Six distinct &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KRIT1&lt;/em&gt; gene variants, two novel (c.1730+1_1730+3del, c.1664 C&amp;gt;T) and four previously described (c.966G&amp;gt;A, c.1255-1G&amp;gt;A c.1197_1200del, c.1255-1_1256del), were identified, including a possible de novo mutation. All the variants resulted in a premature stop codon. Cerebral 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple CCMs in all the mutation carriers for whom it was available, including sporadic cases. One patient had also cutaneous angiomas. Among the mutation carriers, symptomatic patients constituted 66% and a variable phenotypic expression was observed. Our data confirms phenotypic variability and incomplete penetrance of neurological symptoms in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KRIT1&lt;/em&gt;-positive families, expands the mutational spectrum of this gene, and highlights how sporadic cases with multiple lesions need an approach similar to individuals with familial CCM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Neuroinformatics: Excavating FAIR Data: the Case of the Multicenter Animal Spinal Cord Injury Study (MASCIS), Blood Pressure, and Neuro-Recovery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12021-021-09512-z</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12021-021-09512-z</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Meta-analyses suggest that the published literature represents only a small minority of the total data collected in biomedical research, with most becoming ‘dark data’ unreported in the literature. Dark data is due to publication bias toward novel results that confirm investigator hypotheses and omission of data that do not. Publication bias contributes to scientific irreproducibility and failures in bench-to-bedside translation. Sharing dark data by making it Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) may reduce the burden of irreproducible science by increasing transparency and support data-driven discoveries beyond the lifecycle of the original study. We illustrate feasibility of dark data sharing by recovering original raw data from the Multicenter Animal Spinal Cord Injury Study (MASCIS), an NIH-funded multi-site preclinical drug trial conducted in the 1990s that tested efficacy of several therapies after a spinal cord injury (SCI). The original drug treatments did not produce clear positive results and MASCIS data were stored in boxes for more than two decades. The goal of the present study was to independently confirm published machine learning findings that perioperative blood pressure is a major predictor of SCI neuromotor outcome (Nielson et al., &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r49&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/span&gt;). We recovered, digitized, and curated the data from 1125 rats from MASCIS. Analyses indicated that high perioperative blood pressure at the time of SCI is associated with poorer health and worse neuromotor outcomes in more severe SCI, whereas low perioperative blood pressure is associated with poorer health and worse neuromotor outcome in moderate SCI. These findings confirm and expand prior results that a narrow window of blood-pressure control optimizes outcome, and demonstrate the value of recovering dark data for assessing reproducibility of findings with implications for precision therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Edaravone was approved as a new treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), although there are different opinions on its effectiveness. Magnetic resonance (MRI) measures appear promising as diagnostic and prognostic indicators of disease. However, published studies on MRI using to monitor treatment efficacy in ALS are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The objective of this study was to investigate changes in brain MRI measures in patients treated with edaravone.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Thirteen ALS patients assuming edaravone (ALS-EDA) underwent MRI at baseline (T0) and after 6 months (T6) to measure cortical thickness (CT) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of white matter (WM) tracts. MRI data of ALS-EDA were compared at T0 with those of 12 control subjects (CS), and at T6 with those of 11 ALS patients assuming only riluzole (ALS-RIL), extracted from our ALS cohort using a propensity-score-matching. A longitudinal MRI analysis was performed in ALS-EDA between T6 and T0.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;At T0&lt;strong class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; ALS-EDA showed a cortical widespread thinning in both hemispheres, particularly in the bilateral precentral gyrus, and a reduction of FA in bilateral corticospinal tracts, in comparison to CS. Thinning in bilateral precentral cortex and significant widespread reduction of FA in several WM tracts were observed in ALS-EDA at T6 compared to T0. At T6, no significant differences in MRI measures of ALS-EDA versus ALS-RIL were found.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Patients treated with edaravone showed progression of damage in the motor cortex and several WM tracts, at a six-month follow-up. Moreover, this study showed no evidence of a difference between edaravone and riluzole.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Transient global amnesia does not increase the risk of subsequent ischemic stroke: a propensity score-matched analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10483-z</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10483-z</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Data regarding the risk of cerebrovascular events following transient global amnesia (TGA) remain controversial. While some neuroradiological studies suggest an underlying cerebrovascular etiology, results from the clinical studies have been largely conflicting. We, therefore, aimed to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke in a large, nationally representative sample of patients with TGA.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We utilized the Nationwide Readmissions Database 2010–2015 to identify all hospitalizations with the primary discharge diagnosis of TGA. We selected a 2% random sample of all elective admissions to be included as controls. A propensity score-matched analysis was performed to match patients with TGA and the controls. The primary outcome was readmission due to ischemic stroke up to 1 year following discharge from the index hospitalization, assessed using the Kaplan–Meier survival analysis in the propensity-matched groups.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;There were 24,803 weighted hospitalizations due to TGA (mean ± SD age: 65.6 ± 10.4 years, female: 54.9%) and 699,644 corresponding controls. At baseline, patients with TGA were significantly older, more likely to be male, and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and migraine, as compared to the controls. However, after propensity score matching, we obtained 21,202 cases and 21,293 well-matched corresponding controls, and the risk of readmission due to ischemic stroke in patients with TGA was not different compared to the control group (HR: 1.13, 95% CI 0.62–2.05, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; 0.686) during the mean (SD) follow-up period of 192.2 (102.4) days.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;After adjustment for demographics and cerebrovascular risk factors, TGA is not associated with an increased risk of subsequent ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Cerebrospinal fluid analysis in Guillain–Barré syndrome: value of albumin quotients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10479-9</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10479-9</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Albuminocytologic dissociation in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a diagnostic hallmark of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). Compared to CSF total protein (TP), the CSF/serum albumin quotient (Qalb) has the advantage of method-independent reference ranges. Whether the diagnostic yield differs between Qalb and CSF-TP is currently unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We retrospectively analyzed the diagnostic yield (i.e., a value above the URL indicating blood–nerve barrier dysfunction) of Qalb and CSF-TP levels in patients with GBS. We evaluated two different equations (Reiber’s and Hegen’s) for age-adjusted URLs of Qalb and compared results to CSF-TP using the standard URL of 0.45 g/L as well as age-adjusted URLs (by decade of age). Additionally, multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effect of clinical factors on the diagnostic yield.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We analyzed 110 patients [62% males; median age 48 (IQR 35–58)] with sensorimotor (68), motor (16), sensory (12) and localized (8) GBS as well as Miller Fisher syndrome (6).&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Qalb and CSF-TP were highly correlated (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.95, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The diagnostic yield of Qalb was 65% with Reiber’s and 47% with Hegen’s age-adjusted URLs compared to 66% with the fixed CSF-TP URL of 0.45 g/L and 49% with age-adjusted CSF-TP URLs. A longer duration from clinical onset to lumbar puncture was associated with a higher diagnostic yield.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Qalb strongly correlates with CSF-TP in patients with GBS with a similar diagnostic yield for the detection of a blood–nerve barrier dysfunction. However, the diagnostic yield of both values is lower when using more recent age-adjusted URLs and at earlier timepoints.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neurology: 5-Year health-related quality of life outcome in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is severely impaired in persons with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). The HRQoL improves in a number of patients after the placement of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt, but long-term follow-up of HRQoL is rare.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Extended follow-up (60 months) of a prospective cohort study involving 189 patients with iNPH who underwent shunt surgery. Preoperative variables were used to predict favorable HRQoL outcome (improvement or non-deterioration) measured by the 15D instrument 5 years after shunting.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Out of the 189 initially enrolled study participants, 88 had completed 5-year HRQoL follow-up (46%), 64 had died (34%), and 37 (20%) failed to complete the HRQoL follow-up but were alive at the end of the study. After initial post-operative HRQoL improvement, HRQoL deteriorated so that 37/88 participants (42%) had a favorable HRQoL outcome 5 years after shunting. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis indicated that younger age (adjusted OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77–0.95; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.005), lower body mass index (adjusted OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77–0.98; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) and better Mini-Mental State Examination performance (adjusted OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01–1.32; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) before surgery predicted favorable 5-year outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This extended follow-up showed that the self-evaluated HRQoL outcome is associated with iNPH patients’ pre-operative cognitive status, overweight and age. The post-operative deterioration may reflect the natural progression of iNPH, but also derive from aging and comorbidities. It indicates a need for long-term follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Vergence increases the amplitude of lateral ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06056-1</guid>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06056-1</link>
	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The angular and linear vestibulo-ocular reflex responses are greater when viewing near targets to compensate for the relatively larger translation of the eyes with respect to the target. Our aim was to measure vestibular evoked myogenic potentials using a lateral ocular electrode montage (oVEMP) with a laterally applied stimulus using a mini-shaker during both far- and near-viewing (vergence) distances to determine whether vergence affects the oVEMP response as it does the semicircular canal vestibulo-ocular reflex response. Our results show that during vergence, the p1 and n1-p1 amplitude of the lateral oVEMP response increases significantly, whereas the latencies do not change significantly. We suggest that the physiological basis for this vergence-mediated amplitude increase in potentials may be the same as those already documented using transient linear head accelerations. Our data also suggest that irregular vestibular afferents are likely mediating the vergence-mediated gain increase during linear head accelerations because only irregular afferents are stimulated during short, transient 500 Hz stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Adaptive Rewiring in Weighted Networks Shows Specificity, Robustness, and Flexibility</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.580569</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain network connections rewire adaptively in response to neural activity. Adaptive rewiring may be understood as a process which, at its every step, is aimed at optimizing the efficiency of signal diffusion. In evolving model networks, this amounts to creating shortcut connections in regions with high diffusion and pruning where diffusion is low. Adaptive rewiring leads over time to topologies akin to brain anatomy: small worlds with rich club and modular or centralized structures. We continue our investigation of adaptive rewiring by focusing on three desiderata: specificity of evolving model network architectures, robustness of dynamically maintained architectures, and flexibility of network evolution to stochastically deviate from specificity and robustness. Our adaptive rewiring model simulations show that specificity and robustness characterize alternative modes of network operation, controlled by a single parameter, the rewiring interval. Small control parameter shifts across a critical transition zone allow switching between the two modes. Adaptive rewiring exhibits greater flexibility for skewed, lognormal connection weight distributions than for normally distributed ones. The results qualify adaptive rewiring as a key principle of self-organized complexity in network architectures, in particular of those that characterize the variety of functional architectures in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Analysis of Chronic Mild Stress-Induced Hypothalamic Proteome: Identification of Protein Dysregulations Associated With Vulnerability and Resiliency to Depression or Anxiety</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress as a known risk factor leads to hyperactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in both depression and anxiety. However, the stress-induced dysfunction of the HPA axis in these disorders especially the common and unique molecular dysregulations have not been well-explored. Previously, we utilized a chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm to segregate and gain depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, and insusceptible groups. In this study, we continue to examine the possible protein expression alterations of the hypothalamus as the center of the HPA axis in these three groups by using a proteomic approach. Though isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative analysis, a total of 593 dysregulated proteins were identified. These were potentially associated with vulnerability and adaptability of CMS-caused depression or anxiety and therefore might become novel investigative protein targets. Further independent analysis using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) indicated that 5, 7, and 21 dysregulated proteins were specifically associated with depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, and insusceptible groups, respectively, suggesting that the same CMS differently affected the regulation system of the rat hypothalamic proteome. In summary, the current proteomic research on the hypothalamus provided insights into the specific and common molecular basis for the HPA dysfunction mechanisms that underlie resiliency and vulnerability to stress-induced depression or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Intra-Arterial Stem Cell Transplantation in Experimental Stroke in Rats: Real-Time MR Visualization of Transplanted Cells Starting With Their First Pass Through the Brain With Regard to the Therapeutic Action</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cell therapy is an emerging approach to stroke treatment with a potential to limit brain damage and enhance its restoration after the acute phase of the disease. In this study we tested directly reprogrammed neural precursor cells (drNPC) derived from adult human bone marrow cells in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of acute ischemic stroke using human placenta mesenchymal stem cells (pMSC) as a positive control with previously confirmed efficacy. Cells were infused into the ipsilateral (right) internal carotid artery of male Wistar rats 24 h after MCAO. The main goal of this work was to evaluate real-time distribution and subsequent homing of transplanted cells in the brain. This was achieved by performing intra-arterial infusion directly inside the MRI scanner and allowed transplanted cells tracing starting from their first pass through the brain vessels. Immediately after transplantation, cells were observed in the periphery of the infarct zone and in the brain stem, 15 min later small numbers of cells could be discovered deep in the infarct core and in the contralateral hemisphere, where drNPC were seen earlier and in greater numbers than pMSC. Transplanted cells in both groups could no longer be detected in the rat brain 48–72 h after infusion. Histological and histochemical analysis demonstrated that both the drNPC and pMSC were localized inside blood vessels in close contact with the vascular wall. No passage of labeled cells through the blood brain barrier was observed. Additionally, the therapeutic effects of drNPC and pMSC were compared. Both drNPC and pMSC induced substantial attenuation of neurological deficits evaluated at the 7th and 14th day after transplantation using the modified neurological severity score (mNSS). Some of the effects of drNPC and pMSC, such as the influence on the infarct volume and the survival rate of animals, differed. The results suggest a paracrine mechanism of the positive therapeutic effects of IA drNPC and pMSC infusion, potentially enhanced by the cell-cell interactions. Our data also indicate that the long-term homing of transplanted cells in the brain is not necessary for the brain’s functional recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Deep-Learning-Based Multivariate Pattern Analysis (dMVPA): A Tutorial and a Toolbox</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.638052</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has been hugely beneficial for cognitive neuroscience by making new experiment designs possible and by increasing the inferential power of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and other neuroimaging methodologies. In a similar time frame, “deep learning” (a term for the use of artificial neural networks with convolutional, recurrent, or similarly sophisticated architectures) has produced a parallel revolution in the field of machine learning and has been employed across a wide variety of applications. Traditional MVPA also uses a form of machine learning, but most commonly with much simpler techniques based on linear calculations; a number of studies have applied deep learning techniques to neuroimaging data, but we believe that those have barely scratched the surface of the potential deep learning holds for the field. In this paper, we provide a brief introduction to deep learning for those new to the technique, explore the logistical pros and cons of using deep learning to analyze neuroimaging data – which we term “deep MVPA,” or dMVPA – and introduce a new software toolbox (the “Deep Learning In Neuroimaging: Exploration, Analysis, Tools, and Education” package, DeLINEATE for short) intended to facilitate dMVPA for neuroscientists (and indeed, scientists more broadly) everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Theory of Mind and Its Elusive Structural Substrate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.618630</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Is brain structure related to function? Can one predict the other? These are questions that are still waiting to be answered definitively. In this paper we seek to investigate these questions, in particular, we are interested in the relation between brain structure and theory of mind (ToM). ToM is defined as the ability to attribute mental states to others. Previous studies have observed correlations between performance on ToM tasks, and gray-matter size/volume in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and precuneus (PCu). Despite these findings, there are concerns about false positive results and replicability issues. In this study we used two different tasks to evaluate ToM, Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), and the Short Story Task (SST). Performance in these tasks was correlated to brain anatomy measures including voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and cortical thickness (CT) analysis, from ninety-one neurotypical participants. High-resolution structural brain images were acquired, and whole-brain and region of interest (ROI) analyses were implemented. The analyses did not show statistically significant associations between ToM performance and brain structural measures after correction. Significant associations between performance on ToM tests and a widespread array of regions loosely associated with ToM were observed only for whole brain uncorrected analysis (p &amp;lt; 0.001). These results do not replicate a previous study with neurotypical participants. We tested two different ToM tests, two different softwares for VBM and CT, and we used two samples, one with 91 and a sub-sample with 69 participants. Neither of these conditions made a difference in the results obtained. Consequently, these results suggest that if the population is neurotypical and homogenous, it is unlikely that a reliable association between brain anatomy measures and ToM performance, as measured with these tasks, may be found.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Direct electrical stimulation (DES) has been widely applied in both guidance of lesion resection and scientific research; however, the design and selection of intraoperative cognitive mapping tasks have not been updated in a very long time. We introduce updated mapping tasks for language and non-language functions and provide recommendations for optimal design and selection of intraoperative mapping tasks. In addition, with DES becoming more critical in current neuroscientific research, a task design that has not been widely used in DES yet (subtraction and conjunction paradigms) was introduced for more delicate mapping of brain functions especially for research purposes. We also illustrate the importance of designing a common task series for DES and other non-invasive mapping techniques. This review gives practical updated guidelines for advanced application of DES in clinical and neuroscientific research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The globus pallidus externa (GPe) functions as a central hub in the basal ganglia for processing motor and non-motor information through the creation of complex connections with the other basal ganglia nuclei and brain regions. Recently, with the adoption of sophisticated genetic tools, substantial advances have been made in understanding the distinct molecular, anatomical, electrophysiological, and functional properties of GPe neurons and non-neuronal cells. Impairments in dopamine transmission in the basal ganglia contribute to Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common movement disorder that severely affects the patients' life quality. Altered GPe neuron activity and synaptic connections have also been found in both PD patients and pre-clinical models. In this review, we will summarize the main findings on the composition, connectivity and functionality of different GPe cell populations and the potential GPe-related mechanisms of PD symptoms to better understand the cell type and circuit-specific roles of GPe in both normal and PD conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The past decade has seen growing support for the critical brain hypothesis, i.e., the possibility that the brain could operate at or very near a critical state between two different dynamical regimes. Such critical states are well-studied in different disciplines, therefore there is potential for a continued transfer of knowledge. Here, I revisit foundations of bifurcation theory, the mathematical theory of transitions. While the mathematics is well-known it's transfer to neural dynamics leads to new insights and hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Synaptic and Axon Degeneration in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.626128</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.626128</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that impairs movement as well as causing multiple other symptoms such as autonomic dysfunction, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, hyposmia, and cognitive changes. Loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and loss of dopamine terminals in the striatum contribute to characteristic motor features. Although therapies ease the symptoms of PD, there are no treatments to slow its progression. Accumulating evidence suggests that synaptic impairments and axonal degeneration precede neuronal cell body loss. Early synaptic changes may be a target to prevent disease onset and slow progression. Imaging of PD patients with radioligands, post-mortem pathologic studies in sporadic PD patients, and animal models of PD demonstrate abnormalities in presynaptic terminals as well as postsynaptic dendritic spines. Dopaminergic and excitatory synapses are substantially reduced in PD, and whether other neuronal subtypes show synaptic defects remains relatively unexplored. Genetic studies implicate several genes that play a role at the synapse, providing additional support for synaptic dysfunction in PD. In this review article we: (1) provide evidence for synaptic defects occurring in PD before neuron death; (2) describe the main genes implicated in PD that could contribute to synapse dysfunction; and (3) show correlations between the expression of Snca mRNA and mouse homologs of PD GWAS genes demonstrating selective enrichment of Snca and synaptic genes in dopaminergic, excitatory and cholinergic neurons. Altogether, these findings highlight the need for novel therapeutics targeting the synapse and suggest that future studies should explore the roles for PD-implicated genes across multiple neuron types and circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: The Anatomical Distribution of Mechanoreceptors in Mouse Hind Paw Skin and the Influence of Integrin α1β1 on Meissner-Like Corpuscle Density in the Footpads</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.628711</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Afferent neurons and their mechanoreceptors provide critical sensory feedback for gait. The anatomical distribution and density of afferents and mechanoreceptors influence sensory feedback, as does mechanoreceptor function. Electrophysiological studies of hind paw skin reveal the different types of afferent responses and their receptive fields, however, the anatomical distribution of mechanoreceptor endings is unknown. Also, the role of integrin α1β1 in mechanoreceptor function is unclear, though it is expressed by keratinocytes in the stratum basale where it is likely involved in a variety of mechanotransduction pathways and ion channel functionalities. For example, it has been shown that integrin α1β1 is necessary for the function of TRPV4 that is highly expressed by afferent units. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine and compare the distribution of mechanoreceptors across the hind paw skin and the footfall patterns of itga1-null and wild type mice. The itga1-null mouse is lacking the integrin α1 subunit, which binds exclusively to the β1 subunit, thus rendering integrin α1β1 nonfunctional while leaving the numerous other pairings of the β1 subunit undisturbed. Intact hind paws were processed, serially sectioned, and stained to visualize mechanoreceptors. Footfall patterns were analyzed as a first step in correlating mechanoreceptor distribution and functionality. Merkel cells and Meissner-like corpuscles were present, however, Ruffini endings and Pacinian corpuscles were not observed. Meissner-like corpuscles were located exclusively in the glabrous skin of the footpads and digit tips, however, Merkel cells were found throughout hairy and glabrous skin. The increased density of Merkel cells and Meissner-like corpuscles in footpads 1 and 3 and Meissner-like corpuscles in footpad 4 suggests their role in anteroposterior balance, while Meissner-like corpuscle concentrations in digits 2 and 5 support their role in mediolateral balance. Finally, a larger density of Meissner-like corpuscles in footpads 3 and 4 in male itga1-null mice compared to wild type controls paves the way for future site-specific single fiber in vivo recordings to provide insight into the role of integrin α1β1 in tactile mechanotransduction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;b&gt;Background:&lt;/b&gt; Recently, loss-of-function variants in &lt;i&gt;TLR7 &lt;/i&gt;were identified in two families in which COVID-19 segregates like an X-linked recessive disorder environmentally conditioned by SARS-CoV-2. We investigated whether the two families represent the tip of the iceberg of a subset of COVID-19 male patients.</description>

	<title>eLife: Archaeal chromatin 'slinkies' are inherently dynamic complexes with deflected DNA wrapping pathways</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65587</link>
	<description>Eukaryotes and many archaea package their DNA with histones. While the four eukaryotic histones wrap ~147 DNA base pairs into nucleosomes, archaeal histones form 'nucleosome-like' complexes that continuously wind between 60 - 500 base pairs of DNA ('archaeasomes'), suggested by crystal contacts and analysis of cellular chromatin. Solution structures of large archaeasomes (&amp;gt;90 DNA base pairs) have never been directly observed. Here, we utilize molecular dynamics simulations, analytical ultracentrifugation, and cryoEM to structurally characterize the solution state of archaeasomes on longer DNA. Simulations reveal dynamics of increased accessibility without disruption of DNA-binding or tetramerization interfaces. Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+ &lt;/sup&gt;concentration influences compaction, and cryoEM densities illustrate that DNA is wrapped in consecutive substates arranged 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; out-of-plane with one another. Without ATP-dependent remodelers, archaea may leverage these inherent dynamics to balance chromatin packing and accessibility.</description>

	<title>eLife: Ciliary neuropeptidergic signaling dynamically regulates excitatory synapses in postnatal neocortical pyramidal neurons</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65427</link>
	<description>Primary cilia are compartmentalized sensory organelles present on the majority of neurons in the mammalian brain throughout adulthood. Recent evidence suggests that cilia regulate multiple aspects of neuronal development, including the maintenance of neuronal connectivity. However, whether ciliary signals can dynamically modulate postnatal circuit excitability is unknown. Here we show that acute cell-autonomous knockdown of ciliary signaling rapidly strengthens glutamatergic inputs onto cultured rat neocortical pyramidal neurons, and increases spontaneous firing. This increased excitability occurs without changes to passive neuronal properties or intrinsic excitability. Further, the neuropeptide receptor somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) is localized nearly exclusively to excitatory neuron cilia both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and in culture, and pharmacological manipulation of SSTR3 signaling bidirectionally modulates excitatory synaptic inputs onto these neurons. Our results indicate that ciliary neuropeptidergic signaling dynamically modulates excitatory synapses, and suggest that defects in this regulation may underlie a subset of behavioral and cognitive disorders associated with ciliopathies.</description>

	<description>Numerous aspects of early hominin biology remain debated or simply unknown. However, recent developments in high-resolution imaging techniques have opened new avenues in the field of paleoanthropology. More specifically, X-ray synchrotron-based analytical imaging techniques have the potential to provide crucial details on the ontogeny, physiology, biomechanics, and biological identity of fossil specimens. Here we present preliminary results of our X-ray synchrotron-based investigation of the skull of the 3.67-million-year-old &lt;i&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/i&gt; specimen StW 573 (‘Little Foot’) at the I12 beamline of the Diamond Light Source (United Kingdom). Besides showing fine details of the enamel (i.e., hypoplasias) and cementum (i.e., incremental lines), as well as of the cranial bone microarchitecture (e.g., diploic channels), our synchrotron-based investigation reveals for the first time the 3D spatial organization of the Haversian systems in the mandibular symphysis of an early hominin.</description>

	<title>eLife: Endoglycan plays a role in axon guidance by modulating cell adhesion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.64767</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64767</link>
	<description>Axon navigation depends on the interactions between guidance molecules along the trajectory and specific receptors on the growth cone. However, our in vitro and in vivo studies on the role of Endoglycan demonstrate that in addition to specific guidance cue – receptor interactions, axon guidance depends on fine-tuning of cell-cell adhesion. Endoglycan, a sialomucin, plays a role in axon guidance in the central nervous system of chicken embryos, but it is neither an axon guidance cue nor a receptor. Rather Endoglycan acts as a negative regulator of molecular interactions based on evidence from &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments demonstrating reduced adhesion of growth cones . In the absence of Endoglycan, commissural axons fail to properly navigate the midline of the spinal cord. Taken together, our &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; results support the hypothesis that Endoglycan acts as a negative regulator of cell-cell adhesion, in commissural axon guidance.</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.64618</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64618</link>
	<description>COVID-19 poses a major challenge to care homes, as SARS-CoV-2 is readily transmitted and causes disproportionately severe disease in older people. Here, 1,167 residents from 337 care homes were identified from a dataset of 6,600 COVID-19 cases from the East of England. Older age and being a care home resident were associated with increased mortality. SARS-CoV-2 genomes were available for 700 residents from 292 care homes. By integrating genomic and temporal data, 409 viral clusters within the 292 homes were identified, indicating two different patterns - outbreaks among care home residents and independent introductions with limited onward transmission. Approximately 70% of residents in the genomic analysis were admitted to hospital during the study, providing extensive opportunities for transmission between care homes and hospitals. Limiting viral transmission within care homes should be a key target for infection control to reduce COVID-19 mortality in this population.</description>

	<title>eLife: In vivo reconstitution finds multivalent RNA-RNA interactions as drivers of mesh-like condensates</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64252</link>
	<description>Liquid-like condensates have been thought to be sphere-like. Recently, various condensates with filamentous morphology have been observed in cells. One such condensate is the TIS granule network that shares a large surface area with the rough endoplasmic reticulum and is important for membrane protein trafficking. It has been unclear how condensates with mesh-like shapes, but dynamic protein components are formed. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; reconstitution experiments revealed that the minimal components are a multivalent RNA-binding protein that concentrates RNAs that are able to form extensive intermolecular mRNA-mRNA interactions. mRNAs with large unstructured regions have a high propensity to form a pervasive intermolecular interaction network that acts as condensate skeleton. The underlying RNA matrix prevents full fusion of spherical liquid-like condensates, thus driving the formation of irregularly shaped membraneless organelles. The resulting large surface area may promote interactions at the condensate surface and at the interface with other organelles.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63591</link>
	<description>The inferior parietal lobe (IPL) is a key neural substrate underlying diverse mental processes, from basic attention to language and social cognition, that define human interactions. Its putative domain-global role appears to tie into poorly understood differences between cognitive domains in both hemispheres. Across attentional, semantic, and social cognitive tasks, our study explored functional specialization within the IPL. The task specificity of IPL subregion activity was substantiated by distinct predictive signatures identified by multivariate pattern-learning algorithms. Moreover, the left and right IPL exerted domain-specific modulation of effective connectivity among their subregions. Task-evoked functional interactions of the anterior and posterior IPL subregions involved recruitment of distributed cortical partners. While anterior IPL subregions were engaged in strongly lateralized coupling links, both posterior subregions showed more symmetric coupling patterns across hemispheres. Our collective results shed light on how under-appreciated functional specialization in the IPL supports some of the most distinctive human mental capacities.</description>

	<description>Can replication and translation emerge in a single mechanism via self-assembly? The key molecule, transfer RNA (tRNA), is one of the most ancient molecules and contains the genetic code. Our experiments show how a pool of oligonucleotides, adapted with minor mutations from tRNA, spontaneously formed molecular assemblies and replicated information autonomously using only reversible hybridization under thermal oscillations. The pool of cross-complementary hairpins self-selected by agglomeration and sedimentation. The metastable DNA hairpins bound to a template and then interconnected by hybridization. Thermal oscillations separated replicates from their templates and drove an exponential, cross-catalytic replication. The molecular assembly could encode and replicate binary sequences with a replication fidelity corresponding to 85–90 % per nucleotide. The replication by a self-assembly of tRNA-like sequences suggests that early forms of tRNA could have been involved in molecular replication. This would link the evolution of translation to a mechanism of molecular replication.</description>

	<description>Microdosing is the practice of regularly using low doses of psychedelic drugs. Anecdotal reports suggest that microdosing enhances well-being and cognition; however, such accounts are potentially biased by the placebo effect. This study used a ‘self-blinding’ citizen science initiative, where participants were given online instructions on how to incorporate placebo control into their microdosing routine without clinical supervision. The study was completed by 191 participants, making it the largest placebo-controlled trial on psychedelics to-date. All psychological outcomes improved significantly from baseline to after the 4 weeks long dose period for the microdose group; however, the placebo group also improved and no significant between-groups differences were observed. Acute (emotional state, drug intensity, mood, energy, and creativity) and post-acute (anxiety) scales showed small, but significant microdose vs. placebo differences; however, these results can be explained by participants breaking blind. The findings suggest that anecdotal benefits of microdosing can be explained by the placebo effect.</description>

	<description>Falciparum malaria is clinically heterogeneous and the relative contribution of parasite and host in shaping disease severity remains unclear. We explored the interaction between inflammation and parasite variant surface antigen (VSA) expression, asking whether this relationship underpins the variation observed in controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). We uncovered marked heterogeneity in the host response to blood challenge; some volunteers remained quiescent, others triggered interferon-stimulated inflammation and some showed transcriptional evidence of myeloid cell suppression. Significantly, only inflammatory volunteers experienced hallmark symptoms of malaria. When we tracked temporal changes in parasite VSA expression to ask whether variants associated with severe disease rapidly expand in naive hosts, we found no transcriptional evidence to support this hypothesis. These data indicate that parasite variants that dominate severe malaria do not have an intrinsic growth or survival advantage; instead, they presumably rely upon infection-induced changes in their within-host environment for selection.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61241</link>
	<description>Adverse early-life exposures have a lasting negative impact on health. Neonatal hyperoxia that is a risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia confers susceptibility to influenza A virus (IAV) infection later in life. Given our previous findings that the circadian clock protects against IAV, we asked if the long-term impact of neonatal hyperoxia vis-à-vis IAV infection includes circadian disruption. Here, we show that neonatal hyperoxia abolishes the clock-mediated time of day protection from IAV in mice, independent of viral burden through host tolerance pathways. We discovered that the lung intrinsic clock (and not the central or immune clocks) mediated this dysregulation. Loss of circadian protein, &lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt;, in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells recapitulates the increased mortality, loss of temporal gating, and other key features of hyperoxia-exposed animals. Our data suggest a novel role for the circadian clock in AT2 cells in mediating long-term effects of early-life exposures to the lungs.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57244</link>
	<description>Coordinating among the demands of the external environment and internal plans requires cognitive control supported by a fronto-parietal control network (FPCN). Evidence suggests that multiple control systems span the FPCN whose operations are poorly understood. Previously (Nee and D'Esposito, 2016; 2017), we detailed frontal dynamics that support control processing, but left open their role in broader cortical function. Here, I show that the FPCN consists of an external/present-oriented to internal/future-oriented cortical gradient extending outwardly from sensory-motor cortices. Areas at the ends of this gradient act in a segregative manner, exciting areas at the same level, but suppressing areas at different levels. By contrast, areas in the middle of the gradient excite areas at all levels, promoting integration of control processing. Individual differences in integrative dynamics predict higher-level cognitive ability and amenability to neuromodulation. These data suggest that an intermediary zone within the FPCN underlies integrative processing that supports cognitive control.</description>

	<description>The production of blood cells (haematopoiesis) occurs in the limb bones of most tetrapods but is absent in the fin bones of ray-finned fish. When did long bones start producing blood cells? Recent hypotheses suggested that haematopoiesis migrated into long bones prior to the water-to-land transition and protected newly-produced blood cells from harsher environmental conditions. However, little fossil evidence to support these hypotheses has been provided so far. Observations of the humeral microarchitecture of stem-tetrapods, batrachians, and amniotes were performed using classical sectioning and three-dimensional synchrotron virtual histology. They show that Permian tetrapods seem to be among the first to exhibit a centralised marrow organisation, which allows haematopoiesis as in extant amniotes. Not only does our study demonstrate that long-bone haematopoiesis was probably not an exaptation to the water-to-land transition but it sheds light on the early evolution of limb-bone development and the sequence of bone-marrow functional acquisitions.</description>

	<description>We present BonZeb - a suite of modular Bonsai packages which allow high-resolution zebrafish tracking with dynamic visual feedback. Bonsai is an increasingly popular software platform that is accelerating the standardization of experimental protocols within the neurosciences due to its speed, flexibility, and minimal programming overhead. BonZeb can be implemented into novel and existing Bonsai workflows for online behavioral tracking and offline tracking with batch processing. We demonstrate that BonZeb can run a variety of experimental configurations used for gaining insights into the neural mechanisms of zebrafish behavior. BonZeb supports head-fixed closed-loop and free-swimming virtual open-loop assays as well as multi-animal tracking, optogenetic stimulation, and calcium imaging during behavior. The combined performance, ease of use and versatility of BonZeb opens new experimental avenues for researchers seeking high-resolution behavioral tracking of larval zebrafish.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: No balance between glutamate+glutamine and GABA+ in visual and motor cortices of the human brain</title>

	<description>Theoretical work, supported by electrophysiological evidence, asserts that a balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) is critical for healthy brain function. In magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies, the ratio of excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory ({gamma}-aminobutyric acid, GABA) neurotransmitters is often used as a proxy for this E/I balance. Recent MRS work found a positive correlation between GABA+ and Glx (glutamate+glutamine) in medial parietal cortex, providing validation for this proxy and supporting the link between the E/I balance observed in electrophysiology and that detected with MRS. Here we assess the same relationship, between GABA+ and Glx, in primary visual and motor cortices of resting male and female human participants. We find moderate to strong evidence that there is no positive correlation between these neurotransmitters in either location. We show this holds true when controlling for a range of other factors (i.e., demographics, signal quality, tissue composition, other neurochemicals) and regardless of the state of neural activity (i.e., resting/active). These results show that there is no brain-wide balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters and indicates a dissociation between the E/I balance observed in electrophysiological work and the ratio of MRS-detected neurotransmitters.</description>

	<description>The complex 16p11.2 Deletion Syndrome (16pdel) is accompanied by neurological disorders, including epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. We demonstrate that 16pdel iPSC differentiated neurons showed augmented local field potential activity and altered ceramide-related lipid species relative to unaffected. FAM57B, a poorly characterized gene in the 16p11.2 interval, has emerged as a candidate tied to symptomatology. We found that FAM57B modulates ceramide synthase (CerS) activity, but is not a CerS per se. In FAM57B mutant human neuronal cells and zebrafish brain, composition and levels of sphingolipids and glycerolipids associated with cellular membranes are disrupted. Consistently, we observed aberrant plasma membrane architecture and synaptic protein mislocalization, which were accompanied by depressed brain and behavioral activity. Together, these results suggest that haploinsufficiency of FAM57B contributes to changes in neuronal activity and function in 16pdel Syndrome, through a crucial role for the gene in lipid metabolism.</description>

	<description>Neural communication or signal transmission in the brain propagates via distinct oscillatory frequency bands. With aging, the communication mediated by these frequency bands is hindered by noise, which arises from the increased stochastic variability in the baseline neural spiking. This increase in noise measured as 1/f power-law scaling reflects the global background noise and is often linked to impaired cognition in different tasks. In this study, we quantify the 1/f slope and intercept of MEG brain signal as a putative marker of neural noise and examined its effect on cognitive and metacognitive measures. We hypothesize that as neural communication becomes noisier with age, it impacts global information processing, whereas specific periodic features mediate local aspects of cognition. Using the recently proposed parametric Fooof model, we first characterized the normative pattern of periodic and aperiodic features (temporal dynamics) across the lifespan, modeled via spectral peaks (Central frequency, power, bandwidth) and 1/f noise activity (slope and intercept) respectively. Secondly, how this Resting-State (RS) baseline shift in temporal dynamics of the signal is associated with various aspects of visual short-term memory (VSTM). Our results suggest that age-associated global change in noisy baseline affects global information processing and crucially impacts the oscillatory features, which relates to more local processing and selective behavioral measures in the VSTM task. Moreover, we suggest that the task-related differences observed across age groups are due to the baseline shift of periodic and aperiodic features.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Leveraging joint mechanics simplifies the neural control of movement</title>

	<description>Behaviors we perform every day, such as manipulating an object or walking, require precise control of interaction forces between our bodies and the environment. These forces are generated by active muscle contractions, specified by the nervous system, and by joint mechanics, determined by the intrinsic properties of the musculoskeletal system. Depending on behavioral goals, joint mechanics might simplify or complicate control of movement by the nervous system. However, whether humans can exploit joint mechanics to simplify neural control remains unclear. Here we evaluated if leveraging joint mechanics can simplify neural control by comparing performance in three tasks that required subjects to generate specified torques about the ankle during imposed sinusoidal movements; only one task required torques that could be generated by leveraging the intrinsic mechanics of the joint. We developed a novel approach that used continuous estimates of impedance, a quantitative description of joint mechanics, and measures of muscle activity to determine the mechanical and neural contributions to the net ankle torque generated in each motor task. We found that the torque resulting from changes in neural control was reduced when ankle impedance was consistent with the task being performed, resulting in a task that required less muscular effort. Subjects perceived this task to be easier than those that were not consistent with the impedance of the ankle and were able to perform it with the highest level of consistency. These results demonstrate that leveraging the mechanical properties of a joint can simplify task completion and improve performance.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Multitaper estimates of phase-amplitude coupling</title>

	<description>Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is the association of the amplitude of a high-frequency oscillation with the phase of a low-frequency oscillation. In neuroscience, this relationship provides a mechanism by which neural activity might be coordinated between distant regions. The dangers and pitfalls of assessing phase-amplitude coupling with existing statistical measures have been well-documented. The limitations of these measures include: (i) response to non-oscillatory, high-frequency, broad-band activity, (ii) response to high-frequency components of the low-frequency oscillation, (iii) adhoc selection of analysis frequency-intervals, and (iv) reliance upon data shuffling to assess statistical significance. In this work, a multitaper phase-amplitude coupling estimator is proposed that addresses issues (i)-(iv) above. Specifically, issue (i) is addressed by replacing the analytic signal envelope estimator computed using the Hilbert transform with a multitaper estimator that down-weights non-sinusoidal activity using a classical, multitaper super-resolution technique. Issue (ii) is addressed by replacing coherence between the low-frequency and high-frequency components in a standard PAC estimator with multitaper partial coherence, while issue (iii) is addressed with a physical argument regarding meaningful neural oscillation. Finally, asymptotic statistical assessment of the multitaper estimator is introduced to address issue (iv).</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The impact of real-time fMRI denoising on online evaluation of brain activity and functional connectivity</title>

	<description>Objective: Comprehensive denoising is imperative in fMRI analysis to reliably evaluate neural activity from the blood oxygenation level dependent signal. In real-time fMRI, however, only a minimal denoising process has been applied and the impact of insufficient denoising on online brain activity estimation has not been assessed comprehensively. This study evaluated the noise reduction performance of online fMRI processes in a real-time estimation of regional brain activity and functional connectivity. Approach: We performed a series of real-time processing simulations of online fMRI processing, including slice-timing correction, motion correction, spatial smoothing, signal scaling, and noise regression with high-pass filtering, motion parameters, motion derivatives, global signal, white matter/ventricle average signals, and physiological noise models with image-based retrospective correction of physiological motion effects (RETROICOR) and respiration volume per time (RVT). Main results: All the processing was completed in less than 400 ms for whole-brain voxels. Most processing had a benefit for noise reduction except for RVT that did not work due to the limitation of the online peak detection. The global signal regression, white matter/ventricle signal regression, and RETORICOR had a distinctive noise reduction effect, depending on the target signal, and could not substitute for each other. Global signal regression could eliminate the noise-associated bias in the mean dynamic functional connectivity across time. Significance: The results indicate that extensive real-time denoising is possible and highly recommended for real-time fMRI applications.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Daily changes in neuronal activities of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus under standard and short-term high fat diet - implications for circadian modulation of parasympathetic outflow</title>

	<description>The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus functions as the brain's primary circadian clock, but circadian clock genes are also rhythmically expressed in several extra-SCN brain sites where they can exert local temporal control over physiology and behaviour. Recently, we found that the hindbrain dorsal vagal complex possesses strong daily timekeeping capabilities, with the area postrema and nucleus of the solitary tract exhibiting the most robust clock properties. The possibility that the executory part of this complex - the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV), also exhibits daily changes has not been extensively studied. The DMV is the source of vagal efferent motoneurons largely responsible for the regulation of gastric motility and emptying and consequently influence meal size and energy homeostasis. We used a combination of multi-channel electrophysiology and patch clamp recordings to gain insight into possible daily variation in these DMV cells and how this is influenced by diet. We found that DMV neurons increase their spontaneous activity, excitability and responsiveness to metabolic neuromodulators at late day which was paralleled with an enhanced synaptic input to these neurons. A high-fat diet typically damps circadian rhythms, but we found that short-term exposure to a high-fat diet paradoxically amplified daily variation of DMV neuronal activity, while blunting their responsiveness to metabolic neuromodulators. In summary, we show for the first time that neural activity at a source of vagal efferents varies with time of day and that this temporal variation is modulated by diet. These findings have clear implications for our understanding of the daily control of parasympathetic outflow.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Rhythmic neuronal activities of the rat nucleus of the solitary tract are impaired by short-term high fat diet - implications for daily control of satiety by the brainstem</title>

	<description>Temporal partitioning of daily food intake is crucial for survival and involves the integration of internal circadian states and external influences such as the light-dark cycle and the composition of diet. These intrinsic and extrinsic factors are interdependent with misalignment of circadian rhythms promoting body weight gain, while consumption of a calorie dense diet elevates the risk of obesity and blunts circadian rhythms. Since cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, and cancer are comorbid with obesity, understanding the relationships between brain activity and diet is of pivotal importance. Recently, we defined for the first time the circadian properties of the dorsal vagal complex of the brainstem, a structure implicated in the control of food intake and autonomic tone, but if and how 24 h rhythms in this area are influenced by diet remains unresolved. Here we focused on a key structure of this complex, the nucleus of the solitary tract, and using a range of approaches, we interrogated how its neuronal and cellular rhythms are affected by high-fat diet. We report that short term consumption of this diet increases food intake during the day and blunts daily rhythms in gene expression and neuronal discharge in the nucleus of the solitary tract. These alterations in this structure occur without prominent body weight gain, suggesting that high-fat diet acts initially to reduce activity in the nucleus of the solitary tract, thereby disinhibiting mechanisms that suppress daytime feeding.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Distinct forms of synaptic plasticity during ascending vs. descending control of medial olivocochlear efferent neurons</title>

	<description>Activity in each brain region is shaped by the convergence of ascending and descending axonal pathways, and the balance and characteristics of these determine neural output. The medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system is part of a reflex arc that critically controls auditory sensitivity. Multiple central pathways contact MOC neurons, raising the question of how a reflex arc could be engaged by diverse inputs. We examined functional properties of synapses onto brainstem MOC neurons from ascending (ventral cochlear nucleus, VCN), and descending (inferior colliculus, IC) sources in mice using an optogenetic approach. We found that these pathways exhibited opposing forms of short-term plasticity, with VCN input showing depression and IC input showing marked facilitation. By using a conductance clamp approach, we found that combinations of facilitating and depressing inputs enabled firing of MOC neurons over a surprisingly wide dynamic range, suggesting an essential role for descending signaling to a brainstem nucleus.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Prostaglandin analog effects on cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption via nasal mucosa</title>

	<description>Introduction Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow has been demonstrated along nasal lymphatics via olfactory nerve projections; flow may be increased by stimulating lymphatic contractility using agents such as noradrenaline and the thromboxane A2 analog U46619. Lymphatics elsewhere in the body show increased contractility upon exposure to the prostaglandin F2alpha analog isoprostane-8-epi-prostaglandin. We investigated the ability of ophthalmic prostaglandin F2alpha analogs to increase CSF outflow when applied to the nasal mucosa by inhalation. Methods Latanoprost (0.1, 0.5, or 1mg/ml), bimatoprost (0.3 or 3mg/ml), travoprost (0.04 or 0.4mg/ml), latanoprostene bunod (0.24 or 2.4mg/ml), tafluprost (0.25 or 2.5mg/ml), or vehicle (10% DMSO) was administered to awake adult C57B/6 mice by nasal inhalation of 2{micro}l droplets. A total of 67 animals were studied including controls. General anesthesia was induced by injection, and fluorescent tracer (AlexaFluor647-labelled ovalbumin) was injected under stereotaxic guidance into the right lateral ventricle. Nasal turbinate tissue was harvested and homogenized after 1 hour for tracer detection by ELISA and fluorometric analysis. Results Inhalation of latanoprost 0.5mg/ml and 1mg/ml led to a 11.5-fold increase in tracer recovery from nasal turbinate tissues compared to controls (3312 pg/ml vs 288 pg/ml, p&amp;lt;0.001 for 0.5mg/ml; 3355 pg/ml vs 288 pg/ml, p&amp;lt;0.001 for 1mg/ml), while latanoprost 0.1 mg/ml enhanced recovery 6-fold (1713 pg/ml vs 288 pg/ml, p&amp;lt;0.01). Tafluprost 0.25mg/ml and bimatoprost 0.3mg/ml showed a modest (1.4x, p&amp;lt;0.05) effect, and the remaining agents showed no significant effect on tracer recovery. Conclusions Prostaglandin F2alpha analogs delivered by nasal inhalation resulted in increased nasal recovery of a CSF fluorescent tracer, implying increased CSF outflow via the nasal lymphatics. The greatest effect, partially dose-dependent, was observed using latanoprost. Further studies are needed to determine the efficacy of these agents in reducing ICP in short and long-term applications.</description>

	<description>The receptor type protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPRD is implicated in maturation of synapses of expressing neurons, vulnerability to addictions, reward from addictive substances, vulnerability to restless leg syndrome and densities of neurofibrillary pathology in Alzheimers disease brains by a variety of evidence. However, PTPRDs physiological substrates and adaptations to differences in levels of PTPRD expression in brains of young and aging animals have not been explored in depth. We report phosphoproteomic studies of brains of young and aged mice with different levels of PTPRD expression, gene ontology studies of genes identified in this way and validation of several candidate PTPRD substrates with in vitro assays using recombinant PTPRD phosphatase. PTPRD is well positioned to modulate the extent of phosphorylation of phosphotyrosine phosphoprotein substrates, including those involved in synaptic maturation and adaptation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Slow rTMS to the left DLPFC enhances verbal memory formation</title>

	<description>Encoding of episodic memories relies on stimulus-specific information processing and involves the left prefrontal cortex. We here present an incidental finding from a simultaneous EEG-TMS experiment as well as a replication of this unexpected effect. Our results reveal that stimulating the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with slow repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) leads to enhanced word memory performance. 40 healthy human participants engaged in a list learning paradigm. Half of the subjects (N=20) received 1 Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC while the other half (N=20) received 1 Hz rTMS to the vertex and served as a control group. Subjects receiving left DLPFC stimulation demonstrated enhanced memory performance compared to the control group. This effect was replicated in a double-blind within-subjects experiment where 24 participants received 1 Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC and vertex. In this second experiment, DLPFC stimulation also induced better memory performance compared to vertex stimulation. In addition to these behavioural effects, we found that 1 Hz rTMS to DLPFC induced stronger beta power modulation in posterior areas, a state which is known to be beneficial for memory encoding. Further analysis indicated, that beta modulations did not have an oscillatory origin. Instead, the observed beta modulations were a result of a spectral tilt, suggesting inhibition of these parietal regions. These results show that applying 1 Hz rTMS to DLPFC, an area involved in episodic memory formation, improves memory performance via modulating neural activity in parietal regions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Transient beta activity and connectivity during sustained motor behaviour</title>

	<description>Neural oscillations are thought to play a central role in orchestrating activity states between distant neural populations. In humans, long-range neural connectivity has been particularly well characterised for 13-30 Hz beta activity which becomes phase coupled between the motor cortex and the contralateral muscle during isometric contraction. Based on this and related observations, beta activity and connectivity have been linked to sustaining stable cognitive and motor states, or the &quot;status quo&quot;, in the brain. Recently, however, beta activity has been shown to be short-lived, as opposed to sustained, though so far this has been reported for regional beta activity in tasks without sustained motor demands. Here, we measured magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electromyography (EMG) in 18 human participants performing an isometric-contraction (gripping) task designed to yield sustained behavioural output. If cortico-muscular beta connectivity is directly responsible for sustaining a stable motor state, then beta activity should be (or become) sustained in this context. In contrast, we found that beta activity and connectivity with the downstream muscle were transient, even when participants engaged in sustained gripping. Moreover, we found that sustained motor requirements did not prolong beta-event duration in comparison to rest. These findings suggest that long-range neural synchronisation may entail short &quot;bursts&quot; of frequency-specific connectivity, even when task demands, and behaviour, are sustained.</description>

	<description>Manual selection of targets in experimental or diagnostic samples by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), based on single overview and detail micrographs, has been time-consuming and susceptible to bias. Substantial information and throughput gain may now be achieved by automated acquisition of virtually all structures in a given EM section. Resulting datasets allow convenient pan-and-zoom examination of tissue ultrastructure with preserved microanatomical orientation. The technique is, however, critically sensitive to artifacts in sample preparation. We therefore established a methodology to prepare large-scale digitization samples (LDS) designed to acquire entire sections free of obscuring flaws. For evaluation, we highlight the supreme performance of scanning EM in transmission mode compared to other EM technology. The use of LDS will substantially facilitate access to EM data for a broad range of applications.</description>

	<description>A collection of longitudinal serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urine samples were collected from a cohort of 50 patients undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repairs (TEVAR). Samples were taken multiple time per day out to 5 days post operation and were probed with novel electrochemiluminescent assays specific for the phosphorylated axonal form of the major neurofilament subunit NF-H (pNF-H) and for ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 1 (UCHL1). Control blood samples showed small signals for pNF-H and in some cases rather larger signals for UCHL1. The presence of UCHL1 in these control blood samples was convincingly verified by western blotting with multiple well characterized UCHL1 antibodies and by mass spectroscopy. Elevated levels of both pNF-H and UCHL1 in blood and CSF in recovering TEVAR patients were associated with poorer outcomes. In particular release of UCHL1 into blood over several hours following TEVAR and peaking at any time over 1 ng/ml was a very strong predictor of patient death and was associated with renal failure and spinal cord ischemia (SCI). An unexpected finding was that high levels of UCHL1 were detected in certain urine samples, again in association with SCI, renal failure and poor patient outcome. We also present epitope mapping data on the UCHL1 monoclonal antibodies used including data on the widely used commercially available MCA-BH7. These studies suggest that measurement of the levels of both proteins in the blood, CSF and urine of TEVAR patients may be of clinical utility. However this study also raises questions about the origin and significance of UCHL1 both in control blood, in patient blood samples and in urine.</description>

	<description>Diffusion MRI (dMRI) has become an invaluable tool to assess the microstructural organization of brain tissue. Depending on the specific acquisition settings, the dMRI signal encodes specific properties of the underlying diffusion process. In the last two decades, several signal representations have been proposed to fit the dMRI signal and decode such properties. Most methods, however, are tested and developed on a limited amount of data, and their applicability to other acquisition schemes remains unknown. With this work, we aimed to shed light on the generalizability of existing dMRI signal representations to different diffusion encoding parameters and brain tissue types. To this end, we organized a community challenge - named MEMENTO, making available the same datasets for fair comparisons across algorithms and techniques. We considered two state-of-the-art diffusion datasets, including single-diffusion-encoding (SDE) spin-echo data from a human brain with over 3820 unique diffusion weightings (the MASSIVE dataset), and double (oscillating) diffusion encoding data (DDE/DODE) of a mouse brain including over 2520 unique data points. A subset of the data sampled in 5 different voxels was openly distributed, and the challenge participants were asked to predict the remaining part of the data. After one year, eight participant teams submitted a total of 80 signal fits. For each submission, we evaluated the mean squared error, the variance of the prediction error and the Bayesian information criteria. Most predictions predicted either multi-shell SDE data (37%) or DODE data (22%), followed by cartesian SDE data (19%) and DDE (18%). Most submissions predicted the signals measured with SDE remarkably well, with the exception of low and very strong diffusion weightings. The prediction of DDE and DODE data seemed more challenging, likely because none of the submissions explicitly accounted for diffusion time and frequency. Next to the choice of the model, decisions on fit procedure and hyperparameters play a major role in the prediction performance, highlighting the importance of optimizing and reporting such choices. This work is a community effort to highlight strength and limitations of the field at representing dMRI acquired with trending encoding schemes, gaining insights into how different models generalize to different tissue types and fiber configurations over a large range of diffusion encodings.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Multi-scale hierarchical neural network models that bridge from single neurons in the primate primary visual cortex to object recognition behavior</title>

	<description>Object recognition relies on inferior temporal (IT) cortical neural population representations that are themselves computed by a hierarchical network of feedforward and recurrently connected neural population called the ventral visual stream (areas V1, V2, V4 and IT). While recent work has created some reasonably accurate image-computable hierarchical neural network models of those neural stages, those models do not yet bridge between the properties of individual neurons and the overall emergent behavior of the ventral stream. For example, current leading ventral stream models do not allow us to ask questions such as: How does the surround suppression behavior of individual V1 neurons ultimately relate to IT neural representation and to behavior?; or How would deactivation of a particular sub-population of V1 neurons specifically alter object recognition behavior? One reason we cannot yet do this is that individual V1 artificial neurons in multi-stage models have not been shown to be functionally similar with individual biological V1 neurons. Here, we took an important first step towards this direction by building and evaluating hundreds of hierarchical neural network models in how well their artificial single neurons approximate macaque primary visual cortical (V1) neurons. We found that single neurons in some models are surprisingly similar to their biological counterparts and that the distributions of single neuron properties, such as those related to orientation and spatial frequency tuning, approximately match those in macaque V1. Crucially, we also observed that hierarchical models with V1-layers that better match macaque V1 at the single neuron level are also more aligned with human object recognition behavior. These results provide the first multi-stage, multi-scale models that allow our field to ask precisely how the specific properties of individual V1 neurons relate to recognition behavior. Finally, we here show that an optimized classical neuroscientific model of V1 is still more functionally similar to primate V1 than all of the tested multi-stage models, suggesting that further model improvements are possible, and that those improvements would likely have tangible payoffs in terms of behavioral prediction accuracy and behavioral robustness.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Hypothalamic Overexpression of Neurosecretory Protein GL Leads to Obesity in Mice</title>

	<description>Introduction: The mechanisms underlying obesity are not fully understood, necessitating the creation of novel animal models for investigation of metabolic disorders from the cellular-molecular to behavioral levels of analysis. We have previously found that neurosecretory protein GL (NPGL), a newly-identified hypothalamic neuropeptide, is involved in feeding behavior and fat accumulation in rats. Given the broad availability of genetic tools in mice, the present investigation sought to establish a mouse model of NPGL-induced obesity. Methods: We overexpressed the NPGL-precursor gene (Npgl) in the hypothalamus using adeno-associated virus in C57BL/6J mice fed normal chow (NC) or a high-calorie diet (HCD). After 9 weeks of Npgl overexpression, we measured adipose tissues, muscle, and several organ masses in addition to food intake and body mass. To assess the effects of Npgl overexpression on peripheral tissues, we analyzed mRNA expression of lipid metabolism-related genes by quantitative RT-PCR. Results: Npgl overexpression increased food intake, body mass, adipose tissues and liver masses, food efficiency, and circulating insulin levels under both NC and HCD, resulting in obesity observable within 8 weeks. Furthermore, we observed fat accumulation in adipose tissues and liver. Additionally, mRNA expression of lipid metabolism-related factors was increased in white adipose tissue and the liver after Npgl overexpression. Conclusion: Taken together, the present study suggests that NPGL is an endogenous obesogenic factor that acts within a short period of time in mice. As a result, this animal model can be widely applied to study the etiology of obesity from genes to behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Gallic Acid, a Methyl 3,4-Dihydroxybenzoate Derivative, Induces Neural Stem Cells to Differentiate and Proliferate</title>

	<description>Differentiation and proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) are both important biological processes in cerebral neural network. However, these two capacities of NSCs are limited. Thus, the induction of differentiation and/or proliferation via administration of small molecules derived from natural plants can be considered as a potential approach to repair damaged neural networks. This paper reports that gallic acid, a catechol compound selected from derivatives of methyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (MDHB), selectively induces NSCs to differentiate into immature neurons and promotes proliferation by activating phosphorylation of key proteins in the MAPK-ERK pathway. In addition, we found that 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid was the main active structure which could show neurotrophic activity. The substitution of carboxyl group on the benzene ring into ester group may promote differentiation on the basis of the structure of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Meanwhile, the introduction of 5-hydroxyl group may promote proliferation. Generally, this study identified a natural catechol compound that promotes differentiation and proliferation of NSCs in vitro.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The Disease-Associated Proteins Drosophila Nab2 and Ataxin-2 Interact with Shared RNAs and Coregulate Neuronal Morphology</title>

	<description>Drosophila encodes a conserved polyadenosine RNA-binding protein (RBP) with broad roles in post-transcriptional regulation, including in poly(A) RNA export, poly(A) tail length control, transcription termination, and mRNA splicing. Mutation of the Drosophila human ortholog ZC3H14 gives rise to an autosomal recessive intellectual disability, but understanding of Nab2/ZC3H14 function in metazoan nervous systems is limited, in part because no comprehensive identification of metazoan Nab2/ZC3H14-associated RNA transcripts has yet been conducted. Moreover, many Nab2/ZC3H14 functional protein partnerships likely remain unidentified. Here we present evidence that Drosophila melanogaster Nab2 interacts with the RBP Ataxin-2 (Atx2), a neuronal translational regulator, and implicate these proteins in coordinate regulation of neuronal morphology and adult viability. We then present the first high-throughput identifications of Nab2- and Atx2-associated RNAs in Drosophila brain neurons using an RNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (RIP-Seq) approach. Critically, the RNA interactomes of each RBP overlap, and Nab2 exhibits high specificity in its RNA associations in neurons in vivo, associating with a small fraction of all polyadenylated RNAs. The identities of shared associated transcripts (e.g. drk, me31B, stai) and of transcripts specific to Nab2 or Atx2 (e.g. Arpc2, tea, respectively) promise insight into neuronal functions of and interactions between each RBP. Significantly, Nab2-associated RNAs are overrepresented for internal A-rich motifs, suggesting these sequences may partially mediate Nab2 target selection. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Nab2 opposingly regulates neuronal morphology and shares associated neuronal RNAs with Atx2, and that Drosophila Nab2 associates with a more specific subset of polyadenylated mRNAs than its polyadenosine affinity alone may suggest.</description>

	<description>The ability to process and respond to external input is critical for adaptive behavior. Why, then, do neural and behavioral responses vary across repeated presentations of the same sensory input? Spontaneous fluctuations of neuronal excitability are currently hypothesized to underlie the trial-by-trial variability in sensory processing. To test this, we capitalized on invasive electrophysiology in neurosurgical patients performing an auditory discrimination task with visual cues: specifically, we examined the interaction between prestimulus alpha oscillations, excitability, task performance, and decoded neural stimulus representations. We found that strong prestimulus oscillations in the alpha+ band (i.e., alpha and neighboring frequencies), rather than the aperiodic signal, correlated with a low excitability state, indexed by reduced broadband high-frequency activity. This state was related to slower reaction times and reduced neural stimulus encoding strength. We propose that the alpha+ rhythm modulates excitability, thereby resulting in variability in behavior and sensory representations despite identical input.</description>

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.01.433441v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is postulated to exert 'top-down control' by modulating information processing throughout the brain to promote specific actions based on current goals. However, the pathways mediating top-down control remain poorly understood. In particular, knowledge about direct prefrontal connections that might facilitate top-down prefrontal control of information processing in the hippocampus remains sparse. Here we describe novel monosynaptic long-range GABAergic projections from PFC to hippocampus. These preferentially inhibit vasoactive intestinal polypeptide expressing interneurons, which are known to disinhibit hippocampal microcircuits. Indeed, stimulating prefrontal-hippocampal GABAergic projections increases hippocampal feedforward inhibition and reduces hippocampal activity in vivo. The net effect of these actions is to specifically enhance the signal-to-noise ratio for hippocampal representations of objects. Correspondingly, stimulation of PFC-to-hippocampus GABAergic projections promotes object exploration. Together, these results elucidate a novel top-down pathway in which long-range GABAergic projections target disinhibitory microcircuits, thereby enhancing signals and network dynamics underlying exploratory behavior.</description>

	<description>Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG expansions in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Modelling HD has remained challenging, as rodent and cellular models poorly recapitulate the disease. To address this, we generated induced neurons (iNs) through direct reprogramming of human skin fibroblasts, which retain age-dependent epigenetic characteristics. HD-iNs displayed profound deficits in autophagy, characterised by reduced transport of late autophagic structures from the neurites to the soma. The neurite-specific alterations in autophagy resulted in shorter, thinner and fewer neurites presented by HD-iNs. CRISPRi-mediated silencing of HTT did not rescue this phenotype but rather resulted in additional autophagy alterations in ctrl-iNs, highlighting the importance of wild type HTT in neuronal autophagy. In summary, our work identifies a distinct subcellular autophagy impairment in aged patient derived HD-neurons and provides a new rational for future development of autophagy activation therapies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The spatiotemporal organization of experience dictates hippocampal involvement in primary visual cortical plasticity</title>

	<description>The hippocampus and neocortex are theorized to be crucial partners in the formation of long-term memories. Here, we assess hippocampal involvement in two related forms of experience-dependent plasticity in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice. Like control animals, those with hippocampal lesions exhibit potentiation of visually evoked potentials following passive daily exposure to a phase reversing oriented grating stimulus, which is accompanied by long-term habituation of a reflexive behavioral response. Thus, low-level recognition memory is formed independently of the hippocampus. However, response potentiation resulting from daily exposure to a fixed sequence of four oriented gratings is severely impaired in mice with hippocampal damage. A feature of sequence plasticity in V1 of controls, but absent in lesioned mice, is generation of predictive responses to an anticipated stimulus element when it is withheld or delayed. Thus, hippocampus is involved in encoding temporally structured experience, even in primary sensory cortex.</description>

	<description>Objective: Personalized neurostimulation is a rapidly expanding category of therapeutics for a broad range of indications. Development of these innovative neurological devices requires high-throughput systems for closed-loop stimulation of model organisms, while monitoring physiological signals and complex, naturalistic behaviors. To address this need, we developed CLARA, a closed-loop automated reaching apparatus. Approach: Using breakthroughs in computer vision, CLARA integrates fully-automated, markerless kinematic tracking of multiple features we use to classify animal behavior and precisely deliver neural stimulation based on behavioral outcomes. CLARA is compatible with advanced neurophysiological tools, enabling the testing of neurostimulation devices and identification of novel neurological biomarkers. Results: The CLARA system tracks unconstrained skilled reach behavior in 3D at 150hz without physical markers. The system fully automates trial initiation and pellet delivery and is capable of accurately delivering stimulation in response to trial outcome with sub-quarter second latency. Mice perform the skilled reach task in the CLARA system at a proficiency similar to manually trained animals. Kinematic data from the CLARA system provided novel insights into the dynamics of reach consistency over the course of learning, suggesting that changes are driven entirely by unsuccessful reach accuracy. Additionally, using the closed-loop capabilities of CLARA, we demonstrate that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) delivered on reach success improves skilled reach performance and increases reach trajectory consistency in healthy animals. Significance: The CLARA system is the first mouse behavior apparatus that uses markerless pose tracking to provide real-time closed-loop stimulation in response to the outcome of an unconstrained motor task. Additionally, we demonstrate that the CLARA system was essential for our finding that VNS given after successful completion of a motor task improves performance in healthy animals. This approach has high translational relevance for developing neurostimulation technology based on complex human behavior.</description>

	<description>High-resolution functional 2-photon microscopy of neural activity is a cornerstone technique in current neuroscience, enabling, for instance, the image-based analysis of relations of the organization of local neuron populations and their temporal neural activity patterns. Interpreting local image intensity as a direct quantitative measure of neural activity presumes, however, a consistent within- and across-image relationship between the image intensity and neural activity, which may be subject to interference by illumination artifacts. In particular, the so-called vignetting artifact - the decrease of image intensity towards the edges of an image - is, at the moment, widely neglected in the context of functional microscopy analyses of neural activity, but potentially introduces a substantial center-periphery bias of derived functional measures. In the present report, we propose a straightforward protocol for single image-based vignetting correction. Using immediate-early-gene-based 2-photon microscopic neural image data of the mouse brain, we show the necessity of correcting both image brightness and contrast to improve within- and across-image intensity consistency and demonstrate the plausibility of the resulting functional data.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Acetylcholine boosts dendritic NMDA spikes in a CA3 pyramidal neuron model</title>

	<description>Acetylcholine has been proposed to facilitate the formation of memory ensembles within the hippocampal CA3 network, by enhancing plasticity at CA3-CA3 recurrent synapses. Regenerative NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation in CA3 neuron dendrites (NMDA spikes) increase synaptic Ca2+ influx and can trigger this synaptic plasticity. Acetylcholine inhibits potassium channels which enhances dendritic excitability and therefore could facilitate NMDA spike generation. Here, we investigate NMDAR-mediated nonlinear synaptic integration in stratum radiatum (SR) and stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM) dendrites in a reconstructed CA3 neuron computational model and study the effect of acetylcholine on this nonlinearity. We found that distal SLM dendrites, with a higher input resistance, had a lower threshold for NMDA spike generation compared to SR dendrites. Simulating acetylcholine by blocking potassium channels (M-type, A-type, Ca2+-activated, and inwardly-rectifying) increased dendritic excitability and reduced the number of synapses required to generate NMDA spikes, particularly in the SR dendrites. The magnitude of this effect was heterogeneous across different dendritic branches within the same neuron. These results predict that acetylcholine facilitates dendritic integration and NMDA spike generation in selected CA3 dendrites which could strengthen connections between specific CA3 neurons to form memory ensembles.</description>

	<description>Functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase are clinically used as anti-depressants since ~60 years. Here, we show that acid sphingomyelinase inhibition by the antidepressants amitriptyline, fluoxetine and desipramine protects from ischemia/reperfusion and elicits a profound brain remodeling response with increased angiogenesis, improved blood-brain barrier integrity, reduced brain leukocyte infiltration and increased neuronal survival. Angiogenesis is promoted by small extracellular vesicles with bona fide characteristics of exosomes, which are released from endothelial cells and which constitute an elegant target for the amplification of stroke recovery.</description>

The naÃ¯ve antibody/B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires of different individuals ought to exhibit significant functional commonality, given that most pathogens trigger an effective antibody response to immunodominant epitopes. Sequence-based repertoire analysis has so far offered little evidence for this phenomenon. For example, a recent study estimated the number of shared (‘public’) antibody clonotypes in circulating baseline repertoires to be around 0.02% across ten unrelated individuals. However, to engage the same epitope, antibodies only require a similar binding site structure and the presence of key paratope interactions, which can occur even when their sequences are dissimilar. Here, we search for evidence of geometric similarity/convergence across human antibody repertoires. We first structurally profile naÃ¯ve (‘baseline’) antibody diversity using snapshots from 41 unrelated individuals, predicting all modellable distinct structures within each repertoire. This analysis uncovers a high (much greater than random) degree of structural commonality. For instance, around 3% of distinct structures are common to the ten most diverse individual samples (‘Public Baseline’ structures). Our approach is the first computational method to find levels of BCR commonality commensurate with epitope immunodominance and could therefore be harnessed to find more genetically distant antibodies with same-epitope complementarity. We then apply the same structural profiling approach to repertoire snapshots from three individuals before and after flu vaccination, detecting a convergent structural drift indicative of recognising similar epitopes (‘Public Response’ structures). We show that Antibody Model Libraries derived from Public Baseline and Public Response structures represent a powerful geometric basis set of low-immunogenicity candidates exploitable for general or target-focused therapeutic antibody screening.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Cwym7GH65-E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Human pluripotent stem cells hold significant promise for regenerative medicine. However, long differentiation protocols and immature characteristics of stem cell-derived cell types remain challenges to the development of many therapeutic applications. In contrast to the slow differentiation of human stem cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; that mirrors a nine-month gestation period, mouse stem cells develop according to a much faster three-week gestation timeline. Here, we tested if co-differentiation with mouse pluripotent stem cells could accelerate the differentiation speed of human embryonic stem cells. Following a six-week RNA-sequencing time course of neural differentiation, we identified 929 human genes that were upregulated earlier and 535 genes that exhibited earlier peaked expression profiles in chimeric cell cultures than in human cell cultures alone. Genes with accelerated upregulation were significantly enriched in Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis, neuron differentiation and maturation, and synapse signaling. Moreover, chimeric mixed samples correlated with &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; human embryonic samples earlier than human cells alone, and acceleration was dose-dependent on human-mouse co-culture ratios. The altered gene expression patterns and developmental rates described in this report have implications for accelerating human stem cell differentiation and the use of interspecies chimeric embryos in developing human organs for transplantation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/R_ZWkRZkSEY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Repurposed drugs that are safe and immediately available constitute a first line of defense against new viral infections. Despite limited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, several drugs are being tested as medication or as prophylaxis to prevent infection. Using a stochastic model of early phase infection, we evaluate the success of prophylactic treatment with different drug types to prevent viral infection. We find that there exists a critical efficacy that a treatment must reach in order to block viral establishment. Treatment by a combination of drugs reduces the critical efficacy, most effectively by the combination of a drug blocking viral entry into cells and a drug increasing viral clearance. Below the critical efficacy, the risk of infection can nonetheless be reduced. Drugs blocking viral entry into cells or enhancing viral clearance reduce the risk of infection more than drugs that reduce viral production in infected cells. The larger the initial inoculum of infectious virus, the less likely is prevention of an infection. In our model, we find that as long as the viral inoculum is smaller than 10 infectious virus particles, viral infection can be prevented almost certainly with drugs of 90% efficacy (or more). Even when a viral infection cannot be prevented, antivirals delay the time to detectable viral loads. The largest delay of viral infection is achieved by drugs reducing viral production in infected cells. A delay of virus infection flattens the within-host viral dynamic curve, possibly reducing transmission and symptom severity. Thus, antiviral prophylaxis, even with reduced efficacy, could be efficiently used to prevent or alleviate infection in people at high risk.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uMOozT2lkZE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Kseniia Cheloshkina, Maria Poptsova&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding mechanisms of cancer breakpoint mutagenesis is a difficult task and predictive models of cancer breakpoint formation have to this time failed to achieve even moderate predictive power. Here we take advantage of a machine learning approach that can gather important features from big data and quantify contribution of different factors. We performed comprehensive analysis of almost 630,000 cancer breakpoints and quantified the contribution of genomic and epigenomic features–non-B DNA structures, chromatin organization, transcription factor binding sites and epigenetic markers. The results showed that transcription and formation of non-B DNA structures are two major processes responsible for cancer genome fragility. Epigenetic factors, such as chromatin organization in TADs, open/closed regions, DNA methylation, histone marks are less informative but do make their contribution. As a general trend, individual features inside the groups show a relatively high contribution of G-quadruplexes and repeats and CTCF, GABPA, RXRA, SP1, MAX and NR2F2 transcription factors. Overall, the cancer breakpoint landscape can be represented by well-predicted hotspots and poorly predicted individual breakpoints scattered across genomes. We demonstrated that hotspot mutagenesis has genomic and epigenomic factors, and not all individual cancer breakpoints are just random noise but have a definite mutation signature. Besides we found a long-range action of some features on breakpoint mutagenesis. Combining omics data, cancer-specific individual feature importance and adding the distant to local features, predictive models for cancer breakpoint formation achieved 70–90% ROC AUC for different cancer types; however precision remained low at 2% and the recall did not exceed 50%. On the one hand, the power of models strongly correlates with the size of available cancer breakpoint and epigenomic data, and on the other hand finding strong determinants of cancer breakpoint formation still remains a challenge. The strength of predictive signals of each group and of each feature inside a group can be converted into cancer-specific breakpoint mutation signatures. Overall our results add to the understanding of cancer genome rearrangement processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xh0PAVy_OrE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

While mortality from malaria continues to decline globally, incidence rates in many countries are rising. Within countries, spatial and temporal patterns of malaria vary across communities due to many different physical and social environmental factors. To identify those areas most suitable for malaria elimination or targeted control interventions, we used Bayesian models to estimate the spatiotemporal variation of malaria risk, rates, and trends and determine areas of high or low malaria burden compared to their geographical neighbours. We present a methodology using Bayesian hierarchical models with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based inference to fit a generalised linear mixed model with a conditional autoregressive structure. We modelled clusters of similar spatiotemporal trends in malaria risk, using trend functions with constrained shapes and visualised high and low burden districts using a multi-criterion index derived by combining spatiotemporal risk, rates and trends of districts in Zambia. Our results indicate that over 3 million people in Zambia live in high-burden districts with either high mortality burden or high incidence burden coupled with an increasing trend over 16 years (2000 to 2015) for all age, under-five and over-five cohorts. Approximately 1.6 million people live in high-incidence burden areas alone. Using our method, we have developed a platform that can enable malaria programs in countries like Zambia to target those high-burden areas with intensive control measures while at the same time pursue malaria elimination efforts in all other areas. Our method enhances conventional approaches and measures to identify those districts, which had higher rates and increasing trends and risk. This study provides a method, and a means that can help policy makers evaluate intervention impact over time and adopt appropriate geographically targeted strategies that address the issues of both high-burden areas, through intensive control approaches, and low-burden areas, via specific elimination programs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ltKHubuqHHw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Spiking information of individual neurons is essential for functional and behavioral analysis in neuroscience research. Calcium imaging techniques are generally employed to obtain activities of neuronal populations. However, these techniques result in slowly-varying fluorescence signals with low temporal resolution. Estimating the temporal positions of the neuronal action potentials from these signals is a challenging problem. In the literature, several generative model-based and data-driven algorithms have been studied with varied levels of success. This article proposes a neural network-based signal-to-signal conversion approach, where it takes as input raw-fluorescence signal and learns to estimate the spike information in an end-to-end fashion. Theoretically, the proposed approach formulates the spike estimation as a single channel source separation problem with unknown mixing conditions. The source corresponding to the action potentials at a lower resolution is estimated at the output. Experimental studies on the spikefinder challenge dataset show that the proposed signal-to-signal conversion approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art-methods in terms of Pearson’s correlation coefficient, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and yields comparable performance for the area under the receiver operating characteristics measure. We also show that the resulting system: (a) has low complexity with respect to existing supervised approaches and is reproducible; (b) is layer-wise interpretable, and (c) has the capability to generalize across different calcium indicators.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/m7z83a4wkUQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Recent concerns about the reproducibility of science have led to several calls for more open and transparent research practices and for the monitoring of potential improvements over time. However, with tens of thousands of new biomedical articles published per week, manually mapping and monitoring changes in transparency is unrealistic. We present an open-source, automated approach to identify 5 indicators of transparency (data sharing, code sharing, conflicts of interest disclosures, funding disclosures, and protocol registration) and apply it across the entire open access biomedical literature of 2.75 million articles on PubMed Central (PMC). Our results indicate remarkable improvements in some (e.g., conflict of interest [COI] disclosures and funding disclosures), but not other (e.g., protocol registration and code sharing) areas of transparency over time, and map transparency across fields of science, countries, journals, and publishers. This work has enabled the creation of a large, integrated, and openly available database to expedite further efforts to monitor, understand, and promote transparency and reproducibility in science.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/l0TdCjmsGF0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Macaque monkey trigeminal blink reflex circuits targeting orbicularis oculi motoneurons</title>

	<description>The blink reflex is critical for protecting the eyes and spreading the tear film, and is a commonly used for learning model. We demonstrate monosynaptic trigeminal (shown here) and disynaptic reticular formation pathways connecting the principal and the spinal trigeminal nucleus (pars caudalis) with orbicularis oculi motoneurons in the macaque monkey.







Abstract
The trigeminal blink reflex plays an important role in protecting the corneal surface from damage and preserving visual function in an unpredictable environment. The closing phase of the human reflex, produced by activation of the orbicularis oculi (ObOc) muscles, consists of an initial, small, ipsilateral R1 component, followed by a larger, bilateral R2 component. We investigated the circuitry that underlies this reflex in macaque (Macaca fascicularis and Macaca mulatta) monkeys by the use of single and dual tracer methods. Injection of retrograde tracer into the facial nucleus labeled neurons in the principal trigeminal nucleus, and in the spinal nucleus pars oralis and interpolaris, bilaterally, and in pars caudalis, ipsilaterally. Injection of anterograde tracer into the principal trigeminal nucleus labeled axons that directly terminated on ObOc motoneurons, with an ipsilateral predominance. Injection of anterograde tracer into pars caudalis of the spinal trigeminal nucleus labeled axons that directly terminated on ipsilateral ObOc motoneurons. The observed pattern of labeling indicates that the reticular formation ventromedial to the principal and spinal nuclei also contributes extensive bilateral input to ObOc motoneurons. Thus, much of the trigeminal sensory complex is in a position to supply a monosynaptic drive for lid closure, and the adjacent reticular formation can supply a disynaptic drive. These findings indicate that the assignment of the R1 and R2 components of the blink reflex to different parts of the trigeminal sensory complex cannot be exclusively based on subdivision connectional relationships with facial motoneurons. The characteristics of the R2 component may be due, instead, to other circuit properties.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Leucine Zipper 4 Autoantibody: A Novel Germ Cell Tumor and Paraneoplastic Biomarker</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26050</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26050?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
This study was undertaken to describe a novel biomarker of germ cell tumor and associated paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS).


Methods
Archival sera from patients with germ cell tumor–associated PNS were evaluated. We identified a common autoantigen in a human testicular cancer cell line (TCam‐2) by Western blot and mass spectrometry. Its identity was confirmed by recombinant‐protein Western blot, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and cell‐based assay. Autoantibody specificity was confirmed by analyzing assorted control sera/cerebrospinal fluid.


Results
Leucine zipper 4 (LUZP4)–immunoglobulin G (IgG) was detected in 28 patients' sera, 26 of whom (93%) were men. The median age at neurological symptom onset was 45 years (range = 28–84). Median titer (ELISA) was 1:300 (1:50 to &amp;gt;1:6,400, normal value &amp;lt; 1:50). Coexistent kelchlike protein 11–IgG was identified in 18 cases (64%). The most common presenting phenotype was rhombencephalitis (17/28, 61%). Other presentations included limbic encephalitis (n = 5, 18%), seizures and/or encephalitis (n = 2, 7%), and motor neuronopathy/polyradiculopathy (n = 4, 14%). The most common malignancy among cancer‐evaluated PNS patients was seminoma (21/27, 78%). Nine of the 21 seminomas detected by whole‐body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan (43%) were extratesticular. Both female patients had ovarian teratoma. Regressed testicular germ cell tumors were found in 4 patients. Exposure of T‐cell–dendritic‐cell cocultures from chronic immunosuppression‐naïve LUZP4‐IgG–seropositive patients to recombinant LUZP4 protein evoked a marked increase in CD69 expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells when compared to vehicle‐exposed and healthy control cultures.


Interpretation
LUZP4‐IgG represents a novel serological biomarker of PNS and has high predictive value for germ cell tumors. The demonstrated antigen‐specific T‐cell responses support a CD8+ T‐cell–mediated cytotoxic paraneoplastic and antitumor potential. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: From Cerebellar Apoplexy in 1849 to Cerebellar Stroke in the 2020s: Robert Dunn’s Contribution</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Stroke of the cerebellum represents about 10% of strokes of the brain. Both infarction and hemorrhage manifest with symptoms related to the location and extent of the lesion(s). Bilateral cerebellar infarcts constitute up to one third of all cerebellar infarctions. The leading cause of cerebellar infarcts is emboli of cardiac origin or from intra-arterial sources. Potential complications include brainstem compression and hydrocephalus. Malignant cerebellar edema is a life-threatening complication of ischemic posterior circulation stroke requiring urgent management. The advent of MRI has revolutionized the early diagnosis in vivo, showing small and large territorial infarcts, hemorrhages, and venous infarcts. Endovascular procedures are growingly applied and are impacting on the prognosis of stroke, although cerebellar stroke from occlusion of small cerebellar arteries is currently not accessible to thrombectomy. Surgical procedures of space-occupying stroke include external ventricular drainage, suboccipital craniotomy, or combined procedures. In 1849, Robert Dunn (1799–1877), an English surgeon, reported the details of a case of apoplexy of the cerebellum in a 52-year-old man, pointing to the importance of post-mortem studies of patients followed meticulously during lifetime. Dunn discussed inflammation surrounding hemorrhage as a source of cerebral degeneration, linking for the first time cerebellar stroke, neuroinflammation, and atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: ClC-2-like Chloride Current Alterations in a Cell Model of Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy, a Polyglutamine Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by expansions of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. SBMA is associated with the progressive loss of lower motor neurons, together with muscle weakness and atrophy. PolyQ-AR is converted to a toxic species upon binding to its natural ligands, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Our previous patch-clamp studies on a motor neuron-derived cell model of SBMA showed alterations in voltage-gated ion currents. Here, we identified and characterized chloride currents most likely belonging to the chloride channel-2 (ClC-2) subfamily, which showed significantly increased amplitudes in the SBMA cells. The treatment with the pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a neuropeptide with a proven protective effect in a mouse model of SBMA, recovered chloride channel current alterations in SBMA cells. These observations suggest that the CIC-2 currents are affected in SBMA, an alteration that may contribute and potentially determine the pathophysiology of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Identification of Key Genes and Pathways in Mouse Spinal Cord Involved in ddC-Induced Neuropathic Pain by Transcriptome Sequencing</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) works effectively in inhibiting HIV replication in patients. However, the use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) often causes side effects of neuropathic pain, and its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we aim to explore the mechanism of NRTIs-induced neuropathic pain at the transcriptome level. C57BL/6 J mice were given intraperitoneal injection of zalcitabine (ddC) or saline (control) for 2 weeks, during which the mechanical pain threshold of the mice was detected by von Frey test. Then the L3~L5 spinal segments of the mice were isolated and subsequently used for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on the last day of treatment. The mechanical pain threshold of mice given ddC decreased significantly. Compared with the control group, ddC caused significant changes in the expression of 135 genes, of which 66 upregulated and 69 downregulated. Enrichment analysis showed that the functions of these genes are mainly enriched in regulation of transcription, multicellular organism development, and cell differentiation, and the pathway is mainly enriched in the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway and AMPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, key genes such as Gabrd, Kcnd3, Npcd, Insr, Lypd6, Scd2, and Mef2d were also identified. These may serve as drug targets for the prevention or treatment of NRTI-induced neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: The Effect of Optogenetic Inhibition of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex in Neuropathic Pain Following Sciatic Nerve Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cortical disinhibition is the underlying pathological alteration contributing to neuropathic pain associated with peripheral nerve injury. Nerve injury resulting in disinhibition of the anterior cingulate cortex has been reported. However, the effect of optogenetic inhibition of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) on the sensory component of nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain has not been well studied. To investigate the feasibility of optogenetic ACC modulation, we injected an optogenetic virus or a null virus into the ACC of a nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain model. The unilateral ACC was modulated, and the optogenetic effect was measured by mechanical and thermal sensitivity tests. The assessment was performed in “pre—light off,” “stimulation—yellow light on,” and “post—light off” states. Optogenetic inhibition of the ACC in injury models revealed improved mechanical and thermal latencies with profound pain-relieving effects against nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain. The sensory thalamic discharge in electrophysiological in vivo recordings was also altered during laser stimulation. This finding indicates that hyperactivity of the ACC in nerve injury increases output to the spinothalamic tract through direct or indirect pathways. The direct photoinhibition of ACC neurons could play a vital role in restoring equilibrium and provide novel insight into techniques that can assuage peripheral nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Cadaverine and Spermine Elicit Ca 2+ Uptake in Human CP Cells via a Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 Dependent Pathway</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The choroid plexus (CP) constitutes a barrier between the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which regulates the exchange of substances between these two fluids through mechanisms that are not completely understood. Polyamines as spermine, spermidine and putrescine are produced by all cells and are present in the CSF. Interestingly, their levels are altered in some neuronal disorders as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, thus increasing the interest in their signalling in the central nervous system (CNS). Cadaverine, on the other hand, is synthetized by the intestinal microbiome, suggesting that the presence of this bacterial metabolite in the CSF requires that it is up taken to the CNS across brain barriers. We knew that polyamines are detected by the olfactory signalling cascade operating at the CP, but the receptor involved had not been identified. The zebrafish TAAR13c was the only receptor known to bind a polyamine-cadaverine. Thus, we searched for a human receptor with homology to TAAR13c and found that some human TAARs including TAAR1 showed great homology. Then, we confirmed the expression of TAAR1 mRNA and protein in a human cell line of the CP, and in human CP samples. Calcium imaging assays after TAAR1 knockdown in these cells with a specific siRNA against TAAR1 showed a consistent reduction in the responses of these cells to cadaverine and spermidine, but not to spermine, suggesting that TAAR1 is activated by cadaverine and spermidine, but not spermine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Different Activation of IL-10 in the Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex During Neurodegeneration Caused by Trimethyltin Chloride</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) plays a crucial role in controlling the resolution of inflammation. In this study, we aimed to assess gene expression and the level of IL-10 in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of rats, after a single injection of neurotoxicant trimethyltin chloride (TMT). It was shown that 4 weeks after the treatment with TMT, the level of IL-10 in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus of TMT-treated rats, was increased. However, expression level of IL-10 mRNA was upregulated both in the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex 3 weeks after the injection. Concomitantly, within the same post-treatment period, the expression level of the cyclooxygenase-2 was upregulated in both brain structures, indicating the induction of neuroinflammation. Considering that TMT leads to the death of neurons mainly in the hippocampus, we assume that in contrast to the prefrontal cortex, the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the hippocampus is not sufficiently increased to prevent the damaging effect of the neurotoxicant. Therefore, an exogenous increase in the level of IL-10 may be useful for the survival of neurons in conditions of neurotoxic damage to the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Loss-of-function variants in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CREBBP&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;EP300&lt;/em&gt; result in Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome (RSTS). The previously reported cluster of variants in the last part of exon 30 and the beginning of exon 31 of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CREBBP&lt;/em&gt;, overlapping with the ZNF2 (zinc finger, ZZ-type; residues 1701 to 1744) and ZNF3 (zinc finger, TAZ-type; residues 1764 to 1853) domains, is associated with atypical RSTS. The main features include developmental delay, short stature, microcephaly, distinctive facial features, autistic behavior, feeding difficulties, recurrent upper airway infections, and hearing impairment. Here, we report a 2-year-7-month-old Chinese girl presenting mild cognitive impairments, developmental delay, short stature, recurrent upper airway infections, and facial dysmorphism that resembled the phenotypes of previously reported atypical RSTS patients. The characteristic facial and limb dysmorphism for RSTS was absent in our patient. In addition, our patient exhibited novel phenotypes including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sleep problem, and abnormal walking posture. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a novel de novo in-frame deletion variant in the beginning of exon 30 of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CREBBP&lt;/em&gt; (NM_004380:c.4897_4899delTTC, p.Phe1633del) in the HAT domain where no pathogenic variants have been previously reported to be responsible for atypical RSTS. Our case allows us to more accurately define the borders of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CREBBP&lt;/em&gt; coding sequence resulting in atypical RSTS, which are extended to the beginning of exon 30 (residue 1633) at the 5′ end of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CREBBP&lt;/em&gt; in the HAT domain, and reveals novel phenotypes observed in our atypical Chinese RSTS patient.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: KLF4 Exerts Sedative Effects in Pentobarbital-Treated Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KLF4 is a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays an essential role in many biological processes, including neuroinflammation, neuron regeneration, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Through effects on these processes, KLF4 has likely roles in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury. However, little is known about the role of KLF4 in more immediate behavioral processes that similarly depend upon broad changes in brain excitability, such as the sleep process. Here, behavioral approaches, western blot, and immunohistochemical experiments were used to explore the role of KLF4 on sedation and the potential mechanisms of those effects. The results showed that overexpression of KLF4 prolonged loss of righting reflex (LORR) duration in pentobarbital-treated mice and increased c-Fos expression in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), while it decreased c-Fos expression in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN). Moreover, overexpression of KLF4 reduced the expression of p53 in the hypothalamus and increased the expression of STAT3 in the hypothalamus. Therefore, these results suggest that KLF4 exerts sedative effects through the regulation of p53 and STAT3 expression, and it indicates a role of KLF4 ligands in the treatment of sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Microtubule Stabilization Promotes Microcirculation Reconstruction After Spinal Cord Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinal cord microcirculation plays an important role in maintaining the function of spinal cord neurons and other cells. Previous studies have largely focused on the ability of microtubule stabilization to inhibit the fibroblast migration and promote axon regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the effect of microtubule stabilization treatment on microcirculation reconstruction after SCI remains unclear. By using immunofluorescence, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment improved microcirculation reconstruction via increasing the number of microvessels, pericytes, and the perfused microvessels after SCI. To clarify the underlying mechanisms, rat brain microvascular endothelial cells and pericytes were subjected to glucose oxygen deprivation. By using flow cytometry and western blotting, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment inhibited apoptosis and migration of endothelial cells and pericytes but promoted proliferation and survival of endothelial cells and pericytes through upregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), VEGF receptor 2, platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB), PDGF receptor β, and angiopoietin-1 after SCI. Taken together, this study provides evidence for the mechanisms underlying the promotion of microcirculation reconstruction after SCI by microtubule stabilization treatment. Importantly, this study suggests the potential of microtubule stabilization as a therapeutic target to reduce microcirculation dysfunction after SCI in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative condition characterized by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity. PD diagnosis is based on medical history, review of signs, symptoms, neurological and physical examinations. Unfortunately, by the time the disease is diagnosed, dopamine (DA) neuronal loss is often extended, thereby resulting in ineffective therapies. Recent evidence suggests that neuroinflammation may be pivotal during PD onset and progression. However, suitable cellular models and biomarkers to detect early signs of neuroinflammation are still missing. In this study, we developed a well-differentiated DAergic neuronal cell line where we triggered a neuroinflammatory response to assess the temporal expression of the tissue- and urokinase plasminogen activators (tPA and uPA) and their endogenous inhibitor (PAI-1) along with that of pro-inflammatory mediators and the neuronal marker nNOS. Human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y were differentiated into DAergic neuronal-like cells using a combination of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and serum depletion. Terminally-differentiated neurons were then exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for short (up to 24 h) or long term (up to 10 days) to mimic acute or chronic inflammation. Results demonstrated that uPA protein expression was stably upregulated during chronic inflammation, whereas the expression of nNOS protein better reflected the cellular response to acute inflammation. Additional studies revealed that the temporal induction of uPA was associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, but did not seem to involve cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) activation, nor the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In conclusion, our in vitro data suggests that nNOS and uPA may serve as viable candidate biomarkers of acute and chronic neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: The Role of EZH2 Inhibitor, GSK-126, in Seizure Susceptibility</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GSK-126 is recognized as an inhibitor of enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2) activity. Because of its inhibition of EZH2 activation, GSK-126 is considered a potential anti-tumor drug. EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes histone 3 tri-methylation at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), resulting in gene silencing. A previous report showed that decreased H3K27me3 levels in the hippocampus may promote seizure susceptibility, possibly restricting the clinical application of GSK-126. The role of GSK-126 in seizure susceptibility was investigated in this study. We first determined a critical concentration of pentamethazol (PTZ) under which mice exhibit no seizures. We then found that mice pretreated with GSK-126 and injected with the same concentration of PTZ experienced marked convulsions. Peripheral injections of GSK-126 decreased H3K27me3 levels in the hippocampus of mice, while some seizure-related genes (Oasl1, Sox7, armcx5, Ncx3, etc.) were found to be differentially expressed in the hippocampus of those mice . These differences in the expression levels might reflect the crucial role of these genes and related pathways in the promotion of seizure susceptibility. Our results suggest that GSK-126 promotes seizure susceptibility due to its role as an EZH2 inhibitor. These findings may provide evidence to support the development of GSK-126 as a clinical drug.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: The Proteomics Study of Compounded HFE/TF/TfR2/HJV Genetic Variations in a Thai Family with Iron Overload, Chronic Anemia, and Motor Neuron Disorder</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The mutation of the homeostatic iron regulatory genes (HFE) impaired the hepatic hepcidin transcription leading to the chronic excess of the iron pool, with the adverse consequences of free radical oxidative damages. We herein reported the findings of Thai family members who had the compound of uncommon HFE rs2794719, together with transferrin (TF) rs1867504, transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) rs7385804, and hemojuvelin (HJV) rs16827043 genetic variants involved in the hepcidin transcriptional pathway. These compounded genetic variants could produce the spectrum of clinical phenotypes that spanned from mild to moderate symptoms of chronic anemia to an established motor neuron disorder. The feasible pathophysiologies were the impairment of the transferrin receptor functions, which affected the endocytic uptake of halo-transferrin into the erythroblast precursors. Such a defect left the erythropoiesis depleted of their iron supply. These alterations also promoted the TfR-independent uptake of iron into other target tissues and left the TrF2/BMP-dependent-hepcidin activation pathway unattended. We used the predicted molecular interactive proteomes to support our speculated dysregulated iron metabolism. During the early stage of an elevated ferritin level, there was no inhibition of ferroportin activities from hepcidin. These pathophysiological processes went on to the point of an iron overload threshold. After that, the hepcidin transcription started to kick in with the resulting decreased serum iron levels and deterioration of clinical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Making the World Behave: A New Embodied Account on Mobile Paradigm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.643526</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.643526</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this review article, we describe the mobile paradigm, a method used for more than 50 years to assess how infants learn and remember sensorimotor contingencies. The literature on the mobile paradigm demonstrates that infants below 6 months of age can remember the learning environment weeks after when reminded periodically and integrate temporally distributed information across modalities. The latter ability is only possible if events occur within a temporal window of a few days, and the width of this required window changes as a function of age. A major critique of these conclusions is that the majority of this literature has neglected the embodied experience, such that motor behavior was considered an equivalent developmental substitute for verbal behavior. Over recent years, simulation and empirical work have highlighted the sensorimotor aspect and opened up a discussion for possible learning mechanisms and variability in motor preferences of young infants. In line with this recent direction, we present a new embodied account on the mobile paradigm which argues that learning sensorimotor contingencies is a core feature of development forming the basis for active exploration of the world and body. In addition to better explaining recent findings, this new framework aims to replace the dis-embodied approach to the mobile paradigm with a new understanding that focuses on variance and representations grounded in sensorimotor experience. Finally, we discuss a potential role for the dorsal stream which might be responsible for guiding action according to visual information, while infants learn sensorimotor contingencies in the mobile paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: A Comprehensive Analysis of Multilayer Community Detection Algorithms for Application to EEG-Based Brain Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modular organization is an emergent property of brain networks, responsible for shaping communication processes and underpinning brain functioning. Moreover, brain networks are intrinsically multilayer since their attributes can vary across time, subjects, frequency, or other domains. Identifying the modular structure in multilayer brain networks represents a gateway toward a deeper understanding of neural processes underlying cognition. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, thanks to their high temporal resolution, can give rise to multilayer networks able to follow the dynamics of brain activity. Despite this potential, the community organization has not yet been thoroughly investigated in brain networks estimated from EEG. Furthermore, at the state of the art, there is still no agreement about which algorithm is the most suitable to detect communities in multilayer brain networks, and a way to test and compare them all under a variety of conditions is lacking. In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis of three algorithms at the state of the art for multilayer community detection (namely, genLouvain, DynMoga, and FacetNet) as compared with an approach based on the application of a single-layer clustering algorithm to each slice of the multilayer network. We test their ability to identify both steady and dynamic modular structures. We statistically evaluate their performances by means of ad hoc benchmark graphs characterized by properties covering a broad range of conditions in terms of graph density, number of clusters, noise level, and number of layers. The results of this simulation study aim to provide guidelines about the choice of the more appropriate algorithm according to the different properties of the brain network under examination. Finally, as a proof of concept, we show an application of the algorithms to real functional brain networks derived from EEG signals collected at rest with closed and open eyes. The test on real data provided results in agreement with the conclusions of the simulation study and confirmed the feasibility of multilayer analysis of EEG-based brain networks in both steady and dynamic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to extinguish fear memories when threats are no longer present is critical for adaptive behavior. Fear extinction represents a new learning process that eventually leads to the formation of extinction memories. Understanding the neural basis of fear extinction has considerable clinical significance as deficits in extinction learning are the hallmark of human anxiety disorders. In recent years, the dopamine (DA) system has emerged as one of the key regulators of fear extinction. In this review article, we highlight recent advances that have demonstrated the crucial role DA plays in mediating different phases of fear extinction. Emerging concepts and outstanding questions for future research are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Consistency and Stability of Motor Subtype Classifications in Patients With de novo Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.637896</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.637896</link>
	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) are commonly classified into subtypes based on motor symptoms. The aims of the present study were to determine the consistency between PD motor subtypes, to assess the stability of PD motor subtypes over time, and to explore the variables influencing PD motor subtype stability.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This study was part of a longitudinal study of de novo PD patients at a single center. Based on three different motor subtype classification systems proposed by Jankovic, Schiess, and Kang, patients were respectively categorized as tremor-dominant/indeterminate/postural instability and gait difficulty (TD/indeterminate/PIGD), TD&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;/mixed&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;/akinetic-rigid&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; (ARS), or TD&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;/mixed&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;/AR&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; at baseline evaluation and then re-assessed 1 month later. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded at each evaluation. The consistency between subtypes at baseline evaluation was assessed using Cohen’s kappa coefficient (κ). Additional variables were compared between PD subtype groups using the two-sample t-test, Mann–Whitney U-test or Chi-squared test.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Of 283 newly diagnosed, untreated PD patients, 79 were followed up at 1 month. There was fair agreement between the Jankovic, Schiess, and Kang classification systems (κ&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.383 ± 0.044, κ&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.360 ± 0.042, κ&lt;sub&gt;SK&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.368 ± 0.038). Among the three classification systems, the Schiess classification was the most stable and the Jankovic classification was the most unstable. The non-motor symptoms questionnaire (NMSQuest) scores differed significantly between PD patients with stable and unstable subtypes based on the Jankovic classification (p = 0.008), and patients with a consistent subtype had more severe NMSQuest scores than patients with an inconsistent subtype.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Fair consistency was observed between the Jankovic, Schiess, and Kang classification systems. For the first time, non-motor symptoms (NMSs) scores were found to influence the stability of the TD/indeterminate/PIGD classification. Our findings support combining NMSs with motor symptoms to increase the effectiveness of PD subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Exosomal MicroRNAs Contribute to Cognitive Impairment in Hypertensive Patients by Decreasing Frontal Cerebrovascular Reactivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.614220</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment (CI) in hypertensive patients remain relatively unclear. The present study aimed to explore the relationship among serum exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs), cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), and cognitive function in hypertensive patients. Seventy-three hypertensive patients with CI (HT-CI), 67 hypertensive patients with normal cognition (HT-NC), and 37 healthy controls underwent identification of exosomal miRNA, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and neuropsychological tests. CVR mapping was investigated based on resting-state functional MRI data. Compared with healthy subjects and HT-NC subjects, HT-CI subjects displayed decreased serum exosomal miRNA-330-3p. The group difference of CVR was mainly found in the left frontal lobe and demonstrated that HT-CI group had a lower CVR than both HT-NC group and control group. Furthermore, both the CVR in the left medial superior frontal gyrus and the miRNA-330-3p level were significantly correlated with executive function (r = −0.275, P = 0.021, and r = −0.246, P = 0.04, respectively) in HT-CI subjects, and the CVR was significantly correlated with the miRNA-330-3p level (r = 0.246, P = 0.040). Notably, path analysis showed that the CVR mediated the association between miRNA-330-3p and executive function. In conclusion, decreased miRNA-330-3p might contribute to CI in hypertensive patients by decreasing frontal CVR and could be a biomarker of early diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Social Exclusion Down-Regulates Pain Empathy at the Late Stage of Empathic Responses: Electrophysiological Evidence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.634714</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.634714</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social exclusion has a significant impact on cognition, emotion, and behavior. Some behavioral studies investigated how social exclusion affects pain empathy. Conclusions were inconsistent, and there is a lack of clarity in identifying which component of pain empathy is more likely to be affected. To investigate these issues, we used a Cyberball task to manipulate feelings of social exclusion. Two groups (social exclusion and social inclusion) participated in the same pain empathy task while we recorded event-related potentials (ERP) when participants viewed static images of body parts in painful and neutral situations. The results showed early N2 differentiation between painful and neutral pictures in the central regions in both groups. The pattern at the late controlled processing stage was different. Parietal P3 amplitudes for painful pictures were significantly smaller than those for neutral pictures in the social exclusion group; they did not differ in the social inclusion group. We observed a parietal late positive potential (LPP) differentiation between painful and neutral pictures in both groups. LPP amplitudes were significantly smaller in the social exclusion group than those in the social inclusion group for painful stimuli. Our results indicate that social exclusion does not affect empathic responses during the early emotional sharing stage. However, it down-regulates empathic responses at the late cognitive controlled stage, and this modulation is attenuated gradually. The current study provides neuroscientific evidence of how social exclusion dynamically influences pain empathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation to Treat Medication-Refractory Freezing of Gait in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.633655</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.633655</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Treating medication-refractory freezing of gait (FoG) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains challenging despite several trials reporting improvements in motor symptoms using subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS). Pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) region DBS has been used for medication-refractory FoG, with mixed findings. FoG, as a paroxysmal phenomenon, provides an ideal framework for the possibility of closed-loop DBS (CL-DBS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In this clinical trial (NCT02318927), five subjects with medication-refractory FoG underwent bilateral GPi DBS implantation to address levodopa-responsive PD symptoms with open-loop stimulation. Additionally, PPN DBS leads were implanted for CL-DBS to treat FoG. The primary outcome of the study was a 40% improvement in medication-refractory FoG in 60% of subjects at 6 months when “on” PPN CL-DBS. Secondary outcomes included device feasibility to gauge the recruitment potential of this four-lead DBS approach for a potentially larger clinical trial. Safety was judged based on adverse events and explantation rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings: The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated as we recruited five subjects with both “on” and “off” medication freezing. The safety for this population of patients receiving four DBS leads was suboptimal and associated with a high explantation rate of 40%. The primary clinical outcome in three of the five subjects was achieved at 6 months. However, the group analysis of the primary clinical outcome did not reveal any benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: This study of a human PPN CL-DBS trial in medication-refractory FoG showed feasibility in recruitment, suboptimal safety, and a heterogeneous clinical effect in FoG outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Behavioral Time Scale Plasticity of Place Fields: Mathematical Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.640235</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.640235</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional synaptic plasticity experiments and models depend on tight temporal correlations between pre- and postsynaptic activity. These tight temporal correlations, on the order of tens of milliseconds, are incompatible with significantly longer behavioral time scales, and as such might not be able to account for plasticity induced by behavior. Indeed, recent findings in hippocampus suggest that rapid, bidirectional synaptic plasticity which modifies place fields in CA1 operates at behavioral time scales. These experimental results suggest that presynaptic activity generates synaptic eligibility traces both for potentiation and depression, which last on the order of seconds. These traces can be converted to changes in synaptic efficacies by the activation of an instructive signal that depends on naturally occurring or experimentally induced plateau potentials. We have developed a simple mathematical model that is consistent with these observations. This model can be fully analyzed to find the fixed points of induced place fields and how these fixed points depend on system parameters such as the size and shape of presynaptic place fields, the animal's velocity during induction, and the parameters of the plasticity rule. We also make predictions about the convergence time to these fixed points, both for induced and pre-existing place fields.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Crosstalk Between ATP-P2X7 and Adenosine A2A Receptors Controlling Neuroinflammation in Rats Subject to Repeated Restraint Stress</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.639322</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.639322</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Depressive conditions precipitated by repeated stress are a major socio-economical burden in Western countries. Previous studies showed that ATP-P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt;R) and adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R) antagonists attenuate behavioral modifications upon exposure to repeated stress. Since it is unknown if these two purinergic modulation systems work independently, we now investigated a putative interplay between P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt;R and A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R. Adult rats exposed to restraint stress for 14 days displayed an anxious (thigmotaxis, elevated plus maze), depressive (anhedonia, increased immobility), and amnesic (modified Y maze, object displacement) profile, together with increased expression of Iba-1 (a marker of microglia “activation”) and interleukin-1β (IL1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα; proinflammatory cytokines) and an up-regulation of P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt;R (mRNA) and A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R (receptor binding) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. All these features were attenuated by the P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt;R-preferring antagonist brilliant blue G (BBG, 45 mg/kg, i.p.) or by caffeine (0.3 g/L, p.o.), which affords neuroprotection through A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R blockade. Notably, BBG attenuated A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R upregulation and caffeine attenuated P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt;R upregulation. In microglial N9 cells, the P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt;R agonist BzATP (100 μM) or the A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R agonist CGS26180 (100 nM) increased calcium levels, which was abrogated by the P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist JNJ47965567 (1 μM) and by the A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonist SCH58261 (50 nM), respectively; notably JNJ47965567 prevented the effect of CGS21680 and the effect of BzATP was attenuated by SCH58261 and increased by CGS21680. These results provide the first demonstration of a functional interaction between P&lt;sub&gt;2X7&lt;/sub&gt;R and A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R controlling microglia reactivity likely involved in behavioral adaptive responses to stress and are illustrative of a cooperation between the two arms of the purinergic system in the control of brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Spontaneous Ca2+ Fluctuations Arise in Thin Astrocytic Processes With Real 3D Geometry</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.617989</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.617989</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fluctuations of cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration in astrocytes are regarded as a critical non-neuronal signal to regulate neuronal functions. Although such fluctuations can be evoked by neuronal activity, rhythmic astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations may also spontaneously arise. Experimental studies hint that these spontaneous astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations may lie behind different kinds of emerging neuronal synchronized activities, like epileptogenic bursts or slow-wave rhythms. Despite the potential importance of spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations in astrocytes, the mechanism by which they develop is poorly understood. Using simple 3D synapse models and kinetic data of astrocytic Glu transporters (EAATs) and the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exchanger (NCX), we have previously shown that NCX activity alone can generate markedly stable, spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillation in the astrocytic leaflet microdomain. Here, we extend that model by incorporating experimentally determined real 3D geometries of 208 excitatory synapses reconstructed from publicly available ultra-resolution electron microscopy datasets. Our simulations predict that the surface/volume ratio (SVR) of peri-synaptic astrocytic processes prominently dictates whether NCX-mediated spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations emerge. We also show that increased levels of intracellular astrocytic Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration facilitate the appearance of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; fluctuations. These results further support the principal role of the dynamical reshaping of astrocyte processes in the generation of intrinsic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations and their spreading over larger astrocytic compartments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Locus Coeruleus Malfunction Is Linked to Psychopathology in Prodromal Dementia With Lewy Bodies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.641101</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.641101</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The locus coeruleus (LC) is a nucleus in the human brainstem with a variety of noradrenaline-driven functions involved in cognition, emotions, and perception. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) constitutes a neurodegenerative disease involving deposits of alpha-synuclein, first appearing in the brainstem. The goal of this narrative review is to delineate the relationship between the expression of psychiatric symptoms as an early-onset of DLB and the degeneration of the LC's noradrenaline system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We searched in PubMed for relevant articles concerning LC degeneration and psychiatric symptoms in prodromal DLB in this narrative review. We rely on the McKeith criteria for prodromal psychiatric DLB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found four studies that document neuronal loss, deposits of Lewy bodies and other hints for neurodegeneration in the LC in patients with DLB. Furthermore, we reviewed theories and studies on how the degenerated noradrenaline LC system contributes to psychiatric DLB's phenotype. We hypothesized how anxiety, hallucinations, delusions, and depressive symptoms might occur in DLB patients due to degenerated noradrenergic neurons entailing consecutive altered noradrenergic transmission in the LC's projection areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: LC degeneration in prodromal DLB might cause psychiatric symptoms as the first and non-motor manifestation of DLB, as the LC is affected earlier by degeneration than are dopaminergic structures such as the substantia nigra, which are impaired later in the disease course.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Contributions of Age-Related and Audibility-Related Deficits to Aided Consonant Identification in Presbycusis: A Causal-Inference Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.640522</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.640522</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The decline of speech intelligibility in presbycusis can be regarded as resulting from the combined contribution of two main groups of factors: (1) audibility-related factors and (2) age-related factors. In particular, there is now an abundant scientific literature on the crucial role of suprathreshold auditory abilities and cognitive functions, which have been found to decline with age even in the absence of audiometric hearing loss. However, researchers investigating the direct effect of aging in presbycusis have to deal with the methodological issue that age and peripheral hearing loss covary to a large extent. In the present study, we analyzed a dataset of consonant-identification scores measured in quiet and in noise for a large cohort (n = 459, age = 42–92) of hearing-impaired (HI) and normal-hearing (NH) listeners. HI listeners were provided with a frequency-dependent amplification adjusted to their audiometric profile. Their scores in the two conditions were predicted from their pure-tone average (PTA) and age, as well as from their Extended Speech Intelligibility Index (ESII), a measure of the impact of audibility loss on speech intelligibility. We relied on a causal-inference approach combined with Bayesian modeling to disentangle the direct causal effects of age and audibility on intelligibility from the indirect effect of age on hearing loss. The analysis revealed that the direct effect of PTA on HI intelligibility scores was 5 times higher than the effect of age. This overwhelming effect of PTA was not due to a residual audibility loss despite amplification, as confirmed by a ESII-based model. More plausibly, the marginal role of age could be a consequence of the relatively little cognitively-demanding task used in this study. Furthermore, the amount of variance in intelligibility scores was smaller for NH than HI listeners, even after accounting for age and audibility, reflecting the presence of additional suprathreshold deficits in the latter group. Although the non-sense-syllable materials and the particular amplification settings used in this study potentially restrict the generalization of the findings, we think that these promising results call for a wider use of causal-inference analysis in audiology, e.g., as a way to disentangle the influence of the various cognitive factors and suprathreshold deficits associated to presbycusis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Diagnostic Value of Exosome-Derived Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637218</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637218</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnoses once depended on neuropathologic examination. Now, many widely used, validated biomarkers benefits for monitoring of AD neuropathologic changes. Exosome-derived biomarker studies have reported them to be significantly related to AD's early occurrence and development, although the findings are inconclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis was to identify exosome-derived biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed, PubMed Central, Web of Science, Embase, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) were searched for studies assessing the diagnostic value of biomarkers, including data describing the pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive diagnostic likelihood ratio (DLR+), negative diagnostic likelihood ratio (DLR–), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC). The quality of the included studies was assessed using RevMan 5.3 software. Publication bias was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In total, 19 eligible studies, including 3,742 patients, were selected for this meta-analysis. The SEN, SPE, DLR+, DLR–, DOR, and AUC (95% confidence intervals) of exosome-derived biomarkers in the diagnosis of AD or MCI were 0.83 (0.76–0.87), 0.82 (0.77–0.86), 4.53 (3.46–5.93), 0.21 (0.15–0.29), 17.27 (11.41–26.14), and 0.89 (0.86–0.92), respectively. Sub-group analyses revealed that studies based on serum or microRNA (miRNA) analysis, and those of Caucasian populations, AD patients, patient sample size &amp;gt;50, neuron-derived exosomes (NDE) from plasma and p-tau had higher sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Exosome-derived biomarkers have shown potential diagnostic value in AD and MCI, although further research is required for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Impaired Learning and Memory Ability Induced by a Bilaterally Hippocampal Injection of Streptozotocin in Mice: Involved With the Adaptive Changes of Synaptic Plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.633495</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms and behavioral disorders, resulting in disability, and loss of self-sufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To establish an AD-like mice model, investigate the behavioral performance, and explore the potential mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Streptozotocin (STZ, 3 mg/kg) was microinjected bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice, and the behavioral performance was observed. The serum concentrations of insulin and nesfatin-1 were measured by ELISA, and the activation of hippocampal microglia and astrocytes was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The protein expression of several molecular associated with the regulation of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) was detected via western blotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The STZ-microinjected model mice showed a slower bodyweight gain and higher serum concentration of insulin and nesfatin-1. Although there was no significant difference between groups with regard to the ability of balance and motor coordination, the model mice presented a decline of spontaneous movement and exploratory behavior, together with an impairment of learning and memory ability. Increased activated microglia was aggregated in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of model mice, together with an increase abundance of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1−42&lt;/sub&gt; and Tau in the hippocampus and PFC. Moreover, the protein expression of NMDAR2A, NMDAR2B, SynGAP, PSD95, BDNF, and p-β-catenin/β-catenin were remarkably decreased in the hippocampus and the PFC of model mice, and the expression of p-GSK-3β (ser9)/GSK-3β were reduced in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: A bilateral hippocampal microinjection of STZ could induce not only AD-like behavioral performance in mice, but also adaptive changes of synaptic plasticity against neuroinflammatory and endocrinal injuries. The underlying mechanisms might be associated with the imbalanced expression of the key proteins of Wnt signaling pathway in the hippocampus and the PFC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Elamipretide (SS-31) Improves Functional Connectivity in Hippocampus and Other Related Regions Following Prolonged Neuroinflammation Induced by Lipopolysaccharide in Aged Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.600484</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation has been recognized as a major cause for neurocognitive diseases. Although the hippocampus has been considered an important region for cognitive dysfunction, the influence of hippocampal neuroinflammation on brain functional connectivity (FC) has been rarely studied. In this study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation in the aged rat brain, while elamipretide (SS-31) was used for treatment. Systemic and hippocampal inflammation were determined using ELISA, while astrocyte responses during hippocampal neuroinflammation were determined by interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β)/tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) double staining immunofluorescence. Oxidative stress was determined by reactive oxidative species (ROS), electron transport chain (ETC) complex, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Short- (&amp;lt;7 days) and long-term (&amp;gt;30 days) learning and spatial working memory were tested by the Morris water maze (MWM). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to analyze the brain FC by placing seed voxels on the left and right hippocampus. Compared with the vehicle group, rats with the LPS exposure showed an impaired MWM performance, higher oxidative stress, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, and astrocyte activation in the hippocampus. The neuroimaging examination showed decreased FC on the right orbital cortex, right olfactory bulb, and left hippocampus on day 3, 7, and 31, respectively, after treatment. In contrast, rats with SS-31 treatment showed lower levels of inflammatory cytokines, less astrocyte activation in the hippocampus, and improved MWM performance. Neuroimaging examination showed increased FC on the left-parietal association cortex (L-PAC), left sensory cortex, and left motor cortex on day 7 with the right flocculonodular lobe on day 31 as compared with those without SS-31 treatment. Our study demonstrated that inhibiting neuroinflammation in the hippocampus not only reduces inflammatory responses in the hippocampus but also improves the brain FC in regions related to the hippocampus. Furthermore, early anti-inflammatory treatment with SS-31 has a long-lasting effect on reducing the impact of LPS-induced neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Dorsolateral Prefrontal Functional Connectivity Predicts Working Memory Training Gains</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.592261</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.592261</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Normal aging is associated with working memory decline. A decrease in working memory performance is associated with age-related changes in functional activation patterns in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Cognitive training can improve cognitive performance in healthy older adults. We implemented a cognitive training study to assess determinants of generalization of training gains to untrained tasks, a key indicator for the effectiveness of cognitive training. We aimed to investigate the association of resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of DLPFC with working memory performance improvement and cognitive gains after the training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: A sample of 60 healthy older adults (mean age: 68 years) underwent a 4-week neuropsychological training, entailing a working memory task. Baseline resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) images were acquired in order to investigate the FC of DLPFC. To evaluate training effects, participants underwent a neuropsychological assessment before and after the training. A second follow-up assessment was applied 12 weeks after the training. We used cognitive scores of digit span backward and visual block span backward tasks representing working memory function. The training group was divided into subjects who had and who did not have training gains, which was defined as a higher improvement in working memory tasks than the control group (N = 19).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A high FC of DLPFC of the right hemisphere was significantly associated with training gains and performance improvement in the visuospatial task. The maintenance of cognitive gains was restricted to the time period directly after the training. The training group showed performance improvement in the digit span backward task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Functional activation patterns of the DLPFC were associated with the degree of working memory training gains and visuospatial performance improvement. Although improvement through cognitive training and acquisition of training gains are possible in aging, they remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Parathyroid hormone attenuates osteoarthritis pain by remodeling subchondral bone in mice</title>

	<description>Osteoarthritis, a highly prevalent degenerative joint disorder, is characterized by joint pain and disability. Available treatments fail to modify osteoarthritis progression and decrease joint pain effectively. Here, we show that intermittent parathyroid hormone (iPTH) attenuates osteoarthritis pain by inhibiting subchondral sensory innervation, subchondral bone deterioration, and articular cartilage degeneration in a destabilized medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model. We found that subchondral sensory innervation for osteoarthritis pain was significantly decreased in PTH-treated DMM mice compared with vehicle-treated DMM mice. In parallel, deterioration of subchondral bone microarchitecture in DMM mice was attenuated by iPTH treatment. Increased level of prostaglandin E2 in subchondral bone of DMM mice was reduced by iPTH treatment. Furthermore, uncoupled subchondral bone remodeling caused by increased transforming growth factor β signaling was regulated by PTH-induced endocytosis of the PTH type 1 receptor–transforming growth factor β type 2 receptor complex. Notably, iPTH improved subchondral bone microarchitecture, and decreased level of prostaglandin E2 and sensory innervation of subchondral bone in DMM mice by acting specifically through PTH type 1 receptor in Nestin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mesenchymal stromal cells. Thus, iPTH could be a potential disease-modifying therapy for osteoarthritis.</description>

	<title>eLife: Latrophilin GPCR signaling mediates synapse formation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.65717</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65717</link>
	<description>Neural circuit assembly in the brain requires precise establishment of synaptic connections, but the mechanisms of synapse assembly remain incompletely understood. Latrophilins are postsynaptic adhesion-GPCRs that engage in trans-synaptic complexes with presynaptic teneurins and FLRTs. In mouse CA1-region neurons, Latrophilin-2 and Latrophilin-3 are essential for formation of entorhinal-cortex-derived and Schaffer-collateral-derived synapses, respectively. However, it is unknown whether latrophilins function as GPCRs in synapse formation. Here, we show that Latrophilin-2 and Latrophilin-3 exhibit constitutive GPCR activity that increases cAMP levels, which was blocked by a mutation interfering with G-protein and arrestin interactions of GPCRs. The same mutation impaired the ability of Latrophilin-2 and Latrophilin-3 to rescue the synapse-loss phenotype in Latrophilin-2 and Latrophilin-3 knockout neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Our results suggest that Latrophilin-2 and Latrophilin-3 require GPCR signaling in synapse formation, indicating that latrophilins promote synapse formation in the hippocampus by activating a classical GPCR-signaling pathway.</description>

	<description>BLM (Bloom syndrome protein) is a RECQ-family helicase involved in the dissolution of complex DNA structures and repair intermediates. Synthetic lethality analysis implicates BLM as a promising target in a range of cancers with defects in the DNA damage response; however, selective small molecule inhibitors of defined mechanism are currently lacking. Here, we identify and characterise a specific inhibitor of BLM’s ATPase-coupled DNA helicase activity, by allosteric trapping of a DNA-bound translocation intermediate. Crystallographic structures of BLM-DNA-ADP-inhibitor complexes identify a hitherto unknown interdomain interface, whose opening and closing are integral to translocation of ssDNA, and which provides a highly selective pocket for drug discovery. Comparison with structures of other RECQ helicases provides a model for branch migration of Holliday junctions by BLM.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64806</link>
	<description>Interleukin-4-induced-1 (IL4i1) is an amino acid oxidase secreted from immune cells. Recent observations have suggested that IL4i1 is pro-tumorigenic via unknown mechanisms. As IL4i1 has homologues in snake venoms (LAAO, L-amino acid oxidases), we used comparative approaches to gain insight into the mechanistic basis of how conserved amino acid oxidases regulate cell fate and function. Using mammalian expressed recombinant proteins, we found venom LAAO kills cells via hydrogen peroxide generation. By contrast, mammalian IL4i1 is non-cytotoxic and instead elicits a cell productive gene expression program inhibiting ferroptotic redox death by generating indole-3-pyruvate (I3P) from tryptophan. I3P suppresses ferroptosis by direct free radical scavenging and through the activation of an anti-oxidative gene expression program. Thus, the pro-tumor effects of IL4i1 are likely mediated by local anti-ferroptotic pathways via aromatic amino acid metabolism, arguing that an IL4i1 inhibitor may modulate tumor cell death pathways.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63333</link>
	<description>Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy improves survival in breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, long-term treatment comes with side effects that impact health and quality of life, including hot flashes, changes in bone density, and fatigue. Partly due to a lack of proven animal models, the tissues and cells that mediate these negative side effects are unclear. Here, we show that mice undergoing tamoxifen treatment experience changes in temperature, bone, and movement. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that tamoxifen treatment induces widespread gene expression changes in the hypothalamus and preoptic area (hypothalamus-POA). These expression changes are dependent on estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), as conditional knockout of ERα in the hypothalamus-POA ablates or reverses tamoxifen-induced gene expression. Accordingly, ERα-deficient mice do not exhibit tamoxifen-induced changes in temperature, bone, or movement. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the effects of tamoxifen on the hypothalamus-POA and indicate that ERα mediates several physiological effects of tamoxifen treatment in mice.</description>

	<description>The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) stimulates a coordinated anabolic program in response to growth-promoting signals. Paradoxically, recent studies indicate that mTORC1 can activate the transcription factor ATF4 through mechanisms distinct from its canonical induction by the integrated stress response (ISR). However, its broader roles as a downstream target of mTORC1 are unknown. Therefore, we directly compared ATF4-dependent transcriptional changes induced upon insulin-stimulated mTORC1 signaling to those activated by the ISR. In multiple mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) and human cancer cell lines, the mTORC1-ATF4 pathway stimulated expression of only a subset of the ATF4 target genes induced by the ISR, including genes involved in amino acid uptake, synthesis, and tRNA charging. We demonstrate that ATF4 is a metabolic effector of mTORC1 involved in both its established role in promoting protein synthesis and in a previously unappreciated function for mTORC1 in stimulating cellular cystine uptake and glutathione synthesis.</description>

	<title>eLife: Cystic proliferation of germline stem cells is necessary to reproductive success and normal mating behavior in medaka</title>

	<description>The production of an adequate number of gametes is necessary for normal reproduction, for which the regulation of proliferation from early gonadal development to adulthood is key in both sexes. Cystic proliferation of germline stem cells is an especially important step prior to the beginning of meiosis; however, the molecular regulators of this proliferation remain elusive in vertebrates. Here, we report that &lt;i&gt;ndrg1b&lt;/i&gt; is an important regulator of cystic proliferation in medaka. We generated mutants of &lt;i&gt;ndrg1b&lt;/i&gt; that led to a disruption of germ cells cystic proliferation. This loss of cystic proliferation was observed from embryogenic to adult stages, impacting the success of gamete production and reproductive parameters such as spawning and fertilization. Interestingly, the depletion of cystic proliferation also impacted male sexual behavior, with a decrease of mating vigor. These data illustrate why it is also necessary to consider gamete production capacity in order to analyze reproductive behavior.</description>

	<description>Glia modulate neuronal excitability and seizure sensitivity by maintaining potassium and water homeostasis. A SIK3-regulated gene expression program controls the glial capacity to buffer K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and water in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, however upstream regulatory mechanisms are unknown. Here we identify an octopaminergic circuit linking neuronal activity to glial ion and water buffering. Under basal conditions, octopamine functions through the inhibitory octopaminergic GPCR OctbR to upregulate glial buffering capacity, while under pathological K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; stress, octopamine signals through the stimulatory octopaminergic GPCR OAMB1 to downregulate the glial buffering program. Failure to downregulate this program leads to intracellular glia swelling and stress signaling, suggesting that turning down this pathway is glioprotective. In the &lt;i&gt;eag shaker &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; seizure model, the SIK3-mediated buffering pathway in inactivated. Re-activation of the glial buffering program dramatically suppresses neuronal hyperactivity, seizures, and shortened lifespan in this mutant. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of a glial-centric therapeutic strategy for diseases of hyperexcitability.</description>

	<description>&lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; expresses human Werner syndrome protein (WRN) orthologs as two distinct proteins: MUT-7, with a 3'-5' exonuclease domain, and CeWRN-1, with helicase domains. How these domains cooperate remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate the different contributions of MUT-7 and CeWRN-1 to 22G small interfering RNA (siRNA) synthesis and the plasticity of neuronal signaling. MUT-7 acts specifically in the cytoplasm to promote siRNA biogenesis and in the nucleus to associate with CeWRN-1. The import of siRNA by the nuclear Argonaute NRDE-3 promotes the loading of the heterochromatin-binding protein HP1 homolog HPL-2 onto specific loci. This heterochromatin complex represses the gene expression of the guanylyl cyclase ODR-1 to direct olfactory plasticity in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Our findings suggest that the exonuclease and helicase domains of human WRN may act in concert to promote RNA-dependent loading into a heterochromatin complex, and the failure of this entire process reduces plasticity in postmitotic neurons.</description>

	<title>eLife: Neural encoding of actual and imagined touch within human posterior parietal cortex</title>

	<description>In the human posterior parietal cortex (PPC), single units encode high-dimensional information with &lt;i&gt;partially mixed&lt;/i&gt; representations that enable small populations of neurons to encode many variables relevant to movement planning, execution, cognition, and perception. Here, we test whether a PPC neuronal population previously demonstrated to encode visual and motor information is similarly engaged in the somatosensory domain. We recorded neurons within the PPC of a human clinical trial participant during actual touch presentation and during a tactile imagery task. Neurons encoded actual touch at short latency with bilateral receptive fields, organized by body part, and covered all tested regions. The tactile imagery task evoked body part-specific responses that shared a neural substrate with actual touch. Our results are the first neuron-level evidence of touch encoding in human PPC and its cognitive engagement during a tactile imagery task, which may reflect semantic processing, attention, sensory anticipation, or imagined touch.</description>

	<description>The study revealed a significant reduction of frequency and severity of seizure in patients of generalized epilepsy with generalized onset motor seizures in adults who were treated with valproate and melatonin

Abstract
Epilepsy treatment is challenging because of multiple impediments like lack of efficacy of monotherapy, adverse drug reactions, and different comorbidities. Add‐on therapy to first‐line antiepileptics may be the option to overcome therapeutic hurdles. The present randomized, double‐blind, add‐on placebo‐controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of add‐on melatonin in the treatment of generalized epilepsy with generalized onset motor seizure in adults. The control group (n = 52) received add‐on placebo, and the test group (n = 52) received add‐on melatonin (3 mg/day) with valproate (20 mg/kg in two divided doses). Clinical evaluation of seizure frequency, Chalfont‐National Hospital seizure severity scale (NHS3), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), quality of life in epilepsy inventory, Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), and biochemical estimation of serum neuron‐specific enolase (NSE) and glutathione reductase were done at baseline and compared with follow‐up at 8 weeks. Among 104 patients randomized [mean (SD) age of 27.6 (11.5); 84 (80.8%) male], 88 (84.6%) completed the trial. The responder rate and seizure‐free rate in the test group were significantly (p = 0.006 and 0.034) higher than the control group. There was a significantly higher reduction in the frequency of seizures (p = 0.016) and NHS3 (−2.39; 95%CI: −4.56 to −0.21; p = 0.032) in the test group compared to the control group. Similarly, improvement in PSQI (−1.40; 95%CI: −2.64 to −0.15; p = 0.029) was significantly better in the test group. There was no significant difference in the change in ESS (p = 0.621) and quality of life scoring (p = 0.456) between the study groups. The decrease in serum NSE was significantly higher with the test group compared to the control group (−2.01; 95% CI: −3.74 to −0.27; p = 0.024). Add‐on melatonin increased serum glutathione reductase significantly (p = 0.038), but there was no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.685). Add‐on melatonin with valproate for generalized epilepsy with generalized onset motor seizures in adults can achieve a significantly better clinical outcome by reducing the seizure frequency, severity and attaining a better seizure‐free rate in comparison to the control group.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Long‐Term Safety and Efficacy of Eculizumab in Aquaporin‐4 IgG‐Positive NMOSD</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26049</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26049?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
During PREVENT (NCT01892345), eculizumab significantly reduced relapse risk versus placebo in patients with aquaporin‐4 immunoglobulin G‐positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4‐IgG+ NMOSD). We report an interim analysis of PREVENT's ongoing open‐label extension (OLE; NCT02003144) evaluating eculizumab's long‐term safety and efficacy.


Methods
Patients who completed PREVENT could enroll in the OLE to receive eculizumab (maintenance dose = 1,200 mg/2 weeks, after a blinded induction phase). Safety and efficacy data from PREVENT and its OLE (interim data cut, July 31, 2019) were combined for this analysis.


Results
Across PREVENT and the OLE, 137 patients received eculizumab and were monitored for a median (range) of 133.3 weeks (5.1–276.9 weeks), for a combined total of 362.3 patient‐years (PY). Treatment‐related adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) rates were 183.5 in 100 PY and 8.6 in 100 PY, respectively. Serious infection rates were 10.2 in 100 PY in eculizumab‐treated patients versus 15.1 in 100 PY in the PREVENT placebo group. No patient developed a meningococcal infection. At 192 weeks (3.7 years), 94.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88.6–97.3) of patients remained adjudicated relapse‐free. The adjudicated annualized relapse rate was 0.025 (95% CI = 0.013–0.048) in all eculizumab‐treated patients versus 0.350 (95% CI = 0.199–0.616) in the PREVENT placebo group. During the OLE, 37% of patients (44 of 119 patients) stopped or decreased background immunosuppressive therapy use.


Interpretation
This analysis demonstrates that eculizumab's long‐term safety profile in NMOSD is consistent with its established profile across other indications. This analysis also demonstrated the sustained ability of long‐term eculizumab treatment to reduce relapse risk in patients with AQP4‐IgG+ NMOSD. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Probabilistic value learning in medial temporal lobe amnesia</title>

	<description>Abstract
A prevailing view in cognitive neuroscience suggests that different forms of learning are mediated by dissociable memory systems, with a mesolimbic (i.e., midbrain and basal ganglia) system supporting incremental trial‐and‐error reinforcement learning and a hippocampal‐based system supporting episodic memory. Yet, growing evidence suggests that the hippocampus may also be important for trial‐and‐error learning, particularly value or reward‐based learning. In the present report, we use a lesion‐based neuropsychological approach to clarify hippocampal contributions to such learning. Six amnesic patients with medial temporal lobe damage and a group of healthy controls were administered a simple value‐based learning task involving probabilistic trial‐and‐error acquisition of stimulus–response‐outcome (reward or none) contingencies modeled after Li et al. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
, 2011, 108
(1), 55–60). As predicted, patients were significantly impaired on the task, demonstrating reduced learning of the contingencies. Our results provide further supportive evidence that the hippocampus' role in cognition extends beyond episodic memory tasks and call for further refinement of theoretical models of hippocampal functioning.</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: The unique plasticity of hippocampal adult‐born neurons: Contributing to a heterogeneous dentate</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/10.1002/hipo.23318</guid>

	<description>Abstract
The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is evolutionarily conserved as one of the few sites of adult neurogenesis in mammals. Although there is clear evidence that neurogenesis is necessary for healthy hippocampal function, whether adult‐born neurons are simply integrated into existing hippocampal networks to serve a similar purpose to that of developmentally born neurons or whether they represent a discrete cell population with unique functions remains less clear. In this review, we consider evidence for discrete cellular, synaptic, and structural features of adult‐born DG neurons, suggesting that neurogenesis contributes to the formation of a heterogeneous DG. We therefore propose that hippocampal neurogenesis creates a specialized neuronal subpopulation that may play a key role in hippocampal functions like episodic memory. We note critical gaps in this extensive body of work, including a general failure to include female animals in relevant research and a need for more precise consideration of intrahippocampal neuroanatomy.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Early Predictors of 9‐Year Disability in Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26052</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26052?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess early predictors of 9‐year disability in pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis.


Methods
Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments of 123 pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis were obtained at disease onset and after 1 and 2 years. A 9‐year clinical follow‐up was also performed. Cox proportional hazard and multivariable regression models were used to assess independent predictors of time to first relapse and 9‐year outcomes.


Results
Time to first relapse was predicted by optic nerve lesions (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.10, p = 0.02) and high‐efficacy treatment exposure (HR = 0.31, p = 0.005). Predictors of annualized relapse rate were: at baseline, presence of cerebellar (β = −0.15, p &amp;lt; 0.001), cervical cord lesions (β = 0.16, p = 0.003), and high‐efficacy treatment exposure (β = −0.14, p = 0.01); considering also 1‐year variables, number of relapses (β = 0.14, p = 0.002), and the previous baseline predictors; considering 2‐year variables, time to first relapse (2‐year: β = −0.12, p = 0.01) entered, whereas high‐efficacy treatment exposure exited the model. Predictors of 9‐year disability worsening were: at baseline, presence of optic nerve lesions (odds ratio [OR] = 6.45, p = 0.01); considering 1‐year and 2‐year variables, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) changes (1‐year: OR = 26.05, p &amp;lt; 0.001; 2‐year: OR = 16.38, p = 0.02), and ≥ 2 new T2‐lesions in 2 years (2‐year: OR = 4.91, p = 0.02). Predictors of higher 9‐year EDSS score were: at baseline, EDSS score (β = 0.58, p &amp;lt; 0.001), presence of brainstem lesions (β = 0.31, p = 0.04), and number of cervical cord lesions (β = 0.22, p = 0.05); considering 1‐year and 2‐year variables, EDSS changes (1‐year: β = 0.79, p &amp;lt; 0.001; 2‐year: β = 0.55, p &amp;lt; 0.001), and ≥ 2 new T2‐lesions (1‐year: β = 0.28, p = 0.03; 2‐year: β = 0.35, p = 0.01).


Interpretation
A complete baseline MRI assessment and an accurate clinical and MRI monitoring during the first 2 years of disease contribute to predict 9‐year prognosis in pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<description>Two‐dimensional (2D) gene expression snapshots cannot properly reflect the volumes, positions, or overlapped domains of multiple genes in tissues that are organized in three‐dimensional (3D) naturally. Novel approach, combing fluorescent antisense mRNA labeling, confocal z‐stack acquisition, and 3D image alignment tool, has uncovered what have been overlooked by 2D images.

Abstract
The conserved bilateral habenular nuclei (HA) in vertebrate diencephalon develop into compartmentalized structures containing neurons derived from different cell lineages. Despite extensive studies demonstrated that zebrafish larval HA display distinct left–right (L‐R) asymmetry in gene expression and connectivity, the spatial gene expression domains were mainly obtained from two‐dimensional (2D) snapshots of colorimetric RNA in situ hybridization staining which could not properly reflect different HA neuronal lineages constructed in three‐dimension (3D). Combing the tyramide‐based fluorescent mRNA in situ hybridization, confocal microscopy and customized imaging processing procedures, we have created spatial distribution maps of four genes for 4‐day‐old zebrafish and in sibling fish whose L‐R asymmetry was spontaneously reversed. 3D volumetric analyses showed that ratios of cpd2, lov, ron, and nrp1a expression in L‐R reversed HA were reversed according to the parapineal positions. However, the quantitative changes of gene expression in reversed larval brains do not mirror the gene expression level in the obverse larval brains. There were a total 87.78% increase in lov+nrp1a+ and a total 12.45% decrease in lov+ron+ double‐positive neurons when the L‐R asymmetry of HA was reversed. Thus, our volumetric analyses of the 3D maps indicate that changes of HA neuronal cell fates are associated with the reversal of HA laterality. These changes likely account for the behavior changes associated with HA laterality alterations.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Extracellular matrix density regulates the formation of tumour spheroids through cell migration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008764</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Inês G. Gonçalves, Jose Manuel Garcia-Aznar&lt;/p&gt;

In this work, we show how the mechanical properties of the cellular microenvironment modulate the growth of tumour spheroids. Based on the composition of the extracellular matrix, its stiffness and architecture can significantly vary, subsequently influencing cell movement and tumour growth. However, it is still unclear exactly how both of these processes are regulated by the matrix composition. Here, we present a centre-based computational model that describes how collagen density, which modulates the steric hindrance properties of the matrix, governs individual cell migration and, consequently, leads to the formation of multicellular clusters of varying size. The model was calibrated using previously published experimental data, replicating a set of experiments in which cells were seeded in collagen matrices of different collagen densities, hence producing distinct mechanical properties. At an initial stage, we tracked individual cell trajectories and speeds. Subsequently, the formation of multicellular clusters was also analysed by quantifying their size. Overall, the results showed that our model could accurately replicate what was previously seen experimentally. Specifically, we showed that cells seeded in matrices with low collagen density tended to migrate more. Accordingly, cells strayed away from their original cluster and thus promoted the formation of small structures. In contrast, we also showed that high collagen densities hindered cell migration and produced multicellular clusters with increased volume. In conclusion, this model not only establishes a relation between matrix density and individual cell migration but also showcases how migration, or its inhibition, modulates tumour growth.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sFxlUIOZPQE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The vast expansion of protein sequence databases provides an opportunity for new protein design approaches which seek to learn the sequence-function relationship directly from natural sequence variation. Deep generative models trained on protein sequence data have been shown to learn biologically meaningful representations helpful for a variety of downstream tasks, but their potential for direct use in the design of novel proteins remains largely unexplored. Here we show that variational autoencoders trained on a dataset of almost 70000 luciferase-like oxidoreductases can be used to generate novel, functional variants of the &lt;i&gt;luxA&lt;/i&gt; bacterial luciferase. We propose separate VAE models to work with aligned sequence input (MSA VAE) and raw sequence input (AR-VAE), and offer evidence that while both are able to reproduce patterns of amino acid usage characteristic of the family, the MSA VAE is better able to capture long-distance dependencies reflecting the influence of 3D structure. To confirm the practical utility of the models, we used them to generate variants of &lt;i&gt;luxA&lt;/i&gt; whose luminescence activity was validated experimentally. We further showed that conditional variants of both models could be used to increase the solubility of &lt;i&gt;luxA&lt;/i&gt; without disrupting function. Altogether 6/12 of the variants generated using the unconditional AR-VAE and 9/11 generated using the unconditional MSA VAE retained measurable luminescence, together with all 23 of the less distant variants generated by conditional versions of the models; the most distant functional variant contained 35 differences relative to the nearest training set sequence. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep generative models to explore the space of possible protein sequences and generate useful variants, providing a method complementary to rational design and directed evolution approaches.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QpiAk3DhhIo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Evidence for spreading seizure as a cause of theta-alpha activity electrographic pattern in stereo-EEG seizure recordings</title>

Intracranial electroencephalography is a standard tool in clinical evaluation of patients with focal epilepsy. Various early electrographic seizure patterns differing in frequency, amplitude, and waveform of the oscillations are observed. The pattern most common in the areas of seizure propagation is the so-called theta-alpha activity (TAA), whose defining features are oscillations in the &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt; − &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; range and gradually increasing amplitude. A deeper understanding of the mechanism underlying the generation of the TAA pattern is however lacking. In this work we evaluate the hypothesis that the TAA patterns are caused by seizures spreading across the cortex. To do so, we perform simulations of seizure dynamics on detailed patient-derived cortical surfaces using the spreading seizure model as well as reference models with one or two homogeneous sources. We then detect the occurrences of the TAA patterns both in the simulated stereo-electroencephalographic signals and in the signals of recorded epileptic seizures from a cohort of fifty patients, and we compare the features of the groups of detected TAA patterns to assess the plausibility of the different models. Our results show that spreading seizure hypothesis is qualitatively consistent with the evidence available in the seizure recordings, and it can explain the features of the detected TAA groups best among the examined models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/G9bY6GLE3wg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Estimating the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 with imperfect serological tests: Exploiting cutoff-free approaches</title>

Large-scale serological testing in the population is essential to determine the true extent of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and use predefined cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives and use this as a proxy for past infection. With the imperfect assays that are currently available to test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of the cumulative incidence and is usually corrected to account for the sensitivity and specificity. Here we use an inference method—referred to as &lt;i&gt;mixture-model approach&lt;/i&gt;—for the estimation of the cumulative incidence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure. We confirm that the mixture model outperforms the methods based on cutoffs, leading to less bias and error in estimates of the cumulative incidence. We illustrate how the mixture model can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests. We also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the test’s ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the cumulative incidence. Lastly, we show how this approach can be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of classes of infections with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures. This is a very promising application of the mixture-model approach that could identify the elusive fraction of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. An R-package implementing the inference methods used in this paper is provided. Our study advocates using serological tests without cutoffs, especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals. This approach circumvents some of the shortcomings of cutoff-based methods at exactly the low cumulative incidence levels and test accuracies that we are currently facing in SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3sv3SljaHIQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Low-cost, high-throughput sequencing has led to an enormous increase in the number of sequenced microbial genomes, with well over 100,000 genomes in public archives today. Automatic genome annotation tools are integral to understanding these organisms, yet older gene finding methods must be retrained on each new genome. We have developed a universal model of prokaryotic genes by fitting a temporal convolutional network to amino-acid sequences from a large, diverse set of microbial genomes. We incorporated the new model into a gene finding system, Balrog (Bacterial Annotation by Learned Representation Of Genes), which does not require genome-specific training and which matches or outperforms other state-of-the-art gene finding tools. Balrog is freely available under the MIT license at https://github.com/salzberg-lab/Balrog.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Iu1IwEQDFec&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Integrated information structure collapses with anesthetic loss of conscious arousal in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;</title>

The physical basis of consciousness remains one of the most elusive concepts in current science. One influential conjecture is that consciousness is to do with some form of causality, measurable through information. The integrated information theory of consciousness (IIT) proposes that conscious experience, filled with rich and specific content, corresponds directly to a hierarchically organised, irreducible pattern of causal interactions; i.e. an integrated informational structure among elements of a system. Here, we tested this conjecture in a simple biological system (fruit flies), estimating the information structure of the system during wakefulness and general anesthesia. Consistent with this conjecture, we found that integrated interactions among populations of neurons during wakefulness collapsed to isolated clusters of interactions during anesthesia. We used classification analysis to quantify the accuracy of discrimination between wakeful and anesthetised states, and found that informational structures inferred conscious states with greater accuracy than a scalar summary of the structure, a measure which is generally championed as the main measure of IIT. In stark contrast to a view which assumes feedforward architecture for insect brains, especially fly visual systems, we found rich information structures, which cannot arise from purely feedforward systems, occurred across the fly brain. Further, these information structures collapsed uniformly across the brain during anesthesia. Our results speak to the potential utility of the novel concept of an “informational structure” as a measure for level of consciousness, above and beyond simple scalar values.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1vrxkl_PB5A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In this work we develop a novel algorithm for reconstructing the genomes of ancestral individuals, given genotype or sequence data from contemporary individuals and an extended pedigree of family relationships. A pedigree with complete genomes for every individual enables the study of allele frequency dynamics and haplotype diversity across generations, including deviations from neutrality such as transmission distortion. When studying heritable diseases, ancestral haplotypes can be used to augment genome-wide association studies and track disease inheritance patterns. The building blocks of our reconstruction algorithm are segments of Identity-By-Descent (IBD) shared between two or more genotyped individuals. The method alternates between identifying a source for each IBD segment and assembling IBD segments placed within each ancestral individual. Unlike previous approaches, our method is able to accommodate complex pedigree structures with hundreds of individuals genotyped at millions of SNPs.
We apply our method to an Old Order Amish pedigree from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, whose founders came to the United States from Europe during the early 18th century. The pedigree includes 1338 individuals from the past 12 generations, 394 with genotype data. The motivation for reconstruction is to understand the genetic basis of diseases segregating in the family through tracking haplotype transmission over time. Using our algorithm thread, we are able to reconstruct an average of 224 ancestral individuals per chromosome. For these ancestral individuals, on average we reconstruct 79% of their haplotypes. We also identify a region on chromosome 16 that is difficult to reconstruct—we find that this region harbors a short Amish-specific copy number variation and the gene &lt;i&gt;HYDIN&lt;/i&gt;. thread was developed for endogamous populations, but can be applied to any extensive pedigree with the recent generations genotyped. We anticipate that this type of practical ancestral reconstruction will become more common and necessary to understand rare and complex heritable diseases in extended families.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/isC9GwaJWqk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Sustained neural rhythms reveal endogenous oscillations supporting speech perception</title>

Rhythmic sensory or electrical stimulation will produce rhythmic brain responses. These rhythmic responses are often interpreted as endogenous neural oscillations aligned (or “entrained”) to the stimulus rhythm. However, stimulus-aligned brain responses can also be explained as a sequence of evoked responses, which only appear regular due to the rhythmicity of the stimulus, without necessarily involving underlying neural oscillations. To distinguish evoked responses from true oscillatory activity, we tested whether rhythmic stimulation produces oscillatory responses which continue after the end of the stimulus. Such sustained effects provide evidence for true involvement of neural oscillations. In Experiment 1, we found that rhythmic intelligible, but not unintelligible speech produces oscillatory responses in magnetoencephalography (MEG) which outlast the stimulus at parietal sensors. In Experiment 2, we found that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) leads to rhythmic fluctuations in speech perception outcomes after the end of electrical stimulation. We further report that the phase relation between electroencephalography (EEG) responses and rhythmic intelligible speech can predict the tACS phase that leads to most accurate speech perception. Together, we provide fundamental results for several lines of research—including neural entrainment and tACS—and reveal endogenous neural oscillations as a key underlying principle for speech perception.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/2tSmh3oY5ds&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Cerebral palsy (CP) neurologic care and research efforts typically focus on children. However, most people with CP are adults. Adults with CP are at increased risk of new neurologic conditions, such as stroke and myelopathy, that require ongoing neurologic surveillance to distinguish them from baseline motor impairments. Neurologic factors could also contribute to the motor function decline, chronic pain, and chronic fatigue that are commonly experienced by adults with CP. Based on a systematic literature review, we suggest (1) guidelines for neurologic surveillance and neurologist referral and (2) clinical research questions regarding the evolving neurologic risks for adults with CP.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Mindfulness‐based stress reduction training modulates striatal and cerebellar connectivity</title>

	<description>We show how mindfulness training changes functional connectivity in the right putamen, cerebellum, and insula, as well as effective connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex, right cerebellum, and bilateral putamen. Results suggest a rearrangement of dorsal striatum functional and effective connectivity, with changes in cortico‐subcortical‐cerebellar modulatory dynamics.

Abstract
Mindfulness is a meditation practice frequently associated with changes in subjective evaluation of cognitive and sensorial experience, as well as with modifications of brain activity and morphometry. Aside from the anatomical localization of functional changes induced by mindfulness practice, little is known about changes in functional and effective functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity. Here we performed a connectivity fMRI analysis in a group of healthy individuals participating in an 8‐week mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) training program. Data from both a “mind‐wandering” and a “meditation” state were acquired before and after the MBSR course. Results highlighted decreased local connectivity after training in the right anterior putamen and insula during spontaneous mind‐wandering and the right cerebellum during the meditative state. A further effective connectivity analysis revealed (a) decreased modulation by the anterior cingulate cortex over the anterior portion of the putamen, and (b) a change in left and right posterior putamen excitatory input and inhibitory output with the cerebellum, respectively. Results suggest a rearrangement of dorsal striatum functional and effective connectivity in response to mindfulness practice, with changes in cortico‐subcortical‐cerebellar modulatory dynamics. Findings might be relevant for the understanding of widely documented mindfulness behavioral effects, especially those related to pain perception.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Assessing Dysferlinopathy Patients Over Three Years With a New Motor Scale</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26044</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26044?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Dysferlinopathy is a muscular dystrophy with a highly variable clinical presentation and currently unpredictable progression. This variability and unpredictability presents difficulties for prognostication and clinical trial design. The Jain Clinical Outcomes Study of Dysferlinopathy aims to establish the validity of the North Star Assessment for Limb Girdle Type Muscular Dystrophies (NSAD) scale and identify factors that influence the rate of disease progression using NSAD.


Methods
We collected a longitudinal series of functional assessments from 187 patients with dysferlinopathy over 3 years. Rasch analysis was used to develop the NSAD, a motor performance scale suitable for ambulant and nonambulant patients. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the impact of patient factors on outcome trajectories.


Results
The NSAD detected significant change in clinical progression over 1 year. The steepest functional decline occurred during the first 10 years after symptom onset, with more rapid decline noted in patients who developed symptoms at a younger age (p = 0.04). The most rapidly deteriorating group over the study was patients 3 to 8 years post symptom onset at baseline.


Interpretation
The NSAD is the first validated limb girdle specific scale of motor performance, suitable for use in clinical practice and clinical trials. Longitudinal analysis showed it may be possible to identify patient factors associated with greater functional decline both across the disease course and in the short‐term for clinical trial preparation. Through further work and validation in this cohort, we anticipate that a disease model incorporating functional performance will allow for more accurate prognosis for patients with dysferlinopathy.

	<description>Neurodegenerative disease (ND) may lead to aberrant changes in glycoenzymes, including glycosyltransferases and glycosidases, which further regulate the key ND‐related molecules, such as amyloid precursor protein, nicastrin, β‐site APP‐cleaving enzyme 1β‐site APP‐cleaving enzyme 1, a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain 10 (ADAM10), neprilysin, etc.

Abstract
Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are incurable and can develop progressively debilitating disorders, including dementia and ataxias. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are the most common NDs that mainly affect the elderly people. There is an urgent need to develop new diagnostic tools so that patients can be accurately stratified at an early stage. As a common post‐translational modification, protein glycosylation plays a key role in physiological and pathological processes. The abnormal changes in glycosylation are associated with the altered biological pathways in NDs. The pathogenesis‐related proteins, like amyloid‐β and microtubule‐associated protein tau, have altered glycosylation. Importantly, specific glycosylation changes in cerebrospinal fluid, blood and urine are valuable for revealing neurodegeneration in the early stages. This review describes the emerging biomarkers based on glycoproteomics in NDs, highlighting the potential applications of glycoprotein biomarkers in the early detection of diseases, monitoring of the disease progression, and measurement of the therapeutic responses. The mass spectrometry‐based strategies for characterizing glycoprotein biomarkers are also introduced.</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Sex differences in hippocampal connectivity during spatial long‐term memory</title>

	<description>Abstract
Sex differences in brain activity have been reported across various types of long‐term memory. To our knowledge, sex differences in functional connectivity during long‐term memory have not been investigated. A previous study on the structural connectome identified that female brains have a greater degree of interhemispheric connectivity than males, whereas males have a greater degree of intrahemispheric connectivity than females. The aim of the current investigation was twofold: (a) identify which brain regions were functionally connected to the hippocampus during spatial long‐term memory, and (b) determine if there were sex differences in the functionally connected regions. During the study phase, abstract shapes were presented to the left or right of fixation. During the test phase, abstract shapes were presented at fixation and participants classified each item as previously on the “left” or “right”. A hippocampal region of interest (ROI) was identified by contrasting spatial memory hits and misses. The peak coordinate from this ROI was used to define the center of a sphere that was used as the seed for the functional connectivity analysis. The connectivity analysis produced many connected activations including the medial posterior frontal cortex, lateral posterior frontal cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and caudate/putamen. Although there were no regions with greater connectivity in females than males, the male versus female comparison produced connected activations in the medial posterior frontal cortex, anterior prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and cingulate sulcus. Females also had greater interhemispheric connectivity than males. The current findings suggest collapsing across sex in cognitive neuroscience studies may not be warranted.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Vitamin C Acutely Affects Brain Perfusion and Mastication-Induced Perfusion Asymmetry in the Principal Trigeminal Nucleus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.641121</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.641121</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prolonged mastication may induce an asymmetric modification of the local perfusion of the trigeminal principal nucleus. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible influence of vitamin C (vit. C) on such effect. Four groups of healthy volunteers underwent arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI) to evaluate the local perfusion of the trigeminal nuclei after a vit. C-enriched lunch or a control lunch. Two ASL-MRI scans were acquired, respectively, before and after a 1 h-long masticating exercise or a 1 h long resting period. The results showed (i) an increased global perfusion of the brain in the vit. C-enriched lunch groups, (ii) an increased local perfusion of the right principal trigeminal nucleus (Vp) due to mastication, and (iii) a reduction of the rightward asymmetry of the Vp perfusion, due to mastication, after the vit C-enriched meal compared to the control meal. These results confirmed a long-lasting effect of prolonged mastication on Vp perfusion and also suggest a possible effect of vit. C on cerebral vascular tone regulation. Moreover, the data strongly draw attention on the side-to-side relation in Vp perfusion as a possible physiological parameter to be considered to understand the origin of pathological conditions like migraine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Voltage-Gated Ca2+ Channels in Dopaminergic Substantia Nigra Neurons: Therapeutic Targets for Neuroprotection in Parkinson's Disease?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.636103</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The loss of dopamine (DA)-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) underlies the core motor symptoms of the progressive movement disorder Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, no treatment to prevent or slow SN DA neurodegeneration exists; thus, the identification of the underlying factors contributing to the high vulnerability of these neurons represents the basis for the development of novel therapies. Disrupted Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction seem to be key players in the pathophysiology of PD. The autonomous pacemaker activity of SN DA neurons, in combination with low cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering, leads to large somatodendritic fluctuations of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels that are linked to elevated mitochondrial oxidant stress. L-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (LTCCs) contribute to these Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations in dendrites, and LTCC inhibition was beneficial in cellular and in vivo animal models of PD. However, in a recently completed phase 3 clinical trial, the dihydropyridine (DHP) LTCC inhibitor isradipine failed to slow disease progression in early PD patients, questioning the feasibility of DHPs for PD therapy. Novel evidence also suggests that R- and T-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (RTCCs and TTCCs, respectively) represent potential PD drug targets. This short review aims to (re)evaluate the therapeutic potential of LTCC, RTCC, and TTCC inhibition in light of novel preclinical and clinical data and the feasibility of available Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel blockers to modify PD disease progression. I also summarize their cell-specific roles for SN DA neuron function and describe how their gating properties allow activity (and thus their contribution to stressful Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations) during pacemaking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Multi-Electrode Array Analysis Identifies Complex Dopamine Responses and Glucose Sensing Properties of Substantia Nigra Neurons in Mouse Brain Slices</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dopaminergic (DA) midbrain neurons within the substantia nigra (SN) display an autonomous pacemaker activity that is crucial for dopamine release and voluntary movement control. Their progressive degeneration is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Their metabolically demanding activity-mode affects Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis, elevates metabolic stress, and renders SN DA neurons particularly vulnerable to degenerative stressors. Accordingly, their activity is regulated by complex mechanisms, notably by dopamine itself, via inhibitory D2-autoreceptors and the neuroprotective neuronal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor NCS-1. Analyzing regulation of SN DA neuron activity-pattern is complicated by their high vulnerability. We studied this activity and its control by dopamine, NCS-1, and glucose with extracellular multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings from midbrain slices of juvenile and adult mice. Our tailored MEA- and spike sorting-protocols allowed high throughput and long recording times. According to individual dopamine-responses, we identified two distinct SN cell-types, in similar frequency: dopamine-inhibited and dopamine-excited neurons. Dopamine-excited neurons were either silent in the absence of dopamine, or they displayed pacemaker-activities, similar to that of dopamine-inhibited neurons. Inhibition of pacemaker-activity by dopamine is typical for SN DA neurons, and it can undergo prominent desensitization. We show for adult mice, that the number of SN DA neurons with desensitized dopamine-inhibition was increased (~60–100%) by a knockout of NCS-1, or by prevention of NCS-1 binding to D2-autoreceptors, while time-course and degrees of desensitization were not altered. The number of neurons with desensitized D2-responses was also higher (~65%) at high glucose-levels (25 mM), compared to lower glucose (2.5 mM), while again desensitization-kinetics were unaltered. However, spontaneous firing-rates were significantly higher at high glucose-levels (~20%). Moreover, transient glucose-deprivation (1 mM) induced a fast and fully-reversible pacemaker frequency reduction. To directly address and quantify glucose-sensing properties of SN DA neurons, we continuously monitored their electrical activity, while altering extracellular glucose concentrations stepwise from 0.5 mM up to 25 mM. SN DA neurons were excited by glucose, with EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values ranging from 0.35 to 2.3 mM. In conclusion, we identified a novel, common subtype of dopamine-excited SN neurons, and a complex, joint regulation of dopamine-inhibited neurons by dopamine and glucose, within the range of physiological brain glucose-levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Physical and Chemical Interplay Between the Membrane and a Prototypical Potassium Channel Reconstituted on a Lipid Bilayer Platform</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Once membrane potential changes or ligand binding activates the ion channel, the activity of the channel is finely modulated by the fluctuating membrane environment, involving local lipid composition and membrane tension. In the age of post-structural biology, the factors in the membrane that affect the ion channel function and how they affect it are a central concern among ion channel researchers. This review presents our strategies for elucidating the molecular mechanism of membrane effects on ion channel activity. The membrane’s diverse and intricate effects consist of chemical and physical processes. These elements can be quantified separately using lipid bilayer methods, in which a membrane is reconstructed only from the components of interest. In our advanced lipid bilayer platform (contact bubble bilayer, CBB), physical features of the membrane, such as tension, are freely controlled. We have elucidated how the specific lipid or membrane tension modulates the gating of a prototypical potassium channel, KcsA, embedded in the lipid bilayer. Our results reveal the molecular mechanism of the channel for sensing and responding to the membrane environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and Autophagy: Potential Targets of Mesenchymal Stem Cells-Based Therapies in Ischemic Stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death worldwide; currently available treatment approaches for ischemic stroke are to restore blood flow, which reduce disability but are time limited. The interruption of blood flow in ischemic stroke contributes to intricate pathophysiological processes. Oxidative stress and inflammatory activity are two early events in the cascade of cerebral ischemic injury. These two factors are reciprocal causation and directly trigger the development of autophagy. Appropriate autophagy activity contributes to brain recovery by reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory activity, while autophagy dysfunction aggravates cerebral injury. Abundant evidence demonstrates the beneficial impact of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and secretome on cerebral ischemic injury. MSCs reduce oxidative stress through suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) generation and transferring healthy mitochondria to damaged cells. Meanwhile, MSCs exert anti-inflammation properties by the production of cytokines and extracellular vesicles, inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory cells activation, suppressing pyroptosis, and alleviating blood–brain barrier leakage. Additionally, MSCs regulation of autophagy imbalances gives rise to neuroprotection against cerebral ischemic injury. Altogether, MSCs have been a promising candidate for the treatment of ischemic stroke due to their pleiotropic effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Novel Neuroimaging Biomarker for Sleep Quality in Insomnia Disorder: A Hypothalamus Resting State Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.634984</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite striking progress in the understanding of the neurobiology of insomnia disorder (ID), about 40% of ID patients do not reach sustained remission with the primary treatments. It is necessary to reveal novel neuroimaging biomarkers for sleep quality in ID. The hypothalamus has a central role in sleep-wake regulation by communicating with different brain regions. However, the functional implications of hypothalamus circuitry with other brain areas remains largely unknown in ID. It may be speculated that dysfunctional circuitry in the hypothalamus is involved in the pathogenesis of ID. Thus, we investigated the different network organizations of the bilateral hypothalamus during the resting-state between 26 ID patients and 28 healthy controls (HC). Correlation analysis has been carried out to link the neuroimaging findings and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores. Group comparisons reveal that the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the left hypothalamic region and a few other brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and pallidum, are significantly higher in ID compared with HC. The right inferior temporal cortex showed reduced RSFC with the left hypothalamus. No significantly different RSFC between ID and HC was detected for the right hypothalamus. Positive correlations with PSQI scores were observed for RSFC strength between the left hypothalamus and bilateral mPFC (left: r = 0.2985, p = 0.0393; right: r = 0.3723, p = 0.0056). Similarly, the RSFC strength between the right hypothalamus and bilateral mPFC (left: r = 0.3980, p = 0.0029; right: r = 0.2972, p = 0.0291) also showed significant positive correlations with PSQI scores. In conclusion, we reveal a novel neuroimaging biomarker for sleep quality, i.e., the RSFC strength of the hypothalamus-mPFC pathway. Consistent with the hyperarousal model of ID, our results shed new insights into the implications of the hyper-connection within hypothalamus circuits in the pathology of the ID.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Neuromodulation of the Pudendal Nerve Assisted by 3D Printed: A New Method of Neuromodulation for Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves by implanted electrodes is an effective treatment for certain pelvic floor diseases. As well as intravesical electrical stimulation, this predominantly includes stimulation of the sacral nerve, tibial nerve, and pudendal nerve. The pudendal nerve is one of the main nerves that stimulate pelvic floor muscles, external urethral meatus, and the anal sphincter and pelvic organs, and it may have effects on frequent urination, urgency, dysuria, and perineal pain. It is difficult to locate because of its anatomical course, however, leading to difficulties fixing the electrode, which increases the difficulty of pudendal nerve electrical stimulation in clinical practice. In the current study 3D printed navigation was used to solve these problems. Combined with autopsy data and patient pelvic and nerve data, a personalized design was generated. Neural modulation of the pudendal nerve was achieved by implanting the lead with the guidance of 3D printed navigation. 3D printed navigation can maximize the phase II conversion rate, reduce the difficulty of surgery, shorten the operation time, reduce damage to additional organs and blood vessels, and increase the accuracy of electrode implantation, and it can be performed while the patient is awake. It is an accurate, reversible, efficient, and minimally invasive surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Memory reconsolidation holds great hope for memory modification approaches and clinical treatments of mental disorders associated with maladaptive memories. However, it remains controversial as to whether reconsolidation is a general property of all types of memory. Especially, discrepancies have been reported in research focusing on whether declarative memory undergoes reconsolidation, and whether old memories can be reorganized after retrieval. Here, we discuss how these inconsistent results can be reconciled and what information we need to uncover for the general use of reconsolidation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Interrelation Between Peripersonal Action Space and Interpersonal Social Space: Psychophysiological Evidence and Clinical Implications</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The peripersonal space is an adaptive and flexible interface between the body and the environment that fulfills a dual-motor function: preparing the body for voluntary object-oriented actions to interact with incentive stimuli and preparing the body for defensive responses when facing potentially harmful stimuli. In this position article, we provide arguments for the sensorimotor rooting of the peripersonal space representation and highlight the variables that contribute to its flexible and adaptive characteristics. We also demonstrate that peripersonal space represents a mediation zone between the body and the environment contributing to not only the control of goal-directed actions but also the organization of social life. The whole of the data presented and discussed led us to the proposal of a new theoretical framework linking the peripersonal action space and the interpersonal social space and we highlight how this theoretical framework can account for social behaviors in populations with socio-emotional deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Long-Term Mutual Training for the CYBATHLON BCI Race With a Tetraplegic Pilot: A Case Study on Inter-Session Transfer and Intra-Session Adaptation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;CYBATHLON is an international championship where people with severe physical disabilities compete with the aid of state-of-the-art assistive technology. In one of the disciplines, the BCI Race, tetraplegic pilots compete in a computer game race by controlling an avatar with a brain-computer interface (BCI). This competition offers a perfect opportunity for BCI researchers to study long-term training effects in potential end-users, and to evaluate BCI performance in a realistic environment. In this work, we describe the BCI system designed by the team Mirage91 for participation in the CYBATHLON BCI Series 2019, as well as in the CYBATHLON 2020 Global Edition. Furthermore, we present the BCI’s interface with the game and the main methodological strategies, along with a detailed evaluation of its performance over the course of the training period, which lasted 14 months. The developed system was a 4-class BCI relying on task-specific modulations of brain rhythms. We implemented inter-session transfer learning to reduce calibration time, and to reinforce the stability of the brain patterns. Additionally, in order to compensate for potential intra-session shifts in the features’ distribution, normalization parameters were continuously adapted in an unsupervised fashion. Across the aforementioned 14 months, we recorded 26 game-based training sessions. Between the first eight sessions, and the final eight sessions leading up to the CYBATHLON 2020 Global Edition, the runtimes significantly improved from 255 ± 23 s (mean ± std) to 225 ± 22 s, respectively. Moreover, we observed a significant increase in the classifier’s accuracy from 46 to 53%, driven by more distinguishable brain patterns. Compared to conventional single session, non-adaptive BCIs, the inter-session transfer learning and unsupervised intra-session adaptation techniques significantly improved the performance. This long-term study demonstrates that regular training helped the pilot to significantly increase the distance between task-specific patterns, which resulted in an improvement of performance, both with respect to class separability in the calibration data, and with respect to the game. Furthermore, it shows that our methodological approaches were beneficial in transferring the performance across sessions, and most importantly to the CYBATHLON competitions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Socio-emotional impairments are key symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorders. This work proposes to analyze the neuronal activity related to the discrimination of emotional prosodies in autistic children (aged 9 to 11-year-old) as follows. Firstly, a database for single words uttered in Mexican Spanish by males, females, and children will be created. Then, optimal acoustic features for emotion characterization will be extracted, followed of a cubic kernel function Support Vector Machine (SVM) in order to validate the speech corpus. As a result, human-specific acoustic properties of emotional voice signals will be identified. Secondly, those identified acoustic properties will be modified to synthesize the recorded human emotional voices. Thirdly, both human and synthesized utterances will be used to study the electroencephalographic correlate of affective prosody processing in typically developed and autistic children. Finally, and on the basis of the outcomes, synthesized voice-enhanced environments will be created to develop an intervention based on social-robot and Social Story&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; for autistic children to improve affective prosodies discrimination. This protocol has been registered at BioMed Central under the following number: ISRCTN18117434.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Object-Location Memory Training in Older Adults Leads to Greater Deactivation of the Dorsal Default Mode Network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.623766</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Substantial evidence indicates that cognitive training can be efficacious for older adults, but findings regarding training-related brain plasticity have been mixed and vary depending on the imaging modality. Recent years have seen a growth in recognition of the importance of large-scale brain networks on cognition. In particular, task-induced deactivation within the default mode network (DMN) is thought to facilitate externally directed cognition, while aging-related decrements in this neural process are related to reduced cognitive performance. It is not yet clear whether task-induced deactivation within the DMN can be enhanced by cognitive training in the elderly. We previously reported durable cognitive improvements in a sample of healthy older adults (age range = 60–75) who completed 6 weeks of process-based object-location memory training (N = 36) compared to an active control training group (N = 31). The primary aim of the current study is to evaluate whether these cognitive gains are accompanied by training-related changes in task-related DMN deactivation. Given the evidence for heterogeneity of the DMN, we examine task-related activation/deactivation within two separate DMN branches, a ventral branch related to episodic memory and a dorsal branch more closely resembling the canonical DMN. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing an untrained object-location memory task at four time points before, during, and after the training period. Task-induced (de)activation values were extracted for the ventral and dorsal DMN branches at each time point. Relative to visual fixation baseline: (i) the dorsal DMN was deactivated during the scanner task, while the ventral DMN was activated; (ii) the object-location memory training group exhibited an increase in dorsal DMN deactivation relative to the active control group over the course of training and follow-up; (iii) changes in dorsal DMN deactivation did not correlate with task improvement. These results indicate a training-related enhancement of task-induced deactivation of the dorsal DMN, although the specificity of this improvement to the cognitive task performed in the scanner is not clear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Emotional Stimulations on the Online Operation of a P300-Based Brain–Computer Interface</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Using P300-based brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) in daily life should take into account the user’s emotional state because various emotional conditions are likely to influence event-related potentials (ERPs) and consequently the performance of P300-based BCIs. This study aimed at investigating whether external emotional stimuli affect the performance of a P300-based BCI, particularly built for controlling home appliances. We presented a set of emotional auditory stimuli to subjects, which had been selected for each subject based on individual valence scores evaluated a priori, while they were controlling an electric light device using a P300-based BCI. There were four conditions regarding the auditory stimuli, including high valence, low valence, noise, and no sound. As a result, subjects controlled the electric light device using the BCI in real time with a mean accuracy of 88.14%. The overall accuracy and P300 features over most EEG channels did not show a significant difference between the four auditory conditions (p &amp;gt; 0.05). When we measured emotional states using frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) and compared FAA across the auditory conditions, we also found no significant difference (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Our results suggest that there is no clear evidence to support a hypothesis that external emotional stimuli influence the P300-based BCI performance or the P300 features while people are controlling devices using the BCI in real time. This study may provide useful information for those who are concerned with the implementation of a P300-based BCI in practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Language Familiarity and Proficiency Leads to Differential Cortical Processing During Translation Between Distantly Related Languages</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.593108</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.593108</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the midst of globalization, English is regarded as an international language, or Lingua Franca, but learning it as a second language (L2) remains still difficult to speakers of other languages. This is true especially for the speakers of languages distantly related to English such as Japanese. In this sense, exploring neural basis for translation between the first language (L1) and L2 is of great interest. There have been relatively many previous researches revealing brain activation patterns during translations between L1 and English as L2. These studies, which focused on language translation with close or moderate linguistic distance (LD), have suggested that the Broca area (BA 44/45) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; BA 46) may play an important role on translation. However, the neural mechanism of language translation between Japanese and English, having large LD, has not been clarified. Thus, we used functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate the brain activation patterns during word translation between Japanese and English. We also assessed the effects of translation directions and word familiarity. All participants’ first language was Japanese and they were learning English. Their English proficiency was advanced or elementary. We selected English and Japanese words as stimuli based on the familiarity for Japanese people. Our results showed that the brain activation patterns during word translation largely differed depending on their English proficiency. The advanced group elicited greater activation on the left prefrontal cortex around the Broca’s area while translating words with low familiarity, but no activation was observed while translating words with high familiarity. On the other hand, the elementary group evoked greater activation on the left temporal area including the superior temporal gyrus (STG) irrespective of the word familiarity. These results suggested that different cognitive process could be involved in word translation corresponding to English proficiency in Japanese learners of English. These difference on the brain activation patterns between the advanced and elementary group may reflect the difference on the cognitive loads depending on the levels of automatization in one’s language processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Target Detection Using Ternary Classification During a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation Task Using Magnetoencephalography Data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.619508</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.619508</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm is a high-speed paradigm of brain–computer interface (BCI) applications. The target stimuli evoke event-related potential (ERP) activity of odd-ball effect, which can be used to detect the onsets of targets. Thus, the neural control can be produced by identifying the target stimulus. However, the ERPs in single trials vary in latency and length, which makes it difficult to accurately discriminate the targets against their neighbors, the near-non-targets. Thus, it reduces the efficiency of the BCI paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: To overcome the difficulty of ERP detection against their neighbors, we proposed a simple but novel ternary classification method to train the classifiers. The new method not only distinguished the target against all other samples but also further separated the target, near-non-target, and other, far-non-target samples. To verify the efficiency of the new method, we performed the RSVP experiment. The natural scene pictures with or without pedestrians were used; the ones with pedestrians were used as targets. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data of 10 subjects were acquired during presentation. The SVM and CNN in EEGNet architecture classifiers were used to detect the onsets of target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We obtained fairly high target detection scores using SVM and EEGNet classifiers based on MEG data. The proposed ternary classification method showed that the near-non-target samples can be discriminated from others, and the separation significantly increased the ERP detection scores in the EEGNet classifier. Moreover, the visualization of the new method suggested the different underling of SVM and EEGNet classifiers in ERP detection of the RSVP experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In the RSVP experiment, the near-non-target samples contain separable ERP activity. The ERP detection scores can be increased using classifiers of the EEGNet model, by separating the non-target into near- and far-targets based on their delay against targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Quantitative Fluorescent in situ Hybridization Reveals Differential Transcription Profile Sharpening of Endocytic Proteins in Cochlear Hair Cells Upon Maturation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.643517</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.643517</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The organ of Corti (OC) comprises two types of sensory cells: outer hair cells (OHCs) and inner hair cells (IHCs). While both are mechanotransducers, OHCs serve as cochlear amplifiers, whereas IHCs transform sound into transmitter release. Reliable sound encoding is ensured by indefatigable exocytosis of synaptic vesicles associated with efficient replenishment of the vesicle pool. Vesicle reformation requires retrieval of vesicle membrane from the hair cell’s membrane via endocytosis. So far, the protein machinery for endocytosis in pre-mature and terminally differentiated hair cells has only partially been deciphered. Here, we studied three endocytic proteins, dynamin-1, dynamin-3, and endophilin-A1, by assessing their transcription profiles in pre-mature and mature mouse OCs. State-of-the-art RNAscope&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of whole-mount OCs was used for quantification of target mRNAs on single-cell level. We found that pre-mature IHCs contained more mRNA transcripts of dnm1 (encoding dynamin-1) and sh3gl2 (endophilin-A1), but less of dnm3 (dynamin-3) than OHCs. These differential transcription profiles between OHCs and IHCs were sharpened upon maturation. It is noteworthy that low but heterogeneous signal numbers were found between individual negative controls, which highlights the importance of corresponding analyses in RNAscope&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; assays. Complementary immunolabeling revealed strong expression of dynamin-1 in the soma of mature IHCs, which was much weaker in pre-mature IHCs. By contrast, dynamin-3 was predominantly found in the soma and at the border of the cuticular plates of pre-mature and mature OHCs. In summary, using quantitative RNAscope&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; FISH and immunohistochemistry on whole-mount tissue of both pre-mature and mature OCs, we disclosed the cellular upregulation of endocytic proteins at the level of transcription/translation during terminal differentiation of the OC. Dynamin-1 and endophilin-A1 likely contribute to the strengthening of the endocytic machinery in IHCs after the onset of hearing, whereas expression of dynamin-3 at the cuticular plate of pre-mature and mature OHCs suggests its possible involvement in activity-independent apical endocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Key Role of Microglial Matrix Metalloproteinases in Choroidal Neovascularization</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), especially neovascular AMD with choroidal neovascularization (CNV), is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. Although matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in pathological ocular angiogenesis, including CNV, the cellular origin of MMPs in AMD remains unknown. The present study investigated the role of microglial MMPs in CNV. MMP activities were analyzed by gelatin zymography in aqueous humor samples from patients with CNV and laser-induced CNV mice. Active MMP-9 was increased in the aqueous humor samples from neovascular AMD patients compared with control subjects. In the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid from CNV mice, active MMP-9 increased, beginning 1 h post-CNV induction, and remained upregulated until Day 7. In RPE/choroid from CNV mice, active MMP-9 was suppressed by minocycline, a known microglial inhibitor, at 6 h and 1-day post-CNV induction. Flow cytometry revealed that the proportion of activated microglia increased very early, beginning at 1 h post-CNV induction, and was maintained until Day 7. Similarly, immunohistochemistry revealed increased microglial activation and MMP-9 expression on CNV lesions at 6 h and 1-day post-CNV induction. SB-3CT, an MMP inhibitor, decreased vascular leakage and lesion size in laser-induced CNV mice. These findings indicated nearly immediate recruitment of activated microglia and very early MMP-9 activation in the RPE/choroid. The present study newly identified a potential role for early microglial MMP-9 expression in CNV, and furthermore that modulating microglial MMP expression is a novel putative therapeutic for CNV.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Traditional Chinese Medicine Monomers: Novel Strategy for Endogenous Neural Stem Cells Activation After Stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stem cell therapy, which has become a potential regenerative medical treatment and a promising approach for treating brain injuries induced by different types of cerebrovascular disease, has various application methods. Activation of endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) can enable infarcted neuron replacement and promote neural networks’ regeneration without the technical and ethical issues associated with the transplantation of exogenous stem cells. Thus, NSC activation can be a feasible strategy to treat central nervous system (CNS) injury. The potential molecular mechanisms of drug therapy for the activation of endogenous NSCs have gradually been revealed by researchers. Traditional Chinese medicine monomers (TCMs) are active components extracted from Chinese herbs, and some of them have demonstrated the potential to activate proliferation and neurogenesis of NSCs in CNS diseases. Ginsenoside Rg1, astragaloside IV (AST), icariin (ICA), salvianolic acid B (Sal B), resveratrol (RES), curcumin, artesunate (ART), and ginkgolide B (GB) have positive effects on NSCs via different signaling pathways and molecules, such as the Wingless/integrated/β-catenin (Wnt/β-catenin) signaling pathway, the sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). This article may provide further motivation for researchers to take advantage of TCMs in studies on CNS injury and stem cell therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Association of Suppressed Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 Transactivation of Angiogenesis With Defective Recovery From Cerebral Ischemic Injury in Aged Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Elderly patients suffer more brain damage in comparison with young patients from the same ischemic stroke. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that suppressed hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) transcription activity is responsible for defective recovery after ischemic stroke in the elders. Aged and young rats underwent 1-h transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to produce cerebral ischemic injury. The initial cerebral infarct volume in the young gradually declined as time elapsed, but in the aged rats remained the same. The defective recovery in the aged was associated with depressed angiogenesis and retarded neurorestoration. There was no difference in HIF-1α accumulation in the brain between the two age groups, but the expression of HIF-1 regulated genes involved in cerebral recovery was suppressed in the aged. In confirmation, inhibition of HIF-1 transactivation of gene expression in the young suppressed cerebral recovery from MCAO as the same as that observed in the aged rats. Furthermore, a copper metabolism MURR domain 1 (COMMD1) was significantly elevated after MCAO only in the brain of aged rats, and suppression of COMMD1 by siRNA targeting COMMD1 restored HIF-1 transactivation and improved recovery from MCAO-induced damage in the aged brain. These results demonstrate that impaired HIF-1 transcription activity, due at least partially to overexpression of COMMD1, is associated with the defective cerebral recovery from ischemic stroke in the aged rats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Apolipoprotein E ε4 Allele-Based Differences in Brain Volumes Are Largely Uniform Across Late Middle Aged and Older Hispanic/Latino- and Non-Hispanic/Latino Whites Without Dementia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hispanics/Latinos are at an equal or a greater risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet risk factors remain more poorly characterized as compared to non-Hispanic/Latino Whites. Among non-Hispanic/Latino White cohorts, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is one of the strongest risk factors for AD with subtle declines in episodic memory and brain volumes detectable in the preclinical stages. We examined whether the APOE ε4 status had a differential impact on cognition and brain volumes among cognitively healthy and mild cognitively impaired Hispanics/Latinos (n = 86; ε4 n = 23) compared to a well-matched group of non-Hispanic/Latino Whites (n = 92; ε4 n = 29). Neither the APOE ε4 status nor the interaction between the ε4 status and ethnicity was associated with cognitive performance. The APOE ε4 status was associated with white matter and not with gray matter volumes. APOE ε4 carriers had a significantly smaller total brain white matter volumes, as well as smaller right middle temporal and left superior temporal volumes. The Hispanics/Latinos had significantly smaller left middle frontal gray matter volumes, yet marginally larger overall white matter volumes, than the non-Hispanic/Latino Whites. Exploratory analysis within the Hispanic/Latino sample found that those people whose primary language was Spanish had larger total brain white matter volumes compared primarily to the English speakers. Importantly, primary language differences only held for Hispanic/Latino ε4 carriers and did not differentiate Hispanic/Latino non-carriers, underscoring the need for further investigation into the impacts of language and acculturation on cognitive aging among the fastest growing ethnic minority group in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Impact of between-tissue differences on pan-cancer predictions of drug sensitivity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by John P. Lloyd, Matthew B. Soellner, Sofia D. Merajver, Jun Z. Li&lt;/p&gt;

Increased availability of drug response and genomics data for many tumor cell lines has accelerated the development of pan-cancer prediction models of drug response. However, it is unclear how much between-tissue differences in drug response and molecular characteristics may contribute to pan-cancer predictions. Also unknown is whether the performance of pan-cancer models could vary by cancer type. Here, we built a series of pan-cancer models using two datasets containing 346 and 504 cell lines, each with MEK inhibitor (MEKi) response and mRNA expression, point mutation, and copy number variation data, and found that, while the tissue-level drug responses are accurately predicted (between-tissue ρ = 0.88–0.98), only 5 of 10 cancer types showed successful within-tissue prediction performance (within-tissue ρ = 0.11–0.64). Between-tissue differences make substantial contributions to the performance of pan-cancer MEKi response predictions, as exclusion of between-tissue signals leads to a decrease in Spearman’s ρ from a range of 0.43–0.62 to 0.30–0.51. In practice, joint analysis of multiple cancer types usually has a larger sample size, hence greater power, than for one cancer type; and we observe that higher accuracy of pan-cancer prediction of MEKi response is almost entirely due to the sample size advantage. Success of pan-cancer prediction reveals how drug response in different cancers may invoke shared regulatory mechanisms despite tissue-specific routes of oncogenesis, yet predictions in different cancer types require flexible incorporation of between-cancer and within-cancer signals. As most datasets in genome sciences contain multiple levels of heterogeneity, careful parsing of group characteristics and within-group, individual variation is essential when making robust inference.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7rQEsVuMj5s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We live in an increasingly data-driven world, where high-throughput sequencing and mass spectrometry platforms are transforming biology into an information science. This has shifted major challenges in biological research from data generation and processing to interpretation and knowledge translation. However, postsecondary training in bioinformatics, or more generally data science for life scientists, lags behind current demand. In particular, development of accessible, undergraduate data science curricula has the potential to improve research and learning outcomes as well as better prepare students in the life sciences to thrive in public and private sector careers. Here, we describe the Experiential Data science for Undergraduate Cross-Disciplinary Education (EDUCE) initiative, which aims to progressively build data science competency across several years of integrated practice. Through EDUCE, students complete data science modules integrated into required and elective courses augmented with coordinated cocurricular activities. The EDUCE initiative draws on a community of practice consisting of teaching assistants (TAs), postdocs, instructors, and research faculty from multiple disciplines to overcome several reported barriers to data science for life scientists, including instructor capacity, student prior knowledge, and relevance to discipline-specific problems. Preliminary survey results indicate that even a single module improves student self-reported interest and/or experience in bioinformatics and computer science. Thus, EDUCE provides a flexible and extensible active learning framework for integration of data science curriculum into undergraduate courses and programs across the life sciences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FuY63NC2BD0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

With more microbiome studies being conducted by African-based research groups, there is an increasing demand for knowledge and skills in the design and analysis of microbiome studies and data. However, high-quality bioinformatics courses are often impeded by differences in computational environments, complicated software stacks, numerous dependencies, and versions of bioinformatics tools along with a lack of local computational infrastructure and expertise. To address this, H3ABioNet developed a 16S rRNA Microbiome Intermediate Bioinformatics Training course, extending its remote classroom model. The course was developed alongside experienced microbiome researchers, bioinformaticians, and systems administrators, who identified key topics to address. Development of containerised workflows has previously been undertaken by H3ABioNet, and Singularity containers were used here to enable the deployment of a standard replicable software stack across different hosting sites. The pilot ran successfully in 2019 across 23 sites registered in 11 African countries, with more than 200 participants formally enrolled and 106 volunteer staff for onsite support. The pulling, running, and testing of the containers, software, and analyses on various clusters were performed prior to the start of the course by hosting classrooms. The containers allowed the replication of analyses and results across all participating classrooms running a cluster and remained available posttraining ensuring analyses could be repeated on real data. Participants thus received the opportunity to analyse their own data, while local staff were trained and supported by experienced experts, increasing local capacity for ongoing research support. This provides a model for delivering topic-specific bioinformatics courses across Africa and other remote/low-resourced regions which overcomes barriers such as inadequate infrastructures, geographical distance, and access to expertise and educational materials.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iuQdx1TkErM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Using prototyping to choose a bioinformatics workflow management system</title>

Workflow management systems represent, manage, and execute multistep computational analyses and offer many benefits to bioinformaticians. They provide a common language for describing analysis workflows, contributing to reproducibility and to building libraries of reusable components. They can support both incremental build and re-entrancy—the ability to selectively re-execute parts of a workflow in the presence of additional inputs or changes in configuration and to resume execution from where a workflow previously stopped. Many workflow management systems enhance portability by supporting the use of containers, high-performance computing (HPC) systems, and clouds. Most importantly, workflow management systems allow bioinformaticians to delegate how their workflows are run to the workflow management system and its developers. This frees the bioinformaticians to focus on what these workflows should do, on their data analyses, and on their science.
RiboViz is a package to extract biological insight from ribosome profiling data to help advance understanding of protein synthesis. At the heart of RiboViz is an analysis workflow, implemented in a Python script. To conform to best practices for scientific computing which recommend the use of build tools to automate workflows and to reuse code instead of rewriting it, the authors reimplemented this workflow within a workflow management system. To select a workflow management system, a rapid survey of available systems was undertaken, and candidates were shortlisted: Snakemake, cwltool, Toil, and Nextflow. Each candidate was evaluated by quickly prototyping a subset of the RiboViz workflow, and Nextflow was chosen. The selection process took 10 person-days, a small cost for the assurance that Nextflow satisfied the authors’ requirements. The use of prototyping can offer a low-cost way of making a more informed selection of software to use within projects, rather than relying solely upon reviews and recommendations by others.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gvUV1MY_IfY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The Hippo-YAP pathway responds to diverse environmental cues to manage tissue homeostasis, organ regeneration, tumorigenesis, and immunity. However, how phosphatase(s) directly target Yes-associated protein (YAP) and determine its physiological activity are still inconclusive. Here, we utilized an unbiased phosphatome screening and identified protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1A (PPM1A/PP2Cα) as the bona fide and physiological YAP phosphatase. We found that PPM1A was associated with YAP/TAZ in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus to directly eliminate phospho-S127 on YAP, which conferring YAP the nuclear distribution and transcription potency. Accordingly, genetic ablation or depletion of PPM1A in cells, organoids, and mice elicited an enhanced YAP/TAZ cytoplasmic retention and resulted in the diminished cell proliferation, severe gut regeneration defects in colitis, and impeded liver regeneration upon injury. These regeneration defects in murine model were largely rescued via a genetic large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1) deficiency or the pharmacological inhibition of Hippo-YAP signaling. Therefore, we identify a physiological phosphatase of YAP/TAZ, describe its critical effects in YAP/TAZ cellular distribution, and demonstrate its physiological roles in mammalian organ regeneration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CX2-Qjoj_E0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The recent emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the underlying cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to a worldwide pandemic causing substantial morbidity, mortality, and economic devastation. In response, many laboratories have redirected attention to SARS-CoV-2, meaning there is an urgent need for tools that can be used in laboratories unaccustomed to working with coronaviruses. Here we report a range of tools for SARS-CoV-2 research. First, we describe a facile single plasmid SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics system that is simple to genetically manipulate and can be used to rescue infectious virus through transient transfection (without in vitro transcription or additional expression plasmids). The rescue system is accompanied by our panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (against nearly every viral protein), SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates, and SARS-CoV-2 permissive cell lines, which are all openly available to the scientific community. Using these tools, we demonstrate here that the controversial ORF10 protein is expressed in infected cells. Furthermore, we show that the promising repurposed antiviral activity of apilimod is dependent on TMPRSS2 expression. Altogether, our SARS-CoV-2 toolkit, which can be directly accessed via our website at https://mrcppu-covid.bio/, constitutes a resource with considerable potential to advance COVID-19 vaccine design, drug testing, and discovery science.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/aHtVPdXDMZQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), early diagnosis is essential for both current and potential treatments. To find a supportive approach for the diagnosis, we constructed an artificial intelligence‐based prediction model of ALS using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Images of spinal motor neurons derived from healthy control subject and ALS patient iPSCs were analyzed by a convolutional neural network, and the algorithm achieved an area under the curve of 0.97 for classifying healthy control and ALS. This prediction model by deep learning algorithm with iPSC technology could support the diagnosis and may provide proactive treatment of ALS through future prospective research.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Endosome Dysregulation in Down Syndrome: A Potential Contributor to Alzheimer Disease Pathology</title>

	<description>Intracellular protein trafficking via the endosomes plays a key role in the maintenance of normal neuronal function. Although many diseases of the central nervous system exhibit specific pathological hallmarks, abnormalities of the endosome system are common traits for several of them, including Alzheimer disease (AD). Three main routes originate from the endosomes: the recycling, degradation, and retrograde pathways. Studies have shown that the majority of Down syndrome subjects develop AD pathology and manifest altered morphology and number of endosomes, and abnormalities in lysosome acidification and exosome secretion, suggesting that dysfunction of one of these pathways could play a functional role in the AD‐like phenotype of the syndrome. Two of the major endosomal routes are mediated by the retromer complex, a multimeric system responsible for transport of cargo from the endosome to the trans‐Golgi network or to the cell membrane. Recently, a new endosome system structurally related to the retromer, called “retriever,” has been reported. Whereas we know a great deal about the neuropathophysiology of the retromer complex, no precise pathogenic role for the retriever has yet been identified. Here, we will review the neurobiology of the endosome system and its role as key player in the development of AD‐like pathology in Down syndrome. Additionally, we will discuss current knowledge on these two main endosome systems, retromer and retriever, and their potential as novel therapeutic targets. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Exogenous l‐lactate promotes astrocyte plasticity but is not sufficient for enhancing striatal synaptogenesis or motor behavior in mice</title>

	<description>Exogenous lactate increases astrocyte morphological complexity and neurotrophic factor gene expression

Lactate alone did not cause synaptogenesis in cortex or striatum

Exogenous lactate did not improve motor learning on the accelerating rotarod



Abstract
l‐Lactate is an energetic and signaling molecule that may be produced through astrocyte‐specific aerobic glycolysis and is elevated in striatal muscle during intensive exercise. l‐Lactate has been shown to promote neurotrophic gene expression through astrocytes within the hippocampus, however, its role in neuroplasticity within the striatum remains unknown. This study sought to investigate the role of peripheral sources of l‐lactate in promoting astrocyte‐specific gene expression and morphology as well as its role in neuroplasticity within the striatum of healthy animals. Using in vitro primary astrocyte cell culture, administration of l‐lactate increased the expression of the neurotrophic factors Bdnf, Gdnf, Cntf, and the immediate early gene cFos. l‐Lactate's promotion of neurotrophic factor expression was mediated through the lactate receptor HCAR1 since application of the HCAR1 agonist 3,5‐DHBA also increased expression of Bdnf in primary astrocytes. Similar to our previous report demonstrating exercise‐induced changes in astrocytic structure within the striatum, l‐lactate administration to healthy mice led to increased astrocyte morphological complexity as well as astrocyte‐specific neurotrophic expression within the striatum. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of peripheral l‐lactate on synaptogenesis or motor behavior. Insufficient levels and/or inadequate delivery of l‐lactate through regional cerebral blood flow within the striatum may account for the lack of these benefits. Taken together, these novel findings suggest a potential framework that links peripheral l‐lactate production within muscle and intensive exercise with neuroplasticity of specific brain regions through astrocytic function.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain computer interfaces (BCI) provide a direct communication link between the brain and a computer or other external devices. They offer an extended degree of freedom either by strengthening or by substituting human peripheral working capacity and have potential applications in various fields such as rehabilitation, affective computing, robotics, gaming, and neuroscience. Significant research efforts on a global scale have delivered common platforms for technology standardization and help tackle highly complex and non-linear brain dynamics and related feature extraction and classification challenges. Time-variant psycho-neurophysiological fluctuations and their impact on brain signals impose another challenge for BCI researchers to transform the technology from laboratory experiments to plug-and-play daily life. This review summarizes state-of-the-art progress in the BCI field over the last decades and highlights critical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Neuroligin1 Contributes to Neuropathic Pain by Promoting Phosphorylation of Cofilin in Excitatory Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.640533</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain is a kind of chronic pain that remains difficult to treat due to its complicated underlying mechanisms. Accumulating evidence has indicated that enhanced synaptic plasticity of nociceptive interneurons in the superficial spinal dorsal horn contributes to the development of neuropathic pain. Neuroligin1 (NL1) is a type of excitatory postsynaptic adhesion molecule, which can mediate excitatory synaptic activity, hence promoting neuronal activation. Vglut2 is the most common marker of excitatory glutamatergic neurons. To explore the role of NL1 in excitatory neurons in nociceptive regulation, we used transgenic mice with cre recombinase expression driven by the Vglut2 promoter combined with viral vectors to knockdown the expression of NL1 in excitatory neurons in the spinal dorsal horn. We found that NL1 was upregulated in the L4–L6 spinal dorsal horn in Vglut2-cre&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mouse subjected to spared nerve injury (SNI). Meanwhile, the expression of phosphorylated cofilin (p-cofilin) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor subunit 1 (GluR1) was also increased. Spinal microinjection of a cre-dependent NL1-targeting RNAi in Vglut2-cre&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mouse alleviated the neuropathic pain-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and reduced the increase in p-cofilin and GluR1 caused by SNI. Taken together, NL1 in excitatory neurons regulates neuropathic pain by promoting the SNI-dependent increase in p-cofilin and GluR1 in the spinal dorsal horn. Our study provides a better understanding of the role of NL1 in excitatory neurons, which might represent a possible therapeutic target for alleviating neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The F-Box Protein CG5003 Regulates Axon Pruning and the Integrity of the Drosophila Mushroom Body</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Protein homeostasis serves as an important step in regulating diverse cellular processes underlying the function and development of the nervous system. In particular, the ubiquitination proteasome system (UPS), a universal pathway mediating protein degradation, contributes to the development of numerous synaptic structures, including the Drosophila olfactory-associative learning center mushroom body (MB), thereby affecting associated function. Here, we describe the function of a newly characterized Drosophila F-box protein CG5003, an adaptor for the RING-domain type E3 ligase (SCF complex), in MB development. Lacking CG5003 ubiquitously causes MB γ axon pruning defects and selective CG5003 expression in pan-neurons leads to both γ axon and α/β lobe abnormalities. Interestingly, change in CG5003 expression in MB neurons does not cause any abnormalities in axons, suggesting that CG5003 functions in cells extrinsic to MB to regulate its development. Mass spectrum analysis indicates that silencing CG5003 expression in all neurons affects expression levels of proteins in the cell and structural morphogenesis, transcription regulator activity, and catalytic activity. Our findings reinforce the importance of UPS and identify a new factor in regulating neuronal development as exemplified by the synaptic structure MB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Identification of Natural Antisense Transcripts in Mouse Brain and Their Association With Autism Spectrum Disorder Risk Genes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.624881</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genome-wide sequencing technologies have greatly contributed to our understanding of the genetic basis of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Interestingly, a number of ASD-related genes express natural antisense transcripts (NATs). In some cases, these NATs have been shown to play a regulatory role in sense strand gene expression and thus contribute to brain function. However, a detailed study examining the transcriptional relationship between ASD-related genes and their NAT partners is lacking. We performed strand-specific, deep RNA sequencing to profile expression of sense and antisense reads with a focus on 100 ASD-related genes in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and striatum across mouse post-natal development (P7, P14, and P56). Using de novo transcriptome assembly, we generated a comprehensive long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) transcriptome. We conducted BLAST analyses to compare the resultant transcripts with the human genome and identified transcripts with high sequence similarity and coverage. We assembled 32861 de novo antisense transcripts mapped to 12182 genes, of which 1018 are annotated by Ensembl as lncRNA. We validated the expression of a subset of selected ASD-related transcripts by PCR, including Syngap1 and Cntnap2. Our analyses revealed that more than 70% (72/100) of the examined ASD-related genes have one or more expressed antisense transcripts, suggesting more ASD-related genes than previously thought could be subject to NAT-mediated regulation in mice. We found that expression levels of antisense contigs were mostly positively correlated with their cognate coding sense strand RNA transcripts across developmental age. A small fraction of the examined transcripts showed brain region specific enrichment, indicating possible circuit-specific roles. Our BLAST analyses identified 110 of 271 ASD-related de novo transcripts with &amp;gt;90% identity to the human genome at &amp;gt;90% coverage. These findings, which include an assembled de novo antisense transcriptome, contribute to the understanding of NAT regulation of ASD-related genes in mice and can guide NAT-mediated gene regulation strategies in preclinical investigations toward the ultimate goal of developing novel therapeutic targets for ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Mechanical Basis of Memory – the MeshCODE Theory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.592951</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.592951</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the major unsolved mysteries of biological science concerns the question of where and in what form information is stored in the brain. I propose that memory is stored in the brain in a mechanically encoded binary format written into the conformations of proteins found in the cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions that organise each and every synapse. The MeshCODE framework outlined here represents a unifying theory of data storage in animals, providing read-write storage of both dynamic and persistent information in a binary format. Mechanosensitive proteins that contain force-dependent switches can store information persistently, which can be written or updated using small changes in mechanical force. These mechanosensitive proteins, such as talin, scaffold each synapse, creating a meshwork of switches that together form a code, the so-called MeshCODE. Large signalling complexes assemble on these scaffolds as a function of the switch patterns and these complexes would both stabilise the patterns and coordinate synaptic regulators to dynamically tune synaptic activity. Synaptic transmission and action potential spike trains would operate the cytoskeletal machinery to write and update the synaptic MeshCODEs, thereby propagating this coding throughout the organism. Based on established biophysical principles, such a mechanical basis for memory would provide a physical location for data storage in the brain, with the binary patterns, encoded in the information-storing mechanosensitive molecules in the synaptic scaffolds, and the complexes that form on them, representing the physical location of engrams. Furthermore, the conversion and storage of sensory and temporal inputs into a binary format would constitute an addressable read-write memory system, supporting the view of the mind as an organic supercomputer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Structural network alterations in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are related to worse cognitive impairment. The aim of this study was to quantify the alterations in gray matter associated with impaired cognition and their pathological biomarkers in AD-spectrum patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We extracted gray matter networks from 3D-T1 magnetic resonance imaging scans, and a graph theory analysis was used to explore alterations in the network metrics in 34 healthy controls, 70 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 40 AD patients. Spearman correlation analysis was computed to investigate the relationships among network properties, neuropsychological performance, and cerebrospinal fluid pathological biomarkers (i.e., Aβ, t-tau, and p-tau) in these subjects.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;AD-spectrum individuals demonstrated higher nodal properties and edge properties associated with impaired memory function, and lower amyloid-β or higher tau levels than the controls. Furthermore, these compensations at the brain regional level in AD-spectrum patients were mainly in the medial temporal lobe; however, the compensation at the whole-brain network level gradually extended from the frontal lobe to become widely distributed throughout the cortex with the progression of AD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The findings provide insight into the alterations in the gray matter network related to impaired cognition and pathological biomarkers in the progression of AD. The possibility of compensation was detected in the structural networks in AD-spectrum patients; the compensatory patterns at regional and whole-brain levels were different and the clinical significance was highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Promotes Differentiation of Ischemia-Activated Adult Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells to Neuronal Precursors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.628983</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modulating endogenous regenerative processes may represent a suitable treatment for central nervous system (CNS) injuries, such as stroke or trauma. Neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs), which naturally reside in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult brain, proliferate and differentiate to other cell types, and therefore may compensate the negative consequences of ischemic injury. The fate of NS/PCs in the developing brain is largely influenced by Wingless/Integrated (Wnt) signaling; however, its role in the differentiation of adult NS/PCs under ischemic conditions is still enigmatic. In our previous study, we identified the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as a factor promoting neurogenesis at the expense of gliogenesis in neonatal mice. In this study, we used adult transgenic mice in order to assess the impact of the canonical Wnt pathway modulation (inhibition or hyper-activation) on NS/PCs derived from the SVZ, and combined it with the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to disclose the effect of focal cerebral ischemia (FCI). Based on the electrophysiological properties of cultured cells, we first identified three cell types that represented in vitro differentiated NS/PCs – astrocytes, neuron-like cells, and precursor cells. Following FCI, we detected fewer neuron-like cells after Wnt signaling inhibition. Furthermore, the immunohistochemical analysis revealed an overall higher expression of cell-type-specific proteins after FCI, indicating increased proliferation and differentiation rates of NS/PCs in the SVZ. Remarkably, Wnt signaling hyper-activation increased the abundance of proliferating and neuron-like cells, while Wnt pathway inhibition had the opposite effect. Finally, the expression profiling at the single cell level revealed an increased proportion of neural stem cells and neuroblasts after FCI. These observations indicate that Wnt signaling enhances NS/PCs-based regeneration in the adult mouse brain following FCI, and supports neuronal differentiation in the SVZ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Local Differences in Cortical Excitability – A Systematic Mapping Study of the TMS-Evoked N100 Component</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.623692</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with simultaneous electroencephalography applied to the primary motor cortex provides two parameters for cortical excitability: motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). This study aimed to evaluate the effects of systematic coil shifts on both the TEP N100 component and MEPs in addition to the relationship between both parameters. In 12 healthy adults, the center of a standardized grid was fixed above the hot spot of the target muscle of the left primary motor cortex. Twelve additional positions were arranged in a quadratic grid with positions between 5 and 10 mm from the hot spot. At each of the 13 positions, TMS single pulses were applied. The topographical maximum of the resulting N100 was located ipsilateral and slightly posterior to the stimulation site. A source analysis revealed an equivalent dipole localized more deeply than standard motor cortex coordinates that could not be explained by a single seeded primary motor cortex dipole. The N100 topography might not only reflect primary motor cortex activation, but also sum activation of the surrounding cortex. N100 amplitude and latency decreased significantly during stimulation anterior-medial to the hot spot although MEP amplitudes were smaller at all other stimulation sites. Therefore, N100 amplitudes might be suitable for detecting differences in local cortical excitability. The N100 topography, with its maximum located posterior to the stimulation site, possibly depends on both anatomical characteristics of the stimulated cortex and differences in local excitability of surrounding cortical areas. The less excitable anterior cortex might contribute to a more posterior maximum. There was no correlation between N100 and MEP amplitudes, but a single-trial analysis revealed a trend toward larger N100 amplitudes in trials with larger MEPs. Thus, functionally efficient cortical excitation might increase the probability of higher N100 amplitudes, but TEPs are also generated in the absence of MEPs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Rationally Designed Bicyclic Peptides Prevent the Conversion of Aβ42 Assemblies Into Fibrillar Structures</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is great interest in drug discovery programs targeted at the aggregation of the 42-residue form of the amyloid β peptide (Aβ42), since this molecular process is closely associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The use of bicyclic peptides may offer novel opportunities for the effective modification of Aβ42 aggregation and the inhibition of its cytotoxicity, as these compounds combine the molecular recognition ability of antibodies with a relatively small size of about 2 kD. Here, to pursue this approach, we rationally designed a panel of six bicyclic peptides targeting various epitopes along the sequence of Aβ42 to scan its most amyloidogenic region (residues 13–42). Our kinetic analysis and structural studies revealed that at sub-stoichiometric concentrations the designed bicyclic peptides induce a delay in the condensation of Aβ42 and the subsequent transition to a fibrillar state, while at higher concentrations they inhibit such transition. We thus suggest that designed bicyclic peptides can be employed to inhibit amyloid formation by redirecting the aggregation process toward amorphous assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Optimized Inner-Volume 3D TSE for High-Resolution Vessel Wall Imaging of Intracranial Perforating Arteries at 7T</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The impairment of microvessels can lead to neurologic diseases such as stroke and vascular dementia. The imaging of lumen and vessel wall of perforating arteries requires an extremely high resolution due to their small caliber size. Current imaging techniques have the difficulty in observing the wall of perforating arteries. In this study, we developed a 3D inner-volume (IV) TSE (SPACE) sequence with optimized 2D spatially selective excitation (SSE) RF pulses. The optimized SSE RF pulses were designed through a series of optimization including iterative RF pulse design, trajectory optimization, and phase convention of Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) condition to meet the perforating arteries imaging demands. High resolution of isotropic 0.30 mm within 10 min was achieved for the black- blood images of lenticulostriate artery (LSA). The LSA lumen and vessel wall were imaged by the IV-SPACE sequence simultaneously. Images obtained by the optimized RF pulse has fewer aliasing artifacts from outside of ROI than the traditional pulse. The IV-SPACE images showed clearer delineation of vessel wall and lumen of LSA than conventional SPACE images. IV-SPACE might be a promising method for detecting microvasculopathies of cerebral vascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The reason why dopamine neurons die in Parkinson’s disease remains largely unknown. Emerging evidence points to a role for brain inflammation in neurodegeneration. Essential questions are whether brain inflammation happens sufficiently early so that interfering with this process can be expected to slow down neuronal death and whether the contribution from inflammation is large enough so that anti-inflammatory agents can be expected to work. Here I discuss data from human PD studies indicating that brain inflammation is an early event in PD. I also discuss the role of T-lymphocytes and peripheral inflammation for neurodegeneration. I critically discuss the failure of clinical trials targeting inflammation in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Maximum safe resection of infiltrative brain tumors in eloquent area is the primary objective in surgical neuro-oncology. This goal can be achieved with direct electrical stimulation (DES) to perform a functional mapping of the brain in patients awake intraoperatively. When awake surgery is not possible, we propose a pipeline procedure that combines advanced techniques aiming at performing a dissection that respects the anatomo-functional connectivity of the peritumoral region. This procedure can benefit from intraoperative monitoring with computerized tomography scan (iCT-scan) and brain shift correction. Associated with this intraoperative monitoring, the additional value of preoperative investigation combining brain mapping by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) with various neuroimaging modalities (tractography and resting state functional MRI) has not yet been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case Report: A 42-year-old left-handed man had increased intracranial pressure (IICP), left hand muscle deficit, and dysarthria, related to an infiltrative tumor of the right frontal lobe with large mass effect and circumscribed contrast enhancement in motor and premotor cortical areas. Spectroscopy profile and intratumoral calcifications on CT-scan suggested an WHO grade III glioma, later confirmed by histology. The aforementioned surgical procedure was considered, since standard awake surgery was not appropriate for this patient. In preoperative time, nTMS mapping of motor function (deltoid, first interosseous, and tibialis anterior muscles) was performed, combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based tractography reconstruction of 6 neural tracts (arcuate, corticospinal, inferior fronto-occipital, uncinate and superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi) and resting-state functional MRI connectivity (rs-fMRI) of sensorimotor and language networks. In intraoperative time, DES mapping was performed with motor evoked response recording and tumor resection was optimized using non-rigid image transformation of the preoperative data (nTMS, tractography, and rs-fMRI) to iCT data. Image guidance was updated with correction for brain shift and tissue deformation using biomechanical modeling taking into account brain elastic properties. This correction was done at crucial surgical steps, i.e., when tumor bulged through the craniotomy after dura mater opening and when approaching the presumed eloquent brain regions. This procedure allowed a total resection of the tumor region with contrast enhancement as well as a complete regression of IICP and dysarthria. Hand paresis remained stable with no additional deficit. Postoperative nTMS mapping confirmed the good functional outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This case report and technical note highlights the value of preoperative functional evaluation by nTMS updated intraoperatively with correction of brain deformation by iCT. This multimodal approach may become the optimized technique of reference for patients with brain tumors in eloquent areas that are unsuitable for awake brain surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) targeting the primary motor hand area (M1-HAND) may induce lasting shifts in corticospinal excitability, but after-effects show substantial inter-individual variability. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can probe after-effects of TDCS on regional neural activity on a whole-brain level.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;Using a double-blinded cross-over design, we investigated whether the individual change in corticospinal excitability after TDCS of M1-HAND is associated with changes in task-related regional activity in cortical motor areas.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Seventeen healthy volunteers (10 women) received 20 min of real (0.75 mA) or sham TDCS on separate days in randomized order. Real and sham TDCS used the classic bipolar set-up with the anode placed over right M1-HAND. Before and after each TDCS session, we recorded motor evoked potentials (MEP) from the relaxed left first dorsal interosseus muscle after single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation(TMS) of left M1-HAND and performed whole-brain fMRI at 3 Tesla while participants completed a visuomotor tracking task with their left hand. We also assessed the difference in MEP latency when applying anterior-posterior and latero-medial TMS pulses to the precentral hand knob (AP-LM MEP latency).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Real TDCS had no consistent aftereffects on mean MEP amplitude, task-related activity or motor performance. Individual changes in MEP amplitude, measured directly after real TDCS showed a positive linear relationship with individual changes in task-related activity in the supplementary motor area and AP-LM MEP latency.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Functional aftereffects of classical bipolar anodal TDCS of M1-HAND on the motor system vary substantially across individuals. Physiological features upstream from the primary motor cortex may determine how anodal TDCS changes corticospinal excitability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Modulatory Effects of Prediction Accuracy on Electroencephalographic Brain Activity During Prediction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.630288</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prediction is essential for the efficiency of many cognitive processes; however, this process is not always perfect. Predictive coding theory suggests that the brain generates and updates a prediction to respond to an upcoming event. Although an electrophysiological index of prediction, the stimulus preceding negativity (SPN), has been reported, it remains unknown whether the SPN reflects the prediction accuracy, or whether it is associated with the prediction error, which corresponds to a mismatch between a prediction and an actual input. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate this question using electroencephalography (EEG). Participants were asked to predict the original pictures from pictures that had undergone different levels of pixelation. The SPN amplitude was affected by the level of pixelation and correlated with the subjective evaluation of the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, late positive components (LPC) were negatively correlated with SPN. These results suggest that the amplitude of SPN reflects the prediction accuracy; more accurate prediction increases the SPN and reduces the prediction error, resulting in reduced LPC amplitudes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Examining Different Motor Learning Paradigms for Improving Balance Recovery Abilities Among Older Adults, Random vs. Block Training—Study Protocol of a Randomized Non-inferiority Controlled Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.624492</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.624492</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Falls are the leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injuries among older adults. Studies showed that older adults can reduce the risk of falls after participation in an unexpected perturbation-based balance training (PBBT), a relatively novel approach that challenged reactive balance control. This study aims to investigate the effect of the practice schedule (i.e., contextual interference) on reactive balance function and its transfer to proactive balance function (i.e., voluntary step execution test and Berg balance test). Our primary hypothesis is that improvements in reactive balance control following block PBBT will be not inferior to the improvements following random PBBT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods and Analysis: This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Fifty community-dwelling older adults (over 70 years) will be recruited and randomly allocated to a random PBBT group (n = 25) or a block PBBT group (n = 25). The random PBBT group will receive eight training sessions over 4 weeks that include unexpected machine-induced perturbations of balance during hands-free treadmill walking. The block PBBT group will be trained by the same perturbation treadmill system, but only one direction will be trained in each training session, and the direction of the external perturbations will be announced. Both PBBT groups (random PBBT and block PBBT) will receive a similar perturbation intensity during training (which will be customized to participant’s abilities), the same training period, and the same concurrent cognitive tasks during training. The generalization and transfer of learning effects will be measured by assessing the reactive and proactive balance control during standing and walking before and after 1 month of PBBT, for example, step and multiple steps and fall thresholds, Berg balance test, and fear of falls. The dependent variable will be rank transformed prior to conducting the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to allow for nonparametric analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: This research will explore which of the balance retraining paradigms is more effective to improve reactive balance and proactive balance control in older adults (random PBBT vs. block PBBT) over 1 month. The research will address key issues concerning balance retraining: older adults’ neuromotor capacities to optimize training responses and their applicability to real-life challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: Helsinki research ethics approval has been received (Soroka Medical Center approval #0396-16-SOR; MOH_2018-07-22_003536; www.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04455607).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Event-Related Potential Correlates of Valence, Arousal, and Subjective Significance in Processing of an Emotional Stroop Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.617861</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.617861</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The present study is the first to measure event-related potentials associated with the processing of the emotional Stroop task (EST) with the use of an orthogonal factorial manipulation for emotional valence, arousal, and subjective significance (the importance of the current experience for goals and plans for the future). The current study aimed to investigate concurrently the role of the three dimensions describing the emotion-laden words for interference control measured in the classical version of the EST paradigm. The results showed that reaction times were affected by the emotional valence of presented words and the interactive effect of valence and arousal. The expected emotional arousal effect was only found in behavioral results for neutrally valenced words. Electrophysiological results showed valence and subjective significance correlated with the amplitude differences in the P2 component. Moreover, the amplitude of the N450 component varied with the level of subjective significance. This study also demonstrated that exploratory event-related potential analysis provides additional information beyond the classical component-based analysis. The obtained results show that cognitive control effects in the EST may be altered by manipulation in the subjective significance dimension.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Structural and Functional Changes Are Related to Cognitive Status in Wilson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.610947</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.610947</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Patients with Wilson’s disease (WD) suffer from prospective memory (PM) impairment, and some of patients develop cognitive impairment. However, very little is known about how brain structure and function changes effect PM in WD. Here, we employed multimodal neuroimaging data acquired from 22 WD patients and 26 healthy controls (HC) who underwent three-dimensional T1-weighted, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). We investigated gray matter (GM) volumes with voxel-based morphometry, DTI metrics using the fiber tractography method, and RS-fMRI using the seed-based functional connectivity method. Compared with HC, WD patients showed GM volume reductions in the basal ganglia (BG) and occipital fusiform gyrus, as well as volume increase in the visual association cortex. Moreover, whiter matter (WM) tracks of WD were widely impaired in association and limbic fibers. WM tracks in association fibers are significant related to PM in WD patients. Relative to HC, WD patients showed that the visual association cortex functionally connects to the thalamus and hippocampus, which is associated with global cognitive function in patients with WD. Together, these findings suggested that PM impairment in WD may be modulated by aberrant WM in association fibers, and that GM volume changes in the association cortex has no direct effect on cognitive status, but indirectly affect global cognitive function by its aberrant functional connectivity (FC) in patients with WD. Our findings may provide a new window to further study how WD develops into cognitive impairment, and deepen our understanding of the cognitive status and neuropathology of WD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Role of the Cerebellum in Social and Non-Social Action Sequences: A Preliminary LF-rTMS Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.593821</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of studies demonstrated the involvement of the cerebellum in (social) sequence processing. The current preliminary study is the first to investigate the causal involvement of the cerebellum in sequence generation, using low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (LF-rTMS). By targeting the posterior cerebellum, we hypothesized that the induced neuro-excitability modulation would lead to altered performance on a Picture and Story sequencing task, which involve the generation of the correct chronological order of various social and non-social stories depicted in cartoons or sentences. Our results indicate that participants receiving LF-rTMS over the cerebellum, as compared to sham participants, showed a stronger learning effect from pre to post stimulation for both tasks and for all types of sequences (i.e. mechanical, social scripts, false belief, true belief). No differences between sequence types were observed. Our results suggest a positive effect of LF-rTMS on sequence generation. We conclude that the cerebellum is causally involved in the generation of sequences of social and nonsocial events. Our discussion focuses on recommendations for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Monosynaptic Retrograde Tracing From Prelimbic Neuron Subpopulations Projecting to Either Nucleus Accumbens Core or Rostromedial Tegmental Nucleus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The prelimbic (PL) region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in both driving and suppressing motivated behaviors, including cocaine-seeking in rats. These seemingly opposing functions may be mediated by different efferent targets of PL projections, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), which have contrasting roles in reward-seeking behaviors. We sought to characterize the anatomical connectivity differences between PL neurons projecting to NAc core and RMTg. We used conventional retrograde tracers to reveal distinct subpopulations of PL neurons projecting to NAc core vs. RMTg in rats, with very little overlap. To examine potential differences in input specificity for these two PL subpopulations, we then used Cre-dependent rabies virus (EnvA-RV-EGFP) as a monosynaptic retrograde tracer and targeted specific PL neurons via injections of retrograde CAV2-Cre in either NAc core or RMTg. We observed a similar catalog of cortical, thalamic, and limbic afferents for both NAc- and RMTg-projecting populations, with the primary source of afferent information arising from neighboring prefrontal neurons in ipsilateral PL and infralimbic cortex (IL). However, when the two subpopulations were directly compared, we found that RMTg-projecting PL neurons received a greater proportion of input from ipsilateral PL and IL, whereas NAc-projecting PL neurons received a greater proportion of input from most other cortical areas, mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, and several other subcortical areas. NAc-projecting PL neurons also received a greater proportion of contralateral cortical input. Our findings reveal that PL subpopulations differ not only in their efferent target but also in the input specificity from afferent structures. These differences in connectivity are likely to be critical to functional differences of PL subpopulations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Genetic Background Effects on the Expression of an Odorant Receptor Gene</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.646413</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There are more than 1000 odorant receptor (OR) genes in the mouse genome. Each olfactory sensory neuron expresses only one of these genes, in a monoallelic fashion. The transcript abundance of homologous OR genes vary between distinct mouse strains. Here we analyzed the expression of the OR gene Olfr17 (also named P2) in different genomic contexts. Olfr17 is expressed at higher levels in the olfactory epithelium from 129 mice than from C57BL/6 (B6) mice. However, we found that in P2-IRES-tauGFP knock-in mice, the transcript levels of the 129 Olfr17 allele are highly reduced when compared to the B6 Olfr17 allele. To address the mechanisms involved in this variation we compared the 5′ region sequence and DNA methylation patterns of the B6 and 129 Olfr17 alleles. Our results show that genetic variations in cis regulatory regions can lead to differential DNA methylation frequencies in these OR gene alleles. They also show that expression of the Olfr17 alleles is largely affected by the genetic background, and suggest that in knock-in mice, expression can be affected by epigenetic modifications in the region of the targeted locus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Astrocytes, Noradrenaline, α1-Adrenoreceptors, and Neuromodulation: Evidence and Unanswered Questions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.645691</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Noradrenaline is a major neuromodulator in the central nervous system (CNS). It is released from varicosities on neuronal efferents, which originate principally from the main noradrenergic nuclei of the brain – the locus coeruleus – and spread throughout the parenchyma. Noradrenaline is released in response to various stimuli and has complex physiological effects, in large part due to the wide diversity of noradrenergic receptors expressed in the brain, which trigger diverse signaling pathways. In general, however, its main effect on CNS function appears to be to increase arousal state. Although the effects of noradrenaline have been researched extensively, the majority of studies have assumed that noradrenaline exerts its effects by acting directly on neurons. However, neurons are not the only cells in the CNS expressing noradrenaline receptors. Astrocytes are responsive to a range of neuromodulators – including noradrenaline. In fact, noradrenaline evokes robust calcium transients in astrocytes across brain regions, through activation of α1-adrenoreceptors. Crucially, astrocytes ensheath neurons at synapses and are known to modulate synaptic activity. Hence, astrocytes are in a key position to relay, or amplify, the effects of noradrenaline on neurons, most notably by modulating inhibitory transmission. Based on a critical appraisal of the current literature, we use this review to argue that a better understanding of astrocyte-mediated noradrenaline signaling is therefore essential, if we are ever to fully understand CNS function. We discuss the emerging concept of astrocyte heterogeneity and speculate on how this might impact the noradrenergic modulation of neuronal circuits. Finally, we outline possible experimental strategies to clearly delineate the role(s) of astrocytes in noradrenergic signaling, and neuromodulation in general, highlighting the urgent need for more specific and flexible experimental tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Inflammation Spreading: Negative Spiral Linking Systemic Inflammatory Disorders and Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As a physiological response to injury in the internal body organs, inflammation is responsible for removing dangerous stimuli and initiating healing. However, persistent and exaggerative chronic inflammation causes undesirable negative effects in the organs. Inflammation occurring in the brain and spinal cord is known as neuroinflammation, with microglia acting as the central cellular player. There is increasing evidence suggesting that chronic neuroinflammation is the most relevant pathological feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), regulating other pathological features, such as the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylation of Tau. Systemic inflammatory signals caused by systemic disorders are known to strongly influence neuroinflammation as a consequence of microglial activation, inflammatory mediator production, and the recruitment of peripheral immune cells to the brain, resulting in neuronal dysfunction. However, the neuroinflammation-accelerated neuronal dysfunction in AD also influences the functions of peripheral organs. In the present review, we highlight the link between systemic inflammatory disorders and AD, with inflammation serving as the common explosion. We discuss the molecular mechanisms that govern the crosstalk between systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation. In our view, inflammation spreading indicates a negative spiral between systemic diseases and AD. Therefore, “dampening inflammation” through the inhibition of cathepsin (Cat)B or CatS may be a novel therapeutic approach for delaying the onset of and enacting early intervention for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Insight Into the Mechanisms and the Challenges on Stem Cell-Based Therapies for Cerebral Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.637210</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Strokes are the most common types of cerebrovascular disease and remain a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Cerebral ischemic stroke is caused by a reduction in blood flow to the brain. In this disease, two major zones of injury are identified: the lesion core, in which cells rapidly progress toward death, and the ischemic penumbra (surrounding the lesion core), which is defined as hypoperfusion tissue where cells may remain viable and can be repaired. Two methods that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include intravenous thrombolytic therapy and endovascular thrombectomy, however, the narrow therapeutic window poses a limitation, and therefore a low percentage of stroke patients actually receive these treatments. Developments in stem cell therapy have introduced renewed hope to patients with ischemic stroke due to its potential effect for reversing the neurological sequelae. Over the last few decades, animal tests and clinical trials have been used to treat ischemic stroke experimentally with various types of stem cells. However, several technical and ethical challenges must be overcome before stem cells can become a choice for the treatment of stroke. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms, processes, and challenges of using stem cells in stroke treatment. We also discuss new developing trends in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Topographical Organization of M-Current on Dorsal and Median Raphe Serotonergic Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dorsal and median raphe nuclei (DR and MR, respectively) are members of the reticular activating system and play important role in the regulation of the sleep-wakefulness cycle, movement, and affective states. M-current is a voltage-gated potassium current under the control of neuromodulatory mechanisms setting neuronal excitability. Our goal was to determine the proportion of DR and MR serotonergic neurons possessing M-current and whether they are organized topographically. Electrophysiological parameters of raphe serotonergic neurons influenced by this current were also investigated. We performed slice electrophysiology on genetically identified serotonergic neurons. Neurons with M-current are located rostrally in the DR and dorsally in the MR. M-current determines firing rate, afterhyperpolarization amplitude, and adaptation index (AI) of these neurons, but does not affect input resistance, action potential width, and high threshold oscillations.These findings indicate that M-current has a strong impact on firing properties of certain serotonergic neuronal subpopulations and it might serve as an effective contributor to cholinergic and local serotonergic neuromodulatory actions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Thalamic Structural Connectivity Abnormalities in Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.592772</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background and Aims: Numerous studies have demonstrated thalamus-related structural, functional, and metabolic abnormalities in minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). We conducted the first study to investigate thalamic structural connectivity alterations in MHE.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based probabilistic tractography was employed to determine the structural linkage between the thalamus and cortical/subcortical regions in 52 cirrhotic patients [22 with MHE; 30 without MHE (NHE)] and 30 controls. We measured these thalamic connections, which included connectivity strength (CS), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD), and then compared these among the three groups. Neurocognitive assessment was also performed. Correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between neurocognitive performance and the above measurements. Classification analysis was performed to determine whether thalamic connection measurements can distinguish MHE from NHE.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The probabilistic tractography revealed thalamic structural connections, which were disrupted in cirrhotic patients (as reflected by a decrease in CS/FA and an increase in MD/AD/RD). Abnormal thalamic connections primarily involved the prefrontal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, parietal cortex, medial temporal cortex and hippocampus, and striatum. Thalamic connectivity abnormalities deteriorated from NHE to MHE, and they were correlated with patients’ neurocognitive performance. The moderate classification accuracy was obtained using CS and MD as discriminating indexes.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrated the altered thalamic structural connectivity involving both cortical and subcortical regions in MHE, which could be regarded as representative of MHE-related widespread impairments in white matter pathways. The disturbed thalamic connectivity may underlie the mechanism of cognitive deficits in MHE and may potentially be utilized as a biomarker for diagnosing MHE and in monitoring disease progression. In addition to thalamic–cortical/subcortical connections, further studies are recommended to explore the structural alterations in other white matter pathways in MHE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cellular Senescence in Brain Aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.646924</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging of the brain can manifest itself as a memory and cognitive decline, which has been shown to frequently coincide with changes in the structural plasticity of dendritic spines. Decreased number and maturity of spines in aged animals and humans, together with changes in synaptic transmission, may reflect aberrant neuronal plasticity directly associated with impaired brain functions. In extreme, a neurodegenerative disease, which completely devastates the basic functions of the brain, may develop. While cellular senescence in peripheral tissues has recently been linked to aging and a number of aging-related disorders, its involvement in brain aging is just beginning to be explored. However, accumulated evidence suggests that cell senescence may play a role in the aging of the brain, as it has been documented in other organs. Senescent cells stop dividing and shift their activity to strengthen the secretory function, which leads to the acquisition of the so called senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescent cells have also other characteristics, such as altered morphology and proteostasis, decreased propensity to undergo apoptosis, autophagy impairment, accumulation of lipid droplets, increased activity of senescence-associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), and epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and histone post-translational modifications that, in consequence, result in altered gene expression. Proliferation-competent glial cells can undergo senescence both in vitro and in vivo, and they likely participate in neuroinflammation, which is characteristic for the aging brain. However, apart from proliferation-competent glial cells, the brain consists of post-mitotic neurons. Interestingly, it has emerged recently, that non-proliferating neuronal cells present in the brain or cultivated in vitro can also have some hallmarks, including SASP, typical for senescent cells that ceased to divide. It has been documented that so called senolytics, which by definition, eliminate senescent cells, can improve cognitive ability in mice models. In this review, we ask questions about the role of senescent brain cells in brain plasticity and cognitive functions impairments and how senolytics can improve them. We will discuss whether neuronal plasticity, defined as morphological and functional changes at the level of neurons and dendritic spines, can be the hallmark of neuronal senescence susceptible to the effects of senolytics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Passive Immunization With a Novel Monoclonal Anti-PrP Antibody TW1 in an Alzheimer’s Mouse Model With Tau Pathology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.640677</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are a major pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Several studies have shown that amyloid β oligomers (Aβo) and tau oligomers mediate their toxicity, in part, via binding to cellular prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) and that some anti-PrP antibodies can block this interaction. We have generated a novel monoclonal anti-PrP antibody (TW1) and assessed the efficacy of passive immunization with it in a mouse model of AD with extensive tau pathology: hTau/PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice. These mice were injected intraperitoneally once a week with TW1 starting at 5 months of age. Behavior was assessed at 8 months of age and brain tissue was subsequently harvested for analysis of treatment efficacy at 9 months. Mice treated with TW1 did not show any significant difference in sensorimotor testing including traverse beam, rotarod, and locomotor activity compared to controls. Significant cognitive benefits were observed with the novel object recognition test (ORT) in the immunized mice (two-tailed, t-test p = 0.0019). Immunized mice also showed cognitive benefits on the closed field symmetrical maze (day 1 two-tailed t-test p = 0.0001; day 2 two-tailed t-test p = 0.0015; day 3 two-tailed t-test p = 0.0002). Reduction of tau pathology was observed with PHF-1 immunohistochemistry in the piriform cortex by 60% (two-tailed t-test p = 0.01) and in the dentate gyrus by 50% (two-tailed t-test p = 0.02) in animals treated with TW1 compared to controls. There were no significant differences in astrogliosis or microgliosis observed between treated and control mice. As assessed by Western blots using PHF-1, the TW1 therapy reduced phosphorylated tau pathology (two-tailed t-test p = 0.03) and improved the ratio of pathological soluble tau to tubulin (PHF1/tubulin; two-tailed t-test p = 0.0006). Reduction of tau pathology also was observed using the CP13 antibody (two-tailed t-test p = 0.0007). These results indicate that passive immunization with the TW1 antibody can significantly decrease tau pathology as assessed by immunohistochemical and biochemical methods, resulting in improved cognitive function in a tau transgenic mouse model of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: TNFRSF1B Gene Variants and Related Soluble TNFR2 Levels Impact Resilience in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.638922</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.638922</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) promotes neuronal survival downstream. This longitudinal study evaluated whether the TNFRSF1B gene encoding TNFR2 and levels of its soluble form (sTNFR2) affect Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers and clinical outcomes. Data analyzed included 188 patients in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia. Further, a replication study was performed in 48 patients with MCI with positive AD biomarkers who were treated at a memory clinic. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sTNFR2 levels along with two related TNFRSF1B gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs976881 and rs1061622 were assessed. General linear models were used to evaluate the effect of CSF sTNFR2 levels and each SNP in relationship to CSF t-tau and p-tau, cognitive domains, MRI brain measures, and longitudinal cognitive changes after adjustments were made for covariates such as APOE ε4 status. In the ADNI cohort, a significant interaction between rs976881 and CSF sTNFR2 modulates CSF t-tau and p-tau levels; hippocampal and whole brain volumes; and Digit Span Forwards subtest scores. In the replication cohort, a significant interaction between rs976881 and CSF sTNFR2 modulates CSF p-tau. A significant interaction between rs976881 and CSF sTNFR2 also impacts Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes scores over 12 months in the ADNI cohort. The interaction between TNFRSF1B variant rs976881 and CSF sTNFR2 levels was noted to modulate multiple AD-associated severity markers and cognitive domains. This interaction impacts resilience-related clinical outcomes in AD and lends support to sTNFR2 as a promising candidate for therapeutic targeting to improve clinical outcomes of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Reduced Superficial Capillary Density in Cerebral Infarction Is Inversely Correlated With the NIHSS Score</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.626334</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.626334</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: The retina and the brain share similar neuronal and microvascular features, therein we aimed to assess the structural and microvascular changes in the macula and choriocapillaris (CC) in patients with cerebral infarction when compared with healthy controls using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: OCTA was used to image and measure the capillary density in the radial peripapillary capillaries (RPC), superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), choriocapillaris (CC), and mean area of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in all participants. Twenty-two cerebral infarction patients based on their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 25 healthy controls were included in our study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Density of the RPC (P &amp;lt; 0.001), SCP (P = 0.001), DCP (P &amp;lt; 0.001) and CC (P &amp;lt; 0.001) were significantly reduced in cerebral infarction patients when compared with healthy controls, respectively. Retinal thickness measurements (P &amp;lt; 0.05) were significantly reduced in cerebral infarction patients when compared with healthy controls. The mean FAZ area was significantly larger (P = 0.012) in cerebral infarction patients when compared with healthy controls. National Institute of HealthStroke Scale (NIHSS) inversely correlated with SCP density in cerebral infarction patients (Rho = −0.409, P = 0.001). Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis showed that the blood flow of the choriocapillaris had the highest index [area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic (AUROC) = 0.964] to discriminate cerebral infarction patients from the healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our study suggests that cerebral microcirculation dysfunction which occurs in cerebral infarction is mirrored in the macula and choroidal microcirculation. OCTA has the potential to non-invasively characterize the macula and choroidal changes in cerebral infarction in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Serum Uric Acid and the Risk of Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.625690</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.625690</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the relationship between serum uric acid (UA) and the risk of dementia and its subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched from inception to July 2020. Random-effect models were employed to analyze the standard mean difference (SMD) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Twenty-three eligible studies involving 5,575 participants were identified. The overall results showed lower levels of UA in dementia relative to non-dementia controls [SMD = −0.32 (−0.64; −0.01) p = 0.04]. The subgroup analysis of the type of dementia demonstrated a significant association of UA with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [SMD = −0.58 (−1.02; −0.15) p = 0.009] and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) [SMD = −0.33 (−0.52; −0.14) p = 0.001] but not with vascular dementia (VaD). The stratification analysis of the concentrations of UA revealed that the UA quartile 1–2 was negatively correlated with dementia and neurodegenerative subtypes (p &amp;lt; 0.05), whereas a positive correlation of UA quartile 4 with dementia was noted (p = 0.028). Additionally, the meta-regression analysis on confounders showed that not age, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or smoking but education (p = 0.003) exerted an influence of the UA in the risk estimate of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Low concentrations of UA (&amp;lt; 292 μmol/L or 4.91 mg/dL) is a potential risk factor for AD and PDD but not for VaD. The mechanism of different concentrations of the UA in dementia needs to be confirmed through further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Listening Network and Cochlear Implant Benefits in Hearing-Impaired Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.589296</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.589296</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Older adults with mild or no hearing loss make more errors and expend more effort listening to speech. Cochlear implants (CI) restore hearing to deaf patients but with limited fidelity. We hypothesized that patient-reported hearing and health-related quality of life in CI patients may similarly vary according to age. Speech Spatial Qualities (SSQ) of hearing scale and Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI) questionnaires were administered to 543 unilaterally implanted adults across Europe, South Africa, and South America. Data were acquired before surgery and at 1, 2, and 3 years post-surgery. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models with visit, age group (18–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, and 65+), and side of implant as main factors and adjusted for other covariates. Tinnitus and dizziness prevalence did not vary with age, but older groups had more preoperative hearing. Preoperatively and postoperatively, SSQ scores were significantly higher (Δ0.75–0.82) for those aged &amp;lt;45 compared with those 55+. However, gains in SSQ scores were equivalent across age groups, although postoperative SSQ scores were higher in right-ear implanted subjects. All age groups benefited equally in terms of HUI gain (0.18), with no decrease in scores with age. Overall, younger adults appeared to cope better with a degraded hearing before and after CI, leading to better subjective hearing performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: On the evolution and development of morphological complexity: A view from gene regulatory networks</title>

How does morphological complexity evolve? This study suggests that the likelihood of mutations increasing phenotypic complexity becomes smaller when the phenotype itself is complex. In addition, the complexity of the genotype-phenotype map (GPM) also increases with the phenotypic complexity. We show that complex GPMs and the above mutational asymmetry are inevitable consequences of how genes need to be wired in order to build complex and robust phenotypes during development.
We randomly wired genes and cell behaviors into networks in EmbryoMaker. EmbryoMaker is a mathematical model of development that can simulate any gene network, all animal cell behaviors (division, adhesion, apoptosis, etc.), cell signaling, cell and tissues biophysics, and the regulation of those behaviors by gene products. Through EmbryoMaker we simulated how each random network regulates development and the resulting morphology (i.e. a specific distribution of cells and gene expression in 3D). This way we obtained a zoo of possible 3D morphologies. Real gene networks are not random, but a random search allows a relatively unbiased exploration of what is needed to develop complex robust morphologies. Compared to the networks leading to simple morphologies, the networks leading to complex morphologies have the following in common: 1) They are rarer; 2) They need to be finely tuned; 3) Mutations in them tend to decrease morphological complexity; 4) They are less robust to noise; and 5) They have more complex GPMs. These results imply that, when complexity evolves, it does so at a progressively decreasing rate over generations. This is because as morphological complexity increases, the likelihood of mutations increasing complexity decreases, morphologies become less robust to noise, and the GPM becomes more complex. We find some properties in common, but also some important differences, with non-developmental GPM models (e.g. RNA, protein and gene networks in single cells).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RI6MFTnDlEo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Noncanonical TGF-β signaling leads to FBXO3-mediated degradation of ΔNp63α promoting breast cancer metastasis and poor clinical prognosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001113</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Mengmeng Niu, Yajun He, Jing Xu, Liangping Ding, Tao He, Yong Yi, Mengyuan Fu, Rongtian Guo, Fengtian Li, Hu Chen, Ye-Guang Chen, Zhi-Xiong Jim Xiao&lt;/p&gt;

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling plays a critical role in promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, invasion, and tumor metastasis. ΔNp63α, the major isoform of p63 protein expressed in epithelial cells, is a key transcriptional regulator of cell adhesion program and functions as a critical metastasis suppressor. It has been documented that the expression of ΔNp63α is tightly controlled by oncogenic signaling and is frequently reduced in advanced cancers. However, whether TGF-β signaling regulates ΔNp63α expression in promoting metastasis is largely unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that activation of TGF-β signaling leads to stabilization of E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXO3, which, in turn, targets ΔNp63α for proteasomal degradation in a Smad-independent but Erk-dependent manner. Knockdown of FBXO3 or restoration of ΔNp63α expression effectively rescues TGF-β-induced EMT, cell motility, and tumor metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, clinical analyses reveal a significant correlation among TGF-β receptor I (TβRI), FBXO3, and p63 protein expression and that high expression of TβRI/FBXO3 and low expression of p63 are associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS). Together, these results demonstrate that FBXO3 facilitates ΔNp63α degradation to empower TGF-β signaling in promoting tumor metastasis and that the TβRI-FBXO3-ΔNp63α axis is critically important in breast cancer development and clinical prognosis. This study suggests that FBXO3 may be a potential therapeutic target for advanced breast cancer treatment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/26UgbajAt_Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Meta-research, or the science of science, is a powerful technique that scientists can use to improve science, however most scientists are unaware that meta-research exists and courses are rare. This initiative demonstrates the feasibility of a participant-guided “learn by doing” approach, in which a multidisciplinary, global team of early career researchers learned meta-research skills by working together to design, conduct and publish a meta-research study.

This Community Page article describes a participant-guided &quot;learn by doing&quot; initiative, in which a multidisciplinary, global team of early career researchers learned meta-research skills by working together to design, conduct and publish a meta-research (science of science) study.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Apolipoprotein E4 Reduction with Antisense Oligonucleotides Decreases Neurodegeneration in a Tauopathy Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26043</guid>

	<description>Objective
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for late‐onset Alzheimer's disease, with the ε4 allele increasing risk in a dose‐dependent fashion. In addition to ApoE4 playing a crucial role in amyloid‐β deposition, recent evidence suggests that it also plays an important role in tau pathology and tau‐mediated neurodegeneration. It is not known, however, whether therapeutic reduction of ApoE4 would exert protective effects on tau‐mediated neurodegeneration.


Methods
Herein, we used antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against human APOE to reduce ApoE4 levels in the P301S/ApoE4 mouse model of tauopathy. We treated P301S/ApoE4 mice with ApoE or control ASOs via intracerebroventricular injection at 6 and 7.5 months of age and performed brain pathological assessments at 9 months of age.


Results
Our results indicate that treatment with ApoE ASOs reduced ApoE4 protein levels by ~50%, significantly protected against tau pathology and associated neurodegeneration, decreased neuroinflammation, and preserved synaptic density. These data were also corroborated by a significant reduction in levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein in plasma of ASO‐treated mice.


Interpretation
We conclude that reducing ApoE4 levels should be explored further as a therapeutic approach for APOE4 carriers with tauopathy including Alzheimer's disease. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Diagnostic Utility of Gold Coast Criteria in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26045</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26045?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains problematic, with current diagnostic criteria (revised El Escorial [rEEC] and Awaji) being complex and prone to error. Consequently, the diagnostic utility of the recently proposed Gold Coast criteria was determined in ALS.


Methods
We retrospectively reviewed 506 patients (302 males, 204 females) to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the Gold Coast criteria to that of the Awaji and rEEC criteria (defined by the proportion of patients categorized as definite, probable, or possible ALS) in accordance with standards of reporting of diagnostic accuracy criteria.


Results
The sensitivity of Gold Coast criteria (92%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 88.7–94.6%) was comparable to that of Awaji (90.3%, 95% CI = 86.69–93.2%) and rEEC (88.6, 95% CI = 84.8–91.7%) criteria. Additionally, the Gold Coast criteria sensitivity was maintained across different subgroups, defined by site of onset, disease duration, and functional disability. In atypical ALS phenotypes, the Gold Coast criteria exhibited greater sensitivity and specificity.


Interpretation
The present study established the diagnostic utility of the Gold Coast criteria in ALS, with benefits evident in bulbar and limb onset disease patients, as well as atypical phenotypes. The Gold Coast criteria should be considered in clinical practice and therapeutic trials. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Inflammatory Cytokine Patterns Associated with Neurological Diseases in Coronavirus Disease 2019</title>

	<description>Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) can present with distinct neurological manifestations. This study shows that inflammatory neurological diseases were associated with increased levels of interleukin (IL)‐2, IL‐4, IL‐6, IL‐10, IL‐12, chemokine (C‐X‐C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL8), and CXCL10 in the cerebrospinal fluid. Conversely, encephalopathy was associated with high serum levels of IL‐6, CXCL8, and active tumor growth factor β1. Inflammatory syndromes of the central nervous system in COVID‐19 can appear early, as a parainfectious process without significant systemic involvement, or without direct evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 neuroinvasion. At the same time, encephalopathy is mainly influenced by peripheral events, including inflammatory cytokines. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Organization of radial glia reveals growth pattern in the telencephalon of a percomorph fish Astatotilapia burtoni</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25126</guid>

	<description>The orientation of radial glia in the dorsal telencephalon of teleost fish follows a morphogenetic process called eversion. We studied the radial glia in the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni and found that glial processes get increasingly displaced by central pallial areas during growth. New cells are added to the growing brain subventricularly consistent with a stacking growth pattern (Cell Addition I). In addition, our data suggest that radial glial cells give rise to migrating astroglial cells providing new neurons and glia to deeper pallial regions (Cell Addition II).







Abstract
In the brain of teleost fish, radial glial cells are the main astroglial cell type. To understand how radial glia structures are adapting to continuous growth of the brain, we studied the astroglial cells in the telencephalon of the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni in small fry to large specimens. These animals grow to a standard length of 10–12 cm in this fish species, corresponding to a more than 100‐fold increase in brain volume. Focusing on the telencephalon where glial cells are arranged radially in the everted (dorsal) pallium, immunocytochemistry for glial markers revealed an aberrant pattern of radial glial fibers in the central division of the dorsal pallium (DC, i.e., DC4 and DC5). The main glial processes curved around these nuclei, especially in the posterior part of the telencephalon. This was verified in tissue‐cleared brains stained for glial markers. We further analyzed the growth of radial glia by immunocytochemically applied stem cell (proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA], Sox2) and differentiation marker (doublecortin) and found that these markers were expressed at the ventricular surface consistent with a stacking growth pattern. In addition, we detected doublecortin and Sox2 positive cells in deeper nuclei of DC areas. Our data suggest that radial glial cells give rise to migrating cells providing new neurons and glia to deeper pallial regions. This results in expansion of the central pallial areas and displacement of existing radial glial. In summary, we show that radial glial cells can adapt to morphological growth processes in the adult fish brain and contribute to this growth.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Investigating the brain structural connectome following working memory training in children born extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/jnr.24818</guid>

	<description>In this randomized controlled trial, we found little evidence that the Cogmed working memory training program influenced brain structural connectivity networks compared with a placebo program in children born extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight. There was also little evidence for relationships between structural connectivity and working memory performance.

Abstract
Children born extremely preterm (EP, &amp;lt;28 weeks’ gestation) or extremely low birth weight (ELBW, &amp;lt;1,000 g) are a vulnerable population at high risk of working memory impairments. We aimed to examine changes in the brain structural connectivity networks thought to underlie working memory performance, after completion of a working memory training program (Cogmed) compared with a placebo program in EP/ELBW children. This was a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled randomized trial (the Improving Memory in a Preterm Randomised Intervention Trial). Children born EP/ELBW received either the Cogmed or placebo program at 7 years of age (n = 91). A subset of children had magnetic resonance imaging of the brain immediately pre‐ and 2 weeks post‐training (Cogmed n = 28; placebo n = 27). T1‐weighted and diffusion‐weighted images were used to perform graph theoretical analysis of structural connectivity networks. Changes from pre‐training to post‐training in structural connectivity metrics were generally similar between randomized groups. There was little evidence that changes in structural connectivity metrics were related to changes in working memory performance from pre‐ to post‐training. Overall, our results provide little evidence that the Cogmed working memory training program has training‐specific effects on structural connectivity networks in EP/ELBW children.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: (Dys)regulation of Synaptic Activity and Neurotransmitter Release by β-Amyloid: A Look Beyond Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.635880</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.635880</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Beside its widely studied role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), β-amyloid (Aβ) is a normal and soluble product of neuronal metabolism that regulates several key physiological functions, exerting neuromodulatory effects on synaptic plasticity, memory, and neurotransmitter release. Such effects have been observed to occur in a hormetic fashion, with Aβ exhibiting a dual role influenced by its concentration, the different isoforms, or aggregation forms of the peptide. However, to date, our knowledge about the physiological functions of Aβ and, in particular, its modulatory role on synaptic activity and neurotransmission in the normal brain is fragmentary, thus hindering a clear comprehension of the biological mechanisms underlying the derangement from function to dysfunction. In particular, according to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the switch from physiology to pathology is linked to the abnormal increase in Aβ levels, due to an imbalance in Aβ production and clearance. In this regard, increased Aβ levels have been hypothesized to induce early defects in synaptic function and such alterations have been suggested to account, at least in part, for the onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., apathy, anxiety, changes in mood, depression, and agitation/aggression), frequently observed in the prodromal stage of AD. Therefore, understanding the biological mechanisms underlying early synaptic alterations in AD is a key starting point to frame the relevant time windows for AD treatment and to gain insight into AD etiopathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Diffusion Tensor Imaging Detects Acute Pathology-Specific Changes in the P301L Tauopathy Mouse Model Following Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.611451</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been linked with tauopathy. However, imaging methods that can non-invasively detect tau-protein abnormalities following TBI need further investigation. This study aimed to investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to detect tauopathy following TBI in P301L mutant-tau-transgenic-pR5-mice. A total of 24 9-month-old pR5 mice were randomly assigned to sham and TBI groups. Controlled cortical injuries/craniotomies were performed for TBI/sham groups followed by DTI data acquisition on days 1 and 7 post-injury. DTI data were analyzed by using voxelwise analysis and track-based spatial statistics for gray matter and white matter. Further, immunohistochemistry was performed for total-tau and phosphorylated-tau, astrocytes, and microglia. To detect the association of DTI with these pathological markers, a correlation analysis was performed between DTI and histology findings. At day 1 post-TBI, DTI revealed a widespread reduction in fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (AxD) in the TBI group compared to shams. On day 7, further reduction in FA, AxD, and mean diffusivity and increased radial diffusivity were observed. FA was significantly increased in the amygdala and cortex. Correlation results showed that in the ipsilateral hemisphere FA reduction was associated with increased phosphorylated-tau and glial-immunoreactivity, whereas in the contralateral regions, the FA increase was associated with increased immunostaining for astrocytes. This study is the first to exploit DTI to investigate the effect of TBI in tau-transgenic mice. We show that alterations in the DTI signal were associated with glial activity following TBI and would most likely reflect changes that co-occur with/without phosphorylated-tau. In addition, FA may be a promising measure to identify discrete pathological processes such as increased astroglia activation, tau-hyperphosphorylation or both in the brain following TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Systems Biology: The Epidemiological and Mechanistic Understanding of the Neurological Manifestations of COVID-19: A Comprehensive Meta-Analysis and a Network Medicine Observation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The clinical characteristics and biological effects on the nervous system of infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain poorly understood. The aim of this study is to advance epidemiological and mechanistic understanding of the neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using stroke as a case study. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of clinical studies reporting stroke history, intensive inflammatory response, and procoagulant state C-reactive protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT), and coagulation indicator (D-dimer) in patients with COVID-19. Via network-based analysis of SARS-CoV-2 host genes and stroke-associated genes in the human protein-protein interactome, we inspected the underlying inflammatory mechanisms between COVID-19 and stroke. Finally, we further verified the network-based findings using three RNA-sequencing datasets generated from SARS-CoV-2 infected populations. We found that the overall pooled prevalence of stroke history was 2.98% (95% CI, 1.89–4.68; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=69.2%) in the COVID-19 population. Notably, the severe group had a higher prevalence of stroke (6.06%; 95% CI 3.80–9.52; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 42.6%) compare to the non-severe group (1.1%, 95% CI 0.72–1.71; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0%). There were increased levels of CRP, PCT, and D-dimer in severe illness, and the pooled mean difference was 40.7 mg/L (95% CI, 24.3–57.1), 0.07 μg/L (95% CI, 0.04–0.10) and 0.63 mg/L (95% CI, 0.28–0.97), respectively. Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), one of the leukocyte adhesion molecules, is suspected to play a vital role of SARS-CoV-2 mediated inflammatory responses. RNA-sequencing data analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients further revealed the relative importance of inflammatory responses in COVID-19-associated neurological manifestations. In summary, we identified an elevated vulnerability of those with a history of stroke to severe COVID-19 underlying inflammatory responses (i.e., VCAM-1) and procoagulant pathways, suggesting monotonic relationships, thus implicating causality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Deep Learning Approach for the Photoacoustic Tomography Recovery From Undersampled Measurements</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.598693</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a propitious imaging modality, which is helpful for biomedical study. However, fast PAT imaging and denoising is an exigent task in medical research. To address the problem, recently, methods based on compressed sensing (CS) have been proposed, which accede the low computational cost and high resolution for implementing PAT. Nevertheless, the imaging results of the sparsity-based methods strictly rely on sparsity and incoherence conditions. Furthermore, it is onerous to ensure that the experimentally acquired photoacoustic data meets CS’s prerequisite conditions. In this work, a deep learning–based PAT (Deep-PAT)method is instigated to overcome these limitations. By using a neural network, Deep-PAT is not only able to reconstruct PAT from a fewer number of measurements without considering the prerequisite conditions of CS, but also can eliminate undersampled artifacts effectively. The experimental results demonstrate that Deep-PAT is proficient at recovering high-quality photoacoustic images using just 5% of the original measurement data. Besides this, compared with the sparsity-based method, it can be seen through statistical analysis that the quality is significantly improved by 30% (approximately), having average SSIM = 0.974 and PSNR = 29.88 dB with standard deviation ±0.007 and ±0.089, respectively, by the proposed Deep-PAT method. Also, a comparsion of multiple neural networks provides insights into choosing the best one for further study and practical implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Correcting for Non-stationarity in BOLD-fMRI Connectivity Analyses</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this work fMRI BOLD datasets are shown to contain slice-dependent non-stationarities. A model containing slice-dependent, non-stationary signal power is proposed to address time-varying signal power during BOLD data acquisition. The impact of non-stationary power on functional MRI connectivity is analytically derived, establishing that pairwise connectivity estimates are scaled by a function of the time-varying signal power, with magnitude upper bound by 1, and that the variance of sample correlation is increased, thereby inducing spurious connectivity. Consequently, we make the observation that time-varying power during acquisition of BOLD timeseries has the propensity to diminish connectivity estimates. To ameliorate the impact of non-stationary signal power, a simple correction for slice-dependent non-stationarity is proposed. Our correction is analytically shown to restore both signal stationarity and, subsequently, the integrity of connectivity estimates. Theoretical results are corroborated with empirical evidence demonstrating the utility of our correction. In addition, slice-dependent non-stationary variance is experimentally determined to be optimally characterized by an inverse Gamma distribution. The resulting distribution of a voxel's signal intensity is analytically derived to be a generalized Student's-t distribution, providing support for the Gaussianity assumption typically imposed by fMRI connectivity methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To examine changes in patients’ desired control of the deep brain stimulator (DBS) and perception of global life control throughout DBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A consecutive cohort of 52 patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) was recruited to participate in a prospective longitudinal study over three assessment points (pre-surgery, post-surgery months 3 and 6). Semi-structured interviews assessing participants’ desire for stimulation control and perception of global control were conducted at all three points. Qualitative data were coded using content analysis. Visual analog scales were embedded in the interviews to quantify participants’ perceptions of control over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Participants reported significant increases in their perception of global control over time and significant declines in their desired control of the stimulation. These changes were unrelated to improvements in motor symptoms. Improvements in global control were negatively correlated with a decline in desired stimulation control. Qualitative data indicate that participants have changed, nuanced levels of desired control over their stimulators. Increased global life control following DBS may be attributed to increased control over PD symptoms, increased ability to engage in valued activities, and increased overall self-regulation, while other domains related to global control remained unaffected by DBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: There are few empirical data documenting patients’ desire for stimulation control throughout neuromodulation and how stimulation control is related to other aspects of control despite the growing application of neuromodulation devices to treat a variety of disorders. Our data highlight distinctions in different types of control and have implications for the development of patient-controlled neurostimulation devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cognitive Impairment in Adolescent Major Depressive Disorder With Nonsuicidal Self-Injury: Evidence Based on Multi-indicator ERPs</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.637407</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescents is reported to be as high as 20%; thus, MDD constitutes a significant social and public health burden. MDD is often associated with nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) behavior, but the contributing factors including cognitive function have not been investigated in detail. To this end, the present study evaluated cognitive impairment and psychosocial factors in associated with MDD with NSSI behavior. Eighteen and 21 drug-naïve patients with first-episode MDD with or without NSSI (NSSI+/– group) and 24 healthy control subjects (HC) were enrolled in the study. The Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Adolescent Self-injury Questionnaire, Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation–Chinese Version (BSI-CV), Shame Scale for Middle School Students, Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) were used to assess depression-related behaviors, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded as a measure of cognitive function. The latency of the N1, N2, P3a, P3b, and P50 components of ERPs at the Cz electrode point; P50 amplitude and P50 inhibition (S1/S2) showed significant differences between the 3 groups. CTQ scores also differed across three groups, and the NSSI– and NSSI+ groups showed significant differences in scores on the Shame Scale for Middle School Students. Thus, cognitive function was impaired in adolescents with MDD with NSSI behavior, which was mainly manifested as memory decline, attention and executive function deficits, and low anti-interference ability. We also found that childhood abuse, lack of social support, and a sense of shame contributed to NSSI behavior. These findings provide insight into the risk factors for MDD with NSSI behavior, which can help mental health workers more effectively diagnose and treat these patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Infantile Iron Deficiency Affects Brain Development in Monkeys Even After Treatment of Anemia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.624107</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A high percent of oxidative energy metabolism is needed to support brain growth during infancy. Unhealthy diets and limited nutrition, as well as other environmental insults, can compromise these essential developmental processes. In particular, iron deficiency anemia (IDA) has been found to undermine both normal brain growth and neurobehavioral development. Even moderate ID may affect neural maturation because when iron is limited, it is prioritized first to red blood cells over the brain. A primate model was used to investigate the neural effects of a transient ID and if deficits would persist after iron treatment. The large size and postnatal growth of the monkey brain makes the findings relevant to the metabolic and iron needs of human infants, and initiating treatment upon diagnosis of anemia reflects clinical practice. Specifically, this analysis determined whether brain maturation would still be compromised at 1 year of age if an anemic infant was treated promptly once diagnosed. The hematology and iron status of 41 infant rhesus monkeys was screened at 2-month intervals. Fifteen became ID; 12 met clinical criteria for anemia and were administered iron dextran and B vitamins for 1–2 months. MRI scans were acquired at 1 year. The volumetric and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures from the ID infants were compared with monkeys who remained continuously iron sufficient (IS). A prior history of ID was associated with smaller total brain volumes, driven primarily by significantly less total gray matter (GM) and smaller GM volumes in several cortical regions. At the macrostructual level, the effect on white matter volumes (WM) was not as overt. However, DTI analyses of WM microstructure indicated two later-maturating anterior tracts were negatively affected. The findings reaffirm the importance of iron for normal brain development. Given that brain differences were still evident even after iron treatment and following recovery of iron-dependent hematological indices, the results highlight the importance of early detection and preemptive supplementation to limit the neural consequences of ID.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Epileptic High-Frequency Oscillations in Intracranial EEG Are Not Confounded by Cognitive Tasks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.613125</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.613125</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rationale: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial EEG (iEEG) are used to delineate the epileptogenic zone during presurgical diagnostic assessment in patients with epilepsy. HFOs are historically divided into ripples (80–250 Hz), fast ripples (FR, &amp;gt;250 Hz), and their co-occurrence (FRandR). In a previous study, we had validated the rate of FRandRs during deep sleep to predict seizure outcome. Here, we ask whether epileptic FRandRs might be confounded by physiological FRandRs that are unrelated to epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We recorded iEEG in the medial temporal lobe MTL (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala) in 17 patients while they performed cognitive tasks. The three cognitive tasks addressed verbal working memory, visual working memory, and emotional processing. In our previous studies, these tasks activated the MTL. We re-analyzed the data of these studies with the automated detector that focuses on the co-occurrence of ripples and FRs (FRandR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: For each task, we identified those channels in which the HFO rate was modulated during the task condition compared to the control condition. However, the number of these channels did not exceed the chance level. Interestingly, even during wakefulness, the HFO rate was higher for channels within the seizure onset zone (SOZ) than for channels outside the SOZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our prospective definition of an epileptic HFO, the FRandR, is not confounded by physiological HFOs that might be elicited by our cognitive tasks. This is reassuring for the clinical use of FRandR as a biomarker of the EZ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Semantic Grounding of Novel Spoken Words in the Primary Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.581847</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.581847</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Embodied theories of grounded semantics postulate that, when word meaning is first acquired, a link is established between symbol (word form) and corresponding semantic information present in modality-specific—including primary—sensorimotor cortices of the brain. Direct experimental evidence documenting the emergence of such a link (i.e., showing that presentation of a previously unknown, meaningless word sound induces, after learning, category-specific reactivation of relevant primary sensory or motor brain areas), however, is still missing. Here, we present new neuroimaging results that provide such evidence. We taught participants aspects of the referential meaning of previously unknown, senseless novel spoken words (such as “Shruba” or “Flipe”) by associating them with either a familiar action or a familiar object. After training, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to analyze the participants’ brain responses to the new speech items. We found that hearing the newly learnt object-related word sounds selectively triggered activity in the primary visual cortex, as well as secondary and higher visual areas.These results for the first time directly document the formation of a link between the novel, previously meaningless spoken items and corresponding semantic information in primary sensory areas in a category-specific manner, providing experimental support for perceptual accounts of word-meaning acquisition in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Local Homeostatic Regulation of the Spectral Radius of Echo-State Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.587721</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recurrent cortical networks provide reservoirs of states that are thought to play a crucial role for sequential information processing in the brain. However, classical reservoir computing requires manual adjustments of global network parameters, particularly of the spectral radius of the recurrent synaptic weight matrix. It is hence not clear if the spectral radius is accessible to biological neural networks. Using random matrix theory, we show that the spectral radius is related to local properties of the neuronal dynamics whenever the overall dynamical state is only weakly correlated. This result allows us to introduce two local homeostatic synaptic scaling mechanisms, termed flow control and variance control, that implicitly drive the spectral radius toward the desired value. For both mechanisms the spectral radius is autonomously adapted while the network receives and processes inputs under working conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the two adaptation mechanisms under different external input protocols. Moreover, we evaluated the network performance after adaptation by training the network to perform a time-delayed XOR operation on binary sequences. As our main result, we found that flow control reliably regulates the spectral radius for different types of input statistics. Precise tuning is however negatively affected when interneural correlations are substantial. Furthermore, we found a consistent task performance over a wide range of input strengths/variances. Variance control did however not yield the desired spectral radii with the same precision, being less consistent across different input strengths. Given the effectiveness and remarkably simple mathematical form of flow control, we conclude that self-consistent local control of the spectral radius via an implicit adaptation scheme is an interesting and biological plausible alternative to conventional methods using set point homeostatic feedback controls of neural firing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Real Time Generation of Three Dimensional Patterns for Multiphoton Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.609505</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The advent of optogenetics has revolutionized experimental research in the field of Neuroscience and the possibility to selectively stimulate neurons in 3D volumes has opened new routes in the understanding of brain dynamics and functions. The combination of multiphoton excitation and optogenetic methods allows to identify and excite specific neuronal targets by means of the generation of cloud of excitation points. The most widely employed approach to produce the points cloud is through a spatial light modulation (SLM) which works with a refresh rate of tens of Hz. However, the computational time requested to calculate 3D patterns ranges between a few seconds and a few minutes, strongly limiting the overall performance of the system. The maximum speed of SLM can in fact be employed either with high quality patterns embedded into pre-calculated sequences or with low quality patterns for real time update. Here, we propose the implementation of a recently developed compressed sensing Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm on a consumer graphical processor unit allowing the generation of high quality patterns at video rate. This, would in turn dramatically reduce dead times in the experimental sessions, and could enable applications previously impossible, such as the control of neuronal network activity driven by the feedback from single neurons functional signals detected through calcium or voltage imaging or the real time compensation of motion artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Differential Macrophage Responses in Affective Versus Non-Affective First-Episode Psychosis Patients</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increased innate immune activation and inflammation are common findings in psychotic and affective (mood) disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), including increased numbers and activation of monocytes and macrophages. These findings often differ depending on the disorder, for example, we previously found increases in circulating inflammatory cytokines associated with monocytes and macrophages in SCZ, while BD had increases in anti-inflammatory cytokines. Despite these differences, few studies have specifically compared immune dysfunction in affective versus non-affective psychotic disorders and none have compared functional monocyte responses across these disorders. To address this, we recruited 25 first episode psychosis (FEP) patients and 23 healthy controls (HC). FEP patients were further grouped based on the presence (AFF) or absence (NON) of mood disorder. We isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cultured them for 1 week with M-CSF to obtain monocyte-derived macrophages. These cells were then stimulated for 24 h to skew them to inflammatory and alternative phenotypes, in order to identify differences in these responses. Following stimulation with LPS and LPS plus IFNγ, we found that macrophages from the NON-group had diminished inflammatory responses compared to both HC and AFF groups. Interestingly, when skewing macrophages to an alternative phenotype using LPS plus IL-4, the AFF macrophages increased production of inflammatory cytokines. Receiver operating curve analysis showed predictive power of inflammatory cytokine concentrations after LPS stimulation in the AFF group versus NON-group. Our results suggest dysfunctional monocyte responses in both affective and non-affective psychotic disorder, with varying types of immune dysfunction depending on the presence or absence of a mood component.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Failure of Glial Cell-Line Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF) in Clinical Trials Orchestrated By Reduced NR4A2 (NURR1) Transcription Factor in Parkinson’s Disease. A Systematic Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.645583</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative maladies with unforeseen complex pathologies. While this neurodegenerative disorder’s neuropathology is reasonably well known, its etiology remains a mystery, making it challenging to aim therapy. Glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) remains an auspicious therapeutic molecule for treating PD. Neurotrophic factor derived from glial cell lines is effective in rodents and nonhuman primates, but clinical findings have been equivocal. Laborious exertions have been made over the past few decades to improve and assess GDNF in treating PD (clinical studies). Definitive clinical trials have, however, failed to demonstrate a survival advantage. Consequently, there seemed to be a doubt as to whether GDNF has merit in the potential treatment of PD. The purpose of this cutting edge review is to speculate as to why the clinical trials have failed to meet the primary endpoint. We introduce a hypothesis, “Failure of GDNF in clinical trials succumbed by nuclear receptor-related factor 1 (Nurr1) shortfall.” We demonstrate how Nurr1 binds to GDNF to induce dopaminergic neuron synthesis. Due to its undisputable neuro-protection aptitude, we display Nurr1 (also called Nr4a2) as a promising therapeutic target for PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) and osteoporosis are both common aging diseases. It is reported that PD has a close relationship with osteoporosis and bone secretory proteins may be involved in disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To detect the bone-derived factors in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with PD and evaluate their correlations with C-reaction protein (CRP) level, motor impairment, and Hoehn-Yahr (HY) stage of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We included 250 PD patients and 250 controls. Levels of osteocalcin (OCN), osteopontin (OPN), osteoprotegerin (OPG), Sclerostin (SO), Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), and Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) in plasma and CSF were measured by custom protein antibody arrays. Data were analyzed using Mann–Whitney U-test and Spearman’s receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Plasma levels of OCN and OPN were correlated with CRP levels and HY stage and motor impairment of PD. Furthermore, the plasma assessment with CSF detection may enhance their potential prediction on PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: OCN and OPN may serve as potential biomarkers for PD. The inflammation response may be involved in the cross-talk between the two factors and PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Blood Hemoglobin, in-vivo Alzheimer Pathologies, and Cognitive Impairment: A Cross-Sectional Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.625511</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.625511</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Despite known associations between low blood hemoglobin level and Alzheimer's disease (AD) or cognitive impairment, the underlying neuropathological links are poorly understood. We aimed to examine the relationships of blood hemoglobin levels with in vivo AD pathologies (i.e., cerebral beta-amyloid [Aβ] deposition, tau deposition, and AD-signature degeneration) and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), which are a measure of cerebrovascular injury. We also investigated the association between hemoglobin level and cognitive performance, and then assessed whether such an association is mediated by brain pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 428 non-demented older adults underwent comprehensive clinical assessments, hemoglobin level measurement, and multimodal brain imaging, including Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography (PET), AV-1451 PET, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, and magnetic resonance imaging. Episodic memory score and global cognition scores were also measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A lower hemoglobin level was significantly associated with reduced AD-signature cerebral glucose metabolism (AD-CM), but not Aβ deposition, tau deposition, or WMH volume. A lower hemoglobin level was also significantly associated with poorer episodic memory and global cognition scores, but such associations disappeared when AD-CM was controlled as a covariate, indicating that AD-CM has a moderating effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The present findings suggest that low blood hemoglobin in older adults is associated with cognitive decline via reduced brain metabolism, which seems to be independent of those aspects of AD-specific protein pathologies and cerebrovascular injury that are reflected in PET and MRI measures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Aging Alters Daily and Regional Calretinin Neuronal Expression in the Rat Non-image Forming Visual Thalamus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.613305</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.613305</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging affects the overall physiology, including the image-forming and non-image forming visual systems. Among the components of the latter, the thalamic retinorecipient inter-geniculate leaflet (IGL) and ventral lateral geniculate (vLGN) nucleus conveys light information to subcortical regions, adjusting visuomotor, and circadian functions. It is noteworthy that several visual related cells, such as neuronal subpopulations in the IGL and vLGN are neurochemically characterized by the presence of calcium binding proteins. Calretinin (CR), a representative of such proteins, denotes region-specificity in a temporal manner by variable day–night expression. In parallel, age-related brain dysfunction and neurodegeneration are associated with abnormal intracellular concentrations of calcium. Here, we investigated whether daily changes in the number of CR neurons are a feature of the aged IGL and vLGN in rats. To this end, we perfused rats, ranging from 3 to 24 months of age, within distinct phases of the day, namely zeitgeber times (ZTs). Then, we evaluated CR immunolabeling through design-based stereological cell estimation. We observed distinct daily rhythms of CR expression in the IGL and in both the retinorecipient (vLGNe) and non-retinorecipient (vLGNi) portions of the vLGN. In the ZT 6, the middle of the light phase, the CR cells are reduced with aging in the IGL and vLGNe. In the ZT 12, the transition between light to dark, an age-related CR loss was found in all nuclei. While CR expression predominates in specific spatial domains of vLGN, age-related changes appear not to be restricted at particular portions. No alterations were found in the dark/light transition or in the middle of the dark phase, ZTs 0, and 18, respectively. These results are relevant in the understanding of how aging shifts the phenotype of visual related cells at topographically organized channels of visuomotor and circadian processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Resilience to Plasma and Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid-β in Cognitively Normal Individuals: Findings From Two Cohort Studies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.610755</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To define resilience metrics for cognitive decline based on plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β (Aβ) and examine the demographic, genetic, and neuroimaging factors associated with interindividual differences among metrics of resilience and to demonstrate the ability of such metrics to predict the diagnostic conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In this study, cognitively normal (CN) participants with Aβ-positive were included from the Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline (SILCODE, n = 100) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n = 144). Using a latent variable model of data, metrics of resilience [brain resilience (BR), cognitive resilience (CR), and global resilience (GR)] were defined based on the plasma Aβ and CSF Aβ. Linear regression analyses were applied to investigate the association between characteristics of individuals (age, sex, educational level, genetic, and neuroimaging factors) and their resilience. The plausibility of these metrics was tested using linear mixed-effects models and Cox regression models in longitudinal analyses. We also compared the effectiveness of these metrics with conventional metrics in predicting the clinical progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Although individuals in the ADNI cohort were older (74.68 [5.65] vs. 65.38 [4.66], p &amp;lt; 0.001) and had higher educational levels (16.3 [2.6] vs. 12.6 [2.8], p &amp;lt; 0.001) than those in the SILCODE cohort, similar loadings between resilience and its indicators were found within both models. BR and GR were mainly associated with age, women, and brain volume in both cohorts. Prediction models showed that higher CR and GR were related to better cognitive performance, and specifically, all types of resilience to CSF Aβ could predict longitudinal cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Different phenotypes of resilience depending on cognition and brain volumes were associated with different factors. Such comprehensive resilience provided insight into the mechanisms of susceptibility for Alzheimer's disease (AD) at the individual level, and interindividual differences in resilience had the potential to predict the disease progression in CN people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Analysis of Circulating Microvesicles Levels and Effects of Associated Factors in Elderly Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.609282</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the elderly is high, and the disorder is associated with a variety of chronic diseases. Microvesicles (MVs) are extracellular vesicles secreted by various cells during stimulation or apoptosis that play an important role in the pathogenesis of OSA. However, concentrations of circulating MVs in elderly patients with OSA remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Patients aged &amp;gt;60 years old were recruited and underwent polysomnography. Circulating plasma MV concentrations, including annexin V&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;MVs, endothelial MVs (EMVs), platelet MVs (PMVs), and leukocyte MVs (LMVs) levels, were measured using a flow cytometer with different labeling methods. Potential factors affecting the concentration of circulating MVs in elderly patients with OSA were determined via Spearman's correlation and multiple linear regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Levels of circulating MVs, including both single- (annexin V&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;MVs, CD144&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;EMVs, CD41a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;PMVs, and CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;LMVs) and dual-labeled MVs (annexin V&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD144&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;EMVs), were elevated in elderly patients with OSA. Circulating MVs were positively correlated with OSA severity (AHI, ODI, and SPO&lt;sub&gt;2min&lt;/sub&gt;). To some extent, obesity affected the MV concentrations in elderly patients with OSA. In addition, age and comorbidities may be associated with MV levels, but the correlations between the MV levels and age or comorbidities were not significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Concentrations of circulating MVs in elderly patients with OSA are associated with the labeling method used, OSA severity, and obesity. The effects of age and comorbidities on circulating MV levels require further verification using a larger sample size.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Large-Scale Morphological Network Efficiency of Human Brain: Cognitive Intelligence and Emotional Intelligence</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Network efficiency characterizes how information flows within a network, and it has been used to study the neural basis of cognitive intelligence in adolescence, young adults, and elderly adults, in terms of the white matter in the human brain and functional connectivity networks. However, there were few studies investigating whether the human brain at different ages exhibited different underpins of cognitive and emotional intelligence (EI) from young adults to the middle-aged group, especially in terms of the morphological similarity networks in the human brain. In this study, we used 65 datasets (aging 18–64), including sMRI and behavioral measurements, to study the associations of network efficiency with cognitive intelligence and EI in young adults and the middle-aged group. We proposed a new method of defining the human brain morphological networks using the morphological distribution similarity (including cortical volume, surface area, and thickness). Our results showed inverted age × network efficiency interactions in the relationship of surface-area network efficiency with cognitive intelligence and EI: a negative age × global efficiency (nodal efficiency) interaction in cognitive intelligence, while a positive age × global efficiency (nodal efficiency) interaction in EI. In summary, this study not only proposed a new method of morphological similarity network but also emphasized the developmental effects on the brain mechanisms of intelligence from young adult to middle-aged groups and may promote mental health study on the middle-aged group in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Exogenous Alpha-Synuclein Evoked Parkin Downregulation Promotes Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Neuronal Cells. Implications for Parkinson’s Disease Pathology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.591475</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.591475</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aberrant secretion and accumulation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) as well as the loss of parkin function are associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Our previous study suggested a functional interaction between those two proteins, showing that the extracellular α-Syn evoked post-translational modifications of parkin, leading to its autoubiquitination and degradation. While parkin plays an important role in mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover, including mitochondrial fission/fusion as well as mitophagy, the involvement of parkin deregulation in α-Syn-induced mitochondrial damage is largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that treatment with exogenous α-Syn triggers mitochondrial dysfunction, reflected by the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, elevated synthesis of the mitochondrial superoxide anion, and a decrease in cellular ATP level. At the same time, we observed a protective effect of parkin overexpression on α-Syn-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. α-Syn-dependent disturbances of mitophagy were also shown to be directly related to reduced parkin levels in mitochondria and decreased ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins. Also, α-Syn impaired mitochondrial biosynthesis due to the parkin-dependent reduction of PGC-1α protein levels. Finally, loss of parkin function as a result of α-Syn treatment induced an overall breakdown of mitochondrial homeostasis that led to the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria. These findings may thus provide the first compelling evidence for the direct association of α-Syn-mediated parkin depletion to impaired mitochondrial function in PD. We suggest that improvement of parkin function may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent mitochondrial impairment and neurodegeneration in PD (thereby slowing the progression of the disease).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Crystallography and NMR system (CNS) is currently a widely used method for fragment-free &lt;i&gt;ab initio&lt;/i&gt; protein folding from inter-residue distance or contact maps. Despite its widespread use in protein structure prediction, CNS is a decade-old macromolecular structure determination system that was originally developed for solving macromolecular geometry from experimental restraints as opposed to predictive modeling driven by interaction map data. As such, the adaptation of the CNS experimental structure determination protocol for &lt;i&gt;ab initio&lt;/i&gt; protein folding is intrinsically anomalous that may undermine the folding accuracy of computational protein structure prediction. In this paper, we propose a new CNS-free hierarchical structure modeling method called DConStruct for folding both soluble and membrane proteins driven by distance and contact information. Rigorous experimental validation shows that DConStruct attains much better reconstruction accuracy than CNS when tested with the same input contact map at varying contact thresholds. The hierarchical modeling with iterative self-correction employed in DConStruct scales at a much higher degree of folding accuracy than CNS with the increase in contact thresholds, ultimately approaching near-optimal reconstruction accuracy at higher-thresholded contact maps. The folding accuracy of DConStruct can be further improved by exploiting distance-based hybrid interaction maps at tri-level thresholding, as demonstrated by the better performance of our method in folding free modeling targets from the 12th and 13th rounds of the Critical Assessment of techniques for protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments compared to popular CNS- and fragment-based approaches and energy-minimization protocols, some of which even using much finer-grained distance maps than ours. Additional large-scale benchmarking shows that DConStruct can significantly improve the folding accuracy of membrane proteins compared to a CNS-based approach. These results collectively demonstrate the feasibility of greatly improving the accuracy of &lt;i&gt;ab initio&lt;/i&gt; protein folding by optimally exploiting the information encoded in inter-residue interaction maps beyond what is possible by CNS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ogSwYNXbpmU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The collective behaviour of animal and human groups emerges from the individual decisions and actions of their constituent members. Recent research has revealed many ways in which the behaviour of groups can be influenced by differences amongst their constituent individuals. The existence of individual differences that have implications for collective behaviour raises important questions. How are these differences generated and maintained? Are individual differences driven by exogenous factors, or are they a response to the social dilemmas these groups face? Here I consider the classic case of patch selection by foraging agents under conditions of social competition. I introduce a multilevel model wherein the perceptual sensitivities of agents evolve in response to their foraging success or failure over repeated patch selections. This model reveals a bifurcation in the population, creating a class of agents with no perceptual sensitivity. These agents exploit the social environment to avoid the costs of accurate perception, relying on other agents to make fitness rewards insensitive to the choice of foraging patch. This provides a individual-based evolutionary basis for models incorporating perceptual limits that have been proposed to explain observed deviations from the Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) in empirical studies, while showing that the common assumption in such models that agents share identical sensory limits is likely false. Further analysis of the model shows how agents develop perceptual strategic niches in response to environmental variability. The emergence of agents insensitive to reward differences also has implications for societal resource allocation problems, including the use of financial and prediction markets as mechanisms for aggregating collective wisdom.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/msedj_TSJeQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Silencing of SRRM4 suppresses microexon inclusion and promotes tumor growth across cancers</title>

RNA splicing is widely dysregulated in cancer, frequently due to altered expression or activity of splicing factors (SFs). Microexons are extremely small exons (3–27 nucleotides long) that are highly evolutionarily conserved and play critical roles in promoting neuronal differentiation and development. Inclusion of microexons in mRNA transcripts is mediated by the SF Serine/Arginine Repetitive Matrix 4 (SRRM4), whose expression is largely restricted to neural tissues. However, microexons have been largely overlooked in prior analyses of splicing in cancer, as their small size necessitates specialized computational approaches for their detection. Here, we demonstrate that despite having low expression in normal nonneural tissues, SRRM4 is further silenced in tumors, resulting in the suppression of normal microexon inclusion. Remarkably, SRRM4 is the most consistently silenced SF across all tumor types analyzed, implying a general advantage of microexon down-regulation in cancer independent of its tissue of origin. We show that this silencing is favorable for tumor growth, as decreased SRRM4 expression in tumors is correlated with an increase in mitotic gene expression, and up-regulation of SRRM4 in cancer cell lines dose-dependently inhibits proliferation in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model. Further, this proliferation inhibition is accompanied by induction of neural-like expression and splicing patterns in cancer cells, suggesting that SRRM4 expression shifts the cell state away from proliferation and toward differentiation. We therefore conclude that SRRM4 acts as a proliferation brake, and tumors gain a selective advantage by cutting off this brake.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rDo_AkWttew&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
Glutamate transporter proteins, expressed on both neurons and glia, serve as the main gatekeepers that dictate the spatial and temporal actions of extracellular glutamate. Glutamate is essential to the function of the healthy brain yet paradoxically contributes to the toxicity associated with many neurodegenerative diseases. Rapid transporter‐mediated glutamate uptake, primarily occurring at astrocytic processes, tightens the efficiency of excitatory network activity and prevents toxic glutamate build‐up in the extracellular space. Glutamate transporter dysfunction is thought to underlie myriad central nervous system (CNS) diseases including Alzheimer and Huntington disease. Over the past few decades, techniques such as biochemical uptake assays and electrophysiological recordings of transporter currents from individual astrocytes have revealed the remarkable ability of the CNS to efficiently clear extracellular glutamate. In more recent years, the rapidly evolving glutamate‐sensing “sniffers” now allow researchers to visualize real‐time glutamate transients on a millisecond time scale with single synapse spatial resolution in defined cell populations. As we transition to an increased reliance on optical‐based methods of glutamate visualization and quantification, it is of utmost importance to understand not only the advantages that glutamate biosensors bring to the table but also the associated caveats and their implications for data interpretation. In this review, we summarize the strengths and limitations of the commonly used methods to quantify glutamate uptake. We then discuss what these techniques, when viewed as a complementary whole, have told us about the brain's ability to regulate glutamate levels, in both health and in the context of neurodegenerative disease.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Poly I:C Activated Microglia Disrupt Perineuronal Nets and Modulate Synaptic Balance in Primary Hippocampal Neurons in vitro</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are specialized, reticular structures of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that can be found covering the soma and proximal dendrites of a neuronal subpopulation. Recent studies have shown that PNNs can highly influence synaptic plasticity and are disrupted in different neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia. Interestingly, there is a growing evidence that microglia can promote the loss of PNNs and contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders. Based on this knowledge, we analyzed the impact of activated microglia on hippocampal neuronal networks in vitro. Therefore, primary cortical microglia were cultured and stimulated via polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C; 50 μg/ml) administration. The Poly I:C treatment induced the expression and secretion of different cytokines belonging to the CCL- and CXCL-motif chemokine family as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). In addition, the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) could be verified via RT-PCR analysis. Embryonic hippocampal neurons were then cultured for 12 days in vitro (DIV) and treated for 24 h with microglial conditioned medium. Interestingly, immunocytochemical staining of the PNN component Aggrecan revealed a clear disruption of PNNs accompanied by a significant increase of glutamatergic and a decrease of γ-aminobutyric acid-(GABA)ergic synapse numbers on PNN wearing neurons. In contrast, PNN negative neurons showed a significant reduction in both, glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Electrophysiological recordings were performed via multielectrode array (MEA) technology and unraveled a significantly increased spontaneous network activity that sustained also 24 and 48 h after the administration of microglia conditioned medium. Taken together, we could observe a strong impact of microglial secreted factors on PNN integrity, synaptic plasticity and electrophysiological properties of cultured neurons. Our observations might enhance the understanding of neuron-microglia interactions considering the ECM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Neuropathophysiological Mechanisms and Treatment Strategies for Post-traumatic Epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in young adults and a risk factor for acquired epilepsy. Severe TBI, after a period of time, causes numerous neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative problems with varying comorbidities; and brain homeostasis may never be restored. As a consequence of disrupted equilibrium, neuropathological changes such as circuit remodeling, reorganization of neural networks, changes in structural and functional plasticity, predisposition to synchronized activity, and post-translational modification of synaptic proteins may begin to dominate the brain. These pathological changes, over the course of time, contribute to conditions like Alzheimer disease, dementia, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). PTE is one of the most common, devastating complications of TBI; and of those affected by a severe TBI, more than 50% develop PTE. The etiopathology and mechanisms of PTE are either unknown or poorly understood, which makes treatment challenging. Although anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are used as preventive strategies to manage TBI, control acute seizures and prevent development of PTE, their efficacy in PTE remains controversial. In this review, we discuss novel mechanisms and risk factors underlying PTE. We also discuss dysfunctions of neurovascular unit, cell-specific neuroinflammatory mediators and immune response factors that are vital for epileptogenesis after TBI. Finally, we describe current and novel treatments and management strategies for preventing PTE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 Activation Might Mitigate Clinical Symptoms in Friedreich’s Ataxia: Clues of an “Out-Brain Origin” of the Disease From a Family Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.638810</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.638810</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is the most frequent autosomal recessive ataxia in western countries, with a mean age of onset at 10–15 years. Patients manifest progressive cerebellar and sensory ataxia, dysarthria, lower limb pyramidal weakness, and other systemic manifestations. Previously, we described a family displaying two expanded GAA alleles not only in the proband affected by late-onset FRDA but also in the two asymptomatic family members: the mother and the younger sister. Both of them showed a significant reduction of frataxin levels, without any disease manifestation. Here, we analyzed if a protective mechanism might contribute to modulate the phenotype in this family. We particularly focused on the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), the first line of antioxidant defense in cells, and on the glutathione (GSH) system, an index of reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification ability. Our findings show a great reactivity of the GSH system to the frataxin deficiency, particularly in the asymptomatic mother, where the genes of GSH synthesis [glutamate–cysteine ligase (GCL)] and GSSG detoxification [GSH S-reductase (GSR)] were highly responsive. The GSR was activated even in the asymptomatic sister and in the proband, reflecting the need of buffering the GSSG increase. Furthermore, and contrasting the NRF2 expression documented in FRDA tissues, NRF2 was highly activated in the mother and in the younger sister, while it was constitutively low in the proband. This suggests that, also under frataxin depletion, the endogenous stimulation of NRF2 in asymptomatic FRDA subjects may contribute to protect against the progressive oxidative damage, helping to prevent the onset of neurological symptoms and highlighting an “out-brain origin” of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Stable Anatomy Detection in Multimodal Imaging Through Sparse Group Regularization: A Comparative Study of Iron Accumulation in the Aging Brain</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multimodal neuroimaging provides a rich source of data for identifying brain regions associated with disease progression and aging. However, present studies still typically analyze modalities separately or aggregate voxel-wise measurements and analyses to the structural level, thus reducing statistical power. As a central example, previous works have used two quantitative MRI parameters—R2* and quantitative susceptibility (QS)—to study changes in iron associated with aging in healthy and multiple sclerosis subjects, but failed to simultaneously account for both. In this article, we propose a unified framework that combines information from multiple imaging modalities and regularizes estimates for increased interpretability, generalizability, and stability. Our work focuses on joint region detection problems where overlap between effect supports across modalities is encouraged but not strictly enforced. To achieve this, we combine L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (lasso), total variation (TV), and L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group lasso penalties. While the TV penalty encourages geometric regularization by controlling estimate variability and support boundary geometry, the group lasso penalty accounts for similarities in the support between imaging modalities. We address the computational difficulty in this regularization scheme with an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimizer. In a neuroimaging application, we compare our method against independent sparse and joint sparse models using a dataset of R2* and QS maps derived from MRI scans of 113 healthy controls: our method produces clinically-interpretable regions where specific iron changes are associated with healthy aging. Together with results across multiple simulation studies, we conclude that our approach identifies regions that are more strongly associated with the variable of interest (e.g., age), more accurate, and more stable with respect to training data variability. This work makes progress toward a stable and interpretable multimodal imaging analysis framework for studying disease-related changes in brain structure and can be extended for classification and disease prediction tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Eros, Beauty, and Phon-Aesthetic Judgements of Language Sound. We Like It Flat and Fast, but Not Melodious. Comparing Phonetic and Acoustic Features of 16 European Languages</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.578594</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This article concerns sound aesthetic preferences for European foreign languages. We investigated the phonetic-acoustic dimension of the linguistic aesthetic pleasure to describe the “music” found in European languages. The Romance languages, French, Italian, and Spanish, take a lead when people talk about melodious language – the music-like effects in the language (a.k.a., phonetic chill). On the other end of the melodiousness spectrum are German and Arabic that are often considered sounding harsh and un-attractive. Despite the public interest, limited research has been conducted on the topic of phonaesthetics, i.e., the subfield of phonetics that is concerned with the aesthetic properties of speech sounds (Crystal, 2008). Our goal is to fill the existing research gap by identifying the acoustic features that drive the auditory perception of language sound beauty. What is so music-like in the language that makes people say “it is music in my ears”? We had 45 central European participants listening to 16 auditorily presented European languages and rating each language in terms of 22 binary characteristics (e.g., beautiful – ugly and funny – boring) plus indicating their language familiarities, L2 backgrounds, speaker voice liking, demographics, and musicality levels. Findings revealed that all factors in complex interplay explain a certain percentage of variance: familiarity and expertise in foreign languages, speaker voice characteristics, phonetic complexity, musical acoustic properties, and finally musical expertise of the listener. The most important discovery was the trade-off between speech tempo and so-called linguistic melody (pitch variance): the faster the language, the flatter/more atonal it is in terms of the pitch (speech melody), making it highly appealing acoustically (sounding beautiful and sexy), but not so melodious in a “musical” sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Development and Validation of a Dynamic Nomogram to Predict the Risk of Neonatal White Matter Damage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.584236</guid>

	<description>Purpose&lt;p&gt;White matter damage (WMD) was defined as the appearance of rough and uneven echo enhancement in the white matter around the ventricle. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a risk prediction model for neonatal WMD.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;We collected data for 1,733 infants hospitalized at the Department of Neonatology at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from 2017 to 2020. Infants were randomly assigned to training (n = 1,216) or validation (n = 517) cohorts at a ratio of 7:3. Multivariate logistic regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses were used to establish a risk prediction model and web-based risk calculator based on the training cohort data. The predictive accuracy of the model was verified in the validation cohort.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We identified four variables as independent risk factors for brain WMD in neonates by multivariate logistic regression and LASSO analysis, including gestational age, fetal distress, prelabor rupture of membranes, and use of corticosteroids. These were used to establish a risk prediction nomogram and web-based calculator (https://caowenjun.shinyapps.io/dynnomapp/). The C-index of the training and validation sets was 0.898 (95% confidence interval: 0.8745–0.9215) and 0.887 (95% confidence interval: 0.8478–0.9262), respectively. Decision tree analysis showed that the model was highly effective in the threshold range of 1–61%. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 82.5 and 81.7%, respectively, and the cutoff value was 0.099.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This is the first study describing the use of a nomogram and web-based calculator to predict the risk of WMD in neonates. The web-based calculator increases the applicability of the predictive model and is a convenient tool for doctors at primary hospitals and outpatient clinics, family doctors, and even parents to identify high-risk births early on and implementing appropriate interventions while avoiding excessive treatment of low-risk patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Can Enhancing Neuronal Activity Improve Myelin Repair in Multiple Sclerosis?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.645240</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Enhanced neuronal activity in the healthy brain can induce de novo myelination and behavioral changes. As neuronal activity can be achieved using non-invasive measures, it may be of interest to utilize the innate ability of neuronal activity to instruct myelination as a novel strategy for myelin repair in demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Preclinical studies indicate that stimulation of neuronal activity in demyelinated lesions indeed has the potential to improve remyelination and that the stimulation paradigm is an important determinant of success. However, future studies will need to reveal the most efficient stimulation protocols as well as the biological mechanisms implicated. Nonetheless, clinical studies have already explored non-invasive brain stimulation as an attractive therapeutic approach that ameliorates MS symptomatology. However, whether symptom improvement is due to improved myelin repair remains unclear. In this mini-review, we discuss the neurobiological basis and potential of enhancing neuronal activity as a novel therapeutic approach in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: High-Intensity Exercise Training Protects the Brain Against Autoimmune Neuroinflammation: Regulation of Microglial Redox and Pro-inflammatory Functions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.640724</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.640724</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Exercise training induces beneficial effects on neurodegenerative diseases, and specifically on multiple sclerosis (MS) and it’s model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, it is unclear whether exercise training exerts direct protective effects on the central nervous system (CNS), nor are the mechanisms of neuroprotection fully understood. In this study, we investigated the direct neuroprotective effects of high-intensity continuous training (HICT) against the development of autoimmune neuroinflammation and the role of resident microglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We used the transfer EAE model to examine the direct effects of training on the CNS. Healthy mice performed HICT by treadmill running, followed by injection of encephalitogenic proteolipid (PLP)-reactive T-cells to induce EAE. EAE severity was assessed clinically and pathologically. Brain microglia from sedentary (SED) and HICT healthy mice, as well as 5-days post EAE induction (before the onset of disease), were analyzed ex vivo for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) formation, mRNA expression of M1/M2 markers and neurotrophic factors, and secretion of cytokines and chemokines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Transfer of encephalitogenic T-cells into HICT mice resulted in milder EAE, compared to sedentary mice, as indicated by reduced clinical severity, attenuated T-cell, and neurotoxic macrophage/microglial infiltration, and reduced loss of myelin and axons. In healthy mice, HICT reduced the number of resident microglia without affecting their profile. Isolated microglia from HICT mice after transfer of encephalitogenic T-cells exhibited reduced ROS formation and released less IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) in response to PLP-stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These findings point to the critical role of training intensity in neuroprotection. HICT protects the CNS against autoimmune neuroinflammation by reducing microglial-derived ROS formation, neurotoxicity, and pro-inflammatory responses involved in the propagation of autoimmune neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Emerging Roles of Extracellular Vesicles in the Central Nervous System: Physiology, Pathology, and Therapeutic Perspectives</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.626043</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles or EVs are secreted by most, if not all, eukaryote cell types and recaptured by neighboring or distant cells. Their cargo, composed of a vast diversity of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, supports the EVs’ inter-cellular communication. The role of EVs in many cellular processes is now well documented both in physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we focus on the role of EVs in the central nervous system (CNS) in physiological as well as pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases or brain cancers. We also discuss the future of EVs in clinical research, in particular, their value as biomarkers as well as innovative therapeutic agents. While an increasing number of studies reveal EV research as a promising field, progress in the standardization of protocols and innovation in analysis as well as in research tools is needed to make a breakthrough in our understanding of their impact in the pathophysiology of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Neuronal Infection Triggers the Disassembly of Key Structural Components of Dendritic Spines</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a widespread neurotropic virus. Primary infection of HSV-1 in facial epithelium leads to retrograde axonal transport to the central nervous system (CNS) where it establishes latency. Under stressful conditions, the virus reactivates, and new progeny are transported anterogradely to the primary site of infection. During the late stages of neuronal infection, axonal damage can occur, however, the impact of HSV-1 infection on the morphology and functional integrity of neuronal dendrites during the early stages of infection is unknown. We previously demonstrated that acute HSV-1 infection in neuronal cell lines selectively enhances Arc protein expression - a major regulator of long-term synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation, known for being a protein-interaction hub in the postsynaptic dendritic compartment. Thus, HSV-1 induced Arc expression may alter the functionality of infected neurons and negatively impact dendritic spine dynamics. In this study we demonstrated that HSV-1 infection induces structural disassembly and functional deregulation in cultured cortical neurons, an altered glutamate response, Arc accumulation within the somata, and decreased expression of spine scaffolding-like proteins such as PSD-95, Drebrin and CaMKIIβ. However, whether these alterations are specific to the HSV-1 infection mechanism or reflect a secondary neurodegenerative process remains to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Neuroserpin Is Strongly Expressed in the Developing and Adult Mouse Neocortex but Its Absence Does Not Perturb Cortical Lamination and Synaptic Proteome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.627896</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroserpin is a serine protease inhibitor that regulates the activity of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in the nervous system. Neuroserpin is strongly expressed during nervous system development as well as during adulthood, when it is predominantly found in regions eliciting synaptic plasticity. In the hippocampus, neuroserpin regulates developmental neurogenesis, synaptic maturation and in adult mice it modulates synaptic plasticity and controls cognitive and social behavior. High expression levels of neuroserpin in the neocortex starting from prenatal stage and persisting during adulthood suggest an important role for the serpin in the formation of this brain region and in the maintenance of cortical functions. In order to uncover neuroserpin function in the murine neocortex, in this work we performed a comprehensive investigation of its expression pattern during development and in the adulthood. Moreover, we assessed the role of neuroserpin in cortex formation by comparing cortical lamination and neuronal maturation between neuroserpin-deficient and control mice. Finally, we evaluated a possible regulatory role of neuroserpin at cortical synapses in neuroserpin-deficient mice. We observed that neuroserpin is expressed starting from the beginning of corticogenesis until adulthood throughout the neocortex in several classes of glutamatergic projection neurons and GABA-ergic interneurons. However, in the absence of neuroserpin we did not detect any alteration either in cortical layer formation, or in neuronal soma size and dendritic length. Furthermore, no significant quantitative changes were observed in the proteome of cortical synapses upon neuroserpin deficiency. We conclude that, although strongly expressed in the neocortex, absence of neuroserpin does not lead to gross developmental abnormalities, and does not perturb the composition of the cortical synaptic proteome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: NEUBOrg: Artificially Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Brain Organoid to Model and Study Genetics of Alzheimer’s Disease Progression</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of neurodegenerative diseases. There are over 44 million people living with the disease worldwide. While there are currently no effective treatments for AD, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids have the potential to provide a better understanding of Alzheimer’s pathogenesis. Nevertheless, developing brain organoid models is expensive, time consuming and often does not reflect disease progression. Using accurate and inexpensive computer simulations of human brain organoids can overcome the current limitations. Induced whole brain organoids (aiWBO) will greatly expand our ability to model AD and can guide wet lab research. In this study, we have successfully developed and validated artificially induced a whole brain organoid platform (NEUBOrg) using our previously validated machine learning platform, DeepNEU (v6.1). Using NEUBorg platform, we have generated aiWBO simulations of AD and provided a novel approach to test genetic risk factors associated with AD progression and pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Enhanced Autolysosomal Function Ameliorates the Inflammatory Response Mediated by the NLRP3 Inflammasome in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) involves activation of many NLRP3 inflammatory bodies, which may be related to amyloid β peptide and aggregation of misfolded proteins. Autophagy is an important regulator of inflammatory bodies. However, autophagy shows dynamic changes in the development of AD, and its role in inflammation remains controversial. In this study, the key link between autophagic disorders and the NLRP3 inflammasome in AD was investigated. APP/PS1 double transgenic mice and C57 mice with Aβ&lt;sub&gt;25–35&lt;/sub&gt; injected into the lateral ventricle were used as two animal models of AD. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis showed that NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins and inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α, were increased and microglia were activated in the brains of both AD animal models. Endogenous overexpression of the APPswe gene and exogenous addition of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;25–35&lt;/sub&gt; increased the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-related proteins, while exogenous Aβ&lt;sub&gt;25–35&lt;/sub&gt; intervention more significantly activated inflammation. Furthermore, LC3 was increased in the AD animal and cell models, and the level of Lamp1 decreased. After overexpression of the primary regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, TFEB, the lysosome protein Lamp1 was increased, and LC3 and inflammatory protein expression were decreased. These results suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammatory response is activated in AD animal and cell models, which may be related to the decline in autolysosome function. Overexpression of the TFEB protein can reduce the inflammatory response by improving autolysosome function in AD model cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Limited data exists regarding the disease course of Huntington's Disease (HD) in children and young adults. Here, we evaluate the trajectory of various cognitive skill development as a function of cytosine‐adenine‐guanine (CAG) repeat length in children and adolescents that carry the mutation that causes HD. We discovered that the development of verbal skills seems to plateau earlier as CAG repeat length increases. These findings increase our understanding of the relationship between neurodegeneration and neurodevelopment and may have far‐reaching implications for future gene‐therapy treatment strategies.

	<description>We surveyed neurologists who completed a global health experience as residents or fellows to assess the impact of the experience. A total of 100% (n = 72) would recommend the experience to others. Most reported improved clinical (86%) and examination (82%) skills. All gained an understanding of different health care systems, and 83% reported deeper commitment to underserved populations. A total of 41 participants (57%) reported more judicious use of resources upon return to the United States. Global health electives had a positive impact on neurology trainees. More attention to the host country perspective and predeparture training may help inform program structure and participant expectations in the future. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<description>Objectives
Patients with established Parkinson's disease (PD) display differences in peripheral blood markers of immune function, including leukocyte differential counts, compared with controls. These differences may be useful biomarkers to predict PD and may shed light on pathogenesis. We sought to identify whether peripheral immune dysregulation was associated with increased risk of subsequent PD diagnosis.


Methods
We examined the relationship between incident PD, baseline differential leukocyte count and other blood markers of acute inflammation in UK Biobank (UKB), a longitudinal cohort with ~500,000 participants. We used a range of sensitivity analyses and Mendelian randomization (MR) to further explore the nature of associations.


Results
After excluding individuals with comorbidities which could influence biomarkers of inflammation, 465 incident PD cases and 312,125 controls remained. Lower lymphocyte count was associated with increased risk of subsequent PD diagnosis (per 1‐SD decrease in lymphocyte count odds ratio [OR] = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07–1.32, padjusted = 0.01). There was some evidence that reductions in eosinophil counts, monocyte counts and C‐reactive protein (CRP) were associated with increased PD risk, and that higher neutrophil count was also associated. Only the association between lower lymphocyte count and increased PD risk remained robust to sensitivity analyses. MR suggested that the effect of lower lymphocyte count on PD risk may be causal (per 1‐SD decrease in lymphocyte count; ORMR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01–1.18, p = 0.02).


Interpretation
We provide converging evidence from observational analyses in UKB and MR that lower lymphocyte count is associated with an increased risk of subsequent PD. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Assessing Uncertainty and Reliability of Connective Field Estimations From Resting State fMRI Activity at 3T</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.625309</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.625309</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Connective Field (CF) modeling estimates the local spatial integration between signals in distinct cortical visual field areas. As we have shown previously using 7T data, CF can reveal the visuotopic organization of visual cortical areas even when applied to BOLD activity recorded in the absence of external stimulation. This indicates that CF modeling can be used to evaluate cortical processing in participants in which the visual input may be compromised. Furthermore, by using Bayesian CF modeling it is possible to estimate the co-variability of the parameter estimates and therefore, apply CF modeling to single cases. However, no previous studies evaluated the (Bayesian) CF model using 3T resting-state fMRI data. This is important since 3T scanners are much more abundant and more often used in clinical research compared to 7T scanners. Therefore in this study, we investigate whether it is possible to obtain meaningful CF estimates from 3T resting state (RS) fMRI data. To do so, we applied the standard and Bayesian CF modeling approaches on two RS scans, which were separated by the acquisition of visual field mapping data in 12 healthy participants. Our results show good agreement between RS- and visual field (VF)- based maps using either the standard or Bayesian CF approach. In addition to quantify the uncertainty associated with each estimate in both RS and VF data, we applied our Bayesian CF framework to provide the underlying marginal distribution of the CF parameters. Finally, we show how an additional CF parameter, beta, can be used as a data-driven threshold on the RS data to further improve CF estimates. We conclude that Bayesian CF modeling can characterize local functional connectivity between visual cortical areas from RS data at 3T. Moreover, observations obtained using 3T scanners were qualitatively similar to those reported for 7T. In particular, we expect the ability to assess parameter uncertainty in individual participants will be important for future clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Using EEG Alpha States to Understand Learning During Alpha Neurofeedback Training for Chronic Pain</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Alpha-neurofeedback (α-NFB) is a novel therapy which trains individuals to volitionally increase their alpha power to improve pain. Learning during NFB is commonly measured using static parameters such as mean alpha power. Considering the biphasic nature of alpha rhythm (high and low alpha), dynamic parameters describing the time spent by individuals in high alpha state and the pattern of transitioning between states might be more useful. Here, we quantify the changes during α-NFB for chronic pain in terms of dynamic changes in alpha states.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Four chronic pain and four healthy participants received five NFB sessions designed to increase frontal alpha power. Changes in pain resilience were measured using visual analogue scale (VAS) during repeated cold-pressor tests (CPT). Changes in alpha state static and dynamic parameters such as fractional occupancy (time in high alpha state), dwell time (length of high alpha state) and transition probability (probability of moving from low to high alpha state) were analyzed using Friedman’s Test and correlated with changes in pain scores using Pearson’s correlation.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There was no significant change in mean frontal alpha power during NFB. There was a trend of an increase in fractional occupancy, mean dwell duration and transition probability of high alpha state over the five sessions in chronic pain patients only. Significant correlations were observed between change in pain scores and fractional occupancy (r = −0.45, p = 0.03), mean dwell time (r = -0.48, p = 0.04) and transition probability from a low to high state (r = -0.47, p = 0.03) in chronic pain patients but not in healthy participants.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;There is a differential effect between patients and healthy participants in terms of correlation between change in pain scores and alpha state parameters. Parameters providing a more precise description of the alpha power dynamics than the mean may help understand the therapeutic effect of neurofeedback on chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Optimal Model Mapping for Intravoxel Incoherent Motion MRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.617152</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In general, only one diffusion model would be applied to whole field-of-view voxels in the intravoxel incoherent motion-magnetic resonance imaging (IVIM-MRI) study. However, the choice of the applied diffusion model can significantly influence the estimated diffusion parameters. The quality of the diffusion analysis can influence the reliability of the perfusion analysis. This study proposed an optimal model mapping method to improve the reliability of the perfusion parameter estimation in the IVIM study. Six healthy volunteers (five males and one female; average age of 38.3 ± 7.5 years). Volunteers were examined using a 3.0 Tesla scanner. IVIM-MRI of the brain was applied at 17 b-values ranging from 0 to 2,500 s/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The Gaussian model, the Kurtosis model, and the Gamma model were found to be optimal for the CSF, white matter (WM), and gray matter (GM), respectively. In the mean perfusion fraction (f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) analysis, the GM/WM ratios were 1.16 (Gaussian model), 1.80 (Kurtosis model), 1.94 (Gamma model), and 1.54 (Optimal model mapping); in the mean pseudo diffusion coefficient (D&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) analysis, the GM/WM ratios were 1.18 (Gaussian model), 1.19 (Kurtosis model), 1.56 (Gamma model), and 1.24 (Optimal model mapping). With the optimal model mapping method, the estimated f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; were reliable compared with the conventional methods. In addition, the optimal model maps, the associated products of this method, may provide additional information for clinical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Semantic Relatedness Emerges in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Designed for Object Recognition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.625804</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human not only can effortlessly recognize objects, but also characterize object categories into semantic concepts with a nested hierarchical structure. One dominant view is that top-down conceptual guidance is necessary to form such hierarchy. Here we challenged this idea by examining whether deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) could learn relations among objects purely based on bottom-up perceptual experience of objects through training for object categorization. Specifically, we explored representational similarity among objects in a typical DCNN (e.g., AlexNet), and found that representations of object categories were organized in a hierarchical fashion, suggesting that the relatedness among objects emerged automatically when learning to recognize them. Critically, the emerged relatedness of objects in the DCNN was highly similar to the WordNet in human, implying that top-down conceptual guidance may not be a prerequisite for human learning the relatedness among objects. In addition, the developmental trajectory of the relatedness among objects during training revealed that the hierarchical structure was constructed in a coarse-to-fine fashion, and evolved into maturity before the establishment of object recognition ability. Finally, the fineness of the relatedness was greatly shaped by the demand of tasks that the DCNN performed, as the higher superordinate level of object classification was, the coarser the hierarchical structure of the relatedness emerged. Taken together, our study provides the first empirical evidence that semantic relatedness of objects emerged as a by-product of object recognition in DCNNs, implying that human may acquire semantic knowledge on objects without explicit top-down conceptual guidance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: The Absence of the Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 Directly Impacts on the Expression and Localization of the Endocannabinoid System in the Mouse Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.645940</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.645940</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a non-selective ligand-gated cation channel involved in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and brain pathology. In the hippocampal dentate gyrus, TRPV1 localizes to dendritic spines and dendrites postsynaptic to excitatory synapses in the molecular layer (ML). At these same synapses, the cannabinoid CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R) activated by exogenous and endogenous cannabinoids localizes to the presynaptic terminals. Hence, as both receptors are activated by endogenous anandamide, co-localize, and mediate long-term depression of the excitatory synaptic transmission at the medial perforant path (MPP) excitatory synapses though by different mechanisms, it is plausible that they might be exerting a reciprocal influence from their opposite synaptic sites. In this anatomical scenario, we tested whether the absence of TRPV1 affects the endocannabinoid system. The results obtained using biochemical techniques and immunoelectron microscopy in a mouse with the genetic deletion of TRPV1 show that the expression and localization of components of the endocannabinoid system, included CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R, change upon the constitutive absence of TRPV1. Thus, the expression of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) drastically increased in TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; whole homogenates. Furthermore, CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R and MAGL decreased and the cannabinoid receptor interacting protein 1a (CRIP1a) increased in TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; synaptosomes. Also, CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R positive excitatory terminals increased, the number of excitatory terminals decreased, and CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R particles dropped significantly in inhibitory terminals in the dentate ML of TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice. In the outer 2/3 ML of the TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mutants, the proportion of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R particles decreased in dendrites, and increased in excitatory terminals and astrocytes. In the inner 1/3 ML, the proportion of labeling increased in excitatory terminals, neuronal mitochondria, and dendrites. Altogether, these observations indicate the existence of compensatory changes in the endocannabinoid system upon TRPV1 removal, and endorse the importance of the potential functional adaptations derived from the lack of TRPV1 in the mouse brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Neurocognitive Effects of Bacopa monnieri and Cognitive Training on Markers of Brain Microstructure in Healthy Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.638109</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bacopa monnieri (BM) is a herbal supplement that increases signaling molecules implicated in synaptogenesis. Combined with cognitive stimulation, it may be a viable supplement to enhance long-term potentiation (LTP) and improve cognitive health in older adults. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial asked 28 healthy adults aged over 55 years to complete cognitive training (CT) 3 hours weekly for 12 weeks. Fifteen consumed a standardized extract of BM and 13 consumed a placebo daily. Cognitive tasks, life-satisfaction, memory complaints and mood were assessed, and bloods analyzed for serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) before and after 12-weeks of the intervention. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) in gray (GM) and white matter (WM) were also analyzed. Results demonstrated slower reaction time in an image discrimination task in the BM group and faster reaction time in a spatial working memory task (SWM-O RT) in the placebo group. Mean accuracy was higher in the BM group for these tasks, suggesting a change in the speed accuracy trade-off. Exploratory neuroimaging analysis showed increased WM mean diffusivity (MD) and GM dispersion of neurites (orientation dispersion index, ODI) and decreased WM fractional anisotropy (FA) and GM neurite density (ND) in the BM group. No other outcomes reached statistical significance. An increase in ODI with a decrease in MD and ND in the BM group may indicate an increase in network complexity (through higher dendritic branching) accompanied by dendritic pruning to enhance network efficiency. These neuroimaging outcomes conflict with the behavioral results, which showed poorer reaction time in the BM group. Given the exploratory outcomes and inconsistent findings between the behavioral and neuroimaging data, a larger study is needed to confirm the synaptogenic mechanisms of BM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Structural Network Efficiency Predicts Resilience to Cognitive Decline in Elderly at Risk for Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637002</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.637002</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Functional imaging studies have demonstrated the recruitment of additional neural resources as a possible mechanism to compensate for age and Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related cerebral pathology, the efficacy of which is potentially modulated by underlying structural network connectivity. Additionally, structural network efficiency (SNE) is associated with intelligence across the lifespan, which is a known factor for resilience to cognitive decline. We hypothesized that SNE may be a surrogate of the physiological basis of resilience to cognitive decline in elderly persons without dementia and with age- and AD-related cerebral pathology.Methods: We included 85 cognitively normal elderly subjects or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients submitted to baseline diffusion imaging, liquor specimens, amyloid-PET and longitudinal cognitive assessments. SNE was calculated from baseline MRI scans using fiber tractography and graph theory. Mixed linear effects models were estimated to investigate the association of higher resilience to cognitive decline with higher SNE and the modulation of this association by increased cerebral amyloid, liquor tau or WMHV. Results: For the majority of cognitive outcome measures, higher SNE was associated with higher resilience to cognitive decline (p-values: 0.011–0.039). Additionally, subjects with higher SNE showed more resilience to cognitive decline at higher cerebral amyloid burden (p-values: &amp;lt;0.001–0.036) and lower tau levels (p-values: 0.002–0.015).Conclusion: These results suggest that SNE to some extent may quantify the physiological basis of resilience to cognitive decline most effective at the earliest stages of AD, namely at increased amyloid burden and before increased tauopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Resilience and Psychobiological Response to Stress in Older People: The Mediating Role of Coping Strategies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.632141</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.632141</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Resilience, the ability to overcome adversity and face stressful demands and experiences, has been strongly associated with successful aging, a low risk of diseases and high mental and physical functioning. This relationship could be based on adaptive coping behaviors, but more research is needed to gain knowledge about the strategies employed to confront social stress. Thus, we aimed to investigate the role of the use of active or passive coping strategies by resilient people in dealing with stressful situations. For this purpose, we measured resilience, coping strategies, and perceived stress in 66 healthy older adults (31 men and 35 women) between 56 and 75 years old who were exposed to stress (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST) or a control situation. The stress response was analyzed at endocrine (cortisol) and psychological (anxiety) levels. In the stress condition, moderated mediation analysis showed a conditional indirect effect of resilience on cortisol reactivity through active coping. However, passive coping strategies did not mediate the resilience-cortisol relationship. In addition, neither active nor passive coping mediated the relationship between resilience and the anxiety response. These results suggest that resilience is associated with active coping strategies, which in turn could explain, at least in part, individual differences in the cortisol response to a psychosocial laboratory stressor. These factors may prevent the development of stress-related pathologies associated with aging and facilitate healthy and satisfactory aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Ethanol causes the secretion of pro‐inflammatory microvesicles (MVs) from brain tissue. Ethanol‐induced MVs reproduce the pro‐inflammatory gene induction and microglial activation seen with ethanol alone, and inhibition of their secretion blocks ethanol‐induced neuroinflammation. Microglia are required for the generation of pro‐inflammatory MVs, with MV secretion involving activation of microglial PI3K.

Abstract
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) pathology features pro‐inflammatory gene induction and microglial activation. The underlying cellular processes that promote this activation remain unclear. Previously considered cellular debris, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as mediators of inflammatory signaling in several disease states. We investigated the role of microvesicles (MVs, 50 nm–100 µm diameter EVs) in pro‐inflammatory and microglial functional gene expression using primary organotypic brain slice culture (OBSC). Ethanol caused a unique immune gene signature that featured: temporal induction of pro‐inflammatory TNF‐α and IL‐1β, reduction of homeostatic microglia state gene Tmem119, progressive increases in purinergic receptor P2RY12 and the microglial inhibitory fractalkine receptor CX3CR1, an increase in the microglial presynaptic gene C1q, and a reduction in the phagocytic gene TREM2. MV signaling was implicated in this response as reduction of MV secretion by imipramine blocked pro‐inflammatory TNF‐α and IL‐1β induction by ethanol, and ethanol‐conditioned MVs (EtOH‐MVs) reproduced the ethanol‐associated immune gene signature in naïve OBSC slices. Depletion of microglia prior to ethanol treatment prevented pro‐inflammatory activity of EtOH‐MVs, as did incubation of EtOH‐MVs with the HMGB1 inhibitor glycyrrhizin. Ethanol caused HMGB1 secretion from cultured BV2 microglia in MVs through activation of PI3 kinase. In summary, these studies find MVs modulate pro‐inflammatory gene induction and microglial activation changes associated with ethanol. Thus, MVs may represent a novel therapeutic target to reduce neuroinflammation in the setting of alcohol abuse or other diseases that feature a neuroimmune component.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Neonatal administration of erythropoietin attenuates cognitive deficits in adult rats following placental insufficiency</title>

	<description>In a transient systemic hypoxic‐ischemic model of placental insufficiency, erythropoietin is found to have lasting, mitigating effects on the diminished cognitive flexibility and increased perseveration which are associated with encephalopathy of prematurity. Highly translatable testing, including novel object recognition and touchscreen‐based visual discrimination and reversal learning, reveal significant differences post‐treatment.

Abstract
Preterm birth is a principal cause of neurological disability later in life, including cognitive and behavioral deficits. Notably, cognitive impairment has greater impact on quality of life than physical disability. Survivors of preterm birth commonly have deficits of executive function. Difficulties with tasks and planning complexity correlate positively with increasing disability. To overcome these barriers for children born preterm, preclinical and clinical studies have emphasized the importance of neurorestoration. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a endogenous cytokine with multiple beneficial mechanisms of action following perinatal brain injury. While most preclinical investigations have focused on pathology and molecular mechanisms, translational studies of repair using clinically viable biobehavioral biomarkers are still lacking. Here, using an established model of encephalopathy of prematurity secondary to placental insufficiency, we tested the hypothesis that administration of EPO in the neonatal period would attenuate deficits in recognition memory and cognitive flexibility in adult rats of both sexes. We assessed cognition and executive function in two ways. First, using the classic test of novel object recognition and second, using a touchscreen platform. Touchscreen testing allows for rigorous testing of cognition and executive function in preclinical and clinical scenarios. Data show that adult rats exhibit deficits in recognition memory and cognitive flexibility following in utero placental insufficiency. Notably, neonatal treatment of EPO attenuates these deficits in adulthood and facilitates functional repair. Together, these data validate EPO neurorestoration using a clinically relevant outcome measure and support the concept that postnatal treatment following in utero injury can improve cognition and executive function through adulthood.</description>

	<description>Abstract
Many studies have reported sex differences in empathy and social skills. In this review, several lines of empirical evidences about sex differences in functions and anatomy of social brain are discussed. The most relevant differences involve face processing, facial expression recognition, response to baby schema, the ability to see faces in things, the processing of social interactions, the response to the others’ pain, interest in social information, processing of gestures and actions, biological motion, erotic, and affective stimuli. Sex differences in oxytocin‐based parental response are also reported. In conclusion, the female and male brains show several neuro‐functional differences in various aspects of social cognition, and especially in emotional coding, face processing, and response to baby schema. An interpretation of this sexual dimorphism is provided in the view of evolutionary psychobiology.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Noradrenaline‐induced l‐lactate production requires d‐glucose entry and transit through the glycogen shunt in single‐cultured rat astrocytes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/jnr.24783</guid>

	<description>d‐glucose uptake in astrocytes is an essential source for the noradrenaline‐induced increase in intracellular L‐lactate. We found that intracellular l‐lactate arises exclusively from the glycogen—a temporary energy store in the brain. The glycolytic pathway intermediates also support oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. At rest, a large proportion of d‐glucose is metabolized in the Krebs cycle, since the resting l‐lactate concentration is low. This is increased when the Krebs cycle is blocked or when cells are stimulated with noradrenaline.

Abstract
During cognitive efforts mediated by local neuronal networks, approximately 20% of additional energy is required; this is mediated by chemical messengers such as noradrenaline (NA). NA targets astroglial aerobic glycolysis, the hallmark of which is the end product l‐lactate, a fuel for neurons. Biochemical studies have revealed that astrocytes exhibit a prominent glycogen shunt, in which a portion of d‐glucose molecules entering the cytoplasm is transiently incorporated into glycogen, a buffer and source of d‐glucose during increased energy demand. Here, we studied single astrocytes by measuring cytosolic L‐lactate ([lac]i) with the FRET nanosensor Laconic. We examined whether NA‐induced increase in [lac]i is influenced by: (a) 2‐deoxy‐d‐glucose (2‐DG, 3 mM), a molecule that enters the cytosol and inhibits the glycolytic pathway; (b) 1,4‐dideoxy‐1,4‐imino‐d‐arabinitol (DAB, 300 µM), a potent inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen degradation; and (c) 3‐nitropropionic acid (3‐NPA, 1 mM), an inhibitor of the Krebs cycle. The results of these pharmacological experiments revealed that d‐glucose uptake is essential for the NA‐induced increase in [lac]i, and that this exclusively arises from glycogen degradation, indicating that most, if not all, d‐glucose molecules in NA‐stimulated cells transit the glycogen shunt during glycolysis. Moreover, under the defined transmembrane d‐glucose gradient, the glycolytic intermediates were not only used to produce l‐lactate, but also to significantly support oxidative phosphorylation, as demonstrated by an elevation in [lac]i when Krebs cycle was inhibited. We conclude that l‐lactate production via aerobic glycolysis is an essential energy pathway in NA‐stimulated astrocytes; however, oxidative metabolism is important at rest.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Sigma‐2 receptor antagonists rescue neuronal dysfunction induced by Parkinson’s patient brain‐derived α‐synuclein</title>

	<description>The protein α‐synuclein is central to Parkinson's disease. For the first time, we report that α‐synuclein from Parkinson's patients brain samples caused signaling deficits in brain cells, and novel drug candidates known to block the sigma‐2 receptor complex reversed these deficits.

Abstract
α‐Synuclein oligomers are thought to have a pivotal role in sporadic and familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and related α‐synucleinopathies, causing dysregulation of protein trafficking, autophagy/lysosomal function, and protein clearance, as well as synaptic function impairment underlying motor and cognitive symptoms of PD. Moreover, trans‐synaptic spread of α‐synuclein oligomers is hypothesized to mediate disease progression. Therapeutic approaches that effectively block α‐synuclein oligomer‐induced pathogenesis are urgently needed. Here, we show for the first time that α‐synuclein species isolated from human PD patient brain and recombinant α‐synuclein oligomers caused similar deficits in lipid vesicle trafficking rates in cultured rat neurons and glia, while α‐synuclein species isolated from non‐PD human control brain samples did not. Recombinant α‐synuclein oligomers also increased neuronal expression of lysosomal‐associated membrane protein‐2A (LAMP‐2A), the lysosomal receptor that has a critical role in chaperone‐mediated autophagy. Unbiased screening of several small molecule libraries (including the NIH Clinical Collection) identified sigma‐2 receptor antagonists as the most effective at blocking α‐synuclein oligomer‐induced trafficking deficits and LAMP‐2A upregulation in a dose‐dependent manner. These results indicate that antagonists of the sigma‐2 receptor complex may alleviate α‐synuclein oligomer‐induced neurotoxicity and are a novel therapeutic approach for disease modification in PD and related α‐synucleinopathies.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Mitochondrial dysfunction, mitophagy, and role of dynamin‐related protein 1 in Alzheimer's disease</title>

	<description>Oxidative stress implicates mitochondrial damage and effects on mitochondrial function, production of ATP, mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis. The mitochondrial dysfunction eventually demonstrates its lethal behaviour on Aβ clearance and mitochondrial fission, especially on the protein Drp1. In AD pathogenesis, Drp1 can play an important regulatory role in mitophagy and autophagy. The miR‐499 causes suppression of calcineurin‐mediated dephosphorylation of Drp1, whereas miR‐30a inhibits mitochondrial fission by suppressing p53 and subsequent Drp‐1 downstream signaling. Mitochondrial targeted antioxidant (MTA) molecules such as Mdivi1, SS31 and Dynasore can reduce excessive mitochondrial fission activity of Drp1 and restore normal mitochondrial functions, fusion‐fission activities, mitophagy and autophagy functions in clearing dead mitochondria for normal synaptic functions.

Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and progressive neurodegenerative disease. The presence of β‐amyloid (Aβ) plaques and phosphorylated Tau tangles are considered to be the two main hallmarks of AD. Recent findings have shown that different changes in the structure and dynamics of mitochondria play an important role in AD pathology progression. Mitochondrial changes in AD are expressed as enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation, altered mitochondrial dynamics, and changes in the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis genes in vitro and in vivo models. Therefore, targeting mitochondria and associated mitochondrial proteins seems to be a promising alternative instead of targeting Aβ and Tau in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease. The dynamin‐related protein (Drp1) is one such protein that plays an important role in the regulation of mitochondrial division and maintenance of mitochondrial structures. Few researchers have shown that inhibition of Drp1 GTPase activity in neuronal cells rescues excessive mitochondrial fragmentation. In addition, the growing evidence revealed that Drp1 can interact with both Aβ and Tau protein in human brain tissues and mouse models. In this review, we would like to update existing knowledge about various changes in and around mitochondria related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, with particular emphasis on mitophagy and autophagy.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Select neurotrophins promote oligodendrocyte progenitor cell process outgrowth in the presence of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans</title>

	<description>Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells cannot extend cellular process in the presence of Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans. Treatment of OPCs with different neurotrophic factors (BDNF, GDNF, and NT‐3) allows OPCs to overcome the inhibitory effects of CSPGs, allowing for OPC process outgrowth which is a critical step in the differentiation of OPCs.

Abstract
Axonal damage and the subsequent interruption of intact neuronal pathways in the spinal cord are largely responsible for the loss of motor function after injury. Further exacerbating this loss is the demyelination of neighboring uninjured axons. The post‐injury environment is hostile to repair, with inflammation, a high expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) around the glial scar, and myelin breakdown. Numerous studies have demonstrated that treatment with the enzyme chondroitinase ABC (cABC) creates a permissive environment around a spinal lesion that permits axonal regeneration. Neurotrophic factors like brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurotrophic factor‐3 (NT‐3), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) have been used to promote neuronal survival and stimulate axonal growth. CSPGs expressed near a lesion also inhibit migration and differentiation of endogenous oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in the spinal cord, and cABC treatment can neutralize this inhibition. This study examined the neurotrophins commonly used to stimulate axonal regeneration after injury and their potential effects on OPCs cultured in the presence of CSPGs. The results reveal differential effects on OPCs, with BDNF and GDNF promoting process outgrowth and NT‐3 stimulating differentiation of OPCs, while CNTF appears to have no observable effect. This finding suggests that certain neurotrophic agents commonly utilized to stimulate axonal regeneration after a spinal injury may also have a beneficial effect on the endogenous oligodendroglial cells as well.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Extra‐striatal dopamine in Parkinson's disease with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder</title>

	<description>This PET study characterized D2 receptor (D2R) availability within extra‐striatal regions in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with (+) and without (−) REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). With disease progression, only PD‐RBD+ patients showed steep decline in D2R availability within the left uncus parahippocampus. Beyond the striatum, extra‐striatal dopaminergic system may also contribute to PD‐RBD in advanced stages.

Abstract
Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a common condition found in more than 50% of the patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Molecular imaging shows that PD with RBD (PD‐RBD+) have lower striatal dopamine transporter activity within the caudate and putamen relative to PD without RBD (PD‐RBD−). However, the characterization of the extra‐striatal dopamine within the mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways remains unknown. We aim to elucidate this with PET imaging in 15 PD‐RBD+ and 15 PD‐RBD− patients, while having 15 age‐matched healthy controls (HC). Each participant underwent a single PET scan with [11C]FLB‐457 to detect the D2 receptor availability within the extra‐striatal regions of interest (ROI), including the prefrontal, temporal, and limbic areas. [11C]FLB‐457 retention was expressed as the nondisplaceable binding potential. Our results reveal that relative to HC, PD‐RBD+ and PD‐RBD− patients have lower levels of D2 receptor availability within the uncus parahippocampus, superior, lateral, and inferior temporal cortex. PD‐RBD+ showed steep decline in D2 receptors within the left uncus parahippocampus with increasing disease severity, but this was not observed for PD‐RBD− patients. Findings imply that extra‐striatal dopaminergic system may play a role in contributing to symptomatic progress in PD patients with RBD. However, validation with more advanced PD patients are needed.</description>

	<description>By observing the behavior of mice in their home cage environment, using the powerful PhenoTyper tracking system, we demonstrate that mice display dramatic reductions in movement and exploration when isolated from their cage mates, an instantaneous effect that escalates over the next 5 days, which is reversible upon re‐pairing.

Abstract
The effects of social isolation on an individual's behavior is an important field of research, especially as public health officials encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of pandemic disease. In this study we evaluate the effects of social isolation on physical activity in mice. Utilizing a pixel‐based tracking system, we continuously monitored the movement of isolated mice compared with paired cage mates in the home cage environment. We demonstrate that mice that are socially isolated dramatically decrease their movement when separated from their cage mate, and especially in the dark cycle, when mice are normally most active. When isolated mice are re‐paired with their original cage mate, this effect is reversed, and mice return to their prior levels of activity. These findings suggest a close link between social isolation and physical activity, and are of particular interest in the wake of coronavirus disease 2019, when many are forced into isolation. Social isolation may affect an individual's overall activity levels in humans too, which may have unintended effects on health that deserve further consideration.</description>

	<description>Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has recently gained attention as an alternative treatment of malignant gliomas. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent within tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). Conventional treatments for this CNS tumor include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Surgery is still being considered as the treatment of choice. Even so, the poor prognosis and/or recurrence of the disease after applying any of these treatments highlight the urgency of exploring new therapies and/or improving existing ones to achieve the definitive eradication of tumor masses and remaining cells. PDT is a therapeutic modality that involves the destruction of tumor cells by reactive oxygen species induced by light, which were previously treated with a photosensitizing agent. However, in recent years, its experimental application has expanded to other effects that could improve overall performance against GBM. In the current review, we revisit the main advances of PDT for GBM management and also, the recent mechanistic insights about cellular and molecular aspects related to tumoral resistance to PDT of GBM.</description>

	<description>Genetic ablation of G protein‐coupled receptor 37‐like 1 results in increased patched 1 expression and internalization. This leads to the intracellular accumulation of cholesterol, with concomitant stimulation of sonic hedgehog (Shh) production and activation of Shh‐induced proliferative signaling.

Abstract
Mammalian cerebellar astrocytes critically regulate the differentiation and maturation of neuronal Purkinje cells and granule precursors. The G protein‐coupled receptor 37‐like 1 (Gpr37l1) is expressed by Bergmann astrocytes and interacts with patched 1 (Ptch1) at peri‐ciliary membranes. Cerebellar primary astrocyte cultures from wild‐type and Gpr37l1 null mutant mouse pups were established and studied. Primary cilia were produced by cultures of both genotypes, as well as Ptch1 and smoothened (Smo) components of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) mitogenic pathway. Compared to wild‐type cells, Gpr37l1−/− astrocytes displayed striking increases in proliferative activity, Ptch1 protein expression and internalization, intracellular cholesterol content, ciliary localization of Smo, as well as a marked production of active Shh. Similar effects were reproduced by treating wild‐type astrocytes with a putative prosaptide ligand of Gpr37l1. These findings indicate that Gpr37l1–Ptch1 interactions specifically regulate Ptch1 internalization and trafficking, with consequent stimulation of Shh production and activation of proliferative signaling.</description>

	<description>Abstract
The mammalian nervous system is a complex network of interconnected cells. We review emerging techniques that use the axonal transport of adeno‐associated virus (AAV) vectors to dissect neural circuits. These intersectional approaches specifically target AAV‐mediated gene expression to discrete neuron populations based on their axonal connectivity, including: (a) neurons with one defined output, (b) neurons with one defined input, (c) neurons with one defined input and one defined output, and (d) neurons with two defined inputs or outputs. The number of labeled neurons can be directly controlled to trace axonal projections and examine cellular morphology. These approaches can precisely target the expression of fluorescent reporters, optogenetic ion channels, chemogenetic receptors, disease‐associated proteins, and other factors to defined neural circuits in mammals ranging from mice to macaques, and thereby provide a powerful new means to understand the structure and function of the nervous system.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Experimental diffuse brain injury and a model of Alzheimer's disease exhibit disease‐specific changes in sleep and incongruous peripheral inflammation</title>

	<description>In similarly aged individuals, traumatic brain injury (TBI) induced more profound sleep alterations than Alzheimer's disease (AD), with incongruous inflammation. Altered sleep may be associated with deleterious pathological processes and unique pathological sleep pathways may exist in older individuals that incur TBI compared with similarly aged individuals that have AD.

Abstract
Elderly populations (≥65 years old) have the highest risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and/or obtaining a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Using translational mouse models, we investigated sleep disturbances and inflammation associated with normal aging, TBI and aging, and AD. We hypothesized that aging results in marked changes in sleep compared with adult mice, and that TBI and aging would result in sleep and inflammation levels similar to AD mice. We used female 16‐month‐old wild‐type (WT Aged) and 3xTg‐AD mice, as well as a 2‐month‐old reference group (WT Adult), to evaluate sleep changes. WT Aged mice received diffuse TBI by midline fluid percussion, and blood was collected from both WT Aged (pre‐ and post‐TBI) and 3xTg‐AD mice to evaluate inflammation. Cognitive behavior was tested, and tissue was collected for histology. Bayesian generalized additive and mixed‐effects models were used for analyses. Both normal aging and AD led to increases in sleep compared with adult mice. WT Aged mice with TBI slept substantially more, with fragmented shorter bouts, than they did pre‐TBI and compared with AD mice. However, differences between WT Aged and 3xTg‐AD mice in immune cell populations and plasma cytokine levels were incongruous, cognitive deficits were similar, and cumulative sleep was not predictive of inflammation or behavior for either group. Our results suggest that in similarly aged individuals, TBI immediately induces more profound sleep alterations than in AD, although both diseases likely include cognitive impairments. Unique pathological sleep pathways may exist in elderly individuals who incur TBI compared with similarly aged individuals who have AD, which may warrant disease‐specific treatments in clinical settings.</description>

	<description>The brain activity of the four brain regions during visuo‐guided grip force tracking tasks were detected by functional near‐infrared spectroscopy. Pearson's correlation method, partial correlation method, and a pairwise maximum entropy model were used to get a more comprehensive and accurate functional connectivity for precise grip force control.

Abstract
The functional connectivity (FC) between multiple brain regions during tasks is currently gradually being explored with functional near‐infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). However, the FC present during grip force tracking tasks performed under visual feedback remains unclear. In the present study, we used fNIRS to measure brain activity during resting states and grip force tracking tasks at 25%, 50%, and 75% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in 11 healthy subjects, and the activity was measured from four target brain regions: the left prefrontal cortex (lPFC), right prefrontal cortex (rPFC), left sensorimotor cortex (lSMC), and right sensorimotor cortex (rSMC). We determined the FC between these regions utilizing three different methods: Pearson's correlation method, partial correlation method, and a pairwise maximum entropy model (MEM). The results showed that the FC of lSMC‐rSMC and lPFC‐rPFC (interhemispheric homologous pairs) were significantly stronger than those of other brain region pairs. Moreover, FC of lPFC‐rPFC was strengthened during the 75% MVC task compared to the other task states and the resting states.

	<description>Glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor derived from glioma cells upregulate matrix metallopeptidase 9 and 14 expression on microglia, which in turn promote glioma progression. 

Abstract
Glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is released by glioma cells and promotes tumor growth. We have previously found that GDNF released from the tumor cells is a chemoattractant for microglial cells, the immune cells of the central nervous system. Here we show that GDNF increases matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 and MMP14 expression in cultured microglial cells from mixed sexes of neonatal mice. The GDNF‐induced microglial MMP9 and MMP14 upregulation is mediated by GDNF family receptor alpha 1 receptors and dependent on p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase signaling. In organotypic brain slices, GDNF promotes the growth of glioma and this effect depends on the presence of microglia. We also previously found that MMP9 and MMP14 upregulation can be mediated by Toll‐like receptor (TLR) 2 signaling and here we demonstrate that GDNF increases the expression of TLR1 and TLR2. In conclusion, GDNF promotes the pro‐tumorigenic phenotype of microglia.</description>

	<description>The potential approaches to treating neonatal H‐I injury are as follows: 1. Inhibiting M1 microglia to secrete pro‐inflammatory cytokines or to promote microglia M2 polarization. 2. Targeting OPCs and oligodendrocytes and promoting their differentiation and maturation to maintain axonal integrity and conductivity and restoring axonal functions through remyelination.

Abstract
Neonatal hypoxic–ischemic (H‐I) injury, which mainly causes neuronal damage and white matter injury (WMI), is among the predominant causes of infant morbidity (cerebral palsy, cognitive and persistent motor disabilities) and mortality. Disruptions to the oxygen and blood supply in the perinatal brain affect the cerebral microenvironment and may affect microglial activation, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress. Microglia are significantly associated with axonal damage and myelinating oligodendrocytes, which are major pathological components of WMI. However, the effects of H‐I injury on microglial functions and underlying transformation mechanisms remain poorly understood. The historical perception that these cells are major risk factors for ischemic stroke has been questioned due to our improved understanding of the diversity of microglial phenotypes and their alterable functions, which exacerbate or attenuate injuries in different regions in response to environmental instability. Unfortunately, although therapeutic hypothermia is an efficient treatment, death and disability remain the prognosis for a large proportion of neonates with H‐I injury. Hence, novel neuroprotective therapies to treat WMI following H‐I injury are urgently needed. Here, we review microglial mechanisms that might occur in the developing brain due to neonatal H‐I injury and discuss whether microglia function as a double‐edged sword in WMI. Then, we emphasize microglial heterogeneity, notably at the single‐cell level, and sex‐specific effects on the etiology of neurological diseases. Finally, we discuss current knowledge of strategies aiming to improve microglia modulation and remyelination following neonatal H‐I injury. Overall, microglia‐targeted therapy might provide novel and valuable insights into the treatment of neonatal H‐I insult.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Development of parvalbumin neurons and perineuronal nets in the visual cortex of normal and dark‐exposed cats</title>

	<description>At the peak of the critical period, immersion into complete darkness for 10 days significantly reduces the number of perineuronal nets (PNN) in the primary visual cortex of cats but does not alter the number of parvalbumin (PV) cells that they usually surround. Darkness also reduces the size of PV cells even if they are surrounded by a PNN, indicating that PNNs do not inhibit all forms of neural plasticity.







Abstract
During development, the visual system maintains a high capacity for modification by expressing characteristics permissive for plasticity, enabling neural circuits to be refined by visual experience to achieve their mature form. This period is followed by the emergence of characteristics that stabilize the brain to consolidate for lifetime connections that were informed by experience. Attenuation of plasticity potential is thought to derive from an accumulation of plasticity‐inhibiting characteristics that appear at ages beyond the peak of plasticity. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are molecular aggregations that primarily surround fast‐spiking inhibitory neurons called parvalbumin (PV) cells, which exhibit properties congruent with a plasticity inhibitor. In this study, we examined the development of PNNs and PV cells in the primary visual cortex of a highly visual mammal, and assessed the impact that 10 days of darkness had on both characteristics. Here, we show that labeling for PV expression emerges earlier and reaches adult levels sooner than PNNs. We also demonstrate that darkness, a condition known to enhance plasticity, significantly reduces the density of PNNs and the size of PV cell somata but does not alter the number of PV cells in the visual cortex. The darkness‐induced reduction of PV cell size occurred irrespective of whether neurons were surrounded by a PNN, suggesting that PNNs have a restricted capacity to inhibit plasticity. Finally, we show that PV cells surrounded by a PNN were significantly larger than those without one, supporting the view that PNNs may mediate trophic support to the cells they surround.</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Rodent mnemonic similarity task performance requires the prefrontal cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/10.1002/hipo.23316</guid>

	<description>Abstract
Mnemonic similarity task performance, in which a known target stimulus must be distinguished from similar lures, is supported by the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex. Impairments on this task are known to manifest with advancing age. Interestingly, disrupting hippocampal activity leads to mnemonic discrimination impairments when lures are novel, but not when they are familiar. This observation suggests that other brain structures support discrimination abilities as stimuli are learned. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for retrieval of remote events and executive functions, such as working memory, and is also particularly vulnerable to dysfunction in aging. Importantly, the medial PFC is reciprocally connected to the perirhinal cortex and neuron firing in this region coordinates communication between lateral entorhinal and perirhinal cortices to presumably modulate hippocampal activity. This anatomical organization and function of the medial PFC suggests that it contributes to mnemonic discrimination; however, this notion has not been empirically tested. In the current study, rats were trained on a LEGO object‐based mnemonic similarity task adapted for rodents, and surgically implanted with guide cannulae targeting prelimbic and infralimbic regions of the medial PFC. Prior to mnemonic discrimination tests, rats received PFC infusions of the GABAA agonist muscimol. Analyses of expression of the neuronal activity‐dependent immediate‐early gene Arc in medial PFC and adjacent cortical regions confirmed muscimol infusions led to neuronal inactivation in the infralimbic and prelimbic cortices. Moreover, muscimol infusions in PFC impaired mnemonic discrimination performance relative to the vehicle control across all testing blocks when lures shared 50–90% feature overlap with the target. Thus, in contrast hippocampal infusions, PFC inactivation impaired target‐lure discrimination regardless of the novelty or familiarity of the lures. These findings indicate the PFC plays a critical role in mnemonic similarity task performance, but the time course of PFC involvement is dissociable from that of the hippocampus.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Resilience, pain, and the brain: Relationships differ by sociodemographics</title>

	<description>Higher resilience associates with lower pain severity and pain disability in those with chronic pain. Additionally, relationships between resilience and pain‐related brain structure were indicated in the right amygdala, bilateral thalamus, and postcentral gyrus which differed by sex and ethnicity/race. Considering sociodemographic factors in pain and resilience investigations are important.

Abstract
Chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is disabling to individuals and burdensome to society. A relationship between telomere length and resilience was reported in individuals with consideration for chronic pain intensity. While chronic pain associates with brain changes, little is known regarding the neurobiological interface of resilience. In a group of individuals with chronic MSK pain, we examined the relationships between a previously investigated resilience index, clinical pain and functioning measures, and pain‐related brain structures, with consideration for sex and ethnicity/race. A cross‐sectional analysis of 166 non‐Hispanic Black and non‐Hispanic White adults, 45–85 years of age with pain ≥ 1 body site (s) over the past 3 months was completed. Measures of clinical pain and functioning, biobehavioral and psychosocial resilience, and structural MRI were completed. Our findings indicate higher levels of resilience associate with lower levels of clinical pain and functional limitations. Significant associations between resilience, ethnicity/race, and/or sex, and pain‐related brain gray matter structure were demonstrated in the right amygdaloid complex, bilateral thalamus, and postcentral gyrus. Our findings provide compelling evidence that in order to decipher the neurobiological code of chronic pain and related protective factors, it will be important to improve how chronic pain is phenotyped; to include an equal representation of females in studies including analyses stratifying by sex, and to consider other sociodemographic factors.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Microglia and astrocytes show limited, acute alterations in morphology and protein expression following a single developmental alcohol exposure</title>

	<description>After a single, binge‐level exposure to ethanol in development, we found subtle effects on glia in the mouse somatosensory cortex and hippocampus. Ethanol treatment reduced colocalization between two astrocytic markers, GFAP and Aldh1L1; induced region‐specific changes in microglia volume, process morphology, and density; and had no effect on glial interactions.

Abstract
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common cause of nonheritable, preventable mental disability and are characterized by cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments. FASD occurs in almost 5% of births in the United States, but despite this prevalence there is no known cure, largely because the biological mechanisms that translate alcohol exposure to neuropathology are not well understood. While the effects of early ethanol exposure on neuronal survival and circuitry have received more attention, glia, the cells most closely tied to initiating and propagating inflammatory events, could be an important target for alcohol in the developing brain. Inflammation is known to alter developmental trajectories, but it has recently been shown that even small changes in both astrocytes and microglia in the absence of full‐blown inflammatory signaling can alter brain function long‐term. Here, we studied the acute response of astrocytes and microglia to a single exposure to ethanol in development across sexes in a mouse model of human third trimester exposure, in order to understand how these cells may transition from their normal developmental path to a different program that leads to FASD neuropathology. We found that although a single ethanol exposure delivered subcutaneously on postnatal day 4 did not cause large changes in microglial morphology or the expression of AldH1L1 and GFAP in the cortex and hippocampus, subtle effects were observed. These findings suggest that even a single, early ethanol exposure can induce mild acute alterations in glia that could contribute to developmental deficits.</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Ecological rules for the assembly of microbiome communities</title>

Humans and many other hosts establish a diverse community of beneficial microbes anew each generation. The order and identity of incoming symbionts is critical for health, but what determines the success of the assembly process remains poorly understood. Here we develop ecological theory to identify factors important for microbial community assembly. Our method maps out all feasible pathways for the assembly of a given microbiome—with analogies to the mutational maps underlying fitness landscapes in evolutionary biology. Building these “assembly maps” reveals a tradeoff at the heart of the assembly process. Ecological dependencies between members of the microbiota make assembly predictable—and can provide metabolic benefits to the host—but these dependencies may also create barriers to assembly. This effect occurs because interdependent species can fail to establish when each relies on the other to colonize first. We support our predictions with published data from the assembly of the preterm infant microbiota, where we find that ecological dependence is associated with a predictable order of arrival. Our models also suggest that hosts can overcome barriers to assembly via mechanisms that either promote the uptake of multiple symbiont species in one step or feed early colonizers. This predicted importance of host feeding is supported by published data on the impacts of breast milk in the assembly of the human microbiome. We conclude that both microbe–microbe and host–microbe interactions are important for the trajectory of microbiome assembly.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/TQx1RXt8PXU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>
