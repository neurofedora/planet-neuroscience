Covalent modification of proteins by ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains is one of the most prevalent post-translational modifications in eukaryotes. Different types of ubiquitin chains are assumed to selectively signal respectively modified proteins for different fates. In support of this hypothesis, structural studies have shown that the eight possible ubiquitin dimers adopt different conformations. However, at least in some cases, these structures cannot sufficiently explain the molecular basis of the selective signaling mechanisms. This indicates that the available structures represent only a few distinct conformations within the entire conformational space adopted by a ubiquitin dimer. Here, molecular simulations on different levels of resolution can complement the structural information. We have combined exhaustive coarse grained and atomistic simulations of all eight possible ubiquitin dimers with a suitable dimensionality reduction technique and a new method to characterize protein-protein interfaces and the conformational landscape of protein conjugates. We found that ubiquitin dimers exhibit characteristic linkage type-dependent properties in solution, such as interface stability and the character of contacts between the subunits, which can be directly correlated with experimentally observed linkage-specific properties.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6aIN2Kla9rU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Essential metabolic reactions are shaping constituents of metabolic networks, enabling viable and distinct phenotypes across diverse life forms. Here we analyse and compare modelling predictions of essential metabolic functions with experimental data and thereby identify core metabolic pathways in prokaryotes. Simulations of 15 manually curated genome-scale metabolic models were integrated with 36 large-scale gene essentiality datasets encompassing a wide variety of species of bacteria and archaea. Conservation of metabolic genes was estimated by analysing 79 representative genomes from all the branches of the prokaryotic tree of life. We find that essentiality patterns reflect phylogenetic relations both for modelling and experimental data, which correlate highly at the pathway level. Genes that are essential for several species tend to be highly conserved as opposed to non-essential genes which may be conserved or not. The tRNA-charging module is highlighted as ancestral and with high centrality in the networks, followed closely by cofactor metabolism, pointing to an early information processing system supplied by organic cofactors. The results, which point to model improvements and also indicate faults in the experimental data, should be relevant to the study of centrality in metabolic networks and ancient metabolism but also to metabolic engineering with prokaryotes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YfypktDVdWM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Embryonic neocortical microglia express Toll-like receptor 9 and respond to plasmid DNA injected into the ventricle: technical considerations regarding microglial distribution in electroporated brain walls</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Microglia, the resident immune cells in the central nervous system, play multiple roles during development. In the embryonic cerebral wall, microglia modulate the functions of neural stem/progenitor cells through their distribution in regions undergoing cell proliferation and/or differentiation. Previous studies using CX3CR1-GFP transgenic mice demonstrated that microglia extensively survey these regions. To simultaneously visualize microglia and neural-lineage cells that interact with each other, we applied the &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; electroporation (IUE) technique, which has been widely used for gene-transfer in neurodevelopmental studies, to CX3CR1-GFP mice (males and females). However, we unexpectedly faced a technical problem: although microglia are normally distributed homogeneously throughout the mid-embryonic cortical wall with only limited luminal entry, the intraventricular presence of exogenously derived plasmid DNAs induced microglia to accumulate along the apical surface of the cortex and aggregate in the choroid plexus. This effect was independent of capillary needle puncture of the brain wall or application of electrical pulses. The microglial response occurred at plasmid DNA concentrations lower than those routinely used for IUE, and was mediated by activation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), an innate immune sensor that recognizes unmethylated cytosine-phosphate guanosine (CpG) motifs abundant in microbial DNA. Administration of plasmid DNA together with oligonucleotide (ODN) 2088, the antagonist of TLR9, restored the normal (dispersed) intramural localization of microglia and decreased luminal accumulation of these cells. Thus, via TLR9, intraventricular plasmid DNA administration causes aberrant distribution of embryonic microglia, suggesting that the behavior of microglia in brain primordia subjected to IUE should be carefully interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Microglia have been recently shown to play multiple roles in the embryonic brain. In the trials for labeling neural-lineage cells using IUE technique in CX3CR1-GFP mice, in which microglia express GFP, to achieve dual live-imaging of these cell types, we unexpectedly found that intra-ventricular administration of plasmid DNA caused microglial aberrant accumulation along the luminal surface of the cerebral wall and in the choroid plexus. Notably, Co-administration of TLR9 antagonist into the ventricle together with plasmid DNA restored the normal dispersed localization of microglia in the mid-embryonic (E14) cortex, suggesting that massive microglial accumulation induced by plasmid DNA is primarily mediated by TLR9 activation. Our findings have implications for the application of IUE to investigate embryonic microglia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Enhancing GABAergic transmission improves locomotion in a C. elegans model of Spinal Muscular Atrophy</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of spinal motor neurons resulting in variable degrees of muscular wasting and weakness. It is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the &lt;i&gt;Survival Motor Neuron&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt;) gene. &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;) mutants lacking &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; recapitulate several aspects of the disease including impaired movement and shorted life span. We examined whether genes previously implicated in life span extension conferred benefits to &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; lacking SMN. We find that reducing DAF-2/insulin receptor signaling activity promotes survival and improves locomotor behavior in this &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; model of SMA. The locomotor dysfunction in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; lacking &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; correlated with structural and functional abnormalities in GABAergic neuromuscular junctions. Moreover, we demonstrated that reduction in DAF-2 signaling reversed these abnormalities. Remarkably, enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission alone was able to correct the locomotor dysfunction. Our work indicated that an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory activity within motor circuits and underlies motor system dysfunction in this SMA model. Interventions aimed at restoring the balance of excitatory/inhibitory activity in motor circuits could be of benefit to individuals with SMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; SMA is a pediatric motor neuron disease resulting from the loss of the SMN protein. While great effort has been expended on interventions aimed at increasing levels of compensatory SMN1, identification of genes that modify the SMA phenotype has lagged. Here we undertook a targeted genetic screen to identify SMA disease suppressors. We demonstrated that reduced insulin/insulin-like signaling is beneficial for not only longevity but also locomotor activity in SMA worm models. Our results from anatomical, functional, and genetic studies show that the impairment of GABAergic neurotransmission contributes to locomotor dysfunction in &lt;i&gt;smn-1&lt;/i&gt; null worms. Enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission alone can correct the locomotor dysfunction. This work leads to new understanding of disease pathogenesis and opens up new opportunities for therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: The mixed-lineage kinase inhibitor URMC-099 protects hippocampal synapses in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Treatments to stop gray matter degeneration are needed to prevent progressive disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). We tested whether inhibiting mixed-lineage kinases (MLKs), which can drive inflammatory microglial activation and neuronal degeneration, could protect hippocampal synapses in C57BL/6 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a disease model that recapitulates the excitatory synaptic injury that occurs widely within the gray matter in MS. URMC-099, a broad spectrum MLK inhibitor with additional activity against LRRK2 and other kinases, prevented loss of PSD95-positive postsynaptic structures, shifted activated microglia toward a less inflammatory phenotype, and reversed deficits in hippocampal-dependent contextual fear conditioning in EAE mice when administered after the onset of motor symptoms. A narrow spectrum inhibitor designed to be highly selective for MLK3 failed to protect synapses in EAE hippocampi, and could not rescue cultured neurons from trophic deprivation in an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model of MLK-driven neuronal degeneration. These results suggest that URMC-099 may have potential as a neuroprotective treatment in MS, and demonstrate that a broad spectrum of inhibition against a combination of MLK and other kinases is more effective in neuroinflammatory disease than selectively targeting a single kinase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Multiple sclerosis (MS) causes progressive neurologic decline that correlates with damage to gray matter in the brain, and is not stopped by current treatments. We used a mouse model of MS, in which gray matter injury is associated with inflammatory molecules produced by activated microglia, to test novel neuroprotective treatments. URMC-099, a mixed-lineage kinase (MLK) inhibitor that has anti-inflammatory and direct neuroprotective properties, prevented loss of hippocampal synapses and reversed deficits in learning and memory in a mouse model of MS. An MLK inhibitor with a narrower range of specificity was not effective, suggesting that combination kinase inhibition with URMC-099 may have potential as a neuroprotective treatment in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Memory formation is a protracted process that initially involves the hippocampus and becomes increasingly dependent on the cortex over time, but the mechanisms of this transfer are unclear. We recently showed that hippocampal depletion of the histone variant H2A.Z enhances both recent and remote memories, but the use of virally mediated depletion reduced H2A.Z levels throughout testing, making its temporally specific function unclear. Given the lack of drugs that target histone variants, we tested existing drugs for efficacy against H2A.Z based on their targeting of known H2A.Z regulators. The Tip60 (part of H2A.Z deposition complex) inhibitor Nu9056 reduced H2A.Z binding, whereas the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin-A increased H2A.Z acetylation without influencing total H2A.Z in cultured hippocampal neurons. Tip60 (but not HDAC) inhibition 23 h after learning enhanced remote (tested at 7 d) and not recent (tested at 24 h) contextual fear memory in mice. In contrast, Tip60 inhibition 30 d after learning impaired recall of remote memory after 1 h, but protected the memory from further decline 24 h later. These data provide the first evidence of a delayed postlearning role for histone variants in supporting memory transfer during systems consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: p11 in Cholinergic Interneurons of the Nucleus Accumbens Is Essential for Dopamine Responses to Rewarding Stimuli</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0332-18.2018?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0332-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A recent study showed that p11 expressed in cholinergic interneurons (CINs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key regulator of depression-like behaviors. Dopaminergic neurons projecting to the NAc are responsible for reward-related behaviors, and their function is impaired in depression. The present study investigated the role of p11 in NAc CINs in dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The extracellular dopamine and acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the NAc were determined in freely moving male mice using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microdialysis. Rewarding stimuli (cocaine, palatable food, and female mouse encounter) induced an increase in dopamine efflux in the NAc of wild-type (WT) mice. The dopamine responses were attenuated (cocaine) or abolished (food and female mouse encounter) in constitutive p11 knock-out (KO) mice. The dopamine response to cocaine was accompanied by an increase in ACh NAc efflux, whereas the attenuated dopamine response to cocaine in p11 KO mice was restored by activation of nicotinic or muscarinic ACh receptors in the NAc. Dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli and ACh release in the NAc were attenuated in mice with deletion of p11 from cholinergic neurons (ChAT-p11 cKO mice), whereas gene delivery of p11 to CINs restored the dopamine responses. Furthermore, chemogenetic studies revealed that p11 is required for activation of CINs in response to rewarding stimuli. Thus, p11 in NAc CINs plays a critical role in activating these neurons to mediate dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The dysregulation of mesolimbic dopamine system by dysfunction of p11 in NAc CINs may be involved in pathogenesis of depressive states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: In Vivo Volume Dynamics of Dendritic Spines in the Neocortex of Wild-Type and Fmr1 KO Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excitatory synapses are often formed at small protrusions of dendrite, called dendritic spines, in most projection neurons, and the spine-head volumes show strong correlations with synaptic connectivity. We examined the dynamics of spine volume in the adult mouse visual cortex using time-lapse &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon imaging with a resonant Galvano scanner. Contrary to expectations, we found that the spines in the adult neocortex showed fluctuations to a similar degree as that observed in young hippocampal preparations, but there were systematic differences in how the dynamics were dependent on spine volumes, thus allowing for fewer fluctuations in small spines, which could account for the relatively low turnover rates of neocortical spines &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We found that spine volumes fluctuated to a greater extent in a mouse model (&lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knockout) of fragile X mental retardation than in wild-type mice, and the spine turnover rates were also higher in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice. Such features of spine dynamics in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice could be represented by a single slope factor in our model. Our data and model indicate a small but significant change in the average spine volume and more eminent differences in the statistical distribution in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice even in adulthood, which reflects the abnormal &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; dynamics of spine volumes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The role of orexin during development, and especially in terms of spinal cord function, is not well understood. It is for this reason that we focused on the network actions of orexin during the first week of development. We found that orexinergic fibers were present in the lumbar spinal cord of postnatal day 0 (P0) to P3 mice. The fibers were expressed mainly in the dorsal horn, but occasional fibers were observed in the ventral horn. Both orexin (OX) A and OXB increased the motoneurons (MNs) tonic neurogram discharge. However, only OXA was found to significantly increase spontaneous bursting activity and the frequency of fictive locomotor bursts. We show that OXA is able to act directly on MNs. To test the contribution of the recurrent MN collaterals, we blocked the nicotinic cholinergic drive and observed that OXA retained its ability to increase fictive locomotor activity. Additionally, we recorded neurograms from ventral lateral funiculi, where OXA had no effect on population discharge. These effects were also confirmed by recording from descending commissural interneurons via patch recordings. The loci of the effects of OXA were further investigated in a dorsal horn-removed preparation where OXA also shows an increase in the discharge from ventral root neurograms but no increase in the frequency of spontaneous or fictive locomotion burst activity. In summary, multiple lines of evidence from our work demonstrate the robust effects of orexins on spinal cord networks and MNs at the time of birth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;CD137L (4-1BBL) is a costimulatory molecule whose signaling can promote monocyte/macrophage functions; however, CD137L-mediated microglial response and its role in neuropathic pain remain unknown. We investigated CD137L following peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain using a spinal nerve L5 transection (L5Tx) murine model in both sexes. First, C57BL/6_CD137L knock-out (KO) mice displayed decreased mechanical and diminished heat hypersensitivity compared to wild-type (WT) controls, beginning on day 3 to up to day 35 post-L5Tx. Purified anti-mouse CD137L neutralizing monoclonal antibody (0.1 or 0.5 µg) was also used to identify CD137L’s window of action in BALB/c mice. Anti-CD137L antibody was intrathecally administered either from day 0 (before surgery) to day 7 (early treatment), or from day 6 to 13 post-L5Tx (late treatment), and nociceptive thresholds were assessed before surgery to up to day 35 post-surgery. Early treatment with anti-CD137L reduced L5Tx-induced mechanical but not heat hypersensitivity, while later treatment did not alter either sensitivity. Pro- versus anti-inflammatory responses within the lumbar spinal cord following L5Tx were further evaluated via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in time-course studies. Following L5Tx, female CD137L KO mice did not show increased iNOS mRNA and had reduced numbers of IL-1β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells compared to WT. At 21 d post-surgery, CD137L KO mice had higher total numbers of arginase (Arg)-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells and Arg-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia. Altogether, results indicate that spinal cord CD137L contributes to the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain, which may be in part mediated through CD137L’s modulation of the pro- and anti-inflammatory balance within the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Changes in GABAergic Transmission to and Intrinsic Excitability of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Neurons during the Estrous Cycle in Mice</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons form the final common central output pathway controlling fertility and are regulated by steroid feedback. In females, estradiol feedback action varies between negative and positive; negative feedback typically regulates episodic GnRH release whereas positive feedback initiates a surge of GnRH, and subsequently luteinizing hormone (LH) release ultimately triggering ovulation. During the estrous cycle, changes between estradiol negative and positive feedback occur with cycle stage and time of day, with positive feedback in the late afternoon of proestrus in nocturnal species. To test the hypotheses that synaptic and intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons are regulated by cycle stage and time of day, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp studies of GnRH neurons in brain slices from mice at two times considered negative feedback (diestrous PM and proestrous AM) and during positive feedback (proestrous PM). GABAergic transmission can excite GnRH neurons and was higher in cells from proestrous PM mice than cells from proestrous AM mice and approached traditional significance levels relative to cells from diestrous PM mice. Action potential response to current injection was also greater in cells from proestrous PM mice than the other two groups. Interestingly, the hormonal milieu of proestrous AM provided stronger negative feedback on both GnRH neuron excitability and GABAergic postsynaptic current (PSC) amplitude than diestrous PM. These observations demonstrate elements of both synaptic and intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons are regulated in a cycle-dependent manner and provide insight into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cyclic changes in neuroendocrine function among states of estradiol negative and positive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Reading literature (e.g., an entire book) is an enriching experience that qualitatively differs from reading a single sentence; however, the brain dynamics of such context-dependent memory remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate mnemonic neural dynamics during natural reading of literature by performing electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Brain activities of human participants recruited on campus were correlated with their subsequent memory, which was quantified by semantic correlation between the read text and reports subsequently written by them based on state of the art natural language processing procedures. The results of the EEG data analysis showed a significant positive relationship between subsequent memory and fixation-related EEG. Sentence-length and paragraph-length mnemonic processes were associated with N1-P2 and P3 fixation-related potential (FRP) components and fixation-related -band (4–8 Hz) EEG power, respectively. In contrast, the results of fMRI analysis showed a significant negative relationship between subsequent memory and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation. Sentence-length and paragraph-length mnemonic processes were associated with networks of regions forming part of the salience network and the default mode network (DMN), respectively. Taken together with the EEG results, these memory-related deactivations in the salience network and the DMN were thought to reflect the reading of sentences characterized by low mnemonic load and the suppression of task-irreverent thoughts, respectively. It was suggested that the context-dependent mnemonic process during literature reading requires large-scale network deactivation, which might reflect coordination of a range of voluntary processes during reading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: June 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Anna L Vlasits, Thomas Euler, Katrin Franke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell type classification has been a major part of retina research for over one hundred years. In recent years, the ability to sample large populations of retinal cells has accelerated cell type classification based on different criteria like genetics, morphology, function, and circuitry. For example, recent work includes bipolar and retinal ganglion cell classifications based on single-cell transcriptomes, large-scale electron microscopy reconstruction, and population-level functional imaging. With comprehensive descriptions of several retinal cell classes now within reach, it is important to reflect on the priority of these different criteria to create an accurate and useful classification. Here, we argue that functional information about retinal cells should be prioritized over other criteria when addressing questions of visual function because this criterion provides the most meaningful information about how the retina works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>How &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;) rewires macrophage energy metabolism to facilitate survival is poorly characterized. Here, we used extracellular flux analysis to simultaneously measure the rates of glycolysis and respiration in real-time. &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt; infection induced a quiescent energy phenotype in human monocyte-derived macrophages and decelerated flux through glycolysis and the TCA cycle. In contrast, infection with the vaccine strain, &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; BCG, or dead &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt; induced glycolytic phenotypes with greater flux. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;Mtb &lt;/i&gt;reduced the mitochondrial dependency on glucose and increased the mitochondrial dependency on fatty acids, shifting this dependency from endogenous fatty acids in uninfected cells to exogenous fatty acids in infected macrophages. We demonstrate how quantifiable bioenergetic parameters of the host can be used to accurately measure and track disease, which will enable rapid quantifiable assessment of drug and vaccine efficacy. Our findings uncovered new paradigms for understanding the bioenergetic basis of host metabolic reprogramming by &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Angiopoietin-4-dependent venous maturation and fluid drainage in the peripheral retina</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37776</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37776</link>
	<description>The maintenance of fluid homeostasis is necessary for function of the neural retina; however, little is known about the significance of potential ﬂuid management mechanisms. Here, we investigated angiopoietin-4 (Angpt4, also known as Ang3), a poorly characterized ligand for endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2, in mouse retina model. By using genetic reporter, fate mapping, and in situ hybridization, we found &lt;i&gt;Angpt4&lt;/i&gt; expression in a specific sub-population of astrocytes at the site where venous morphogenesis occurs and that lower oxygen tension, which distinguishes peripheral and venous locations, enhances Angpt4 expression. Correlating with its spatiotemporal expression, deletion of &lt;i&gt;Angpt4&lt;/i&gt; resulted in defective venous development causing impaired venous drainage and defects in neuronal cells. In vitro characterization of angiopoietin-4 proteins revealed both ligand-specific and redundant functions among the angiopoietins. Our study identifies Angpt4 as the first growth factor for venous-specific development and its importance in venous remodeling, retinal fluid clearance and neuronal function.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The impact of modern jazz dance on the electrical brain activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/472324v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Dance as one of the earliest cultural assets of mankind is practised in different cultures, mostly for wellbeing or for treating psycho-physiological disorders like Parkinson, depression, autism. However, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms are still unclear and only few studies address the effects of particular dance styles. For a first impression, we were interested in the effects of modern jazz dance (MJD) on the brain activation that would contribute to the understanding of these mechanisms. 11 female subjects rehearsed a MJD choreography for three weeks (1h per week) and passed electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements in a crossover-design thereafter. The objectives were to establish the differences between dancing physically and participating just mentally with or without music. Therefore, each subject realized the four following test conditions: dancing physically to and without music, dancing mentally to and without music. Each of the conditions were performed for 15 minutes. Before and after each condition, the EEG activities were recorded under resting conditions (2 min. eyes-open, 2 min. eyes-closed) followed by a subsequent wash-out phase of 10 minutes. The results of the study revealed no time effects for the mental dancing conditions, either to or without music. An increased electrical brain activation was followed by the physical dancing conditions with and without music for the theta, alpha-1, alpha-2, beta and gamma frequency band across the entire scalp. Especially the higher frequencies (alpha-2, beta, gamma) showed increased brain activation across all brain areas. Higher brain activities for the physical dancing conditions were identified in comparison to the mental dancing condition. No statistically significant differences could be found as to dancing to or without music. Our findings demonstrate evidence for the immediate influence of modern jazz dance and its sweeping effects on all brain areas for all measured frequency bands, when dancing physically. In comparison, dancing just mentally does not result in similar effects.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Distinct neural mechanisms meet challenges in dynamic visual attention due to either load or spatial interference</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/472209v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/472209v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>When solving dynamic visuo-spatial tasks, like multiple-object tracking (MOT), the brain copes with challenges imposed by the number of objects (i.e. load) that has to be tracked, but also by spatial interference from irrelevant objects (i.e. crowding). At present, it is not clear whether load and crowding activate separate cognitive and physiological mechanisms. Cognitive workload recruits cortical systems, like the dorsal and ventral attention networks, and brainstem neuromodulatory systems, such as the locus coeruleus - norepinephrine (LC-NE) system and the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra dopaminergic (VTA/SN - DA) system. However, it remains unknown what the specific roles of each of these brain systems are in dealing with load versus crowding. We employed a MOT task where participants had to track simultaneously multiple randomly moving targets. We varied the degree of processing challenge in two ways: first, how many dynamic targets participants had to track (load, known at the beginning of every trial); second, the proximity between targets and distractors (i.e., the number of close target-distractor encounters, causing moment-to-moment confusion within the trial). To evaluate the extent to which load and crowding elicits distinct physiological responses, we ran two MOT experiments in separate cohorts. In a first experiment, we measured task-induced saccades and pupil dilations. In a separate fMRI experiment, we measured brain activity elicited by MOT. The behavioral results from both experiments revealed that increased load and crowding led to reduced accuracy in an additive manner, suggesting that they may rely on different mechanisms. Consistent with this, ocular data showed that load was associated with pupil dilations, whereas crowding was not. Conversely, both load and crowding were associated with increased frequency of saccades during tracking. The fMRI results showed that dorsal attentional areas were proportionally active with both higher levels of load and crowding. Higher crowding recruited additionally ventral attentional areas that may reflect orienting mechanisms. The activity in the brainstem nuclei VTA/SN and LC showed strongly dissociated patterns. While activations in VTA/SN mainly reflected variations in crowding, activity in LC mainly reflected variations in load. An exploratory individual differences approach showed that high-performers were able to recruit dynamically the LC with high difficulty. Thus, distinct brain and brainstem systems deal with spatially versus non-spatially-related effort.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Tissue mechanics and somatosensory neural responses govern touch sensation in C. elegans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/471904v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/471904v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The sense of touch hinges on tissues transducing stimuli applied to the skin and somatosensory neurons converting mechanical inputs into currents. Like mammalian Pacinian corpuscles, the light-touch response of the prime model organism C. elegans adapts rapidly, and is symmetrically activated by the onset and offset of a step indentation. Here, we propose a quantitative model that combines transduction of stimuli across the skin and subsequent gating of mechanoelectrical channels. For mechanics, we use an elastic model based on geometrically-nonlinear deformations of a pressurized cylindrical shell. For gating, we build upon consequences of the dermal layer's thinness and tangential stimuli. Our model demonstrates how the onset-offset symmetry arises from the coupling of mechanics and adaptation, and accounts for experimental neural responses to a broad variety of stimuli. Predicted effects of modifications in the mechanics or the internal pressure of the body are tested against mechanical and neurophysiological experiments.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: In Vivo Two-Photon Imaging of Neuronal and Vascular Responses in Mice Chronically Exposed to Ethanol</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/471763v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/471763v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The effects of ethanol on brain function have been extensively studied using a variety of in vitro and in vivo techniques. For example, electrophysiological studies using brain slices from rodents and non-human primates have demonstrated that acute and chronic exposure to ethanol alters the intrinsic excitability and synaptic signaling of neurons within cortical and sub-cortical areas of the brain. In humans, neuroimaging studies reveal alterations in measures of brain activation and connectivity in subjects with alcohol use disorders. While complementary, these methods are inherently limited due to issues related to either disruption of normal sensory input (in vitro slice studies) or resolution (whole brain imaging). In the present study, we used 2-photon laser scanning microscopy in intact animals to assess the impact of chronic ethanol exposure on sensory evoked neuronal and vascular responses. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 4 weekly cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure while control mice were exposed to air. After withdrawal (&amp;gt; 72 hr), a cranial window was placed over the primary visual cortex (V1) and sensory evoked responses were monitored using the calcium indicator OGB-1. CIE exposure produced small but significant changes in response amplitude (decrease) and orientation selectivity of V1 neurons (increase). While arteriole diameter did not differ between control and CIE mice under baseline conditions, sensory-evoked dilation was enhanced in vessels from CIE exposed mice as compared to controls. This was accompanied by a reduced latency in response to stimulation. In separate experiments, pial arteriole diameter was measured in the barrel cortex of control and CIE exposed mice. Baseline diameter of barrel cortex arterioles was similar between control and CIE exposed mice but unlike vessels in V1, sensory-evoked dilation of barrel cortex arterioles was similar between the two groups. Together the results of these studies suggest that chronic exposure to alcohol induces changes in neurovascular coupling that are region dependent.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: SKN-1/Nrf2 regulation of neuromuscular function in response to oxidative stress requires EGL-15/FGF Receptor and DAF-2/insulin Receptor signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/471755v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/471755v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The transcription factor Nrf2 plays a critical role in the organism wide-regulation of the antioxidant stress response. The Nrf2 homolog SKN-1 functions in the intestine cell non-autonomously to negatively regulate neuromuscular (NMJ) function in Caenorhabditis elegans. To identify additional molecules that mediate SKN-1 signaling to the NMJ, we performed a candidate screen for suppressors of aldicarb-resistance caused by acute treatment with the SKN-1 activator, arsenite. We identified two receptor tyrosine kinases, EGL-15 (fibroblast growth factor receptor, FGFR) and DAF-2 (insulin-like peptide receptor, IR) that are required for NMJ regulation in response to stress. Through double mutant analysis, we found that EGL-15 functions downstream of SKN-1 and SPHK-1 (sphingosine kinase), and that the EGL-15 ligand EGL-17 FGF and canonical EGL-15 effectors are required for oxidative stress-mediated regulation of NMJ function. DAF-2 also functions downstream of SKN-1, independently of DAF-16/FOXO, to regulate NMJ function. Through tissue-specific rescue experiments, we found that FGFR signaling functions primarily in the hypodermis, whereas IR signaling is required in multiple tissues. Our results support the idea that the regulation of NMJ function by SKN-1 occurs via a complex organism-wide signaling network involving RTK signaling in multiple tissues.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Concurrent Multisensory Integration and Segregation with Complementary Congruent and Opposite Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/471490v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Our brain perceives the world by exploiting multiple sensory modalities to extract information about various aspects of external stimuli. If these sensory cues are from the same stimulus of interest, they should be integrated to improve perception; otherwise, they should be segregated to distinguish different stimuli. In reality, however, the brain faces the challenge of recognizing stimuli without knowing in advance whether sensory cues come from the same or different stimuli. To address this challenge and to recognize stimuli rapidly, we argue that the brain should carry out multisensory integration and segregation concurrently with complementary neuron groups. Studying an example of inferring heading-direction via visual and vestibular cues, we develop a concurrent multisensory processing neural model which consists of two reciprocally connected modules, the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd) and the ventral intraparietal area (VIP), and that at each module, there exists two distinguishing groups of neurons, congruent and opposite neurons. Specifically, congruent neurons implement cue integration, while opposite neurons compute the cue disparity, both optimally as described by Bayesian inference. The two groups of neurons provide complementary information which enables the neural system to assess the validity of cue integration and, if necessary, to recover the lost information associated with individual cues without re-gathering new inputs. Through this process, the brain achieves rapid stimulus perception if the cues come from the same stimulus of interest, and differentiates and recognizes stimuli based on individual cues with little time delay if the cues come from different stimuli of interest. Our study unveils the indispensable role of opposite neurons in multisensory processing and sheds light on our understanding of how the brain achieves multisensory processing efficiently and rapidly.</description>

	<description>Most genetic risk for human diseases lies within non-coding regions of the genome, which is predicted to regulate gene expression, often in a tissue and stage specific manner. This has motivated building of extensive eQTL resources to understand how human allelic variation affects gene expression and splicing throughout the body, focusing primarily on adult tissue. Given the importance of regulatory pathways during brain development, we characterize the genetic control of the developing human cerebral cortical transcriptome, including expression and splicing, in 201 mid-gestational human brains, to understand how common allelic variation affects gene regulation during development. We leverage expression and splice quantitative trait loci to identify genes and isoforms relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders and brain volume. These findings demonstrate genetic mechanisms by which early developmental events have a striking and widespread influence on adult anatomical and behavioral phenotypes, as well as the evolution of the human cerebral cortex.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Knowledge is power: Contingency instruction promotes threat extinction in high intolerance of uncertainty individuals</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/470724v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Extinction-resistant threat is considered to be a central feature of pathological anxiety. Reduced threat extinction is observed in individuals with high intolerance of uncertainty (IU). Here we sought to determine whether contingency instructions could alter the course threat extinction for individuals high in IU. We tested this hypothesis in two identical experiments (Exp 1 n = 60, Exp 2 n = 82) where we recorded electrodermal activity during threat acquisition with partial reinforcement, and extinction. Participants were split into groups based on extinction instructions (instructed, uninstructed) and IU score (low, high). All groups displayed larger skin conductance responses to learned threat versus safety cues during threat acquisition, indicative of threat conditioning. In both experiments, only the uninstructed high IU groups displayed larger skin conductance responses to the learned threat versus safety cue during threat extinction. These findings suggest that uncertain threat during extinction maintains conditioned responding in individuals high in IU.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Cytoplasmic flows in starfish oocytes are fully determined by cortical contractions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Nils Klughammer, Johanna Bischof, Nikolas D. Schnellbächer, Andrea Callegari, Péter Lénárt, Ulrich S. Schwarz&lt;/p&gt;

Cytoplasmic flows are an ubiquitous feature of biological systems, in particular in large cells, such as oocytes and eggs in early animal development. Here we show that cytoplasmic flows in starfish oocytes, which can be imaged well with transmission light microscopy, are fully determined by the cortical dynamics during surface contraction waves. We first show that the dynamics of the oocyte surface is highly symmetric around the animal-vegetal axis. We then mathematically solve the Stokes equation for flows inside a deforming sphere using the measured surface displacements as boundary conditions. Our theoretical predictions agree very well with the intracellular flows quantified by particle image velocimetry, proving that during this stage the starfish cytoplasm behaves as a simple Newtonian fluid on the micrometer scale. We calculate the pressure field inside the oocyte and find that its gradient is too small as to explain polar body extrusion, in contrast to earlier suggestions. Myosin II inhibition by blebbistatin confirms this conclusion, because it diminishes cell shape changes and hydrodynamic flow, but does not abolish polar body formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TABMnyJYzl0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Patterning the insect eye: From stochastic to deterministic mechanisms</title>

While most processes in biology are highly deterministic, stochastic mechanisms are sometimes used to increase cellular diversity. In human and Drosophila eyes, photoreceptors sensitive to different wavelengths of light are distributed in stochastic patterns, and one such patterning system has been analyzed in detail in the Drosophila retina. Interestingly, some species in the dipteran family Dolichopodidae (the “long legged” flies, or “Doli”) instead exhibit highly orderly deterministic eye patterns. In these species, alternating columns of ommatidia (unit eyes) produce corneal lenses of different colors. Occasional perturbations in some individuals disrupt the regular columns in a way that suggests that patterning occurs via a posterior-to-anterior signaling relay during development, and that specification follows a local, cellular-automaton-like rule. We hypothesize that the regulatory mechanisms that pattern the eye are largely conserved among flies and that the difference between unordered Drosophila and ordered dolichopodid eyes can be explained in terms of relative strengths of signaling interactions rather than a rewiring of the regulatory network itself. We present a simple stochastic model that is capable of explaining both the stochastic Drosophila eye and the striped pattern of Dolichopodidae eyes and thereby characterize the least number of underlying developmental rules necessary to produce both stochastic and deterministic patterns. We show that only small changes to model parameters are needed to also reproduce intermediate, semi-random patterns observed in another Doli species, and quantification of ommatidial distributions in these eyes suggests that their patterning follows similar rules.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WfAj38t5J5A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Neural evidences of hierarchical cognitive control during haptic processing: an fMRI study</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Interacting with our immediate surroundings requires constant manipulation of objects. Dexterous manipulation depends on comparison between actual and predicted sensory input, with these predictions calculated by means of lower- and higher-order corollary discharge signals. However, there is still scarce knowledge about the hierarchy in the neural architecture supporting haptic monitoring during manipulation. The present study aimed to assess this issue focusing on the cross-talk between lower-order sensory and higher-order associative regions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans during a haptic discrimination task in which participants had to judge whether a touched shape or texture corresponded to an expected stimulus whose name was previously presented. Specialized haptic regions identified with an independent localizer task did not differ between expected and unexpected conditions, suggesting their lack of involvement in tactile monitoring. When presented stimuli did not match previous expectations, the left supramarginal gyrus, middle temporal, and medial prefrontal cortices were activated regardless of the nature of the haptic mismatch (shape/texture). The left SI responded differently to unexpected shapes and textures in line with a specialized detection of haptic mismatch. Importantly, connectivity analyses revealed that the left supramarginal gyrus and SI were more functionally coupled during unexpected trials, emphasizing their interaction. The results point for the first time to a hierarchical organization in the neural substrates underlying haptic monitoring during manipulation with the supramarginal gyrus as a higher-order hub comparing actual and predicted somatosensory input, and SI as a lower-order site involved in the detection of more specialized haptic mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The findings in the present study have important implications for the understanding of the neural architecture that supports haptic monitoring during manipulation. The results point, for the first time, to a hierarchical organization in the neural substrates underlying haptic monitoring during manipulation. In this hierarchy, the supramarginal gyrus is positioned as a higher-order region comparing predicted and actual somatosensory input, and SI as a lower-order site involved in the detection of more specialized haptic mismatches. The increased functional connectivity between the supramarginal gyrus and SI during the processing of unexpected stimuli emphasizes the cross-talk between lower-order sensory and higher-order associative regions during manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Maternal immune activation (MIA) has been identified as a causal factor in psychiatric disorders by epidemiological studies in humans and mechanistic studies in rodent models. Addressing this gap in species between mice and human will accelerate the understanding of the role of MIA in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Here, we provide the first study of MIA in the ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;), an animal model with a rich history of developmental investigations due to the similarities in developmental programs and cortical organization with primates. We found that after MIA by injection of PolyIC in the pregnant mother animal, the adult offspring exhibited reduced social behavior, less eye contact with humans, decreased recognition memory, a sex-specific increase in amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, and altered gut microbiome. We also studied the neurophysiological properties of the MIA ferrets in development by &lt;i&gt;in-vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings of the local field potential (LFP) from visual cortex in five- to six-week-old animals, and found that the spontaneous and sensory-evoked LFP had decreased power, especially in the gamma frequency band. Overall, our results provide the first evidence for the detrimental effect of MIA in ferrets and support the use of the ferret as an intermediate model species for the study of disorders with neurodevelopmental origin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Microglia Enhance Synapse Activity to Promote Local Network Synchronization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0088-18.2018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are highly motile immunoreactive cells that play integral roles in the response to brain infection and damage, and in the progression of various neurological diseases. During development, microglia also help sculpt neural circuits, via both promoting synapse formation and by targeting specific synapses for elimination and phagocytosis. Microglia are also active surveyors of neural circuits in the mature, healthy brain, although the functional consequences of such microglia-neuron contacts under these conditions is unclear. Using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging of neurons and microglia in awake mice, we report here the functional consequences of microglia-synapse contacts. Direct contact between a microglial process and a single synapse results in a specific increase in the activity of that contacted synapse, and a corresponding increase in back-propagating action potentials along the parent dendrite. This increase in activity is not seen for microglia-synapse contacts when microglia are activated by chronic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. To probe how this microglia-synapse contact affects neural circuits, we imaged across larger populations of motor cortical neurons. When microglia were again activated by LPS (or partially ablated), there was a decrease in the extent to which neuronal activity was synchronized. Together, our results demonstrate that interactions between physiological or resting microglia and synapses in the mature, healthy brain leads to an increase in neuronal activity and thereby helps to synchronize local populations of neurons. Our novel findings provide a plausible physical basis for understanding how alterations in immune status may impact on neural circuit plasticity and on cognitive behaviors such as learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Targeted degradation of BRD9 reverses oncogenic gene expression in synovial sarcoma</title>

	<description>Synovial sarcoma tumours contain a characteristic fusion protein, SS18-SSX, which drives disease development. Targeting oncogenic fusion proteins presents an attractive therapeutic opportunity. However, SS18-SSX has proven intractable for therapeutic intervention. Using a domain-focused CRISPR screen we identified the bromodomain of BRD9 as a critical functional dependency in synovial sarcoma. BRD9 is a component of SS18-SSX containing BAF complexes in synovial sarcoma cells; and integration of BRD9 into these complexes is critical for cell growth. Moreover BRD9 and SS18-SSX co-localize extensively on the synovial sarcoma genome. Remarkably, synovial sarcoma cells are highly sensitive to a novel small molecule degrader of BRD9, while other sarcoma subtypes are unaffected. Degradation of BRD9 induces downregulation of oncogenic transcriptional programs and inhibits tumour progression &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We demonstrate that BRD9 supports oncogenic mechanisms underlying the SS18-SSX fusion in synovial sarcoma and highlight targeted degradation of BRD9 as a potential therapeutic opportunity in this disease.</description>

	<description>Ponce-Alvarez et al. show that zebrafish larvae generate spontaneous neuronal avalanches across the entire brain. These collective cascading events exhibit scale invariance, typical of critical phenomena (e.g., earthquakes, paper crumpling). The brain’s critical dynamics are modulated during interactions with the environment.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Decreased Inter Trial Phase Coherence of Steady-State Visual Evoked Responses in Sleep Deprivation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/471730v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Sleep loss has detrimental effects on cognitive and emotional functioning. These impairments have been associated with alterations in EEG measures of power spectrum and event-related potentials, however the impact of sleep loss on inter trial phase coherence (ITPC), a measure of phase consistency over experimental trials, remains mostly unknown. ITPC is thought to reflect the ability of the neural response to temporally synchronize with relevant events, thus optimizing information processing. In the current study we investigated the effects of sleep deprivation (SD) on information processing by evaluating the phase consistency of steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) obtained from a group of 18 healthy individuals following 24 hours of total SD and after a night of habitual sleep. An ssVEP task was utilized, which included the presentation of dots flickering at 7.5 Hz, along with a cognitive-emotional task. Our results show that ITPC is significantly reduced under SD relative to habitual sleep. Interestingly, the decrease in ITPC was accompanied by a decrease in behavioral performance in the ssVEP cognitive-emotional task, and the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) in the majority of our participants. The results suggest that the capability of the brain to synchronize with rhythmic stimuli is disrupted in SD. Thus, decreased ITPC may represent an objective and mechanistic measure of SD, allowing future work to study the relation between brain-world synchrony and the specific functional impairments associated with SD.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Representation of music genres based on the spectro-temporal modulation responses of the human brain</title>

	<description>Music genre is an essential category for understanding human musical preferences and is provided based on the abstract categorization upon complex auditory stimuli. Previous neuroimaging studies have reported the involvement of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in response to general music-related features. However, it remains largely unclear how abstract categories of music genre are represented in the brain and what acoustic features are more suited for explaining such representations. Here we examined comprehensive cortical representations and functional organization of music genres using 540 music clips. We applied a voxel-wise modeling approach to music-evoked brain activity measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We observed distinct cortical organizations for different music genres in the bilateral STG, which revealed the representational relationship between various music genres, e.g., classical and hip-hop music showed opposite representations. Representations of music genres were largely explained by spectro-temporal modulation, which was modeled by a biologically plausible spectro-temporal modulation-transfer function (MTF) model. Our results elucidate the quantitative representation of music genres in the human cortex and indicate the possibility of modeling our abstract categorization of complex auditory stimuli based on the brain activity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Reward Modulates Local Field Potentials, Spiking Activity and Spike-Field Coherence in the Primary Motor Cortex</title>

	<description>Reward modulation of the primary motor cortex (M1) could be exploited in developing an autonomously updating brain-machine interface (BMI) based on a reinforcement learning architecture. In order to understand the multifaceted effects of reward on M1 activity, we investigated how neural spiking, oscillatory activities and their functional interactions are modulated by conditioned stimuli related reward expectation. To do so, local field potentials (LFPs) and single-unit/multi-unit activities were recorded simultaneously and bilaterally from M1 cortices while five non-human primates performed cued center-out reaching or grip force tasks either manually using their right arm/hand or observed passively. We found that reward expectation influenced the strength of alpha (8-14 Hz) power, alpha-gamma comodulation, alpha spike-field coherence, and firing rates in general in M1. Furthermore, we found that an increase in alpha-band power was correlated with a decrease in neural spiking activity, that firing rates were highest at the trough of the alpha-band cycle and lowest at the peak of its cycle. These findings imply that alpha oscillations modulated by reward expectation have an influence on spike firing rate and spike timing during both reaching and grasping tasks in M1. These LFP, spike, and spike-field interactions could be used to follow the M1 neural state in order to enhance BMI decoding (An et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018).</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Ethanol Experience Enhances Glutamatergic Ventral Hippocampal Inputs To D1 Receptor-Expressing Medium Spiny Neurons In The Nucleus Accumbens Shell</title>

	<description>Nucleus accumbens dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) have been implicated in the formation of dependence to many drugs of abuse including alcohol. Previous studies have revealed that acute alcohol exposure suppresses glutamatergic signaling within the accumbens and repeated alcohol exposure enhances glutamatergic signaling. D1-MSNs receive glutamatergic input from several brain regions and it is not currently known how individual inputs onto D1-MSNs are altered by alcohol experience. To Address this, we used virally mediated expression of Channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in ventral hippocampal (vHipp) glutamate neurons to selectively activate vHipp to D1-MSN synapses and compared synaptic adaptations in response to low and high alcohol experience in vitro and in vivo. Alcohol experience enhanced glutamatergic activity and abolished long-term depression (LTD) at ventral hippocampal (vHipp) to D1-MSN synapses. Following chronic alcohol experience GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors, which are Ca-permeable, were inserted into vHipp to D1-MSN synapses. These alcohol-induced adaptations of glutamatergic signaling occurred at lower levels of exposure than previously reported. The loss of LTD expression and enhancement in glutamatergic signaling from the vHipp to D1-MSNs in the nucleus accumbens may play a critical role in the formation of alcohol dependence and enhancements in ethanol consumption. Reversal of alcohol-induced insertion of Ca-permeable AMPA receptors and enhancement of glutamatergic activity at vHipp to D1-MSNs presents potential targets for intervention during early exposure to alcohol.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Augmenting cognitive load during split-belt walking increases the generalization of motor memories across walking contexts</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/470930v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Cognitive load plays a role on the movement recalibration induced by sensorimotor adaptation, but little is known about its impact on the generalization of movements from trained to untrained situations. We hypothesized that altering cognitive load by distracting subjects during sensorimotor adaptation would facilitate the generalization of recalibrated movements beyond the training condition. We reasoned that awareness of the novel condition inducing adaptation could be used to consciously contextualize movements to that particular situation. To test this hypothesis, young adults adapted their gait on a split-belt treadmill (moving their legs at different speeds) while they observed visual information that either distracted them or made them aware of the speed difference between their feet. We assessed the adaptation and aftereffects of spatial and temporal gait features known to adapt and generalize differently when walking on the treadmill or overground. We found similar adaptation and aftereffects on the treadmill across all groups. In contrast, both groups with altered cognitive load (i.e., distraction and awareness groups) generalized their movements from the treadmill to overground more than controls, who walked without altered cognitive load. Of note, this effect was only observed in temporal gait features, which are less susceptible to online motor adjustments, and were eliminated upon experiencing large errors by briefly removing the split perturbation during adaptation (i.e., catch trial). Taken together, increasing cognitive demands during sensorimotor adaptation facilitates the generalization of movement recalibration, but this cognitive-mediated effect cannot eliminate the specificity of actions due to context-specific errors.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neural distinctiveness declines with age in auditory cortex and is associated with auditory GABA levels.</title>

	<description>Neural activation patterns in the ventral visual cortex in response to different categories of visual stimuli (e.g., faces vs. houses) are less selective, or distinctive, in older adults than in younger adults, a phenomenon known as age-related neural dedifferentiation. Previous work in animals suggests that age-related reductions of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), may play a role in this age-related decline in neural distinctiveness. In this study, we investigated whether neural dedifferentiation extends to auditory cortex and whether individual differences in GABA are associated with individual differences in neural distinctiveness in humans. 20 healthy young adults (ages 18-29) and 23 healthy older adults (over 65) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan, during which neural activity was estimated while they listened to foreign speech and music. GABA levels in the auditory, ventrovisual and sensorimotor cortex were estimated in the same individuals in a separate magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) scan. Relative to the younger adults, the older adults exhibited both (1) less distinct activation patterns for music vs. speech stimuli and (2) lower GABA levels in the auditory cortex. Also, individual differences in auditory GABA levels (but not ventrovisual or sensorimotor GABA levels) predicted individual differences in neural distinctiveness in the auditory cortex in the older adults. These results demonstrate that age-related neural dedifferentiation extends to the auditory cortex and suggest that declining GABA levels may play a role in neural dedifferentiation in older adults.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Optogenetic vision restoration with high resolution</title>

	<description>The majority of inherited retinal degenerations are due to photoreceptor cell death. In many cases ganglion cells are spared making it possible to stimulate them to restore visual function. Several studies (Bi et al., 2006; Lin et al., 2008; Sengupta et al., 2016; Caporale et al., 2011; Berry et al., 2017) have shown that it is possible to express an optogenetic protein in ganglion cells and make them light sensitive. This is a promising strategy to restore vision since optical targeting may be more precise than electrical stimulation with a retinal prothesis. However the spatial resolution of optogenetically-reactivated retinas has not been measured with fine-grained stimulation patterns. Since the optogenetic protein is also expressed in axons, it is unclear if these neurons will only be sensitive to the stimulation of a small region covering their somas and dendrites, or if they will also respond to any stimulation overlapping with their axon, dramatically impairing spatial resolution. Here we recorded responses of mouse and macaque retinas to random checkerboard patterns following an in vivo optogenetic therapy. We show that optogenetically activated ganglion cells are each sensitive to a small region of visual space. A simple model based on this small receptive field predicted accurately their responses to complex stimuli. From this model, we simulated how the entire population of light sensitive ganglion cells would respond to letters of different sizes. We then estimated the maximal acuity expected by a patient, assuming it could make an optimal use of the information delivered by this reactivated retina. The obtained acuity is above the limit of legal blindness. This high spatial resolution is a promising result for future clinical studies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cortical network fingerprints predict deep brain stimulation outcome in dystonia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/470526v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/470526v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective evidence-based therapy for dystonia. However, no unequivocal predictors of therapy responses exist. We investigate whether patients optimally responding to DBS present distinct brain network organization and structural patterns. Methods: Based on a German multicentre cohort of eighty-two dystonia patients with segmental and generalized dystonia, who received DBS implantation in the globus pallidus internus patients were classified based on the clinical response 36 months after DBS, as superior-outcome group or moderate-outcome group, as above or below 70% motor improvement, respectively. Fifty-one patients met MRI-quality and treatment response requirements (mean age 51.3 {+/-} 13.2 years; 25 female) and were included into further analysis. From preoperative MRI we assessed cortical thickness and structural covariance, which were then fed into network analysis using graph theory. We designed a support vector machine to classify subjects for the clinical response based on group network properties and individual grey matter fingerprints. Results: The moderate-outcome group showed cortical atrophy mainly in the sensorimotor and visuomotor areas and disturbed network topology in these regions. From all the structural integrity of the cortical mantle explained about 45% of the stimulation amplitude. Classification analyses achieved 88% of accuracy using individual grey matter atrophy patterns to predict DBS outcome. Conclusions: The analysis of cortical integrity and network properties could be developed into independent predictors to identify dystonia patients who benefit from DBS.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Modular organization of the murine locomotor pattern in presence and absence of sensory feedback from muscle spindles</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/470492v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>For exploiting terrestrial and aquatic locomotion, vertebrates must build their locomotor patterns based on an enormous amount of variables. The great number of muscles and joints, together with the constant need for sensory feedback information (e.g. proprioception), make the task of creating and controlling movement a problem with overabundant degrees of freedom. It is widely accepted that the central nervous system might simplify the creation and control of movement. This could happen through the generation of activation patterns, which are common to many different muscles, rather than specific to individual muscles. These activation patterns, called muscle synergies, can be extracted from electromyographic data and describe the modular organization of movement. We extracted muscle synergies from the hindlimb muscle activities of wild type and genetically modified mice, in which sensory feedback from muscle spindles is eliminated. Muscle spindle-deficient mice underwent a modification of the temporal structure (motor primitives) of muscle synergies that resulted in diminished functionality during walking. In addition, both the temporal and spatial components (motor modules) of muscle synergies were severely affected when external perturbations were introduced of when animals were immersed in water. These findings show that group Ia/II sensory feedback from muscle spindles regulates motor function in normal and perturbed walking. Moreover, when group Ib Golgi tendon organ feedback is lacking due to the reduction of gravitational load in conditions of enhanced buoyancy, the modular organization of swimming is almost completely compromised.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Deep Residual Learning for Neuroimaging: An application to Predict Progression to Alzheimer\'s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/470252v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/470252v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>This work investigates the suitability of deep residual neural networks (ResNets) for studying neuroimaging data in the specific application of predicting progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We focus on predicting the subset of MCI individuals that would progress to AD within three years (progressive MCI) and the subset of MCI individuals that do not progress to AD within this period (stable MCI). This prediction was conducted first as a standard binary classification task by training a ResNet architecture using MCI individuals only, followed by a modified domain transfer learning version that additionally trained on the AD and cognitively normal (CN) individuals. For this modified inter-MCI classification task, the ResNet architecture achieved better than state-of-the-art performance in predicting progression to AD using structural MRI data alone (&amp;gt; 7% than the second best performing method), within 1% of the state-of-the-art performance considering learning using multiple structural modalities as well, and a significant performance improvement over the classical support vector machine learning framework (p = 2.5762 x 10-8). The learnt surrogate (i.e. cross-validation-fold-specific) models and the final predictive model (trained on all data) in this modified classification task showed highly similar peak activations, significant correspondence of which in the medial temporal lobe and other areas could be established with previous reports in AD literature, thus further validating our findings. Our results highlight the possibility of early identification of modifiable risk factors for understanding progression to AD using similar advanced deep learning architectures.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Predictiveness and Reward Effects on Attention can be Explained by a Single Mechanism</title>

	<description>In order to learn efficiently, organisms must learn how to distribute their attention to the available cues. Traditionally, most experiments on attention learning have involved discrete outcomes (e.g. no food vs. one food pellet, or category A vs. category B). A basic finding is that cues receive attention in proportion to how well they predict such outcomes. However, more recent research has shown an apparently independent effect of outcome value on attention (Le Pelley, Mitchell, &amp;amp; Johnson, 2013}, in which cues associated with large rewards receive more attention than those associated with small rewards. It has been suggested that a separate derived attention mechanism - in which attention is based directly on association strength - is necessary to explain this result (Le Pelley, Mitchell, Beesley, George, &amp;amp; Wills, 2016). As our primary experimental contribution, we use modified versions of this design to replicate the value effect and show that it can be reversed by manipulating the rewards given for incorrect choices. Our simulations show that CompAct - a model in which cues compete for attention on the basis of their relative predictiveness - can account for both of our empirical results. The derived attention theory, in contrast, incorrectly predicts that cues associated with large rewards will always receive more attention. We conclude that we do not need separate mechanisms to account for predictiveness effects and value effects on attention.</description>

	<description>Parkinsons disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease that presents with significant motor symptoms, for which there is no diagnostic test (1-3). We have serendipitously identified a hyperosmic individual, a Super Smeller that can detect PD by odor alone, and our early pilot studies have indicated that the odor was present in the sebum from the skin of PD subjects(4). Here, we have employed an unbiased approach to investigate the volatile metabolites of sebum samples obtained non-invasively from the upper back of 64 participants in total (21 controls and 43 PD subjects). Our results, validated by an independent cohort, identified a distinct volatiles-associated signature of PD, including altered levels of perillic aldehyde and eicosane, the smell of which was then described as being highly similar to the scent of PD by our Super Smeller.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Theta Bursts Precede, and Spindles Follow, Cortical and Thalamic Downstates in Human NREM Sleep</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9989?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since their discovery, slow oscillations have been observed to group spindles during non-REM sleep. Previous studies assert that the slow-oscillation downstate (DS) is preceded by slow spindles (10–12 Hz) and followed by fast spindles (12–16 Hz). Here, using both direct transcortical recordings in patients with intractable epilepsy (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 10, 8 female), as well as scalp EEG recordings from a healthy cohort (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3, 1 female), we find in multiple cortical areas that both slow and fast spindles follow the DS. Although discrete oscillations do precede DSs, they are theta bursts (TBs) centered at 5–8 Hz. TBs were more pronounced for DSs in NREM stage 2 (N2) sleep compared with N3. TB with similar properties occur in the thalamus, but unlike spindles they have no clear temporal relationship with cortical TB. These differences in corticothalamic dynamics, as well as differences between spindles and theta in coupling high-frequency content, are consistent with NREM theta having separate generative mechanisms from spindles. The final inhibitory cycle of the TB coincides with the DS peak, suggesting that in N2, TB may help trigger the DS. Since the transition to N1 is marked by the appearance of theta, and the transition to N2 by the appearance of DS and thus spindles, a role of TB in triggering DS could help explain the sequence of electrophysiological events characterizing sleep. Finally, the coordinated appearance of spindles and DSs are implicated in memory consolidation processes, and the current findings redefine their temporal coupling with theta during NREM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sleep is characterized by large slow waves which modulate brain activity. Prominent among these are downstates (DSs), periods of a few tenths of a second when most cells stop firing, and spindles, oscillations at ~12 times a second lasting for ~a second. In this study, we provide the first detailed description of another kind of sleep wave: theta bursts (TBs), a brief oscillation at ~six cycles per second. We show, recording during natural sleep directly from the human cortex and thalamus, as well as on the scalp, that TBs precede, and spindles follow DSs. TBs may help trigger DSs in some circumstances, and could organize cortical and thalamic activity so that memories can be consolidated during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ipsilesional Motor Cortex Plasticity Participates in Spontaneous Hindlimb Recovery after Lateral Hemisection of the Thoracic Spinal Cord in the Rat</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9977?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;After an incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) spontaneous motor recovery can occur in mammals, but the underlying neural substrates remain poorly understood. The motor cortex is crucial for skilled motor learning and the voluntary control of movement and is known to reorganize after cortical injury to promote recovery. Motor cortex plasticity has also been shown to parallel the recovery of forelimb function after cervical SCI, but whether cortical plasticity participates in hindlimb recovery after SCI remains unresolved. Using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) mapping, behavioral and cortical inactivation techniques in the female Long–Evans rat, we evaluated the spontaneous cortical mechanisms of hindlimb motor recovery 1–5 weeks after lateral hemisection of the thoracic (T8) spinal cord that ablated the crossed corticospinal tract (CST) from the contralesional motor cortex while sparing the majority of the CST from the ipsilesional motor cortex. Hemisection initially impaired hindlimb motor function bilaterally but significant recovery occurred during the first 3 weeks. ICMS revealed time-dependent changes in motor cortex organization, characterized by a chronic abolishment of hindlimb motor representation in the contralesional motor cortex and the development of transient bilateral hindlimb representation in the ipsilesional motor cortex 3 weeks after hemisection, when significant behavioral recovery occurred. Consistently, reversible inactivation of the ipsilesional, but not the contralesional motor cortex, during skilled ladder walking 3 weeks after hemisection reinstated deficits in both hindlimbs. These findings indicate that the ipsilesional motor cortex transiently reorganizes after lateral hemisection of the thoracic spinal cord to support recovery of hindlimb motor function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Partial motor recovery can occur after an incomplete spinal cord injury and is hypothesized to result from the reorganization of spared descending motor pathways. The motor cortex is crucial for the control of voluntary movement and contains topographical movement representations (motor maps) that are highly plastic. We examined the organization of hindlimb motor maps bilaterally after a lateral hemisection of the spinal cord to show that while motor maps are abolished in the deefferented cortex, the spared ipsilesional cortex transiently reorganizes to gain a representation of the affected hindlimb after injury that relates to recovery. This finding demonstrates that plasticity in the ipsilesional motor cortex at early time points after spinal cord hemisection is initially important to support motor recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Opposite Dynamics of GABA and Glutamate Levels in the Occipital Cortex during Visual Processing</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures the two most common inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters, GABA and glutamate, in the human brain. However, the role of MRS-derived GABA and glutamate signals in relation to system-level neural signaling and behavior is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated levels of GABA and glutamate in the visual cortex of healthy human participants (both genders) in three functional states with increasing visual input. Compared with a baseline state of eyes closed, GABA levels decreased after opening the eyes in darkness and Glx levels remained stable during eyes open but increased with visual stimulation. In relevant states, GABA and Glx correlated with amplitude of fMRI signal fluctuations. Furthermore, visual discriminatory performance correlated with the level of GABA, but not Glx. Our study suggests that differences in brain states can be detected through the contrasting dynamics of GABA and Glx, which has implications in interpreting MRS measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; GABA and glutamate are the two most abundant neurotransmitters in human brain. Their interaction, known as inhibitory-excitatory balance, plays a crucial role in establishing spontaneous and stimulus-driven brain activity. Yet, the relationship between magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-derived levels of both metabolites and fMRI is still a matter of dispute. In this work, we study GABA and glutamate in three states of visual processing and in relation to fMRI and visual discriminatory performance in healthy people. We found that states of visual processing can be detected through the contrasting dynamics of GABA and glutamate and their correlation with fMRI signals. We also demonstrated that GABA, but not glutamate, in the visual system predicts visual performance. Our results provide insights into MRS-derived GABA and glutamate measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Implicit Memory for Complex Sounds in Higher Auditory Cortex of the Ferret</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9955?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9955?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Responses of auditory cortical neurons encode sound features of incoming acoustic stimuli and also are shaped by stimulus context and history. Previous studies of mammalian auditory cortex have reported a variable time course for such contextual effects ranging from milliseconds to minutes. However, in secondary auditory forebrain areas of songbirds, long-term stimulus-specific neuronal habituation to acoustic stimuli can persist for much longer periods of time, ranging from hours to days. Such long-term habituation in the songbird is a form of long-term auditory memory that requires gene expression. Although such long-term habituation has been demonstrated in avian auditory forebrain, this phenomenon has not previously been described in the mammalian auditory system. Utilizing a similar version of the avian habituation paradigm, we explored whether such long-term effects of stimulus history also occur in auditory cortex of a mammalian auditory generalist, the ferret. Following repetitive presentation of novel complex sounds, we observed significant response habituation in secondary auditory cortex, but not in primary auditory cortex. This long-term habituation appeared to be independent for each novel stimulus and often lasted for at least 20 min. These effects could not be explained by simple neuronal fatigue in the auditory pathway, because time-reversed sounds induced undiminished responses similar to those elicited by completely novel sounds. A parallel set of pupillometric response measurements in the ferret revealed long-term habituation effects similar to observed long-term neural habituation, supporting the hypothesis that habituation to passively presented stimuli is correlated with implicit learning and long-term recognition of familiar sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Long-term habituation in higher areas of songbird auditory forebrain is associated with gene expression and is correlated with recognition memory. Similar long-term auditory habituation in mammals has not been previously described. We studied such habituation in single neurons in the auditory cortex of awake ferrets that were passively listening to repeated presentations of various complex sounds. Responses exhibited long-lasting habituation (at least 20 min) in the secondary, but not primary auditory cortex. Habituation ceased when stimuli were played backward, despite having identical spectral content to the original sound. This long-term neural habituation correlated with similar habituation of ferret pupillary responses to repeated presentations of the same stimuli, suggesting that stimulus habituation is retained as a long-term behavioral memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Dual Noradrenergic Mechanism for the Relief of Neuropathic Allodynia by the Antidepressant Drugs Duloxetine and Amitriptyline</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9934?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to treating depression, antidepressant drugs are also a first-line treatment for neuropathic pain, which is pain secondary to lesion or pathology of the nervous system. Despite the widespread use of these drugs, the mechanism underlying their therapeutic action in this pain context remains partly elusive. The present study combined data collected in male and female mice from a model of neuropathic pain and data from the clinical setting to understand how antidepressant drugs act. We show two distinct mechanisms by which the selective inhibitor of serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake duloxetine and the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline relieve neuropathic allodynia. One of these mechanisms is acute, central, and requires descending noradrenergic inhibitory controls and α&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; adrenoceptors, as well as the mu and delta opioid receptors. The second mechanism is delayed, peripheral, and requires noradrenaline from peripheral sympathetic endings and β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adrenoceptors, as well as the delta opioid receptors. We then conducted a transcriptomic analysis in dorsal root ganglia, which suggested that the peripheral component of duloxetine action involves the inhibition of neuroimmune mechanisms accompanying nerve injury, including the downregulation of the TNF-α–NF-B signaling pathway. Accordingly, immunotherapies against either TNF-α or Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) provided allodynia relief. We also compared duloxetine plasma levels in the animal model and in patients and we observed that patients' drug concentrations were compatible with those measured in animals under chronic treatment involving the peripheral mechanism. Our study highlights a peripheral neuroimmune component of antidepressant drugs that is relevant to their delayed therapeutic action against neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In addition to treating depression, antidepressant drugs are also a first-line treatment for neuropathic pain, which is pain secondary to lesion or pathology of the nervous system. However, the mechanism by which antidepressant drugs can relieve neuropathic pain remained in part elusive. Indeed, preclinical studies led to contradictions concerning the anatomical and molecular substrates of this action. In the present work, we overcame these apparent contradictions by highlighting the existence of two independent mechanisms. One is rapid and centrally mediated by descending controls from the brain to the spinal cord and the other is delayed, peripheral, and relies on the anti-neuroimmune action of chronic antidepressant treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nucleus Reuniens Is Required for Encoding and Retrieving Precise, Hippocampal-Dependent Contextual Fear Memories in Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9925?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The nucleus reuniens (RE) is a ventral midline thalamic nucleus that interconnects the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HPC). Considerable data indicate that HPC–mPFC circuits are involved in contextual and spatial memory; however, it is not clear whether the RE mediates the acquisition or retrieval of these memories. To examine this question, we inactivated the RE with muscimol before either the acquisition or retrieval of pavlovian fear conditioning in rats; freezing served as the index of fear. We found that RE inactivation before conditioning impaired the acquisition of contextual freezing, whereas inactivation of the RE before retrieval testing increased the generalization of freezing to a novel context; inactivation of the RE did not affect either the acquisition or expression of auditory fear conditioning. Interestingly, contextual conditioning impairments were absent when retrieval testing was also conducted after RE inactivation. Contextual memories acquired under RE inactivation were hippocampal independent, insofar as contextual freezing in rats conditioned under RE inactivation was insensitive to intrahippocampal infusions of the NMDA receptor antagonist aminophosphonovalerate. Together, these data reveal that the RE supports hippocampal-dependent encoding of precise contextual memories that allow discrimination of dangerous contexts from safe contexts. When the RE is inactive, however, alternate neural systems acquire an impoverished contextual memory that is expressed only when the RE is off-line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The midline thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) coordinates communication between the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, brain areas that are critical for contextual and spatial memory. Here we show that temporary pharmacological inactivation of RE impairs the acquisition and precision of contextual fear memories after pavlovian fear conditioning in rats. However, inactivating the RE before retrieval testing restored contextual memory in rats conditioned after RE inactivation. Critically, we show that imprecise contextual memories acquired under RE inactivation are learned independently of the hippocampus. These data reveal that the RE is required for hippocampal-dependent encoding of precise contextual memories to support the discrimination of safe and dangerous contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Classifiers with Limited Connectivity and Recurrent Readouts</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9900?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9900?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;For many neural network models in which neurons are trained to classify inputs like perceptrons, the number of inputs that can be classified is limited by the connectivity of each neuron, even when the total number of neurons is very large. This poses the problem of how the biological brain can take advantage of its huge number of neurons given that the connectivity is sparse. One solution is to combine multiple perceptrons together, as in committee machines. The number of classifiable random patterns would then grow linearly with the number of perceptrons, even when each perceptron has limited connectivity. However, the problem is moved to the downstream readout neurons, which would need a number of connections as large as the number of perceptrons. Here we propose a different approach in which the readout is implemented by connecting multiple perceptrons in a recurrent attractor neural network. We prove analytically that the number of classifiable random patterns can grow unboundedly with the number of perceptrons, even when the connectivity of each perceptron remains finite. Most importantly, both the recurrent connectivity and the connectivity of downstream readouts also remain finite. Our study shows that feedforward neural classifiers with numerous long-range afferent connections can be replaced by recurrent networks with sparse long-range connectivity without sacrificing the classification performance. Our strategy could be used to design more general scalable network architectures with limited connectivity, which resemble more closely the brain neural circuits that are dominated by recurrent connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mammalian brain has a huge number of neurons, but the connectivity is rather sparse. This observation seems to contrast with the theoretical studies showing that for many neural network models the performance scales with the number of connections per neuron and not with the total number of neurons. To solve this dilemma, we propose a model in which a recurrent network reads out multiple neural classifiers. Its performance scales with the total number of neurons even when each neuron of the network has limited connectivity. Our study reveals an important role of recurrent connections in neural systems like the hippocampus, in which the computational limitations due to sparse long-range feedforward connectivity might be compensated by local recurrent connections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: MBD1 Contributes to the Genesis of Acute Pain and Neuropathic Pain by Epigenetic Silencing of Oprm1 and Kcna2 Genes in Primary Sensory Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The transmission of normal sensory and/or acute noxious information requires intact expression of pain-associated genes within the pain pathways of nervous system. Expressional changes of these genes after peripheral nerve injury are also critical for neuropathic pain induction and maintenance. Methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 1 (MBD1), an epigenetic repressor, regulates gene transcriptional activity. We report here that MBD1 in the primary sensory neurons of DRG is critical for the genesis of acute pain and neuropathic pain as DRG MBD1-deficient mice exhibit the reduced responses to acute mechanical, heat, cold, and capsaicin stimuli and the blunted nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivities. Furthermore, DRG overexpression of MBD1 leads to spontaneous pain and evoked pain hypersensitivities in the WT mice and restores acute pain sensitivities in the MBD1-deficient mice. Mechanistically, MDB1 represses &lt;i&gt;Oprm1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kcna2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression by recruiting DNA methyltransferase DNMT3a into these two gene promoters in the DRG neurons. DRG MBD1 is likely a key player under the conditions of acute pain and neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the present study, we revealed that the mice with deficiency of methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 1 (MBD1), an epigenetic repressor, in the DRG displayed the reduced responses to acute noxious stimuli and the blunted neuropathic pain. We also showed that DRG overexpression of MBD1 produced the hypersensitivities to noxious stimuli in the WT mice and rescued acute pain sensitivities in the MBD1-deficient mice. We have also provided the evidence that MDB1 represses &lt;i&gt;Oprm1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kcna2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression by recruiting DNA methyltransferase DNMT3a into these two gene promoters in the DRG neurons. DRG MBD1 may participate in the genesis of acute pain and neuropathic pain likely through regulating DNMT3a-controlled &lt;i&gt;Oprm1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kcna2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression in the DRG neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Pool of Postnatally Generated Interneurons Persists in an Immature Stage in the Olfactory Bulb</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Calretinin (CR)-expressing periglomerular (PG) cells are the most abundant interneurons in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb. They are predominately generated postnatally from the septal and dorsal subventricular zones that continue producing them well into adulthood. Yet, little is known about their properties and functions. Using transgenic approaches and patch-clamp recording in mice of both sexes we show that CR(+) PG cells of both septal and dorsal origin have homogeneous morphological and electrophysiological properties. However, unlike other PG cells, these axonless neurons express a surprisingly small repertoire of voltage-activated channels and do not fire or fire at most a single and often small action potential. Moreover, they are not innervated by olfactory sensory neurons and receive little synaptic inputs from mitral or tufted cells at excitatory synapses where NMDA receptors predominate. These membrane and synaptic properties, that resemble those of newborn immature neurons not yet integrated in the network, persist over time and limit the recruitment of CR(+) PG cells by afferent inputs that strongly drive local network activity. Together, our results show that postnatally generated CR(+) PG cells continuously supply a large pool of neurons with unconventional properties. These data also question the contribution of CR(+) PG cells in olfactory bulb computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Calretinin-expressing PG cells are by far the most abundant interneurons in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb. They are continuously produced during postnatal life, including adulthood, from neural stem cells located in the subventricular zones. Surprisingly, unlike other postnatally generated newborn neurons that quickly integrate into preexisting olfactory bulb networks, calretinin-expressing PG cells retain immature properties that limit their recruitment in local network activity for weeks, if not months, as if they would never fully mature. The function of this so far unsuspected pool of latent neurons is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dynamics and Functional Role of Dopaminergic Neurons in the Ventral Tegmental Area during Itch Processing</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Itchiness triggers a strong urge to engage in scratching behavior, which could lead to severe skin or tissue damage in patients with chronic itch. This process is dynamically modulated. However, the neural mechanisms underlying itch modulation remain largely unknown. Here, we report that dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play a critical role in modulating itch-induced scratching behavior. We found that the activity of VTA DA neurons was increased during pruritogen-induced scratching behavior in freely moving male mice. Consistently, individual VTA DA neurons mainly exhibited elevated neural activity during itch-induced scratching behavior as demonstrated by &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; extracellular recording. In behavioral experiments, the transient suppression of VTA DA neurons with the optogenetic approach shortened the pruritogen-induced scratching train. Furthermore, the DA projection from the VTA to the lateral shell of the nucleus accumbens exhibited strong activation as measured with fiber photometry during itch-elicited scratching behavior. These results revealed the dynamic activity of VTA DA neurons during itch processing and demonstrated the modulatory role of the DA system in itch-induced scratching behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Itchiness is an unpleasant sensation that evokes a scratching response for relief. However, the neural mechanism underlying the modulation of itch-evoked scratching in the brain remains elusive. Here, by combining fiber photometry, extracellular recording, and optogenetic manipulation, we show that the dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area play a modulatory role in itch-evoked scratching behavior. These results reveal a potential target for suppressing excessive scratching responses in patients with chronic itch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A recently reported rapid potentiation of NMDA receptors by Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRIs) via a Homer protein link is distinct from the classical, relatively slow inhibitory G-protein-associated signaling triggered by mGluRI activation. The relationship between these two mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we focused on the mGluRI-dependent modulation of NMDAR response in hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells and cerebellar granule cells of C57BL6-J mice and found that these two contrasting mechanisms overlap competitively on the time scale from hundreds of milliseconds to seconds, with the net effect depending on the cell type. At a shorter time interval (units of millisecond), the Homer-mediated signal from mGluRIs prevails, causing upregulation of NMDAR function, in both dentate gyrus granule cells and cerebellar granule cells. Our results shed light on the possible mechanisms of anti-schizophrenia drugs that disrupt Homer-containing protein link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we study modulation of NMDA receptors triggered by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors Group I via two distinct pathways: classical G-protein signaling system and newly discovered high-speed modulatory mechanism associated with Homer-protein-containing direct molecular link. We found that these two contrasting mechanisms overlap competitively on the time scale from hundreds of milliseconds to seconds, with the net effect depending on the cell type. We have also found that both crosstalk mechanisms cause significant changes in synaptic strength and plasticity. Our results resolve an apparent discrepancy between earlier studies that demonstrated contradictive effects of Homer-containing protein link disruption on NMDA receptor signaling. On top of that, our data provide a plausible explanation for unclear action mechanisms of anti-schizophrenia drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Interactive Repression of MYRF Self-Cleavage and Activity in Oligodendrocyte Differentiation by TMEM98 Protein</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Myelin sheath formed by oligodendrocytes (OLs) is essential for the rapid propagation of action potentials in the vertebrate CNS. Myelin regulatory factor (MYRF) is one of the critical factors that control OL differentiation and myelin maintenance. Previous studies showed that MYRF is a membrane-bound transcription factor associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). After self-cleavage, the N-fragment of MYRF is released from the ER and translocated into the nucleus where it functions as a transcription factor to activate myelin gene expression. At present, it remains unknown whether MYRF self-cleavage and functional activation can be regulated during OL differentiation. Here, we report that TMEM98, an ER-associated transmembrane protein, is capable of binding to the C-terminal of MYRF and inhibiting its self-cleavage and N-fragment nuclear translocation. In the developing CNS, TMEM98 is selectively expressed in early maturing OLs in mouse pups of either sex. Forced expression of TMEM98 in embryonic chicken spinal cord of either sex suppresses endogenous OL differentiation and MYRF-induced ectopic expression of myelin genes. These results suggest that TMEM98, through inhibiting the self-cleavage of MYRF, functions as a negative feedback regulator of MYRF in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; MYRF protein is initially synthesized as an ER-associated membrane protein that undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage to release the N-fragment, which is then transported into the nucleus and activates the transcription of myelin genes. To date, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the self-cleavage and function of MYRF in regulating oligodendrocyte differentiation have remained unknown. In this study, we present the molecular and functional evidence that TMEM98 membrane protein physically interacts with MYRF in the ER and subsequently blocks its self-cleavage, N-terminal nuclear translocation, and functional activation of myelin gene expression. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the regulation of MYRF self-proteolytic activity and function by an interacting protein, providing new insights into the molecular regulation of OL differentiation and myelinogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Opposite Roles in Short-Term Plasticity for N-Type and P/Q-Type Voltage-Dependent Calcium Channels in GABAergic Neuronal Connections in the Rat Cerebral Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/9814?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurotransmitter release is triggered by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx through voltage-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (VDCCs). Distinct expression patterns of VDCC subtypes localized on the synaptic terminal affect intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics induced by action potential-triggered Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx. However, it has been unknown whether the expression pattern of VDCC subtypes depends on each axon terminal or neuronal subtype. Furthermore, little information is available on how these VDCC subtypes regulate the release probability of neurotransmitters. To address these questions, we performed multiple whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from GABAergic neurons in the insular cortex of either the male or the female rat. The paired-pulse ratio (PPR; 50 ms interstimulus interval) varied widely among inhibitory connections between GABAergic neurons. The PPR of unitary IPSCs was enhanced by -conotoxin GVIA (CgTx; 3 μm), an N-type VDCC blocker, whereas blockade of P/Q-type VDCCs by -agatoxin IVA (AgTx, 200 nm) decreased the PPR. In the presence of CgTx, application of 4 mm [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; or of roscovitine, a P/Q-type activator, increased the PPR. These results suggest that the recruitment of P/Q-type VDCCs increases the PPR, whereas N-type VDCCs suppress the PPR. Furthermore, we found that charybdotoxin or apamin, blockers of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels, with AgTx increased the PPR, suggesting that Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels are coupled to N-type VDCCs and suppress the PPR in GABAergic neuronal terminals. Variance–mean analysis with changing [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; showed a negative correlation between the PPR and release probability in GABAergic synapses. These results suggest that GABAergic neurons differentially express N-type and/or P/Q-type VDCCs and that these VDCCs regulate the GABA release probability in distinct manners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; GABAergic neuronal axons target multiple neurons and release GABA triggered by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx via voltage-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (VDCCs), including N-type and P/Q-type channels. Little is known about VDCC expression patterns in GABAergic synaptic terminals and their role in short-term plasticity. We focused on inhibitory synaptic connections between GABAergic neurons in the cerebral cortex using multiple whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and found different expression patterns of VDCCs in the synaptic terminals branched from a single presynaptic neuron. Furthermore, we observed facilitative and depressive short-term plasticity of IPSCs mediated by P/Q-type and N-type VDCCs, respectively. These results suggest that VDCC expression patterns regulate distinctive types of synaptic transmission in each GABAergic axon terminal even though they are branched from a common presynaptic neuron.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Differential Representation of Articulatory Gestures and Phonemes in Precentral and Inferior Frontal Gyri</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Speech is a critical form of human communication and is central to our daily lives. Yet, despite decades of study, an understanding of the fundamental neural control of speech production remains incomplete. Current theories model speech production as a hierarchy from sentences and phrases down to words, syllables, speech sounds (phonemes), and the actions of vocal tract articulators used to produce speech sounds (articulatory gestures). Here, we investigate the cortical representation of articulatory gestures and phonemes in ventral precentral and inferior frontal gyri in men and women. Our results indicate that ventral precentral cortex represents gestures to a greater extent than phonemes, while inferior frontal cortex represents both gestures and phonemes. These findings suggest that speech production shares a common cortical representation with that of other types of movement, such as arm and hand movements. This has important implications both for our understanding of speech production and for the design of brain–machine interfaces to restore communication to people who cannot speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite being studied for decades, the production of speech by the brain is not fully understood. In particular, the most elemental parts of speech, speech sounds (phonemes) and the movements of vocal tract articulators used to produce these sounds (articulatory gestures), have both been hypothesized to be encoded in motor cortex. Using direct cortical recordings, we found evidence that primary motor and premotor cortices represent gestures to a greater extent than phonemes. Inferior frontal cortex (part of Broca's area) appears to represent both gestures and phonemes. These findings suggest that speech production shares a similar cortical organizational structure with the movement of other body parts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Inhibitory Signaling to Ion Channels in Hippocampal Neurons Is Differentially Regulated by Alternative Macromolecular Complexes of RGS7</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/46/10002?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The neuromodulatory effects of GABA on pyramidal neurons are mediated by GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) that signal via a conserved G-protein-coupled pathway. Two prominent effectors regulated by GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs include G-protein inwardly rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (GIRK) and P/Q/N type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2) ion channels that control excitability and synaptic output of these neurons, respectively. Regulator of G-protein signaling 7 (RGS7) has been shown to control GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; effects, yet the specificity of its impacts on effector channels and underlying molecular mechanisms is poorly understood. In this study, we show that hippocampal RGS7 forms two distinct complexes with alternative subunit configuration bound to either membrane protein R7BP (RGS7 binding protein) or orphan receptor GPR158. Quantitative biochemical experiments show that both complexes account for targeting nearly the entire pool of RGS7 to the plasma membrane. We analyzed the effect of genetic elimination in mice of both sexes and overexpression of various components of RGS7 complex by patch-clamp electrophysiology in cultured neurons and brain slices. We report that RGS7 prominently regulates GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R signaling to Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2, in addition to its known involvement in modulating GIRK. Strikingly, only complexes containing R7BP, but not GPR158, accelerated the kinetics of both GIRK and Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2 modulation by GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs. In contrast, GPR158 overexpression exerted the opposite effect and inhibited RGS7-assisted temporal modulation of GIRK and Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2 by GABA. Collectively, our data reveal mechanisms by which distinctly composed macromolecular complexes modulate the activity of key ion channels that mediate the inhibitory effects of GABA on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study identifies the contributions of distinct macromolecular complexes containing a major G-protein regulator to controlling key ion channel function in hippocampal neurons with implications for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: High-Fidelity Imaging in Brain-Wide Structural Studies Using Light-Sheet Microscopy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0124-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Light-sheet microscopy (LSM) has proven a useful tool in neuroscience to image whole brains with high frame rates at cellular resolution, and, in combination with tissue clearing methods, is often employed to reconstruct the cyto-architecture over the intact mouse brain. Inherently to LSM, however, residual opaque objects, always present to some extent even in extremely well optically cleared samples, cause stripe artifacts, which, in the best case, severely affect image homogeneity and, in the worst case, completely obscure features of interest. Here, demonstrating two example applications in intact optically cleared mouse brains, we report how Bessel beams reduce streaking artifacts and produce high-fidelity structural data for the brain-wide morphology of neuronal and vascular networks. We found that a third of the imaged volume of the brain was affected by strong striated image intensity inhomogeneity and, furthermore, a significant amount of information content lost with Gaussian illumination was accessible when interrogated with Bessel beams. In conclusion, Bessel beams produce high-fidelity structural data of improved image homogeneity and might significantly relax demands placed on the automated tools to count, trace or segment fluorescent features of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The standard way to measure neuronal structure in light-sheet microscopy applies Gaussian beams, a method prone to artifacts introduced by residual opaque objects present even in extremely well optically cleared samples. These objects cause streaky shadows, which severely affect image homogeneity and, furthermore, obscure features of interest. In measurements using Bessel beam illumination, however, high-fidelity imaging of micro-anatomical detail is restored. Since whole mouse brain data sets now routinely comprise several terabytes, automated tools to count, trace or segment features of interest are needed to extract meaningful insights. This is why high-fidelity structural imaging has the potential to relax computational demands on the algorithms used to turn data into knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Homozygous splicing mutation in NUP133 causes Galloway–Mowat syndrome</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galloway–Mowat syndrome (GAMOS) is a neural and renal disorder, characterized by microcephaly, brain anomalies, and early‐onset nephrotic syndrome. Biallelic mutations in &lt;i&gt;WDR73&lt;/i&gt; and the four subunit genes of the KEOPS complex are reported to cause GAMOS. Furthermore, an identical homozygous &lt;i&gt;NUP107&lt;/i&gt; (nucleoporin 107 kDa) mutation was identified in four GAMOS‐like families, although biallelic &lt;i&gt;NUP107&lt;/i&gt; mutations were originally identified in steroid‐resistant nephrotic syndrome. NUP107 and NUP133 (nucleoporin 133 kDa) are interacting subunits of the nuclear pore complex in the nuclear envelope during interphase, and these proteins are also involved in centrosome positioning and spindle assembly during mitosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linkage analysis and whole exome sequencing were performed in a previously reported GAMOS family with brain atrophy and steroid‐resistant nephrotic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a homozygous &lt;i&gt;NUP133&lt;/i&gt; mutation, c.3335‐11T&amp;gt;A, which results in the insertion of 9 bp of intronic sequence between exons 25 and 26 in the mutant transcript. NUP133 and NUP107 interaction was impaired by the &lt;i&gt;NUP133&lt;/i&gt; mutation based on an immunoprecipitation assay. Importantly, focal cortical dysplasia type IIa was recognized in the brain of an autopsied patient and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was confirmed in the kidneys of the three examined patients. A &lt;i&gt;nup133&lt;/i&gt;‐knockdown zebrafish model exhibited microcephaly, fewer neuronal cells, underdeveloped glomeruli, and fusion of the foot processes of the podocytes, which mimicked human GAMOS features. &lt;i&gt;nup133&lt;/i&gt; morphants could be rescued by human wildtype &lt;i&gt;NUP133&lt;/i&gt; mRNA but not by mutant mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data indicate that the biallelic &lt;i&gt;NUP133&lt;/i&gt; loss‐of‐function mutation causes GAMOS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Relation between firing statistics of spiking neuron with delayed excitatory feedback and without feedback. (arXiv:1811.05403v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05403</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05403</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A class of spiking neuronal models with threshold 2 is considered. It is
defined by a set of conditions typical for basic threshold-type models, such as
the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) or the binding neuron model and also for
some artificial neurons. A neuron is stimulated with a Poisson stream of
excitatory impulses. Each output impulse is conveyed through the feedback line
to the neuron input after finite delay $\Delta$. This impulse is identical to
those delivered from the input stream. We have obtained a general relation
allowing calculating exactly the probability density function (pdf) $p(t)$ of
output interspike intervals (ISI) values for a neuron with feedback based on
known pdf $p^0(t)$ for the same neuron without feedback, intensity of the input
stream $\lambda$ and the properties of the feedback line. Also, we derive the
exact relation for calculating the moments of $p(t)$ based on known moments of
$p^0(t)$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obtained general expression for $p(t)$ is checked numerically using Monte
Carlo simulation for the case of LIF model. The course of $p(t)$ has a
$\delta$-function type peculiarity. This fact contributes to the discussion
about the possibility to model neuronal activity with Poisson process,
supporting the 'no' answer.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In neural networks with identical neurons, the matrix of connection weights
completely describes the network structure and thereby determines how it is
processing information. However, due to the non-linearity of these systems, it
is not clear if similar microscopic connection structures also imply similar
functional properties, or if a network is impacted more by macroscopic
structural quantities, such as the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory
connections (balance), or the ratio of non-zero connections (density). To
clarify these questions, we focus on motifs of three binary neurons with
discrete ternary connection strengths, an important class of network building
blocks that can be analyzed exhaustively. We develop new, permutation-invariant
metrics to quantify the structural and functional distance between two given
network motifs. We then use multidimensional scaling to identify and visualize
clusters of motifs with similar structural and functional properties. Our
comprehensive analysis reveals that the function of a neural network is only
weakly correlated with its microscopic structure, but depends strongly on the
balance of the connections.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Automated methods for Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification have the
potential for great clinical benefits and may provide insight for combating the
disease. Machine learning, and more specifically deep neural networks, have
been shown to have great efficacy in this domain. These algorithms often use
neurological imaging data such as MRI and PET, but a comprehensive and balanced
comparison of these modalities has not been performed. In order to accurately
determine the relative strength of each imaging variant, this work performs a
comparison study in the context of Alzheimer's dementia classification using
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Furthermore,
this work analyzes the benefits of using both modalities in a fusion setting
and discusses how these data types may be leveraged in future AD studies using
deep learning.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Electrophysiological indicators of gesture perception. (arXiv:1811.05058v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05058</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05058</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: While there has been abundant research concerning neurological
responses to gesture generation, the time course of gesture processing is not
well understood. Specifically, it is not clear if or how particular
characteristics within the kinematic execution of gestures capture attention
and aid in the classification of gestures with communicative intent. If indeed
key features of gestures with perceptual saliency exist, such features could
help form the basis of a compact representation of the gestures in memory.
Methods: This study used a set of available gesture videos as stimuli. The
timing for salient features of performed gestures was determined by isolating
inflection points in the hands' motion trajectories. Participants passively
viewed the gesture videos while continuous EEG data was collected. We focused
on mu oscillations (10 Hz) and used linear regression to test for associations
between the timing of mu oscillations and inflection points in motion
trajectories. Results: Peaks in the EEG signals at central and occipital
electrodes were used to isolate the salient events within each gesture. EEG
power oscillations were detected 343 and 400ms on average after inflection
points at occipital and central electrodes, respectively. A regression model
showed that inflection points in the motion trajectories strongly predicted
subsequent mu oscillations (R^2=0.961, p&amp;lt;.01). Conclusion: The results suggest
that coordinated activity in the visual and motor cortices are highly
correlated with key motion components within gesture trajectories. These points
may be associated with neural signatures used to encode gestures in memory for
later identification and even recognition.

	<description>Understanding the distribution patterns of antibiotics at the site of infection is paramount to selecting adequate drug regimens and developing new antibiotics. Tuberculosis (TB) lung lesions are made of various immune cell types, some of which harbor persistent forms of the pathogen, &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;. By combining high resolution MALDI MSI with histology staining and quantitative image analysis in rabbits with active TB, we have mapped the distribution of a fluoroquinolone at high resolution, and identified the immune-pathological factors driving its heterogeneous penetration within TB lesions, in relation to where bacteria reside. We find that macrophage content, distance from lesion border and extent of necrosis drive the uneven fluoroquinolone penetration. Preferential uptake in macrophages and foamy macrophages, where persistent bacilli reside, compared to other immune cells present in TB granulomas, was recapitulated in vitro using primary human cells. A nonlinear modeling approach was developed to help predict the observed drug behavior in TB lesions. This work constitutes a methodological advance for the co-localization of drugs and infectious agents at high spatial resolution in diseased tissues, which can be applied to other diseases with complex immunopathology.</description>

	<description>Age predictors based on DNA methylation levels at a small set of CpG sites, DNAm clocks, have been developed for humans and extended to several other species. Three currently available versions of mouse DNAm clocks were either created for individual tissues or tuned towards young ages. Here, we constructed a robust multi-tissue age predictor based on 435 CpG sites, which covers the entire mouse lifespan and remains unbiased with respect to any particular age group. It can successfully detect the effects of certain lifespan-modulating interventions on DNAm age as well as the rejuvenation effect related to the transition from fibroblasts to iPSCs. We have carried out comparative analyses of available mouse DNAm clocks, which revealed their broad applicability, but also certain limitations to the use of tissue-specific and multi-tissue age predictors. Together, these tools should help address diverse questions in aging research.</description>

	<description>Shear forces between cells occur during global changes in multicellular organization during morphogenesis and tissue growth, yet how cells sense shear forces and propagate a response across a tissue is unknown. We found that applying exogenous shear at the midline of an epithelium induced a local, short-term deformation near the shear plane, and a long-term collective oscillatory movement across the epithelium that spread from the shear-plane and gradually dampened. Inhibiting actomyosin contraction or E-cadherin &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cell adhesion blocked oscillations, whereas stabilizing actin filaments prolonged oscillations. Combining these data with a model of epithelium mechanics supports a mechanism involving the generation of a shear-induced mechanical event at the shear plane which is then relayed across the epithelium by actomyosin contraction linked through E-cadherin. This causes an imbalance of forces in the epithelium, which is gradually dissipated through oscillatory cell movements and actin filament turnover to restore the force balance across the epithelium.</description>

	<description>Despite strong theoretical reasons for assuming that abstract representations organize complex action sequences in terms of subplans (chunks) and sequential positions, we lack methods to directly track such content-independent, hierarchical representations in humans. We applied time-resolved, multivariate decoding analysis to the pattern of rhythmic EEG activity that was registered while participants planned and executed individual elements from pre-learned, structured sequences. Across three experiments, the theta and alpha-band activity coded basic elements &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; abstract control representations, in particular the ordinal position of basic elements, but also the identity and position of chunks. Further, a robust representation of higher-level, chunk identity information was only found in individuals with above-median working memory capacity, potentially providing a neural-level explanation for working-memory differences in sequential performance. Our results suggest that by decoding oscillatory activity we can track how the cognitive system traverses through the states of a hierarchical control structure.</description>

	<description>Organ renewal is governed by the dynamics of cell division, differentiation, and loss. To study these dynamics in real time, we present a platform for extended live imaging of the adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; midgut, a premier genetic model for stem cell-based organs. A window cut into a living animal allows the midgut to be imaged while intact and physiologically functioning. This approach prolongs imaging sessions to 12-16 hours and yields movies that document cell and tissue dynamics at vivid spatiotemporal resolution. Applying a pipeline for movie processing and analysis, we uncover new, intriguing cell behaviors: that mitotic stem cells dynamically re-orient, that daughter cells use slow kinetics of Notch activation to reach a fate-specifying threshold, and that enterocytes extrude via ratcheted constriction of a junctional ring. By enabling real-time study of midgut phenomena that were previously inaccessible, our platform opens a new realm for dynamic understanding of adult organ renewal.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Moth olfactory receptor neurons adjust their encoding efficiency to temporal statistics of pheromone fluctuations</title>

The efficient coding hypothesis predicts that sensory neurons adjust their coding resources to optimally represent the stimulus statistics of their environment. To test this prediction in the moth olfactory system, we have developed a stimulation protocol that mimics the natural temporal structure within a turbulent pheromone plume. We report that responses of antennal olfactory receptor neurons to pheromone encounters follow the temporal fluctuations in such a way that the most frequent stimulus timescales are encoded with maximum accuracy. We also observe that the average coding precision of the neurons adjusted to the stimulus-timescale statistics at a given distance from the pheromone source is higher than if the same encoding model is applied at a shorter, non-matching, distance. Finally, the coding accuracy profile and the stimulus-timescale distribution are related in the manner predicted by the information theory for the many-to-one convergence scenario of the moth peripheral sensory system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T3ETnhHC120&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Humans can meaningfully report their confidence in a perceptual or cognitive decision. It is widely believed that these reports reflect the Bayesian probability that the decision is correct, but this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested against non-Bayesian alternatives. We use two perceptual categorization tasks in which Bayesian confidence reporting requires subjects to take sensory uncertainty into account in a specific way. We find that subjects do take sensory uncertainty into account when reporting confidence, suggesting that brain areas involved in reporting confidence can access low-level representations of sensory uncertainty, a prerequisite of Bayesian inference. However, behavior is not fully consistent with the Bayesian hypothesis and is better described by simple heuristic models that use uncertainty in a non-Bayesian way. Both conclusions are robust to changes in the uncertainty manipulation, task, response modality, model comparison metric, and additional flexibility in the Bayesian model. Our results suggest that adhering to a rational account of confidence behavior may require incorporating implementational constraints.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k1ezyXe_qUo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Population genetic modeling can enhance Bayesian phylogenetic inference by providing a realistic prior on the distribution of branch lengths and times of common ancestry. The parameters of a population genetic model may also have intrinsic importance, and simultaneous estimation of a phylogeny and model parameters has enabled phylodynamic inference of population growth rates, reproduction numbers, and effective population size through time. Phylodynamic inference based on pathogen genetic sequence data has emerged as useful supplement to epidemic surveillance, however commonly-used mechanistic models that are typically fitted to non-genetic surveillance data are rarely fitted to pathogen genetic data due to a dearth of software tools, and the theory required to conduct such inference has been developed only recently. We present a framework for coalescent-based phylogenetic and phylodynamic inference which enables highly-flexible modeling of demographic and epidemiological processes. This approach builds upon previous structured coalescent approaches and includes enhancements for computational speed, accuracy, and stability. A flexible markup language is described for translating parametric demographic or epidemiological models into a structured coalescent model enabling simultaneous estimation of demographic or epidemiological parameters and time-scaled phylogenies. We demonstrate the utility of these approaches by fitting compartmental epidemiological models to Ebola virus and Influenza A virus sequence data, demonstrating how important features of these epidemics, such as the reproduction number and epidemic curves, can be gleaned from genetic data. These approaches are provided as an open-source package &lt;i&gt;PhyDyn&lt;/i&gt; for the BEAST2 phylogenetics platform.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KBwoD24QGeY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Functional protein-protein interactions are crucial in most cellular processes. They enable multi-protein complexes to assemble and to remain stable, and they allow signal transduction in various pathways. Functional interactions between proteins result in coevolution between the interacting partners, and thus in correlations between their sequences. Pairwise maximum-entropy based models have enabled successful inference of pairs of amino-acid residues that are in contact in the three-dimensional structure of multi-protein complexes, starting from the correlations in the sequence data of known interaction partners. Recently, algorithms inspired by these methods have been developed to identify which proteins are functional interaction partners among the paralogous proteins of two families, starting from sequence data alone. Here, we demonstrate that a slightly higher performance for partner identification can be reached by an approximate maximization of the mutual information between the sequence alignments of the two protein families. Our mutual information-based method also provides signatures of the existence of interactions between protein families. These results stand in contrast with structure prediction of proteins and of multi-protein complexes from sequence data, where pairwise maximum-entropy based global statistical models substantially improve performance compared to mutual information. Our findings entail that the statistical dependences allowing interaction partner prediction from sequence data are not restricted to the residue pairs that are in direct contact at the interface between the partner proteins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sTP41XDQ1ZA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) in plants involves a large family of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors, including Toll/IL-1 receptor-NLRs (TNLs) and coiled-coil NLRs (CNLs). Although various NLR immune receptors are known, a mechanistic understanding of NLR function in ETI remains unclear.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The wiring diagram of the mouse brain has recently been mapped at a
mesoscopic scale in the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas. Axonal
projections from brain regions were traced using green fluoresent proteins. The
resulting data were registered to a common three-dimensional reference space.
They yielded a matrix of connection strengths between 213 brain regions. Global
features such as closed loops formed by connections of similar intensity can be
inferred using tools from persistent homology. We map the wiring diagram of the
mouse brain to a simplicial complex (filtered by connection strengths). We work
out generators of the first homology group. Some regions, including nucleus
accumbens, are connected to the entire brain by loops, whereas no region has
non-zero connection strength to all brain regions. Thousands of loops go
through the isocortex, the striatum and the thalamus. On the other hand,
medulla is the only major brain compartment that contains more than 100 loops.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Detection of REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder by Automated Polysomnography Analysis. (arXiv:1811.04662v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests Rapid-Eye-Movement (REM) Sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) is
an early predictor of Parkinson's disease. This study proposes a
fully-automated framework for RBD detection consisting of automated sleep
staging followed by RBD identification. Analysis was assessed using a limited
polysomnography montage from 53 participants with RBD and 53 age-matched
healthy controls. Sleep stage classification was achieved using a Random Forest
(RF) classifier and 156 features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG),
electrooculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) channels. For RBD detection, a
RF classifier was trained combining established techniques to quantify muscle
atonia with additional features that incorporate sleep architecture and the EMG
fractal exponent. Automated multi-state sleep staging achieved a 0.62 Cohen's
Kappa score. RBD detection accuracy improved by 10% to 96% (compared to
individual established metrics) when using manually annotated sleep staging.
Accuracy remained high (92%) when using automated sleep staging. This study
outperforms established metrics and demonstrates that incorporating sleep
architecture and sleep stage transitions can benefit RBD detection. This study
also achieved automated sleep staging with a level of accuracy comparable to
manual annotation. This study validates a tractable, fully-automated, and
sensitive pipeline for RBD identification that could be translated to wearable
take-home technology.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Topographic maps in the brain are fundamental to processing of causality. (arXiv:1811.04581v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ubiquity of topographic maps in the brain has long been known, and
molecular mechanisms for the formation of topographic organization of neural
systems have been revealed. Less attention has been given to the question of
why are the maps topographical and why so ubiquitous. In this study, I explore
the implications of the topographic maps for brain function, by employing the
mathematical framework of the Zeeman topology. I propose the notion about the
meaning of topographic order as generic mechanisms for the representation and
analysis of causal structure, implemented by the neural systems. This leads to
a much improved understanding of the division of labour between chemical
systems and neural systems in the formation of maps to deal with causality.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Identifying community structure of a complex network provides insight to the
interdependence between the network topology and emergent collective behaviors
of networks, while detecting such invariant communities in a time-varying
network is more challenging. In this paper, we define the temporal stable
community and newly propose the concept of dynamic modularity to evaluate the
stable community structures in time-varying networks, which is robust against
small changes as verified by several empirical time-varying network datasets.
Besides, using the volatility features of temporal stable communities in
functional brain networks, we successfully differentiate the ADHD (Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) patients and healthy controls efficiently.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Reframing Convergent and Divergent Thought for the 21st Century. (arXiv:1811.04512v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04512</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04512</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Convergent thought is defined and measured in terms of the ability to perform
on tasks where there is a single correct solution, and divergent thought is
defined and measured in terms of the ability to generate multiple different
solutions. However, this characterization of them presents inconsistencies, and
despite that they are promoted as key constructs of creativity, they do not
capture the capacity to reiteratively modify an idea in light of new
perspectives arising out of an overarching conceptual framework. Research on
formal models of concepts and their interactions suggests that different
creative outputs may be projections of the same underlying idea at different
phases of this kind of 'honing' process. This leads us to redefine convergent
thought as thought in which the relevant concepts are considered from
conventional contexts, and divergent thought as thought in which they are
considered from unconventional contexts. Implications for the assessment of
creativity are discussed.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Nonlinear analysis of EEG complexity in episode and remission phase of recurrent depression. (arXiv:1811.04489v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04489</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Biomarkers of Major Depressive Disorder(MDD), its phases and forms have long
been sought. Research indicates that the complexity measures of the cortical
electrical activity (EEG) might be candidates for this role. To examine whether
the complexity of EEG activity, measured by Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) and
sample entropy (SampEn), differs between healthy subjects, patients in
remission and episode phase of the recurrent depression and whether the changes
are differentially distributed between hemispheres and cortical regions.
Resting state EEG with eyes closed was recorded from 26 patients suffering from
recurrent depression and 20 age and sex-matched healthy control subjects.
Artefact-free EEG epochs were analyzed by in-house developed programs running
HFD and SampEn algorithms. Depressed patients had higher HFD and SampEn
complexity compared to healthy subjects. Surprisingly, the complexity was even
higher in patients who were in remission than in those in the episode. Altered
complexity was present in the frontal and centro-parietal regions when compared
to the control group. The complexity in frontal and parietal regions differed
between the two phases of depressive disorder. SampEn manifested higher
sensitivity than HFD in some cortical areas. Complexity measures of EEG
distinguish between the three groups. Further studies are needed to establish
whether these measures carry the potential to aid clinically relevant decisions
about depression.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: StationPlot: A New Non-stationarity Quantification Tool for Detection of Epileptic Seizures. (arXiv:1811.04230v1 [eess.SP])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04230</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04230</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A novel non-stationarity visualization tool known as StationPlot is developed
for deciphering the chaotic behavior of a dynamical time series. A family of
analytic measures enumerating geometrical aspects of the non-stationarity &amp;amp;
degree of variability is formulated by convex hull geometry (CHG) on
StationPlot. In the Euclidean space, both trend-stationary (TS) &amp;amp;
difference-stationary (DS) perturbations are comprehended by the asymmetric
structure of StationPlot's region of interest (ROI). The proposed method is
experimentally validated using EEG signals, where it comprehend the relative
temporal evolution of neural dynamics &amp;amp; its non-stationary morphology, thereby
exemplifying its diagnostic competence for seizure activity (SA) detection.
Experimental results &amp;amp; analysis-of-Variance (ANOVA) on the extracted CHG
features demonstrates better classification performances as compared to the
existing shallow feature based state-of-the-art &amp;amp; validates its efficacy as
geometry-rich discriminative descriptors for signal processing applications.

	<description>DNA replication stress is often defined by the slowing or stalling of replication fork progression leading to local or global DNA synthesis inhibition. Failure to resolve replication stress in a timely manner contribute towards cell cycle defects, genome instability and human disease; however, the mechanism for fork recovery remains poorly defined. Here we show that the translesion DNA polymerase (Pol) kappa, a DinB orthologue, has a unique role in both protecting and restarting stalled replication forks under conditions of nucleotide deprivation. Importantly, Pol kappa-mediated DNA synthesis during hydroxyurea (HU)-dependent fork restart is regulated by both the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway and PCNA polyubiquitination. Loss of Pol kappa prevents timely rescue of stalled replication forks, leading to replication-associated genomic instability, and a p53-dependent cell cycle defect. Taken together, our results identify a previously unanticipated role for Pol kappa in promoting DNA synthesis and replication stress recovery at sites of stalled forks.</description>

	<description>Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) compensates for impaired postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor function through a rapid, persistent adjustment of neurotransmitter release, an effect that can exceed 200%. An unexplained property of PHP is the preservation of short-term plasticity (STP), thereby stabilizing activity-dependent synaptic information transfer. We demonstrate that the dramatic potentiation of presynaptic release during PHP is achieved while simultaneously maintaining a constant ratio of primed to super-primed synaptic vesicles, thereby preserving STP. Mechanistically, genetic, biochemical and electrophysiological evidence argue that a constant ratio of primed to super-primed synaptic vesicles is achieved by the concerted action of three proteins: Unc18, Syntaxin1A and RIM. Our data support a model based on the regulated availability of Unc18 at the presynaptic active zone, a process that is restrained by Syntaxin1A and facilitated by RIM. As such, regulated vesicle priming/super-priming enables PHP to stabilize both synaptic gain and the activity-dependent transfer of information at a synapse.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40262</link>
	<description>The quality of social relationships is a powerful determinant of lifetime health. Here, we explored the impact of social experiences on circulating oxytocin (OT) concentration, telomere length (TL) and novelty-seeking behaviour in male and female rats. Prolonged social housing raised circulating OT levels in both sexes while elongating TL only in females. Novelty-seeking behaviour in females was more responsive to social housing and increased OT levels than males. The OT antagonist (OT ANT) L-366,509 blocked the benefits of social housing in all conditions along with female-specific TL erosion and novelty-seeking deficit. Thus, females seem more susceptible than males to genetic and behavioural changes when the secretion of endogenous OT in response to social life is interrupted. Social enrichment may therefore provide a therapeutic avenue to promote stress resiliency and chances of healthy aging across generations.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Targeting MYC dependency in ovarian cancer through inhibition of CDK7 and CDK12/13</title>

	<description>High-grade serous ovarian cancer is characterized by extensive copy number alterations, among which the amplification of &lt;i&gt;MYC&lt;/i&gt; oncogene occurs in nearly half of tumors. We demonstrate that ovarian cancer cells highly depend on MYC for maintaining their oncogenic growth, indicating MYC as a therapeutic target for this difficult-to-treat malignancy. However, targeting MYC directly has proven difficult. We screen small molecules targeting transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, and find that THZ1 - a chemical inhibiting CDK7, CDK12, and CDK13 - markedly downregulates MYC. Notably, abolishing MYC expression cannot be achieved by targeting CDK7 alone, but require the combined inhibition of CDK7, CDK12, and CDK13. In 11 patient derived xenografts models derived from heavily pre-treated ovarian cancer patients, administration of THZ1 induces significant tumor growth inhibition with concurrent abrogation of MYC expression. Our study indicates that targeting these transcriptional CDKs with agents such as THZ1 may be an effective approach for MYC-dependent ovarian malignancies.</description>

	<description>XMAP215/Stu2/Alp14 proteins accelerate microtubule plus-end polymerization by recruiting tubulins via arrays of Tumor Overexpressed Gene (TOG) domains, yet their mechanism remains unknown. Here, we describe the biochemical and structural basis for TOG arrays in recruiting and polymerizing tubulins. Alp14 binds four tubulins via dimeric TOG1-TOG2 subunits, in which each domain exhibits a distinct exchange rate for tubulin. X-ray structures revealed square-shaped assemblies composed of pseudo-dimeric TOG1-TOG2 subunits assembled head-to-tail, positioning four unpolymerized tubulins in a polarized wheel-like configuration. Crosslinking and electron microscopy show Alp14-tubulin forms square assemblies in solution, and inactivating their interfaces destabilize this organization without influencing tubulin binding. An X-ray structure determined using approach to modulate tubulin polymerization revealed an unfurled assembly, in which TOG1-TOG2 uniquely bind to two polymerized tubulins. Our findings suggest a new microtubule polymerase model in which TOG arrays recruit tubulins by forming square assemblies that then unfurl, facilitating their concerted polymerization into protofilaments.</description>

	<description>More than half of long-term brain tumor survivors develop irreversible cognitive decline that severely affect their quality of life. However, there is no pre-clinical model that allows long-term assessment of cognition, and there is no treatment which ameliorates cognitive deficits in patients. Here, we report a novel glioma mouse model that offers manageable tumor growth and reliable assessment of cognitive functions in a post-treatment manner. Using this model, we found that fractionated whole-brain irradiation (fWBI), but not tumor growth, results in memory deficits. Transient inhibition of CSF-1R during fWBI prolongs survival of glioma-bearing mice and fully prevents fWBI-induced memory deficits. This result suggests that CSF-1R inhibition during radiotherapy can be explored as an approach to improve both survival and cognitive outcomes in patients who will receive fWBI. Taken together, the current study provides a proof of concept of a powerful tool to study radiation-induced cognitive deficits in glioma-bearing animals.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Dopamine neurons drive fear extinction learning by signaling the omission of expected aversive outcomes</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38818</link>
	<description>Extinction of fear responses is critical for adaptive behavior and deficits in this form of safety learning are hallmark of anxiety disorders. However, the neuronal mechanisms that initiate extinction learning are largely unknown. Here we show, using single-unit electrophysiology and cell-type specific fiber photometry, that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are activated by the omission of the aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) during fear extinction. This dopamine signal occurred specifically during the beginning of extinction when the US omission is unexpected, and correlated strongly with extinction learning. Furthermore, temporally-specific optogenetic inhibition or excitation of dopamine neurons at the time of the US omission revealed that this dopamine signal is both necessary for, and sufficient to accelerate, normal fear extinction learning. These results identify a prediction error-like neuronal signal that is necessary to initiate fear extinction and reveal a crucial role of DA neurons in this form of safety learning.</description>

	<description>The plasma membrane in mammalian cells is rich in cholesterol. How cholesterol partitions between the two leaflets of the plasma membrane remains a matter of debate. Recently, Liu et al used domain 4 (D4) of perfringolysin O as a cholesterol sensor to argue that cholesterol is mostly in the exofacial leaflet (&lt;i&gt;Liu et al.&lt;/i&gt;, 2017). This conclusion was made by interpreting D4 binding in live cells using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; calibrations with liposomes. However, liposomes may be unfaithful in mimicking the plasma membrane, as we demonstrate here. Also, D4 binding is highly sensitive to the presence of cytosolic proteins. In addition, we find that a D4 variant, that requires &amp;gt;35 mol% cholesterol to bind to liposomes &lt;i&gt;in vitro,&lt;/i&gt; does in fact bind to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Thus, we believe, based on the current evidence, that it is unlikely that there is a significantly higher proportion of cholesterol in the exofacial leaflet of the plasma membrane compared to the cytosolic leaflet.</description>

	<description>The status signalling hypothesis aims to explain within-species variation in ornamentation by suggesting that some ornaments signal dominance status. Here, we use multilevel meta-analytic models to challenge the textbook example of this hypothesis, the black bib of male house sparrows (&lt;i&gt;Passer domesticus&lt;/i&gt;). We conducted a systematic review, and obtained primary data from published and unpublished studies to test whether dominance rank is positively associated with bib size across studies. Contrary to previous studies, the overall effect size (i.e. meta-analytic mean) was small and uncertain. Furthermore, we found several biases in the literature that further question the support available for the status signalling hypothesis. We discuss several explanations including pleiotropic, population- and context-dependent effects. Our findings call for reconsidering this established textbook example in evolutionary and behavioural ecology, and should stimulate renewed interest in understanding within-species variation in ornamental traits.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A regularity index for dendrites - local statistics of a neuron's input space</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Anton-Sanchez, Felix Effenberger, Concha Bielza, Pedro Larrañaga, Hermann Cuntz&lt;/p&gt;

Neurons collect their inputs from other neurons by sending out arborized dendritic structures. However, the relationship between the shape of dendrites and the precise organization of synaptic inputs in the neural tissue remains unclear. Inputs could be distributed in tight clusters, entirely randomly or else in a regular grid-like manner. Here, we analyze dendritic branching structures using a regularity index &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;, based on average nearest neighbor distances between branch and termination points, characterizing their spatial distribution. We find that the distributions of these points depend strongly on cell types, indicating possible fundamental differences in synaptic input organization. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; is independent of cell size and we find that it is only weakly correlated with other branching statistics, suggesting that it might reflect features of dendritic morphology that are not captured by commonly studied branching statistics. We then use morphological models based on optimal wiring principles to study the relation between input distributions and dendritic branching structures. Using our models, we find that branch point distributions correlate more closely with the input distributions while termination points in dendrites are generally spread out more randomly with a close to uniform distribution. We validate these model predictions with connectome data. Finally, we find that in spatial input distributions with increasing regularity, characteristic scaling relationships between branching features are altered significantly. In summary, we conclude that local statistics of input distributions and dendrite morphology depend on each other leading to potentially cell type specific branching features.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ori6Lo6m244&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Diverse plasticity mechanisms are orchestrated to shape the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying brain functions. However, why these plasticity rules emerge and how their dynamics interact with neural activity to give rise to complex neural circuit dynamics remains largely unknown. Here we show that both Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity rules emerge from a functional perspective of neuronal dynamics whereby each neuron learns to encode its own activity in the population activity, so that the activity of the presynaptic neuron can be decoded from the activity of its postsynaptic neurons. We explain how a range of experimentally observed plasticity phenomena with widely separated time scales emerge from learning this encoding function, including STDP and its frequency dependence, and metaplasticity. We show that when implemented in neural circuits, these plasticity rules naturally give rise to essential neural response properties, including variable neural dynamics with balanced excitation and inhibition, and approximately log-normal distributions of synaptic strengths, while simultaneously encoding a complex real-world visual stimulus. These findings establish a novel function-based account of diverse plasticity mechanisms, providing a unifying framework relating plasticity, dynamics and neural computation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4hnBgLInEwc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Population structure can strongly affect evolutionary dynamics. The most general way to describe population structures are graphs. An important observable on evolutionary graphs is the probability that a novel mutation spreads through the entire population. But what drives this spread of a mutation towards fixation? Here, we propose a novel way to understand the forces driving fixation by borrowing techniques from evolutionary demography to quantify the invasion fitness and the effective population size for different graphs. Our method is very general and even applies to weighted graphs with node dependent fitness. However, we focus on analytical results for undirected graphs with node independent fitness. The method will allow to conceptually integrate evolutionary graph theory with theoretical genetics of structured populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uezjpMD9TOY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Despite advances in experimental techniques and accumulation of large datasets concerning the composition and properties of the cortex, quantitative modeling of cortical circuits under in-vivo-like conditions remains challenging. Here we report and publicly release a biophysically detailed circuit model of layer 4 in the mouse primary visual cortex, receiving thalamo-cortical visual inputs. The 45,000-neuron model was subjected to a battery of visual stimuli, and results were compared to published work and new in vivo experiments. Simulations reproduced a variety of observations, including effects of optogenetic perturbations. Critical to the agreement between responses in silico and in vivo were the rules of functional synaptic connectivity between neurons. Interestingly, after extreme simplification the model still performed satisfactorily on many measurements, although quantitative agreement with experiments suffered. These results emphasize the importance of functional rules of cortical wiring and enable a next generation of data-driven models of in vivo neural activity and computations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hU_7d7E5u8Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Oscillations in working memory and neural binding: A mechanism for multiple memories and their interactions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006517</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jason E. Pina, Mark Bodner, Bard Ermentrout&lt;/p&gt;

Neural oscillations have been recorded and implicated in many different basic brain and cognitive processes. For example, oscillatory neural activity has been suggested to play a role in binding and in the maintenance of information in working memory. With respect to the latter, the majority of work has focused primarily on oscillations in terms of providing a “code” in working memory. However, oscillations may additionally play a fundamental role by enabling or facilitating essential properties and behaviors that neuronal networks must exhibit in order to produce functional working memory and the processes it supports, such as combining items in memory into bound objects or separating bound objects into distinct items. In the present work, we present a biologically plausible working memory model and demonstrate that specific types of stable oscillatory dynamics that arise may play critical roles in providing mechanisms for working memory and the cognitive functions that it supports. Specifically, these roles include (1) enabling a range of different types of binding, (2) both enabling and limiting capacities of bound and distinct items held active in working memory, and (3) facilitating transitions between active working memory states as required in cognitive function. Several key results arise within the examinations, such as the occurrence of different network capacities for working memory and binding, differences in processing times for transitions in working memory states, and the emergence of a combinatorially rich and complex range of oscillatory states that are sufficient to map onto a wide range of cognitive operations supported by working memory, such as variable binding, reasoning, and language. In particular, we show that these oscillatory states and their transitions can provide a specific instantiation of current established connectionist models in representing these functions. Finally, we further characterize the dependence of the relevant oscillatory solutions on certain critical parameters, including mutual inhibition and synaptic timescales.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n2vXpNJbJkw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neural stem cells hold great promise for neural repair in cases of CNS injury and neurodegeneration, however, conventional cell-based transplant methods face the challenges of poor survival and inadequate neuronal differentiation. Here, we report an alternative, tissue-based transplantation strategy whereby cerebral organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells were grafted into lesioned mouse cortex. Cerebral organoid transplants exhibited enhanced survival and robust vascularization from host brain as compared to transplants of dissociated neural progenitor cells. Engrafted cerebral organoids harbored a large neural stem cell pool and displayed multilineage neurodifferentiation at two and four week post-grafting. Cerebral organoids therefore represent a promising alternative source to neural stem cells or fetal tissues for transplantation, as they contain a large set of neuroprogenitors and differentiated neurons in a structured organization. Engrafted cerebral organoids may also offer a unique experimental paradigm for modeling human neurodevelopment and CNS diseases in the context of vascularized cortical tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Neural stem cells hold great promise for neural repair, but conventional cell-based transplant methods face the hurdles of poor graft survival and inadequate neural differentiation. Here, we transplanted cerebral organoids derived from human pluripotent cells into lesioned mouse cortex. We report enhanced survival, robust vascularization, and multilineage differentiation of engrafted human cerebral organoids in host mouse brain. Cerebral organoid transplantation therefore represents an alternative, tissue-based transplantation strategy for neural repair and for modeling human neurodevelopment and CNS diseases in the context of vascularized cortical tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25379?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the association between clinical outcomes and acute systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels achieved after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eligible patients who were randomized to the Antihypertensive Treatment in Intracerebral Hemorrhage 2 (ATACH‐2) trial (&lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt; NCT01176565) were divided into 5 groups by 10‐mmHg strata of average hourly minimum SBP (&amp;lt;120 mmHg, 120‐130, 130‐140, 140‐150 and ≥150) during 2 to 24 hours after randomization. Outcomes included: 90‐day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 4‐6; hematoma expansion, defined as an increase ≥6 mL from baseline to 24‐hour computed tomography; and cardio‐renal adverse events within 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 1,000 subjects in ATACH‐2, 995 with available SBP data were included in the analyses. The proportion of mRS 4‐6 was 37.5%, 36.0%, 42.8%, 38.6%, and 38.0%, respectively. For the ‘140‐150’ group relative to the ‘120‐130’, the odds ratio, adjusting for sex, race, age, onset‐to‐randomization time, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, hematoma volume, and hematoma location, was 1.62 (95% confidence interval 1.02‐2.58). Hematoma expansion was identified in 16.9%, 13.7%, 21.4%, 18.5%, and 26.4%, respectively. The ‘140‐150’ (odds ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.05‐3.09) and ‘≥150’ (1.98, 1.12‐3.51) showed a higher frequency of expansion than ‘120‐130’ group. Cardio‐renal events occurred in 13.6%, 16.6%, 11.5%, 8.1%, and 8.2%, respectively. The ‘140‐150’ (0.43, 0.19‐0.88) and ‘≥150’ (0.44, 0.18‐0.96) showed a lower frequency of the events than the ‘120‐130’.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beneficial effects of lowering and maintaining SBP at 120‐130 mmHg during the first 24 hours on clinical outcomes by suppressing hematoma expansion was somewhat offset by cardio‐renal complications.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Attributable Risk of Alzheimer's Dementia Due to Age‐Related Neuropathologies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25380?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The degree to which Alzheimer's versus other neuropathologies contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's dementia is unknown. We examined the risk of Alzheimer's dementia attributable to pathologic AD and eight other neuropathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants (n=1,161) came from two clinical‐pathologic studies of aging. Multivariable logistic regression models examined associations of eight neuropathologic indices with Alzheimer's dementia and quantified the percentage of cases attributable to each. Further, because some dementia cases are not driven by common neuropathologies, we re‐estimated the attributable risks after empirically adjusting for such cases.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 1,161 persons, 512 (44.1%) had Alzheimer's dementia at the time of death. With the exception of microinfarcts, all neuropathologic indices were independently associated with greater odds of Alzheimer's dementia. 210 (41.0%) Alzheimer's dementia cases were attributable to pathologic AD. Separately, 8.9% were attributable to macroscopic infarcts, 10.8% to Lewy bodies, 5.2% to hippocampal sclerosis, 11.7% to TDP‐43, 8.1% to CAA, 6.0% to atherosclerosis and 5.2% to arteriolosclerosis. A total of 83.3% of cases were attributable to all eight indices combined. However, after further adjustment for cases driven by other factors, a total of 67.5% of cases were attributable to all eight neuropathologic indices combined.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathologic AD accounts for a considerable percentage of Alzheimer's dementia cases, but multiple other neuropathologies also contribute. In total, just over two thirds of Alzheimer's dementia cases are attributable to common age‐related neuropathologies, suggesting that other disease and resilience factors are important.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study we evaluate the role of the thalamus in the neural circuitry of arousal. Level of consciousness within the first 12 hours of a thalamic stroke is assessed with lesion symptom mapping. Impaired arousal correlates with lesions in the paramedian posterior thalamus near the centromedian and parafascicular nuclei, posterior hypothalamus, and midbrain tegmentum. All patients with severely impaired arousal (coma, stupor) had lesion extension into the midbrain and/or pontine tegmentum, whereas purely thalamic lesions did not severely impair arousal. These results are consistent with growing evidence that pathways most critical for human arousal lay outside the thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sensitive Period for Cognitive Repurposing of Human Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy280</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy280/5174328?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Studies of sensory loss are a model for understanding the functional flexibility of human cortex. In congenital blindness, subsets of visual cortex are recruited during higher-cognitive tasks, such as language and math tasks. Is such dramatic functional repurposing possible throughout the lifespan or restricted to sensitive periods in development? We compared visual cortex function in individuals who lost their vision as adults (after age 17) to congenitally blind and sighted blindfolded adults. Participants took part in resting-state and task-based fMRI scans during which they solved math equations of varying difficulty and judged the meanings of sentences. Blindness at any age caused “visual” cortices to synchronize with specific frontoparietal networks at rest. However, in task-based data, visual cortices showed regional specialization for math and language and load-dependent activity only in congenital blindness. Thus, despite the presence of long-range functional connectivity, cognitive repurposing of human cortex is limited by sensitive periods.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Functional Connectivity Changes of Key Regions for Motor Initiation in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Akinesia, a cardinal symptom of Parkinson’s disease, has been linked to abnormal activation in putamen and posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC). However, little is known whether clinical severity of akinesia is linked to dysfunctional connectivity of these regions. Using a seed-based approach, we here investigated resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of putamen, pMFC and primary motor cortex (M1) in 60 patients with Parkinson’s disease on regular medication and 72 healthy controls. We found that in patients putamen featured decreases of connectivity for a number of cortical and subcortical areas engaged in sensorimotor and cognitive processing. In contrast, the pMFC showed reduced connectivity with a more focal cortical network involved in higher-level motor-cognition. Finally, M1 featured a selective disruption of connectivity in a network specifically connected with M1. Correlating clinical impairment with connectivity changes revealed a relationship between akinesia and reduced RSFC between pMFC and left intraparietal lobule (IPL). Together, the present study demonstrated RSFC decreases in networks for motor initiation and execution in Parkinson’s disease. Moreover, results suggest a relationship between pMFC-IPL decoupling and the manifestation of akinetic symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Functional Connectivity of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex in Depression and in Health</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The first voxel-level resting-state functional connectivity (FC) neuroimaging analysis of depression of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed in 282 patients with major depressive disorder compared with 254 controls, some higher, and some lower FCs. However, in 125 unmedicated patients, primarily increases of FC were found: of the subcallosal anterior cingulate with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, of the pregenual/supracallosal anterior cingulate with the medial orbitofrontal cortex, and of parts of the anterior cingulate with the inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and with early cortical visual areas. In the 157 medicated patients, these and other FCs were lower than in the unmedicated group. Parcellation was performed based on the FC of individual ACC voxels in healthy controls. A pregenual subdivision had high FC with medial orbitofrontal cortex areas, and a supracallosal subdivision had high FC with lateral orbitofrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. The high FC in depression between the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the subcallosal parts of the ACC provides a mechanism for more non-reward information transmission to the ACC, contributing to depression. The high FC between the medial orbitofrontal cortex and supracallosal ACC in depression may also contribute to depressive symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

GTPases regulate a multitude of essential cellular processes ranging from movement and division to differentiation and neuronal activity. These ubiquitous enzymes operate by hydrolyzing GTP to GDP with associated conformational changes that modulate affinity for family-specific binding partners. There are three major GTPase superfamilies: Ras-like GTPases, heterotrimeric G proteins and protein-synthesizing GTPases. Although they contain similar nucleotide-binding sites, the detailed mechanisms by which these structurally and functionally diverse superfamilies operate remain unclear. Here we compare and contrast the structural dynamic mechanisms of each superfamily using extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and subsequent network analysis approaches. In particular, dissection of the cross-correlations of atomic displacements in both the GTP and GDP-bound states of Ras, transducin and elongation factor EF-Tu reveals analogous dynamic features. This includes similar dynamic communities and subdomain structures (termed lobes). For all three proteins the GTP-bound state has stronger couplings between equivalent lobes. Network analysis further identifies common and family-specific residues mediating the state-specific coupling of distal functional sites. Mutational simulations demonstrate how disrupting these couplings leads to distal dynamic effects at the nucleotide-binding site of each family. Collectively our studies extend current understanding of GTPase allosteric mechanisms and highlight previously unappreciated similarities across functionally diverse families.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/L2Q7vnwDhzE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Long-term potentiation and excitability in the hippocampus are modulated differently by theta rhythm</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Oscillations in the brain facilitate neural processing and cognitive functions. This study investigated the dependence of long-term potentiation (LTP), a neural correlate of memory, on the phase of the hippocampal theta rhythm, a prominent brain oscillation. Multichannel field potentials and current source-sinks were analyzed in hippocampal CA1 of adult male rats under urethane anesthesia. A single burst (5 pulses at 200 Hz) stimulation of stratum oriens induced LTP of the basal dendritic excitatory sink, which was maximal when the burst was delivered at ~340&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; and ~160&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; of the distal dendritic theta rhythm. Apical dendritic sink evoked by stratum radiatum stimulation also showed biphasic maxima at ~30&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; and ~210&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; of the distal dendritic theta rhythm, about 50&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; phase delay to basal dendritic LTP. By contrast, maximal population spike excitability, following single-pulse excitation of the basal or mid-apical dendrites, occurred at a theta phase of ~140&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt;, and maximal basal dendritic excitatory sink occurred at ~20&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt;. Gamma (30-57 Hz) activity recorded in CA1 stratum radiatum had maximal power at ~300&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; of the distal dendritic theta rhythm, different from the phases of maximal LTP. LTP induced during the rising theta phase was N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor sensitive. It is suggested that the theta-phase modulation of CA1 population spike excitability is mainly provided by theta-rhythmic proximal inhibition, while dendritic LTP is also modulated by dendritic inhibition and excitation, specific to basal and apical dendrites. In summary, basal and apical dendritic synaptic plasticity and spike excitability are facilitated at different theta phases in a compartmental fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; How the hippocampal theta rhythm modulates synaptic plasticity and transmission is not completely known. Here, we showed, for the first time, phase modulation of synaptic plasticity and spike excitability across a complete theta cycle. Using a single burst stimulation to probe long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1, we observed two LTP peaks and a single spike excitability peak in a single theta cycle (360&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt;). Basal dendritic LTP led apical dendritic LTP by ~50&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt;, and LTP peaks occurred during both low and high spike excitability. This suggests a brain oscillation can optimally process output (spikes) and synaptic plasticity of different dendritic compartments at different phases, possibly resulting from rhythmic somatic and dendritic inhibition and excitation in the network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Biallelic COLGALT1 variants are associated with cerebral small vessel disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25367?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25367?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 5% of cerebral small vessel diseases are hereditary, which include &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders. &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt; encode type IV collagen α1/2 chains in the basement membranes of cerebral vessels. &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt; mutations impair the secretion of collagen to the extracellular matrix, thereby resulting in vessel fragility. The diagnostic yield for &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt; variants is around 20%–30%, suggesting other mutated genes might be associated with this disease. This study aimed to identify novel genes that cause &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole exome sequencing was performed in two families with suspected &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders. We validated the role of &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; variants by constructing a 3D structural model, evaluating ColGalT1 protein expression and ColGalT activity by western blotting and collagen galactosyltransferase assays, and performing &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; RNA interference and rescue experiments.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exome sequencing demonstrated biallelic variants in &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; encoding collagen β (1‐O) galactosyltransferase 1, which was involved in the post‐translational modification of type IV collagen in two unrelated patients: c.452T&amp;gt;G (p.Leu151Arg) and c.1096delG (p.Glu366Argfs*15) in Patient 1, and c.460G&amp;gt;C (p.Ala154Pro) and c.1129G&amp;gt;C (p.Gly377Arg) in Patient 2. 3D model analysis suggested that p.Leu151Arg and p.Ala154Pro destabilized protein folding, which impaired enzymatic activity. ColGalT1 protein expression and ColGalT activity in Patient 1 were undetectable. RNA interference studies demonstrated that reduced ColGalT1 altered COL4A1 secretion, and rescue experiments showed that mutant &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; insufficiently restored COL4A1 production in cells compared with wild‐type.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biallelic &lt;i&gt;COLGALT1&lt;/i&gt; variants cause cerebral small vessel abnormalities through a common molecular pathogenesis with &lt;i&gt;COL4A1/COL4A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Communication and Information Theory of Single Action Potential Signals in Plants. (arXiv:1811.03612v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03612</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03612</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many plants, such as Mimosa pudica (the sensitive plant), employ
electrochemical signals known as action potentials (APs) for rapid
intercellular communication. In this paper, we consider a reaction diffusion
model of individual AP signals to analyze APs from a communication and
information theoretic perspective. We use concepts from molecular communication
to explain the underlying process of information transfer in a plant for a
single AP pulse that is shared with one or more receiver cells. We also use the
chemical Langevin equation to accommodate the deterministic as well as
stochastic component of the system. Finally we present an information theoretic
analysis of single action potentials, obtaining achievable information rates
for these signals. We show that, in general, the presence of an AP signal can
increase the mutual information and information propagation speed among
neighboring cells with receivers in different settings.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a biologically-inspired research agenda with parallel tracks aimed
at AI and AI safety. The bottom-up component consists of building a sequence of
biophysically realistic simulations of simple organisms such as the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the
zebrafish Danio rerio to serve as platforms for research into AI algorithms and
system architectures. The top-down component consists of an approach to value
alignment that grounds AI goal structures in neuropsychology. Our belief is
that parallel pursuit of these tracks will inform the development of
value-aligned AI systems that have been inspired by embodied organisms with
sensorimotor integration. An important set of side benefits is that the
research trajectories we describe here are grounded in long-standing
intellectual traditions within existing research communities and funding
structures. In addition, these research programs overlap with significant
contemporary themes in the biological and psychological sciences such as
data/model integration and reproducibility.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A spatially resolved network spike in model neuronal cultures reveals nucleation centers, circular traveling waves and drifting spiral waves. (arXiv:1811.03335v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03335</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03335</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We show that in model neuronal cultures, where the probability of
interneuronal connection formation decreases exponentially with increasing
distance between the neurons, there exists a small number of spatial nucleation
centers of a network spike, from where the synchronous spiking activity starts
propagating in the network typically in the form of circular traveling waves.
The number of nucleation centers and their spatial locations are unique and
unchanged for a given realization of neuronal network but are different for
different networks. In contrast, if the probability of interneuronal connection
formation is independent of the distance between neurons, then the nucleation
centers do not arise and the synchronization of spiking activity during a
network spike occurs spatially uniform throughout the network. Therefore one
can conclude that spatial proximity of connections between neurons is important
for the formation of nucleation centers. It is also shown that fluctuations of
the spatial density of neurons at their random homogeneous distribution typical
for the experiments $\textit{in vitro}$ do not determine the locations of the
nucleation centers. The simulation results are qualitatively consistent with
the experimental observations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: On the Subspace Invariance of Population Responses. (arXiv:1811.03251v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03251</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03251</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In cat visual cortex, the response of a neural population to the linear
combination of two sinusoidal gratings (a plaid) can be well approximated by a
weighted sum of the population responses to the individual gratings --- a
property we refer to as {\em subspace invariance}. We tested subspace
invariance in mouse primary visual cortex by measuring the angle between the
population response to a plaid and the plane spanned by the population
responses to its individual components. We found robust violations of subspace
invariance arising from a strong, negative correlation between the responses of
neurons to individual gratings and their responses to the plaid. Contrast
invariance, a special case of subspace invariance, also failed. The responses
of some neurons decreased with increasing contrast, while others increased.
Altogether the data show that subspace and contrast invariance do not hold in
mouse primary visual cortex. These findings rule out some models of population
coding, including vector averaging, some versions of normalization and temporal
multiplexing.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The Cultural Brain Hypothesis: How culture drives brain expansion, sociality, and life history</title>

In the last few million years, the hominin brain more than tripled in size. Comparisons across evolutionary lineages suggest that this expansion may be part of a broader trend toward larger, more complex brains in many taxa. Efforts to understand the evolutionary forces driving brain expansion have focused on climatic, ecological, and social factors. Here, building on existing research on learning, we analytically and computationally model the predictions of two closely related hypotheses: The Cultural Brain Hypothesis and the Cumulative Cultural Brain Hypothesis. The Cultural Brain Hypothesis posits that brains have been selected for their ability to store and manage information, acquired through asocial or social learning. The model of the Cultural Brain Hypothesis reveals relationships between brain size, group size, innovation, social learning, mating structures, and the length of the juvenile period that are supported by the existing empirical literature. From this model, we derive a set of predictions—the Cumulative Cultural Brain Hypothesis—for the conditions that favor an autocatalytic take-off characteristic of human evolution. This narrow evolutionary pathway, created by cumulative cultural evolution, may help explain the rapid expansion of human brains and other aspects of our species’ life history and psychology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/D8JG9Z49BUk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Research in computational biology has given rise to a vast number of methods developed to solve scientific problems. For areas in which many approaches exist, researchers have a hard time deciding which tool to select to address a scientific challenge, as essentially all publications introducing a new method will claim better performance than all others. Not all of these claims can be correct. Equally, for this same reason, developers struggle to demonstrate convincingly that they created a new and superior algorithm or implementation. Moreover, the developer community often has difficulty discerning which new approaches constitute true scientific advances for the field. The obvious answer to this conundrum is to develop benchmarks—meaning standard points of reference that facilitate evaluating the performance of different tools—allowing both users and developers to compare multiple tools in an unbiased fashion.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qGkTd6d2wRY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The automated comparison of protein-ligand binding sites provides useful insights into yet unexplored site similarities. Various stages of computational and chemical biology research can benefit from this knowledge. The search for putative off-targets and the establishment of polypharmacological effects by comparing binding sites led to promising results for numerous projects. Although many cavity comparison methods are available, a comprehensive analysis to guide the choice of a tool for a specific application is wanting. Moreover, the broad variety of binding site modeling approaches, comparison algorithms, and scoring metrics impedes this choice. Herein, we aim to elucidate strengths and weaknesses of binding site comparison methodologies. A detailed benchmark study is the only possibility to rationalize the selection of appropriate tools for different scenarios. Specific evaluation data sets were developed to shed light on multiple aspects of binding site comparison. An assembly of all applied benchmark sets (ProSPECCTs–Protein Site Pairs for the Evaluation of Cavity Comparison Tools) is made available for the evaluation and optimization of further and still emerging methods. The results indicate the importance of such analyses to facilitate the choice of a methodology that complies with the requirements of a specific scientific challenge.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q6hPgve3kwY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Etiologic diagnosis is uncertain in 35% to 50% of patients with encephalitis, despite its substantial global prevalence and disease burden. We report on 2 adult female patients with fatal leukoencephalitis associated with human pegivirus‐1 (HPgV‐1) brain infection. Neuroimaging showed inflammatory changes in cerebral white matter. Brain‐derived HPgV‐1 RNA sequences clustered phylogenetically with other pegiviruses despite an 87‐nucleotide deletion in the viral nonstructural (NS)2 gene. Neuropathology disclosed lymphocyte infiltration and gliosis predominantly in brain white matter. HPgV‐1 NS5A antigen was detected in lymphocytes as well as in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. HPgV‐1 neuroadaptation should be considered in the differential diagnosis of progressive leukoencephalitis in humans. Ann Neurol 2018&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several small case series identified &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; mutations in patients with a rare autosomal recessive disorder designated progressive myoclonic epilepsy (EPM3) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN14). Despite the name KCTD (potassium channel tetramerization domain), KCTD protein family members lack predicted channel domains. We sought to translate insight gained from yeast studies to uncover disease mechanisms associated with deficiencies in KCTD7 of unknown function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; variants in new and published patients were assessed for disease causality using genetic analyses, cell‐based functional assays of patient fibroblasts and knockout yeast, and electron microscopy of patient samples.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; mutations can exhibit movement disorders or developmental regression before seizure onset, and are distinguished from similar disorders by an earlier age of onset. Although most published &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; patient variants were excluded from a genome sequence database of normal human variations, most newly identified patient variants are present in this database, potentially challenging disease causality. However, genetic analysis and impaired biochemical interactions with cullin 3 support a causal role for patient &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; variants, suggesting deleterious alleles of &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; and other rare disease variants may be underestimated. Both patient‐derived fibroblasts and yeast lacking Whi2 with sequence similarity to KCTD7 have impaired autophagy consistent with brain pathology.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biallelic &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; mutations define a neurodegenerative disorder with lipofuscin and lipid droplet accumulation but without defining features of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis or lysosomal storage disorders. &lt;i&gt;KCTD7&lt;/i&gt; deficiency appears to cause an underlying autophagy‐lysosome defect conserved in yeast, thereby assigning a biological role for KCTD7.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Magnetic resonance T1w/T2w ratio: A parsimonious marker for Parkinson's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25376?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newer MRI techniques have shown promise in capturing early Parkinson's disease (PD)‐related changes in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), the key pathological loci. Their translational value, however, is hindered by technical complexity and inconsistent results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel yet simple MRI contrast, the T1w/T2w ratio, was used to study 76 PD patients and 70 controls. The T1w/T2w ratio maps were analyzed using both voxel‐based and region‐of‐interest approaches in normalized space. The sensitivity and specificity of the SN T1w/T2w ratio in discriminating between PD and controls also were assessed. In addition, its diagnostic performance was tested in a subgroup of PD patients with disease duration ≤2 years (PDE). A second independent cohort of 73 PD and 49 controls was used for validation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to controls, PD patients showed a higher T1w/T2w ratio in both the right (cluster size=164 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and left (cluster size=213 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, p&amp;lt;0.0001) midbrain that was located ventrolateral to the red nucleus and corresponded to the SNc. The region‐of‐interest approach confirmed the group difference in the SNc T1w/T2w ratio between PD and controls (p&amp;lt;0.0001). The SNc T1w/T2w ratio had high sensitivity (0.908) and specificity (0.80) to separate PD and controls (AUC=0.926), even for PDE patients (AUC=0.901, sensitivity=0.857, specificity=0.857). These results were validated in the second cohort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T1w/T2w ratio can detect PD‐related changes in the SN and may be used as a novel, parsimonious &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; biomarker for the disease, particularly early stage patients, with high translational value for clinical practice and research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite bioequivalence, the exchangeability of antiepileptic drugs in clinical settings is disputed. Therefore, we investigated the risk for recurrent seizures after switching the manufacturer of the same drug in a large German cohort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anonymous patient data from practice neurologists throughout Germany between 2011 and 2016 were collected using the IMS Disease Analyzer database (QuintilesIMS, Frankfurt, Germany). People with epilepsy were included if at least 2 prescriptions within 360 days and 1 within 180 days prior to the index date were available. The cohort was separated into a seizure group and seizure‐free controls. Both groups were matched 1:1 according to age, gender, insurance status, and treating physician. The risk for breakthrough seizures after a manufacturer switch of the same antiepileptic drug was analyzed using multivariate regression models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 3,530 people with epilepsy were included (each group, n = 1,765; age = 53.7 ± 19.8 years). Patients with seizures had switched the drug manufacturer more often than controls (26.8% vs 14.2%; odds ratio [OR] = 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08–1.69, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009), both from branded to generic (5.5% vs 2.4%; OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.30–2.64, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and between generic drugs (14.7% vs 7.1%; OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.13–1.87, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previously seizure‐free patients, switching the manufacturer of antiepileptic medications was associated with a higher risk for seizure recurrence. Our retrospective approach does not allow us to determine whether other changes in medical care at the same time could contribute to the recurrence. However, it would be prudent to avoid switching the manufacturer of anticonvulsants in seizure‐free patients. Ann Neurol 2018&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated the therapeutic potential of the interleukin‐6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab in 7 patients with new‐onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) who remained refractory to conventional immunotherapy with rituximab (n=5) or without rituximab (n=2). Status epilepticus (SE) was terminated after 1‐2 doses of tocilizumab in six patients with a median interval of three days from the initiation. They had no recurrence of SE during the observation. However, two patients experienced severe adverse events related to infection during the tocilizumab therapy. Further prospective controlled studies are warranted to validate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with NORSE.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Brain‐State Dependent Stimulation boosts functional recovery following stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25375?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25375?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjuvant protocols devised to enhance motor recovery in subacute stroke patients have failed to show benefits with respect to classic therapeutic interventions. Here we evaluate the efficacy of a novel brain‐state dependent intervention based on known mechanisms of memory and learning, that is integrated as part of the weekly rehabilitation program in subacute stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐four hospitalized subacute stroke patients were randomly assigned to two intervention groups; 1. The associative group received thirty pairings of a peripheral electrical nerve stimulus (ES) such that the generated afferent volley arrived precisely during the most active phase of the motor cortex as patients attempted to perform a movement; 2. In the control group the ES intensity was too low to generate a stimulation of the nerve. Functional (including the lower extremity Fugl‐Meyer assessment (LE‐FM; primary outcome measure)) and neurophysiological (changes in motor evoked potentials (MEPs)) assessments were performed prior to and following the intervention period.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The associative group significantly improved functional recovery with respect to the control group (median (interquartile range) LE‐FM improvement: 6.5 (3.5‐8.25) and 3 (0.75‐3), respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.029). Significant increases in MEP amplitude were seen following all sessions in the associative group only (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;’s≤0.006).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first evidence of a clinical effect of a neuromodulatory intervention in the subacute phase of stroke. This was evident with relatively few repetitions in comparison to available techniques, making it a clinically‐viable approach. The results indicate the potential of the proposed neuromodulation system in daily clinical routine for stroke rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In electrophysiology, microelectrodes are the primary source for recording
neural data of single neurons (single unit activity). These microelectrodes can
be implanted individually, or in the form of microelectrodes arrays, consisting
of hundreds of electrodes. During recordings, some channels capture the
activity of neurons, which is usually contaminated with external artifacts and
noise. Another considerable fraction of channels does not record any neural
data, but external artifacts and noise. Therefore, an automatic identification
and tracking of channels containing neural data is of great significance and
can accelerate the process of analysis, e.g. automatic selection of meaningful
channels during offline and online spike sorting. Another important aspect is
the selection of meaningful channels during online decoding in brain-computer
interface applications, where threshold crossing events are usually for feature
extraction, even though they do not necessarily correspond to neural events.
Here, we propose a novel algorithm based on the newly introduced way of feature
vector extraction and a supervised deep learning method: a universal spike
classifier (USC). The USC enables us to address both above-raised issues. The
USC uses the standard architecture of convolutional neural networks (Conv net).
It takes the batch of the waveforms, instead of a single waveform as an input,
propagates it through the multilayered structure, and finally classifies it as
a channel containing neural spike data or artifacts. We have trained the model
of USC on data recorded from single tetraplegic patient with Utah arrays
implanted in different brain areas. This trained model was then evaluated
without retraining on the data collected from six epileptic patients implanted
with depth electrodes and two tetraplegic patients implanted with two Utah
arrays, individually.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02881</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We relate the concepts used in decentralized ledger technology to studies of
episodic memory in the mammalian brain. Specifically, we introduce the standard
concepts of linked list, hash functions, and sharding, from computer science.
We argue that these concepts may be more relevant to studies of the neural
mechanisms of memory than has been previously appreciated. In turn, we also
highlight that certain phenomena studied in the brain, namely metacognition,
reality monitoring, and how perceptual conscious experiences come about, may
inspire development in blockchain technology too, specifically regarding
probabilistic consensus protocols.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Experiments in various neural systems found avalanches: bursts of activity
with characteristics typical for critical dynamics. A possible explanation for
their occurrence is an underlying network that self-organizes into a critical
state. We propose a simple spiking model for developing neural networks,
showing how these may &quot;grow into&quot; criticality. Avalanches generated by our
model correspond to clusters of widely applied Hawkes processes. We
analytically derive the cluster size and duration distributions and find that
they agree with those of experimentally observed neuronal avalanches.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02795</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we developed a method to estimate the relationship between
stimulation current and volatility during isometric contraction. In functional
electrical stimulation (FES), joints are driven by applying voltage to muscles.
This technology has been used for a long time in the field of rehabilitation,
and recently application oriented research has been reported. However,
estimation of the relationship between stimulus value and exercise capacity has
not been discussed to a great extent. Therefore, in this study, a human muscle
model was estimated using the transfer function estimation method with fast
Fourier transform. It was found that the relationship between stimulation
current and force exerted could be expressed by a first-order lag system. In
verification of the force estimate, the ability of the proposed model to
estimate the exerted force under steady state response was found to be good.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The superior temporal gyrus (STG) region of cortex critically contributes to
speech recognition. In this work, we show that a proposed WaveNet, with limited
available data, is able to reconstruct speech stimuli from STG intracranial
recordings. We further investigate the impulse response of the fitted model for
each recording electrode and observe phoneme level temporospectral tuning
properties for the recorded area of cortex. This discovery is consistent with
previous studies implicating the posterior STG (pSTG) in a phonetic
representation of speech and provides detailed acoustic features that certain
electrode sites possibly extract during speech recognition.

	<description>Ogasawara et al. find that dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra are activated when animals are required to inhibit inappropriate actions. Disruption of nigrostriatal dopamine signaling impaired this inhibition behavior, as seen in neurological/psychiatric disorders with dopaminergic dysfunctions.</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Targeted Activation of Cholinergic Interneurons Accounts for the Modulation of Dopamine by Striatal Nicotinic Receptors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0397-17.2018?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Striatal dopamine (DA) is a major player in action selection and reinforcement. DA release is under strong local control by striatal ACh acting at axonal nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) on DA axons. Striatal nAChRs have been shown to control how DA is released in response to ascending activity from DA neurons, and they also directly drive DA release following synchronized activity in a small local cholinergic network. The source of striatal ACh has been thought to arise solely from intrinsic cholinergic interneurons (ChIs), but recent findings have identified a source of cholinergic inputs to striatum from brainstem nuclei, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). Here, we used targeted optogenetic activation alongside DA detection with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to test whether ChIs alone and/or brainstem afferents to the striatum can account for how ACh drives and modulates DA release in rat striatum. We demonstrate that targeted transient light activation of rat striatal ChIs drives striatal DA release, corroborating and extending previous observations in mouse to rat. However, the same light stimulation targeted to cholinergic brainstem afferents did not drive DA release, and nor did it modulate DA release activated subsequently by electrical stimulation, whereas targeted activation of ChIs did so. We were unable to obtain any evidence for DA modulation by PPN/LDT stimulation. By contrast, we could readily identify that striatal ChIs alone are sufficient to provide a source of ACh that powerfully regulates DA via nAChRs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: COMT Inhibition Alters Cue-Evoked Oscillatory Dynamics during Alcohol Drinking in the Rat</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Alterations in the corticostriatal system have been implicated in numerous substance use disorders, including alcohol use disorder (AUD). Adaptations in this neural system are associated with enhanced drug-seeking behaviors following exposure to cues predicting drug availability. Therefore, understanding how potential treatments alter neural activity in this system could lead to more refined and effective approaches for AUD. Local field potentials (LFPs) were acquired simultaneously in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NA) of both alcohol preferring (P) and Wistar rats engaged in a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm wherein a light cue signaled the availability of ethanol (EtOH). On test days, the catechol-o-methyl-transferase (COMT) inhibitor tolcapone was administered prior to conditioning. Stimulus-evoked voltage changes were observed following the presentation of the EtOH cue in both strains and were most pronounced in the PFC of P rats. Phase analyses of LFPs in the  band (5–11 Hz) revealed that PFC-NA synchrony was reduced in P rats relative to Wistars but was robustly increased during drinking. Presentation of the cue resulted in a larger phase reset in the PFC of P rats but not Wistars, an effect that was attenuated by tolcapone. Additionally, tolcapone reduced cued EtOH intake in P rat but not Wistars. These results suggest a link between corticostriatal synchrony and genetic risk for excessive drinking. Moreover, inhibition of COMT within these systems may result in reduced attribution of salience to reward paired stimuli via modulation of stimulus-evoked changes to cortical oscillations in genetically susceptible populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this Review, Dallérac and colleagues discuss the determinants of these divergent regulations throughout life focusing on astroglial intrinsic heterogeneity, developmental changes and activity-dependent processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrn/rss/current/~4/KKkiuqKLhUY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;How does attention route information from sensory to high-order areas as a function of task, within the relatively fixed topology of the brain? In this study, participants were simultaneously presented with 2 unrelated stories—one spoken and one written—and asked to attend one while ignoring the other. We used fMRI and a novel intersubject correlation analysis to track the spread of information along the processing hierarchy as a function of task. Processing the unattended spoken (written) information was confined to auditory (visual) cortices. In contrast, attending to the spoken (written) story enhanced the stimulus-selective responses in sensory regions and allowed it to spread into higher-order areas. Surprisingly, we found that the story-specific spoken (written) responses for the attended story also reached secondary visual (auditory) regions of the unattended sensory modality. These results demonstrate how attention enhances the processing of attended input and allows it to propagate across brain areas.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The GABA Developmental Shift Is Abolished by Maternal Immune Activation Already at Birth</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy279</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that maternal immune activation (MIA) leads to developmental brain disorders, but whether the pathogenic mechanism impacts neurons already at birth is not known. We now report that MIA abolishes in mice the oxytocin-mediated delivery γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing in CA3 pyramidal neurons, and this is restored by the NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist bumetanide. Furthermore, MIA hippocampal pyramidal neurons at birth have a more exuberant apical arbor organization and increased apical dendritic length than age-matched controls. The frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic postsynaptic currents is also increased in MIA offspring, as well as the pairwise correlation of the synchronized firing of active cells in CA3. These alterations produced by MIA persist, since at P14–15 GABA action remains depolarizing, produces excitatory action, and network activity remains elevated with a higher frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic postsynaptic currents. Therefore, the pathogenic actions of MIA lead to important morphophysiological and network alterations in the hippocampus already at birth.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Selective Role of the Putamen in Serial Reversal Learning in the Marmoset</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fronto-striatal circuitry involving the orbitofrontal cortex has been identified as mediating successful reversal of stimulus-outcome contingencies. The region of the striatum that most contributes to reversal learning remains unclear, with studies in primates implicating both caudate nucleus and putamen. We trained four marmosets on a touchscreen-based serial reversal task and implanted each with cannulae targeting both putamen and caudate bilaterally. This allowed reversible inactivation of the two areas within the same monkeys, but across separate sessions, to directly investigate their respective contributions to reversal performance. Behavioral sensitivity to the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; agonist muscimol varied across subjects and between brain regions, so each marmoset received a range of doses. Intermediate doses of intra-putamen muscimol selectively impaired reversal performance, leaving the baseline discrimination phase unchanged. There was no effect of low doses and high doses were generally disruptive. By contrast, low doses of intra-caudate muscimol improved reversal performance, while high doses impaired both reversal and baseline discrimination performance. These data provide evidence for a specific role of the putamen in serial reversal learning, which may reflect the more habitual nature of repeated reversals using the same stimulus pair.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: 27-Hydroxycholesterol Induces Aberrant Morphology and Synaptic Dysfunction in Hippocampal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy274</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy274/5158244?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, but how high blood cholesterol levels are linked to neurodegeneration is still unknown. Here, we show that an excess of the blood–brain barrier permeable cholesterol metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH) impairs neuronal morphology and reduces hippocampal spine density and the levels of the postsynaptic protein PSD95. Dendritic spines are the main postsynaptic elements of excitatory synapses and are crucial structures for memory and cognition. Furthermore, PSD95 has an essential function for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. PSD95 synthesis is controlled by the REST–miR124a–PTBP1 axis. Here, we report that high levels of 27-OH induce REST–miR124a–PTBP1 axis dysregulation in a possible RxRγ-dependent manner, suggesting that 27-OH reduces PSD95 levels through this mechanism. Our results reveal a possible molecular link between hypercholesterolemia and neurodegeneration. We discuss the possibility that reduction of 27-OH levels could be a useful strategy for preventing memory and cognitive decline in neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Homology and Specificity of Natural Sound-Encoding in Human and Monkey Auditory Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Understanding homologies and differences in auditory cortical processing in human and nonhuman primates is an essential step in elucidating the neurobiology of speech and language. Using fMRI responses to natural sounds, we investigated the representation of multiple acoustic features in auditory cortex of awake macaques and humans. Comparative analyses revealed homologous large-scale topographies not only for frequency but also for temporal and spectral modulations. In both species, posterior regions preferably encoded relatively fast temporal and coarse spectral information, whereas anterior regions encoded slow temporal and fine spectral modulations. Conversely, we observed a striking interspecies difference in cortical sensitivity to temporal modulations: While decoding from macaque auditory cortex was most accurate at fast rates (&amp;gt; 30 Hz), humans had highest sensitivity to ~3 Hz, a relevant rate for speech analysis. These findings suggest that characteristic tuning of human auditory cortex to slow temporal modulations is unique and may have emerged as a critical step in the evolution of speech and language.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Resting-State Activity in High-Order Visual Areas as a Window into Natural Human Brain Activations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy242</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy242/5158238?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A major limitation of conventional human brain research has been its basis in highly artificial laboratory experiments. Due to technical constraints, little is known about the nature of cortical activations during ecological real life. We have previously proposed the “spontaneous trait reactivation (STR)” hypothesis arguing that resting-state patterns, which emerge spontaneously in the absence of external stimulus, reflect the statistics of habitual cortical activations during real life. Therefore, these patterns can serve as a window into daily life cortical activity. A straightforward prediction of this hypothesis is that spontaneous patterns should preferentially correlate to patterns generated by naturalistic stimuli compared with artificial ones. Here we targeted high-level category-selective visual areas and tested this prediction by comparing BOLD functional connectivity patterns formed during rest to patterns formed in response to naturalistic stimuli, as well as to more artificial category-selective, dynamic stimuli. Our results revealed a significant correlation between the resting-state patterns and functional connectivity patterns generated by naturalistic stimuli. Furthermore, the correlations to naturalistic stimuli were significantly higher than those found between resting-state patterns and those generated by artificial control stimuli. These findings provide evidence of a stringent link between spontaneous patterns and the activation patterns during natural vision.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Fingolimod enhances the efficacy of delayed alteplase administration in acute ischemic stroke by promoting anterograde reperfusion and retrograde collateral flow</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25352?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25352?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of coadministration of fingolimod with alteplase in acute ischemic stroke patients in a delayed time window.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a prospective, randomized, open‐label, blinded endpoint clinical trial, enrolling patients with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery proximal occlusion within 4.5 to 6 hours from symptom onset. Patients were randomly assigned to receive alteplase alone or alteplase with fingolimod. All patients underwent pretreatment and 24‐hour noncontrast computed tomography (CT)/perfusion CT/CT angiography. The coprimary endpoints were the decrease of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores over 24 hours and the favorable shift of modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) distribution at day 90. Exploratory outcomes included vessel recanalization, anterograde reperfusion, and retrograde reperfusion of collateral flow.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each treatment group included 23 patients. Compared with alteplase alone, patients receiving fingolimod plus alteplase exhibited better early clinical improvement at 24 hours and a favorable shift of mRS distribution at day 90. In addition, patients who received fingolimod and alteplase exhibited a greater reduction in the perfusion lesion accompanied by suppressed infarct growth by 24 hours. Fingolimod in conjunction with alteplase significantly improved anterograde reperfusion of downstream territory and prevented the failure of retrograde reperfusion from collateral circulation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingolimod may enhance the efficacy of alteplase administration in the 4.5‐ to 6‐hour time window in patients with a proximal cerebral arterial occlusion and salvageable penumbral tissue by promoting both anterograde reperfusion and retrograde collateral flow. These findings are instructive for the design of future trials of recanalization therapies in extended time windows. Ann Neurol 2018;1–12&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Reduced brain amyloid burden in elderly patients with narcolepsy type 1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25373?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25373?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether brain amyloid burden in elderly patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is lower than in controls, and to assess in patients with NT1 the relationships between amyloid burden, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), CSF orexin‐A, and cognitive profile.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐florbetapir‐positron emission tomography (PET) data were compared in patients with NT1 aged ≥65 years (n=23) and in age‐ and sex‐matched controls free of clinical dementia selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n=69) and the Multi‐domain Intervention Alzheimer's Prevention Trial (MAPT‐AV45; n=23) cohorts. The standardized uptake values (SUV) of the cortical retention index for six regions of interest were computed and averaged to create a mean SUV ratio normalized to three subcortical reference regions (cerebellum, pons and a composite region). A cortical/cerebellum SUV ratio ≥1.17 defined positive PET amyloid.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower cortical amyloid burden was observed in the NT1 than in the ADNI and MAPT‐AV45 groups (mean cortical/cerebellum SUV ratios: 0.95±0.15, 1.11±0.18 (p&amp;lt;0.0001), and 1.14 ±0.17 (p=0.0005), respectively). Similar results were obtained with all subcortical reference regions and for all cortical regions of interest, except cingulum. Only one patient with NT1 (4.4%) had positive PET‐amyloid compared with 27.5% in the ADNI and 30.4% in the MAPT group. In the NT1 group, cortical or regional amyloid load was not associated with CSF orexin‐A, CSF AD biomarkers or neuropsychological profile.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower brain amyloid burden, assessed by &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐florbetapir‐PET, in patients with NT1 suggests delayed appearance of amyloid plaques.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: The neural basis of induced phantom limb pain relief</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25371?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25371?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phantom limb pain (PLP) is notoriously difficult to treat, partly due to an incomplete understanding of PLP‐related disease mechanisms. Non‐invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is used to modulate plasticity in various neuropathological diseases, including chronic pain. While NIBS can alleviate neuropathic pain (including PLP), both disease and treatment mechanisms remain tenuous. Insight into the mechanisms underlying both PLP and NIBS‐induced PLP relief is needed for future implementation of such treatment and generalisation to related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used a within‐participants, double‐blind, and sham‐controlled design to alleviate PLP via task‐concurrent NIBS over the primary sensorimotor missing hand cortex (S1/M1). To specifically influence missing hand signal processing, amputees performed phantom hand movements during anodal transcranial direct current stimulation. Brain activity was monitored using neuroimaging during and after NIBS. PLP ratings were obtained throughout the week after stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single session of intervention NIBS significantly relieved PLP, with effects lasting at least one week. PLP relief associated with reduced activity in the S1/M1 missing hand cortex after stimulation. Critically, PLP relief and reduced S1/M1 activity correlated with preceding activity changes during stimulation in the mid‐ and posterior insula and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observed correlation between PLP relief and decreased S1/M1 activity confirms our previous findings linking PLP with increased S1/M1 activity. Our results further highlight the driving role of the mid‐ and posterior insula, as well as S2, in modulating PLP. Lastly, our novel PLP intervention using task‐concurrent NIBS opens new avenues for developing treatment for PLP and related pain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A professional violinist reported increasing difficulties playing the violin. He executed the initial half of the musical piece well, but produced an increasing number of mistakes during the second half. Neurological examination was remarkable for bradykinesia and tremor. Formal acoustic analysis of finger taps and pronation‐supination showed a decrement in sound intensity and number of taps over time. Oscillations in performance correlated with a parkinsonian tremor. We interpret these findings as the audible equivalent of bradykinesia and tremor. Listening to bradykinesia and quantifying its decrement using acoustic analysis may offer a simple, objective and reliable supplement to the neurological examination.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with visual snow syndrome (VS) suffer from a debilitating continuous visual disturbance of unknown mechanism. The present study tested the hypothesis of dysfunctional visual processing using visual evoked potentials. Eighteen patients were compared to age‐matched migraineurs (M) and healthy controls (C) using two‐way ANOVA with group (VS, M, C) and gender as factors. Visual evoked potentials from patients with VS demonstrated increased N145 latency (in ms; VS: 152.7±7.9 vs. M: 145.3±9.8 vs. C: 145.5±9.4; F=3.28; p=0.046) and reduced N75‐P100 amplitudes (in μV; VS: 7.4±3.5 vs. M: 12.5±4.7 vs. C: 10.8±3.4; F=3.16; p=0.051). Dunnett post‐hoc analysis was significant for all comparisons between VS and controls. These findings are in agreement with the idea that the primary disturbance in VS is a dysfunction of the visual association cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a European‐only and trans‐ancestral genome‐wide association meta‐analysis in 72,147 stroke patients and 823,869 controls using data from UK Biobank (UKB) and the MEGASTROKE consortium. We identified an exonic polymorphism in &lt;i&gt;NOS3&lt;/i&gt; (rs1799983, p.Glu298Asp; p=2.2E‐8; OR=1.05[1.04‐1.07]) and variants in an intron of &lt;i&gt;COL4A1&lt;/i&gt; (rs9521634, p‐value=3.8E‐8, OR=1.04[1.03‐1.06]) and near &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt; (rs720470, p=6.1E‐9; OR=1.05[1.03‐1.07]) at genome‐wide significance for stroke. Effect sizes of known stroke loci were highly correlated between UKB and MEGASTROKE. Using Mendelian Randomization we further show that genetic variation in the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) – nitric oxide (NO) pathway in part affects stroke risk via variation in blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>In 2006, Ma et al. presented an elegant theory for how populations of neurons might represent uncertainty to perform Bayesian inference. Critically, according to this theory, neural variability is no longer a nuisance, but rather a vital part of how the brain encodes probability distributions and performs computations with them.</description>

	<description>Large-scale efforts are underway to map the neuronal connectomes of various animal species. In 1986 White et al. reported the first complete reconstruction of the nervous system connectome of an animal. Largely through manual reconstruction of serial electron micrographs, the authors characterized the morphology of each of the 302 neurons of the adult nematode C. elegans, and mapped the chemical and electrical synapses that connect them. This wiring diagram has profoundly influenced behavioral neurobiology and network science, and it continues to offer a guide for the impact of connectomics on neurobiology.</description>

	<description>Over the past half-century, we have gained significant insights into the molecular biology of long-term memory storage at the level of the synapse. In recent years, our understanding of the cellular architecture supporting long-term memory traces has also substantially improved. However, the molecular biology of consolidation at the level of neuronal systems has been relatively neglected. In this opinion article, we first examine our current understanding of the cellular mechanisms of synaptic consolidation.</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: β2‐adrenoreceptor medications and risk of Parkinson disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25341?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25341?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study observed a 2‐fold greater risk of Parkinson disease (PD) in relation to the β2‐adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol and a markedly lower risk of PD for the β2‐adrenoreceptor agonist salbutamol. We examined whether confounding by clinical indication for these medications, that is, tremor and smoking‐related pulmonary conditions, explained these associations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a large, population‐based case–control study of United States Medicare beneficiaries in 2009 with diagnosis codes, procedure codes, and prescription data (48,295 incident PD cases, 52,324 controls), we examined the risk of PD in relation to use of selected β antagonists (propranolol, carvedilol, metoprolol), the β2 agonist salbutamol, and other medications used for the same clinical indications (primidone, inhaled corticosteroids). We adjusted for demographics, smoking, and overall use of medical care. We then examined the effect of also adjusting for clinical indication and applying medication exposure lagging.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propranolol appeared to increase PD risk (odds ratio [OR] = 3.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.31–3.96). When we adjusted for tremor or abnormal involuntary movement prior to the PD diagnosis/reference date and lagged propranolol exposure, the association was 0.97 (95% CI = 0.80–1.18). Primidone, also used for tremor, was similarly sensitive to this adjustment and lagging. β Antagonists not indicated for tremor appeared to reduce PD risk (carvedilol: OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.73–0.81; metoprolol: OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.91–0.97) and were insensitive to adjustment for indications and lagging.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Dissociation of Appetitive Overexpectation and Extinction in the Infralimic Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy248</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy248/5146174?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Behavioral change is paramount to adaptive behavior. Two ways to achieve alterations in previously established behavior are extinction and overexpectation. The infralimbic (IL) portion of the medial prefrontal cortex controls the inhibition of previously established aversive behavioral responses in extinction. The role of the IL cortex in behavioral modification in appetitive Pavlovian associations remains poorly understood. Here, we seek to determine if the IL cortex modulates overexpectation and extinction of reward learning. Using overexpectation or extinction to achieve a reduction in behavior, the present findings uncover a dissociable role for the IL cortex in these paradigms. Pharmacologically inactivating the IL cortex left overexpectation intact. In contrast, pre-training manipulations in the IL cortex prior to extinction facilitated the reduction in conditioned responding but led to a disrupted extinction retrieval on test drug-free. Additional studies confirmed that this effect is restricted to the IL and not dependent on the dorsally-located prelimbic cortex. Together, these results show that the IL cortex underlies extinction but not overexpectation-driven reduction in behavior, which may be due to regulating the expression of conditioned responses influenced by stimulus–response associations rather than stimulus–stimulus associations.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Mapping the Conformational Landscape of Glutamate Receptors Using Single Molecule FRET</title>

	<description>The ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system. These receptors provide a range of temporally diverse signals which stem from subunit composition and also from the inherent ability of each member to occupy multiple functional states, the distribution of which can be altered by small molecule modulators and binding partners. Hence it becomes essential to characterize the conformational landscape of the receptors under this variety of different conditions.</description>
