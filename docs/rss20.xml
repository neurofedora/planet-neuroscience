	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Correction to: Intra-arterial Stem Cell Therapy Diminishes Inflammasome Activation After Ischemic Stroke: a Possible Role of Acid Sensing Ion Channel 1a</title>

	<description>&lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;It has come to our notice that there was an inadvertent misupload of Fig. 2 (c, d) in the loading control (GAPDH) for ASIC1a and NLRP1 blots. We would like to replace the same with the correct image. This change anyhow does not affect the conclusion of the study. However, the use of GAPDH as a loading control for stroke studies sometimes is debatable (Zhai et al. 2014; Kang et al. 2018). Hence, we repeated our experiments to check the expression of ASIC1a and NLRP1 at different time points following stroke, using beta actin as a loading control. We found that at 24 h post stroke, maximal and significant expression of both ASIC1a and NLRP1 was observed (Fig. 2 e, f). The expression at 48 and 72 h post stroke were not significantly different as compared to that of sham. The expression results obtained using beta actin as a loading control were concurrent with the previous results published with GAPDH as a loading control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;G9a is essential for dendritic plasticity and is associated with neurological disorders. The possible relationship between age-related hearing loss and G9a expression in the auditory cortex has not been fully explored. This study aimed to understand the expression patterns of G9a-mediated histone methylations in the auditory cortex during aging. Using immunofluorescence and western blotting, we demonstrated that a significant reduction in G9a expression observed in the auditory cortex of 24-month-old rats compared to 3-month-old rats, was associated with remarkable hearing threshold elevation and hair cell loss. Correspondingly, histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) mono- and dimethylation (marked by H3K9me1 and H3K9me2, respectively), which were regulated by G9a activity, also evidently decreased during aging. These findings, which merit further investigation, suggest a possible association between G9a-mediated histone methylations and central age-related hearing disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Genetic factors play a major role in the etiopathogenesis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CDH13&lt;/em&gt; (rs6565113, rs11150556) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; (rs6551665, rs6858066, rs1947274, rs2345039) gene polymorphisms and ADHD. We also sought to examine possible relationships between these polymorphisms and the clinical course and treatment response in ADHD. A total of 120 patients (79% boys), aged 6 to 18 years, newly diagnosed (medication-naïve) with ADHD according to the DSM-5 and a group of 126 controls (74% girls) were enrolled in the study. We examined the association between the aforementioned polymorphisms and ADHD. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate factors influencing the treatment response of ADHD. A significant difference was found between ADHD and control groups in terms of genotype distribution of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; rs6551665 and rs1947274 polymorphisms. The results also showed that having the GG genotype of rs6551665 and CC genotype of rs1947274 of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; gene was associated with risk for ADHD, and this relationship was more prominent in male participants. In the multivariate logistic regression model established with variables shown to have a significant relationship with treatment response, the presence of the GG genotype of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; rs6551665 polymorphism and high severity of ADHD assessed by CGI-S were associated with poor response to treatment. This study is the first study to investigate the relationship between ADHD and these polymorphisms among Turkish adolescents. Our results imply that the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; rs6551665 and rs1947274 polymorphisms have a significant effect on ADHD in a Turkish population, and support previous observations that the presence of the GG genotype of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LPHN3&lt;/em&gt; rs6551665 polymorphism may be associated with poor response to treatment in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The pharmacological inhibition of glial activation is one of the new approaches for combating neuropathic pain in which the role of glia in the modulation of neuropathic pain has attracted significant interest and attention. Neuron-glial crosstalk is achieved with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;-methyl-D-aspartate-2B receptor (NMDAR-2B) activation. This study aims to determine the effect of ifenprodil, a potent noncompetitive NMDAR-2B antagonist, on activated microglia, brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) and downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM) protein expression in the spinal cord of streptozotocin-induced painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) rats following formalin injection. In this experimentation, 48 Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly selected and divided into four groups: (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 12): control, PDN, and ifenprodil-treated PDN rats at 0.5 μg or 1.0 μg for 7 days. Type I diabetes mellitus was then induced by injecting streptozotocin (60 mg/kg, i.p.) into the rats which were then over a 2-week period allowed to progress into the early phase of PDN. Ifenprodil was administered in PDN rats while saline was administered intrathecally in the control group. A formalin test was conducted during the fourth week to induce inflammatory nerve injury, in which the rats were sacrificed at 72 h post-formalin injection. The lumbar enlargement region (L4–L5) of the spinal cord was dissected for immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. The results demonstrated a significant increase in formalin-induced flinching and licking behavior with an increased spinal expression of activated microglia, BDNF and DREAM proteins. It was also shown that the ifenprodil-treated rats following both doses reduced the extent of their flinching and duration of licking in PDN in a dose-dependent manner. As such, ifenprodil successfully demonstrated inhibition against microglia activation and suppressed the expression of BDNF and DREAM proteins in the spinal cord of PDN rats. In conclusion, ifenprodil may alleviate PDN by suppressing spinal microglia activation, BDNF and DREAM proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: NEAT1 Decreasing Suppresses Parkinson’s Disease Progression via Acting as miR-1301-3p Sponge</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01660-2</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays a crucial role in multiple disorders, while the role of it in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is still unclear. Here, the increased lncRNA NEAT1 was discovered in MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced SH-SY5Y cells. Then, we proved that NEAT1 decreasing suppressed MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced neuronal apoptosis, upregulation of α-syn and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Rescue experiments shown that the inhibition of NEAT1 decreasing to MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent neuronal apoptosis can be reversed by overexpressed α-syn. Subsequently, we indicated the interaction between NEAT1 and miR-1301-3p, as well as between NEAT1 and miR-5047. Interesting, we found that NEAT1 decreasing repressed the expression of GJB1, a downstream target of miR-1301-3p and miR-5047, through promoting miR-1301-3p rather than miR-5047 expression. Finally, we transfected miR-1301-3p inhibitor to MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced SH-SY5Y cells following si-NEAT1, and found that downregulation of NEAT1 repressed α-syn-mediated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome through regulating miR-1301-3p/GJB1 signaling pathway. Overall, our data demonstrated that NEAT1 decreasing effectively suppressed MPP&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced neuronal apoptosis. Mechanismly, downregulation of NEAT1 repressed α-syn-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome via inhibiting the expression of GJB1 by targeting miR-1301-3p. Our study supported a new and reliable evidence for lncRNA NEAT1 as a potential target for PD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Integrated Systems Analysis Explores Dysfunctional Molecular Modules and Regulatory Factors in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder involving multiple genes that occurs in early childhood, and a number of risk genes have been reported in previous studies. However, the molecular mechanism of the polygenic regulation leading to pathological changes in ASD remains unclear. First, we identified 8 dysregulated gene coexpression modules by analyzing blood transcriptome data from 96 children with ASD and 42 controls. These modules are rich in ASD risk genes and function related to metabolism, immunity, neurodevelopment, and signaling. The regulatory factors of each module including microRNA (miRNA) and transcription factors (TFs) were subsequently predicted based on transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. We identified a set of miRNAs that regulate metabolic and immune modules, as well as transcription factors that cause dysregulation of the modules, and we constructed a coregulatory network between the regulatory factors and modules. Our work reveals dysfunctional modules in children with ASD, elucidates the role of miRNA and transcription factor dysregulation in the pathophysiology of ASD, and helps us to further understand the underlying molecular mechanism of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Involvement of Oxidative Stress and Nerve Growth Factor in Behavioral and Biochemical Deficits of Experimentally Induced Musculoskeletal Pain in Mice: Ameliorative Effects of Heraclin</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Musculoskeletal pain is a widespread complex regional pain syndrome associated with altered emotional and cognitive functioning along with heightened physical disability that has become a global health concern. Effective management of this disorder and associated disabilities includes accurate diagnosis of its biomarkers and instituting mechanism–based therapeutic interventions. Herein, we explored the role of heraclin, a plant-derived molecule, in musculoskeletal pain and its underlying mechanistic approaches in an experimental mouse model. Reserpine (0.5 mg/kg) for 3 consecutive days evoked hyperalgesia, motor incoordination, lack of exploratory behavior, anxiety, and cognition lapse in mice. Reserpine-challenged mice displayed higher serum cytokine level, altered brain neurotransmitter content, elevated brain and muscle oxidative stress, and upregulated brain nerve growth factor receptor expression. Treatment with heraclin (10 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days) exerted analgesic effect and improved motor coordination and memory deficits in mice. Heraclin arrested serum cytokine rise, normalized brain neurotransmitter content, reduced tissue oxidative stress, and downregulated the nerve growth factor receptor expression. Therefore, it may be suggested that heraclin exerts beneficial effects against reserpine-induced musculoskeletal pain disorder possibly through the attenuation of NGFR-mediated pain and inflammatory signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To report the phenomenology of movement disorder (MD) in neurological Wilson disease (NWD), and correlate these with MRI, and biomarkers of oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and inflammation. Eighty-two patients were included, and their phenomenology of MD was categorized. The severity of dystonia was assessed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden score, and chorea, athetosis, myoclonus, and tremor on a 0–4 scale. The MRI changes were noted. Serum glutamate, cytokines, and oxidative stress markers were measured. Movement disorders were noted in 78/82 (95.1%) patients and included dystonia in 69 (84.1%), chorea in 31 (37.8%), tremor in 24 (29.3%), parkinsonism in 19 (23.2%), athetosis in 13 (15.9%), and myoclonus in 9 (11.0%) patients. Dystonia was more frequently observed in the patients with thalamic (76.8 vs 23.2%), globus pallidus (72.0 vs 28.0%), putamen (69.5 vs 30.5%), caudate (68.3 vs 31.7%) and brainstem (61.0 vs 39.0%) involvement, and tremor with cerebellar involvement (37.5 vs 5.2%). The median age of onset of neurological symptoms was 12 (5–50) years. WD patients had higher levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutamate, and cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNFα) and lower levels of glutathione and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) compared with the controls. Serum glutamate, IL-6, IL-8, and plasma MDA levels were increased with increasing neurological severity, while glutathione and TAC levels decreased. The severity of dystonia related to the number of MRI lesions. MD is the commonest neurological symptoms in WD. Oxidative stress, glutamate, and cytokine levels are increased in WD and correlate with neurological severity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Isolated dystonia is a common movement disorder often caused by genetic mutations, although it is predominantly sporadic in nature. Common variants of dystonia-related genes were reported to be risk factors for idiopathic isolated dystonia. In this study, we aimed to analyse the roles of previously reported GTP cyclohydrolase (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GCH1&lt;/em&gt;) and Torsin family 1 member A (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TOR1A&lt;/em&gt;) polymorphisms in an Indian isolated dystonia case-control group. A total of 292 sporadic isolated dystonia patients and 316 control individuals were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GCH1&lt;/em&gt; (rs3759664:G &amp;gt; A, rs12147422:A &amp;gt; G and rs10483639:C &amp;gt; G) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TOR1A&lt;/em&gt; (rs13300897:G &amp;gt; A, rs1801968:G &amp;gt; C, rs1182:G &amp;gt; T and rs3842225:G &amp;gt; Δ) using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and confirmed by direct Sanger sequencing. The statistical significance of allelic, genotypic and haplotypic associations of all of the SNPs were evaluated using the two-tailed Fisher exact test. The minor allele (A) of rs3759664 is significantly associated with isolated limb dystonia as a risk factor (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.005). The minor allele (C) of rs1801968 is strongly associated with isolated dystonia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and most of its subtypes. The major allele of rs3842225 (G) may act as a significant risk factor for Writer’s cramp (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03). Four different haplogroups comprising of either rs1182 or rs3842225 or in combination with rs1801968 and rs13300897 were found to be significantly associated with isolated dystonia. No other allelic, genotypic or haplotypic association was found to be significant with isolated dystonia cohort or its endophenotype stratified groups. Our study suggests that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TOR1A&lt;/em&gt; common variants have a significant role in isolated dystonia pathogenesis in the Indian population, whereas SNPs in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GCH1&lt;/em&gt; gene may have a limited role.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;By measuring the cerebral infarction rate and neurological behavioral score of rats in a sham operation group, an MCAO model control group and an &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection treatment group, we explored the therapeutic effects of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection on brain tissue and neuroethological injury in rats. Plasma samples were collected at 18 time points after intravenous injection of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt;. The levels of scutellarin, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, chlorogenic acid and isochlorogenic acid B in rat plasma at the various time points were determined by an HPLC method, and drug concentration versus time plots were constructed to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters. Finally, a PK-PD combined model was used to analyze the relationship between the blood concentration, time and therapeutic effects of the seven active components. The results of the pharmacodynamics studies showed that the cerebral infarction rate of rats in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection group decreased significantly at 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 6 h, 8 h, 18 h, 24 h, 32 h, 40 h and 48 h after cerebral ischemia. Abnormal neurological behavior scores were significantly reduced after 4 h of cerebral ischemia. The pharmacokinetics results showed that the seven chemical constituents in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection reached their highest detection value after 5 min of cerebral ischemia. The lowest detection values of scutellarin and isochlorogenic acid B appeared after 6 h of cerebral ischemia but could not be detected after 8 h. The lowest detection values of 5-caffeoylquinic acid and 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid were found in the third hour of cerebral ischemia but not after 4 h. The lowest detection values of 4-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid and chlorogenic acid were found during the second hour of cerebral ischemia but not at the third hour. However, at 18 h, 24 h, 32 h and 40 h of cerebral ischemia, the cerebral infarction rates of rats in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection group were significantly reduced, with decreased values of 6.22%, 11.71%, 6.92% and 4.96%, respectively, and the effects were stronger than those after 5–20 min of cerebral ischemia. The decreased values reached their highest value after 24 h of cerebral ischemia. Our results show that the effects of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection on reducing the cerebral infarct rate in MCAO model rats are characterized by a fast onset and long maintenance time. The 5-min blood concentration in cerebral ischemia was the highest test value, and after this time, the cerebral infarction rate of MCAO rats began to decrease. However, the peak value of the effects lagged behind that of the plasma concentration. The maximum effective time for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Erigeron breviscapus&lt;/em&gt; injection appeared 24 h after cerebral ischemia, which provides a reference for the screening of specific drugs for ischemic stroke, optimal dosing regimens and rational clinical drug use.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study aimed to clarify the regulation role of miR-708 and miR-335-3p in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) autophagy and apoptosis in glaucoma. Chronic glaucoma mice were established by laser photocoagulation. RGCs were isolated and transfected with a series of plasmids and the cultured in 60 mmHg pressure. miR-335-3p, miR-708, and ATG3 mRNA expressions were detected by qRT-PCR. Protein levels of ATG3, autophagy-related protein LC3, and p62 were detected by Western blot. The apoptosis of RGCs was detected by flow cytometry. The regulation role of miR-335-3p/miR-708 in ATG3 was confirmed by the dual-luciferase reporter gene. The expressions of several miRNAs were measured in retinal tissues from chronic glaucoma mice and RGCs under pressure conditions, and results showed that both miR-335-3p and miR-708 were down-regulated. Besides, the inhibition of miR-708 and miR-335-3p induced the apoptosis of RGCs through promoting autophagy. Also, miR-708 and miR-335-3p could bind to ATG3 and targeted regulated ATG3. Furthermore, the interference with miR-708/miR-335-3p induced RGC apoptosis by up-regulating ATG3 to promote autophagy. In general, the down-regulation of miR-708 and miR-335-3p contributed to the apoptosis of RGCs through promoting autophagy in glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNP rs2043211 in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CARD8&lt;/em&gt; was found to have significant association with ischemic stroke. This study aimed to explore the possible association between rs2043211 and large-artery atherosclerosis stroke in Chinese and explain the possible mechanism. In total, 716 large-artery atherosclerosis stroke patients and 1088 controls were included in the study. Co-dominant, dominant, and recessive genetic models were constructed to evaluate the relationship between rs2043211 and large-artery atherosclerosis stroke risk by odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Stratified and interaction analyses were also done. We selected another 111 large-artery atherosclerosis stroke patients and measured the CARD8 levels in their plasma samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Participants who carry T/T genotype have a higher risk of large-artery atherosclerosis stroke compared with those carry A/T or A/A genotypes (odds ratio = 1.35, 95% confidence intervals 1.03–1.77, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.029). The higher risk for the T/T genotype is still notable in female, people with hypertension, and people without diabetes. In the interaction analysis, compared to the non-hypertensive participants with the wild homozygote type A/A, the hypertensive participants with the A/T+T/T homozygote had 3.27-fold increased risk (odds ratio = 3.27, 95% confidence intervals 2.33–4.60). The A/A group had lower CARD8 levels in plasma than the A/T and T/T group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Further bioinformatics prediction indicated that the rs2043211 could significantly influence the mRNA secondary structure and protein expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CARD8&lt;/em&gt; (eQTL &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 9.8 × 10&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;−198&lt;/sup&gt;). The rs2043211 is probably a novel biomarker for large-artery atherosclerosis stroke in Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Drinking Pattern in Intermittent Access Two-Bottle-Choice Paradigm in Male Wistar Rats Is Associated with Exon-Specific BDNF Expression in the Hippocampus During Early Abstinence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01645-1</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Outbred rats differentially consume alcohol when having free access to it. Among others, BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) is believed to control voluntary ethanol intake in rodents. Meanwhile, expression of BDNF exons in brain regions and epigenetic mechanisms underlying alcohol intake pattern remain obscure. The main goal was to study whether voluntary alcohol drinking pattern affects expression of BDNF exons in selected rat brain regions during early abstinence. Intermittent access to 20% ethanol in a two-bottle-choice procedure (IA2BC) was used as a model of voluntary ethanol intake. Male Wistar rats (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 24) had twenty 24-h sessions of free access to two-bottle choice (water or 20% ethanol) with 24-h withdrawal periods (water only). Control animals had access to water only (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 11). After finishing IA2BC, the animals were divided according to the compliance of ethanol intake pattern with gradual escalation, a key feature of the paradigm. To access potential behavioral disturbances during the early abstinence, rats were consequently tested in the open field test, the elevated plus-maze, and the sucrose preference test. On the third day after the last drinking session, expression of BDNF exons and polypeptide was measured in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and midbrain using quantitative PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to analyze enrichment of positive Ph-CREB (Ser133) and negative EZH2 transcriptional regulators as well as markers of active H3K9ac and repressed H3K27me3 chromatin at exon-specific BDNF promoters in brain regions with affected BDNF expression. During the course of the IA2BC, one part of animals demonstrated gradual escalation from low to high alcohol intake and preference of alcohol over water (a typical pattern for IA2BC) while the other one consumed alcohol at a consistently high level (an unusual pattern for IA2BC). Drinking pattern in the IA2BC does not define differences of behavior in any of the tests during early abstinence. Finally, the IA2BC rats with growing alcohol intake showed elevation of BDNF mRNA containing exon VI in the hippocampus associated with an enhanced H3K9ac occupancy at the respective promoter. Thus, rats differentially consuming alcohol in the IA2BC paradigm differ in epigenetically determined expression of BDNF exon VI in the hippocampus during early abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Influence of Two Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms of the Oxytocin Receptor Gene ( OXTR ) on Empathy: the Mediation Role of a Primary Emotion, CARE</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To feel other’s pain would elicit empathy. Some theorists hypothesized that observing other’s pain may activate the primary emotion of maternal care instinct, which may function as a precursor of empathy. The maternal care instinct and empathy share the same genetic background and neuroendocrine underpinnings. An extensive body of research has shown that maternal behaviors relate to the oxytocinergic system, which has a strong influence on empathy. These studies suggest that the maternal care instinct may mediate the effect of oxytocin receptor gene (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;OXTR&lt;/em&gt;) on empathy. To provide evidence for this mediation, we used the subscale of CARE in Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS) to measure the maternal care instinct and tested two &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;OXTR&lt;/em&gt; single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs53576 and rs13316193, in 880 high school participants (588 females, 292 males; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 16.51 years old, SD = 0.65). Results showed that the genotype of rs13316193 was indirectly associated with empathy via CARE, suggesting a mediating role of CARE in the pathway from &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;OXTR&lt;/em&gt; to empathy. These findings may contribute to an understanding of how empathy emerges when one witnesses another person in pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Metachromatic leukodystrophy(MLD) is an autosomal recessive hereditary neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by the mutations in arylsulfatase A gene (ARSA), which results in the deficiency of ARSA enzyme. The common clinical characteristics of MLD are abnormal gait, and then gradually appears ataxia, spastic quadriplegia, optic atrophy, cortical blindness, and dementia. We describe two patients in China who were diagnosed with MLD and find that the four ARSA gene mutations (c.1115G&amp;gt;A, c.302G&amp;gt;T, c.893 G&amp;gt; T, and c.302G&amp;gt;T) are associated with MLD, in which c.893 G&amp;gt;T and c.302G&amp;gt;T are novel mutations by gene sequence and clinical manifestations, to further understand the relationship between MLD and ARSA gene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The sweet taste receptor, which was identified approximately 20 years ago, mediates sweet taste recognition in humans and other vertebrates. With the development of genomics, metabonomics, structural biology, evolutionary biology, physiology, and neuroscience, as well as technical advances in these areas, our understanding of this important protein has resulted in substantial progress. This article reviews the structure, function, genetics, and evolution of the sweet taste receptor and offers meaningful insights into this G protein–coupled receptor, which may be helpful guidances for personalized feeding, diet, and medicine. Prospective directions for research on sweet taste receptors have also been proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Correlation Between SNPs at the 3'UTR of the FGF2 Gene and Their Interaction with Environmental Factors in Han Chinese Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy Patients</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2 is a neurotrophic factor that can act as a key regulatory molecule of neuroprotection, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis in various injuries. To explore the genetic background of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; gene on DPN development, this study analyzed the correlation between SNPs in the 3'UTR of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; gene and their interaction with environmental factors in DPN patients of Han Chinese nationality. Sanger sequencing was used to analyze the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; genotypes at the rs1048201, rs3804158, rs41348645, rs6854081, rs3747676, rs7683093, rs1476215, and rs1476217 loci in 150 DPN patients, 150 NDPN patients, and 150 healthy control patients. Plasma FGF2 levels were measured in all subjects by using ELISAs. Subjects carrying the T allele at the rs1048201 locus in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; gene had a significantly lower risk of developing DPN compared with subjects carrying the C allele (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.33–0.56, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Subjects with the G genotype at the rs6854081 locus had an exceptionally higher risk of developing DPN than subjects with the T allele (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.39–1.89, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Individuals harboring the G allele at the rs7683093 locus had a markedly higher risk of DPN than patients with the C allele (OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.36–1.87, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Finally, individuals having the A genotype at the rs1476215 locus had a significantly higher risk of DPN than individuals carrying the T allele (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.53–2.02, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). There was an interaction between age and alcohol consumption and the SNP rs7683093. SNPs at rs1048201, rs6854081, rs7683093, and rs1476215 in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; 3’UTR were strongly associated with plasma levels of FGF2 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). SNPs at the rs1048201, rs6854081, rs7683093, and rs1476215 loci in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FGF2&lt;/em&gt; gene were significantly associated with the risk of DPN. A possible mechanism is that these SNPs affect the expression level of FGF2 by interrupting the binding of microRNAs to target sites in the 3'UTR.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are involved in the pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysm (IA) formation and rupture. Interleukin enhancer binding factor 2 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt;) is known as the nuclear factor of activated T cells and regulates cell growth. This study was aimed to explore the effects of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; on IA progression. Human brain VSMCs (hBVSMCs) were transfected with pCDNA3.1(+), pCDNA3.1(+)-ILF2, siRNA-negative control, and siRNA-ILF2. The transfection efficiency was then evaluated by determining &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; expression. The cell viability and apoptosis were determined using Cell Counting Kit-8 and Annexin V-FITC cell apoptosis assay kit, respectively. Real-time quantification PCR (RT-qPCR) was applied to measure the expression levels of apoptosis-related and inflammation-related genes. Finally, western blot was used to detect the expression level of Fas cell surface death receptor 95 (CD95) and Caspase 8. Overexpression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; could significantly increase cell viability and decrease cell apoptosis (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), while knock-down of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; showed opposite trends for hBVSMCs on cell viability and apoptosis (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). RT-qPCR results showed that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; knock-down downregulated the expression levels of BCL2 apoptosis regulator (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BCL2&lt;/em&gt;), transcriptional regulator Myc-like (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;c-Myc&lt;/em&gt;), and caspase 1 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ICE&lt;/em&gt;) whereas upregulated the expression levels of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CD95&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p21&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p53&lt;/em&gt;, and interleukin-13 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;IL-13&lt;/em&gt;). Additionally, the protein expression levels of CD95 and Caspase 8 were significantly decreased after &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; overexpression while were significantly increased after &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; knock-down (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ILF2&lt;/em&gt; knock-down may inhibit cell viability and promote cell apoptosis of hBVSMCs by regulating the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes and suppressing inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is known as a chronic neuroinflammatory disorder typified by an immune-mediated demyelination process with ensuing axonal damage and loss. Sinomenine is a natural alkaloid with different therapeutic benefits, including anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities. In this study, possible beneficial effects of sinomenine in an MOG-induced model of MS were determined. Sinomenine was given to MOG&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;35–55&lt;/sub&gt;-immunized C57BL/6 mice at doses of 25 or 100 mg/kg/day after onset of MS clinical signs till day 30 post-immunization. Analyzed data showed that sinomenine reduces severity of the clinical signs and to some extent decreases tissue level of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, TNFα, IL-17A, and increases level of anti-inflammatory IL-10. In addition, sinomenine successfully attenuated tissue levels of inflammasome NLRP3, ASC, and caspase 1 besides its reduction of intensity of neuroinflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage and loss in lumbar spinal cord specimens. Furthermore, immunoreactivity for MBP decreased and increased for GFAP and Iba1 after MOG-immunization, which was in part reversed upon sinomenine administration. Overall, sinomenine decreases EAE severity, which is attributed to its alleviation of microglial and astrocytic mobilization, demyelination, and axonal damage along with its suppression of neuroinflammation, and its beneficial effect is also associated with its inhibitory effects on inflammasome and pyroptotic pathways; this may be of potential benefit for the primary progressive phenotype of MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Intra-arterial Stem Cell Therapy Diminishes Inflammasome Activation After Ischemic Stroke: a Possible Role of Acid Sensing Ion Channel 1a</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Studies from our lab demonstrated that 1 × 10&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; intra-arterial mesenchymal stem cells (IA MSCs) at 6 h following ischemic stroke are efficacious owing to its maximum homing due to elevated stromal derived factor 1 (SDF1) in the tissue. Further, IA MSCs could abate the infarct progression, improve functional outcome, and decrease expression of calcineurin by modifying neuronal Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels following ischemic stroke. Since stroke pathology also encompasses acidosis that worsens the condition; hence, the role of acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) in this context could not be overlooked. ASIC1a being the major contributor towards acidosis triggers Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions overload which progressively contributes towards exacerbation of neuronal injury following ischemic insult. Inflammasome involvement in ischemic stroke is well reported as activated ASIC1a increases the expression of inflammasome in a pH-dependent manner to trigger inflammatory cascade. Hence, the current study aimed to identify if IA MSCs can decrease the production of inflammasome by attenuating ASIC1a expression to render neuroprotection. Ovariectomized Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) for 90 min were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 1 × 10&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; MSCs IA at 6 h to check for the expression of ASIC1a and inflammasome in different groups. Inhibition studies were carried out to explore the underlying mechanism. Our results demonstrate that IA MSCs improves functional outcome and oxidative stress parameters, and decreases the expression of ASIC1a and inflammasomes in the cortical brain region after ischemic stroke. This study offers a preliminary evidence of the role of IA MSCs in regulating inflammasome by modulating ASIC1a.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The penalization method is a popular technique to provide particle swarm
optimizers with the ability to handle constraints. The downside is the need of
penalization coefficients whose settings are problem-specific. While adaptive
coefficients can be found in the literature, a different adaptive scheme is
proposed in this paper, where coefficients are kept constant. A pseudo-adaptive
relaxation of the tolerances for constraint violations while penalizing only
violations beyond such tolerances results in a pseudo-adaptive penalization. A
particle swarm optimizer is tested on a suite of benchmark problems for three
types of tolerance relaxation: no relaxation; self-tuned initial relaxation
with deterministic decrease; and self-tuned initial relaxation with
pseudo-adaptive decrease. Other authors' results are offered as frames of
reference.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Three basic factors govern the individual behaviour of a particle: the
inertia from its previous displacement; the attraction to its own best
experience; and the attraction to a given neighbour's best experience. The
importance awarded to each factor is controlled by three coefficients: the
inertia; the individuality; and the sociality weights. The social behaviour is
ruled by the structure of the social network, which defines the neighbours that
are to inform of their experiences to a given particle. This paper presents a
study of the influence of different settings of the coefficients as well as of
the combined effect of different settings and different neighbourhood
topologies on the speed and form of convergence.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Some recent research reveals that a topological structure in meta-heuristic
algorithms can effectively enhance the interaction of population, and thus
improve their performance. Inspired by it, we creatively investigate the
effectiveness of using a scale-free network in differential evolution methods,
and propose a scale-free network-based differential evolution method. The
novelties of this paper include a scale-free network-based population structure
and a new mutation operator designed to fully utilize the neighborhood
information provided by a scale-free structure. The elite individuals and
population at the latest generation are both employed to guide a global
optimization process. In this manner, the proposed algorithm owns balanced
exploration and exploitation capabilities to alleviate the drawbacks of
premature convergence. Experimental and statistical analyses are performed on
the CEC'17 benchmark function suite and three real world problems. Results
demonstrate its superior effectiveness and efficiency in comparison with its
competitive peers.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes an efficient video summarization framework that will give
a gist of the entire video in a few key-frames or video skims. Existing video
summarization frameworks are based on algorithms that utilize computer vision
low-level feature extraction or high-level domain level extraction. However,
being the ultimate user of the summarized video, humans remain the most
neglected aspect. Therefore, the proposed paper considers human's role in
summarization and introduces human visual attention-based summarization
techniques. To understand human attention behavior, we have designed and
performed experiments with human participants using electroencephalogram (EEG)
and eye-tracking technology. The EEG and eye-tracking data obtained from the
experimentation are processed simultaneously and used to segment frames
containing useful information from a considerable video volume. Thus, the frame
segmentation primarily relies on the cognitive judgments of human beings. Using
our approach, a video is summarized by 96.5% while maintaining higher precision
and high recall factors. The comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques
demonstrates that the proposed approach yields ceiling-level performance with
reduced computational cost in summarising the videos.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is an adversarial model, and it has
been demonstrated to be effective for various generative tasks. However, GAN
and its variants also suffer from many training problems, such as mode collapse
and gradient vanish. In this paper, we firstly propose a general crossover
operator, which can be widely applied to GANs using evolutionary strategies.
Then we design an evolutionary GAN framework C-GAN based on it. And we combine
the crossover operator with evolutionary generative adversarial networks (EGAN)
to implement the evolutionary generative adversarial networks with crossover
(CE-GAN). Under the premise that a variety of loss functions are used as
mutation operators to generate mutation individuals, we evaluate the generated
samples and allow the mutation individuals to learn experiences from the output
in a knowledge distillation manner, imitating the best output outcome,
resulting in better offspring. Then, we greedily selected the best offspring as
parents for subsequent training using discriminator as evaluator. Experiments
on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CE-GAN and show that our
method is competitive in terms of generated images quality and time efficiency.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11143</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To make informed decisions in natural environments that change over time,
humans must update their beliefs as new observations are gathered. Studies
exploring human inference as a dynamical process that unfolds in time have
focused on situations in which the statistics of observations are
history-independent. Yet temporal structure is everywhere in nature, and yields
history-dependent observations. Do humans modify their inference processes
depending on the latent temporal statistics of their observations? We
investigate this question experimentally and theoretically using a change-point
inference task. We show that humans adapt their inference process to fine
aspects of the temporal structure in the statistics of stimuli. As such, humans
behave qualitatively in a Bayesian fashion, but, quantitatively, deviate away
from optimality. Perhaps more importantly, humans behave suboptimally in that
their responses are not deterministic, but variable. We show that this
variability itself is modulated by the temporal statistics of stimuli. To
elucidate the cognitive algorithm that yields this behavior, we investigate a
broad array of existing and new models that characterize different sources of
suboptimal deviations away from Bayesian inference. While models with 'output
noise' that corrupts the response-selection process are natural candidates,
human behavior is best described by sampling-based inference models, in which
the main ingredient is a compressed approximation of the posterior, represented
through a modest set of random samples and updated over time. This result comes
to complement a growing literature on sample-based representation and learning
in humans.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The advantages of evolutionary algorithms with respect to traditional methods
have been greatly discussed in the literature. While particle swarm optimizers
share such advantages, they outperform evolutionary algorithms in that they
require lower computational cost and easier implementation, involving no
operator design and few coefficients to be tuned. However, even marginal
variations in the settings of these coefficients greatly influence the dynamics
of the swarm. Since this paper does not intend to study their tuning,
general-purpose settings are taken from previous studies, and virtually the
same algorithm is used to optimize a variety of notably different problems.
Thus, following a review of the paradigm, the algorithm is tested on a set of
benchmark functions and engineering problems taken from the literature. Later,
complementary lines of code are incorporated to adapt the method to
combinatorial optimization as it occurs in scheduling problems, and a real case
is solved using the same optimizer with the same settings. The aim is to show
the flexibility and robustness of the approach, which can handle a wide variety
of problems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The sparse coding algorithm has served as a model for early processing in
mammalian vision. It has been assumed that the brain uses sparse coding to
exploit statistical properties of the sensory stream. We hypothesize that
sparse coding discovers patterns from the data set, which can be used to
estimate a set of stimulus parameters by simple readout. In this study, we
chose a model of stereo vision to test our hypothesis. We used the Locally
Competitive Algorithm (LCA), followed by a na\&quot;ive Bayes classifier, to infer
stereo disparity. From the results we report three observations. First,
disparity inference was successful with this naturalistic processing pipeline.
Second, an expanded, highly redundant representation is required to robustly
identify the input patterns. Third, the inference error can be predicted from
the number of active coefficients in the LCA representation. We conclude that
sparse coding can generate a suitable general representation for subsequent
inference tasks. Keywords: Sparse coding; Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA);

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most state of the art decision systems based on Reinforcement Learning (RL)
are data-driven black-box neural models, where it is often difficult to
incorporate expert knowledge into the models or let experts review and validate
the learned decision mechanisms. Knowledge-insertion and model review are
important requirements in many applications involving human health and safety.
One way to bridge the gap between data- and knowledge-driven systems is program
synthesis: replacing a neural network that outputs decisions with one that
generates decision-making code in some programming language. We propose a new
programming language, BF++, designed specifically for neural program synthesis
in a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) setting and generate
programs for a number of standard OpenAI Gym benchmarks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The widespread deployment of surveillance cameras for facial recognition
gives rise to many privacy concerns. This study proposes a privacy-friendly
alternative to large scale facial recognition. While there are multiple
techniques to preserve privacy, our work is based on the minimization principle
which implies minimizing the amount of collected personal data. Instead of
running facial recognition software on all video data, we propose to
automatically extract a high quality snapshot of each detected person without
revealing his or her identity. This snapshot is then encrypted and access is
only granted after legal authorization. We introduce a novel unsupervised face
image quality assessment method which is used to select the high quality
snapshots. For this, we train a variational autoencoder on high quality face
images from a publicly available dataset and use the reconstruction probability
as a metric to estimate the quality of each face crop. We experimentally
confirm that the reconstruction probability can be used as biometric quality
predictor. Unlike most previous studies, we do not rely on a manually defined
face quality metric as everything is learned from data. Our face quality
assessment method outperforms supervised, unsupervised and general image
quality assessment methods on the task of improving face verification
performance by rejecting low quality images. The effectiveness of the whole
system is validated qualitatively on still images and videos.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding principles of neurolocomotion requires the synthesis of neural
activity, sensory feedback, and biomechanics. The nematode \textit{C. elegans}
is an ideal model organism for studying locomotion in an integrated
neuromechanical setting because its neural circuit has a well-characterized
modular structure and its undulatory forward swimming gait adapts to the
surrounding fluid with a shorter wavelength in higher viscosity environments.
This adaptive behavior emerges from the neural modules interacting through a
combination of mechanical forces, neuronal coupling, and sensory feedback
mechanisms. However, the relative contributions of these coupling modes to gait
adaptation are not understood. The model consists of repeated neuromechanical
modules that are coupled through the mechanics of the body, short-range
proprioception, and gap-junctions. The model captures the experimentally
observed gait adaptation over a wide range of mechanical parameters, provided
that the muscle response to input from the nervous system is faster than the
body response to changes in internal and external forces. The modularity of the
model allows the use of the theory of weakly coupled oscillators to identify
the relative roles of body mechanics, gap-junctional coupling, and
proprioceptive coupling in coordinating the undulatory gait. The analysis shows
that the wavelength of body undulations is set by the relative strengths of
these three coupling forms. In a low-viscosity fluid environment, the
competition between gap-junctions and proprioception produces a long wavelength
undulation, which is only achieved in the model with sufficiently strong
gap-junctional coupling.The experimentally observed decrease in wavelength in
response to increasing fluid viscosity is the result of an increase in the
relative strength of mechanical coupling, which promotes a short wavelength.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We provide two characterizations, one axiomatic and the other
neuro-computational, of the dependence of choice probabilities on deadlines,
within the widely used softmax representation \[ p_{t}\left( a,A\right)
=\dfrac{e^{\frac{u\left( a\right) }{\lambda \left( t\right) }+\alpha \left(
a\right) }}{\sum_{b\in A}e^{\frac{u\left( b\right) }{\lambda \left( t\right)
}+\alpha \left( b\right) }}% \] where $p_{t}\left( a,A\right) $ is the
probability that alternative $a$ is selected from the set $A$ of feasible
alternatives if $t$ is the time available to decide, $\lambda$ is a time
dependent noise parameter measuring the unit cost of information, $u$ is a time
independent utility function, and $\alpha$ is an alternative-specific bias that
determines the initial choice probabilities reflecting prior information and
memory anchoring.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our axiomatic analysis provides a behavioral foundation of softmax (also
known as Multinomial Logit Model when $\alpha$ is constant). Our
neuro-computational derivation provides a biologically inspired algorithm that
may explain the emergence of softmax in choice behavior. Jointly, the two
approaches provide a thorough understanding of soft-maximization in terms of
internal causes (neurophysiological mechanisms) and external effects (testable
implications).

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03887</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inferring linear dependence between time series is central to our
understanding of natural and artificial systems. Unfortunately, the hypothesis
tests that are used to determine statistically significant directed or
multivariate relationships from time-series data often yield spurious
associations (Type I errors) or omit causal relationships (Type II errors).
This is due to the autocorrelation present in the analysed time series -- a
property that is ubiquitous across diverse applications, from brain dynamics to
climate change. Here we show that, for limited data, this issue cannot be
mediated by fitting a time-series model alone (e.g., in Granger causality or
prewhitening approaches), and instead that the degrees of freedom in
statistical tests should be altered to account for the effective sample size
induced by cross-correlations in the observations. This insight enabled us to
derive modified hypothesis tests for any multivariate correlation-based
measures of linear dependence between covariance-stationary time series,
including Granger causality and mutual information with Gaussian marginals. We
use both numerical simulations (generated by autoregressive models and digital
filtering) as well as recorded fMRI-neuroimaging data to show that our tests
are unbiased for a variety of stationary time series. Our experiments
demonstrate that the commonly used $F$- and $\chi^2$-tests can induce
significant false-positive rates of up to $100\%$ for both measures, with and
without prewhitening of the signals. These findings suggest that many
dependencies reported in the scientific literature may have been, and may
continue to be, spuriously reported or missed if modified hypothesis tests are
not used when analysing time series.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper is concerned with robust instability analysis of linear feedback
systems subject to a dynamic uncertainty. The work is motivated by, and
provides a basic foundation for, a more challenging problem of analyzing
persistence of oscillations in nonlinear dynamical systems. We first formalize
the problem for SISO LTI systems by introducing a notion of the robust
instability radius (RIR). We provide a method for calculating the RIR exactly
for a certain class of systems and show that it works well for a class of
second order systems. This result is applied to the FitzHugh-Nagumo model for
neuronal dynamics, and the effectiveness is confirmed by numerical simulations,
where we properly care for the change of the equilibrium point.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study aimed to investigate how early A-waves could occur in type II diabetes, and what it implied functionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed conduction velocity distribution (CVD) test in peroneal nerves of 37 type II diabetic patients with normal nerve conduction study (NCS) and 22 age-matched controls. The electrophysiological data and clinical information were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A-waves were observed in 45.9% of diabetic patients and only in 1 person in healthy controls, all detected in the tibial nerves. The diabetic patients with A-waves showed faster conduction velocity in all quartiles in the motor peroneal nerves compared to the patients without A-waves, and their CVD histograms were shifted to the right side, consisting of a significantly larger percentage of fast conducting fibers. There was no significant difference in the CVD values of the upper extremity nerves among the patients with and without A-waves and the healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: A-waves could occur in type II diabetes as early as when NCS showed normal, and represented as a sign of neuropathy as well as a sign of rescued motor nerve function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: The Effect of Media Professionalization on Cognitive Neurodynamics During Audiovisual Cuts</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Experts apply their experience to the proper development of their routine activities. Their acquired expertise or professionalization is expected to help in the development of those recurring tasks. Media professionals spend their daily work watching narrative contents on screens, so learning how they manage visual perception of those contents could be of interest in an increasingly audiovisual society. Media works require not only the understanding of the storytelling, but also the decoding of the formal rules and presentations. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from 36 participants (18 media professionals and 18 non-media professionals) while they were watching audiovisual contents, and compared their eyeblink rate and their brain activity and connectivity. We found that media professionals decreased their blink rate after the cuts, suggesting that they can better manage the loss of visual information that blinks entail by sparing them when new visual information is being presented. Cuts triggered similar activation of basic brain processing in the visual cortex of the two groups, but different processing in medial and frontal cortical areas, where media professionals showed a lower activity. Effective brain connectivity occurred in a more organized way in media professionals–possibly due to a better communication between cortical areas that are coordinated for decoding new visual content after cuts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Alterations of Spinal Epidural Stimulation-Enabled Stepping by Descending Intentional Motor Commands and Proprioceptive Inputs in Humans With Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.590231</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.590231</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Regaining control of movement following a spinal cord injury (SCI) requires utilization and/or functional reorganization of residual descending, and likely ascending, supraspinal sensorimotor pathways, which may be facilitated via task-specific training through body weight supported treadmill (BWST) training. Recently, epidural electrical stimulation (ES) combined with task-specific training demonstrated independence of standing and stepping functions in individuals with clinically complete SCI. The restoration of these functions may be dependent upon variables such as manipulation of proprioceptive input, ES parameter adjustments, and participant intent during step training. However, the impact of each variable on the degree of independence achieved during BWST stepping remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To describe the effects of descending intentional commands and proprioceptive inputs, specifically body weight support (BWS), on lower extremity motor activity and vertical ground reaction forces (vGRF) during ES-enabled BWST stepping in humans with chronic sensorimotor complete SCI. Furthermore, we describe perceived changes in the level of assistance provided by clinicians when intent and BWS are modified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Two individuals with chronic, mid thoracic, clinically complete SCI, enrolled in an IRB and FDA (IDE G150167) approved clinical trial. A 16-contact electrode array was implanted in the epidural space between the T11-L1 vertebral regions. Lower extremity motor output and vertical ground reaction forces were obtained during clinician-assisted ES-enabled treadmill stepping with BWS. Consecutive steps were achieved during various experimentally-controlled conditions, including intentional participation and varied BWS (60% and 20%) while ES parameters remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: During ES-enabled BWST stepping, the knee extensors exhibited an increase in motor activation during trials in which stepping was passive compared to active or during trials in which 60% BWS was provided compared to 20% BWS. As a result of this increased motor activation, perceived clinician assistance increased during the transition from stance to swing. Intentional participation and 20% BWS resulted in timely and purposeful activation of the lower extremities muscles, which improved independence and decreased clinician assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Maximizing participant intention and optimizing proprioceptive inputs through BWS during ES-enabled BWST stepping may facilitate greater independence during BWST stepping for individuals with clinically complete SCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02592668.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Sex Differences in Autism Spectrum Disorder: An Investigation on Core Symptoms and Psychiatric Comorbidity in Preschoolers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.594082</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Findings regarding sex differences in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as far as core symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities (PC) are concerned, are inconsistent, inconclusive, or conflicting among studies. The lower prevalence of ASD in females than in males and the age and intelligence quotient (IQ) heterogeneity among samples made it difficult to investigate these differences. This case–control study tries to deepen the impact of sex differences on core symptoms of autism and PC in 214 preschoolers with ASD (mean age, 45.26) without impairment in non-verbal IQ (nvIQ ≥70). A total of 107 ASD females (mean age, 44.51 ± 13.79 months) were matched one by one with 107 males (mean age, 46.01 ± 13.42 months) for chronological age (±6 months) and nvIQ (±6 points). We used the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 2 (ADOS-2) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 1.5–5 to explore autism severity and PC. The results highlight that ASD females did not significantly differ from ASD males regarding the severity of autism. Statistically significant lower levels of emotionally reactive (p = 0.005, η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.04), anxious-depressed (p = 0.001, η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.05), internalizing problems (p = 0.04, η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.02), and DSM-Oriented Scales anxiety problems (p = 0.02, η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.04) in ASD females than in ASD males were also detected. Our findings of no difference in the autism severity and lower internalizing problems in females than males with ASD extend the knowledge of autism in females during preschool years. Compared to other similar studies on this topic, we can state that these results are not supported by differences in nvIQ between sexes nor by the presence of cognitive impairment. It confirms the need for clinicians to consider sex differences when describing autism psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Inflammatory Diseases Among Norwegian LRRK2 Mutation Carriers. A 15-Years Follow-Up of a Cohort</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.634666</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The first families with LRRK2 related Parkinson’s disease (PD) were presented around 15 years ago and numerous papers have described the characteristics of the LRRK2 phenotype. The prevalence of autosomal dominant PD varies around the world mainly depending on local founder effects. The highest prevalence of LRRK2 G2019S PD in Norway is located to the central part of the country and most families could be traced back to common ancestors. The typical Norwegian LRRK2 phenotype is not different from classical PD and similar to that seen in most other LRRK2 families. The discovery of LRRK2 PD has allowed us to follow-up multi-incident families and to study their phenotype longitudinally. In the Norwegian LRRK2 families there has been a significantly higher incidence of inflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis that seen in other PD populations. Recent studies in LRRK2 mechanisms have indicated that this protein may be crucial in initiating disease processes. In this short survey of 100 Norwegian mutation carriers followed through more than 15 years are presented. The prevalence of inflammatory diseases among these cases is highlighted. The role of LRRK2 in the conversion process from carrier status to PD phenotype is still unknown and disease generating mechanisms important for initiating LRRK2 PD are still to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Using Muse: Rapid Mobile Assessment of Brain Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.634147</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The advent of mobile electroencephalography (mEEG) has created a means for large scale collection of neural data thus affording a deeper insight into cognitive phenomena such as cognitive fatigue. Cognitive fatigue – a neural state that is associated with an increased incidence of errorful performance – is responsible for accidents on a daily basis which at times can cost human lives. To gain better insight into the neural signature of cognitive fatigue in the present study we used mEEG to examine the relationship between perceived cognitive fatigue and human-event related brain potentials (ERPs) and electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations in a sample of 1,000 people. As a secondary goal, we wanted to further demonstrate the capability of mEEG to accurately measure ERP and EEG data. To accomplish these goals, participants performed a standard visual oddball task on an Apple iPad while EEG data were recorded from a Muse EEG headband. Counter to traditional EEG studies, experimental setup and data collection was completed in less than seven minutes on average. An analysis of our EEG data revealed robust N200 and P300 ERP components and neural oscillations in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. In line with previous findings we observed correlations between ERP components and EEG power and perceived cognitive fatigue. Further, we demonstrate here that a linear combination of ERP and EEG features is a significantly better predictor of perceived cognitive fatigue than any ERP or EEG feature on its own. In sum, our results provide validation of mEEG as a viable tool for research and provide further insight into the impact of cognitive fatigue on the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Test-Retest Reliability of Neural Correlates of Response Inhibition and Error Monitoring: An fMRI Study of a Stop-Signal Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.624911</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Response inhibition (RI) and error monitoring (EM) are important processes of adaptive goal-directed behavior, and neural correlates of these processes are being increasingly used as transdiagnostic biomarkers of risk for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. Potential utility of these purported biomarkers relies on the assumption that individual differences in brain activation are reproducible over time; however, available data on test-retest reliability (TRR) of task-fMRI are very mixed. This study examined TRR of RI and EM-related activations using a stop signal task in young adults (n = 56, including 27 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins) in order to identify brain regions with high TRR and familial influences (as indicated by MZ twin correlations) and to examine factors potentially affecting reliability. We identified brain regions with good TRR of activations related to RI (inferior/middle frontal, superior parietal, and precentral gyri) and EM (insula, medial superior frontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). No subcortical regions showed significant TRR. Regions with higher group-level activation showed higher TRR; increasing task duration improved TRR; within-session reliability was weakly related to the long-term TRR; motion negatively affected TRR, but this effect was abolished after the application of ICA-FIX, a data-driven noise removal method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Brain Network Analysis of EEG Recordings Can Be Used to Assess Cognitive Function in Teenagers With 15q13.3 Microdeletion Syndrome</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome causes a spectrum of cognitive disorders, including intellectual disability and autism. We assessed the ability of the EEG analysis algorithm Brain Network Analysis (BNA) to measure cognitive function in 15q13.3 deletion patients, and to differentiate between patient and control groups. EEG data was collected from 10 individuals with 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome (14–18 years of age), as well as 30 age-matched healthy controls, as the subjects responded to Auditory Oddball (AOB) and Go/NoGo cognitive tasks. It was determined that BNA can be used to evaluate cognitive function in 15q13.3 microdeletion patients. This analysis also significantly differentiates between patient and control groups using 5 scores, all of which are produced from ERP peaks related to late cortical components that represent higher cognitive functions of attention allocation and response inhibition (P &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Reduction in Nesfatin-1 Levels in the Cerebrospinal Fluid and Increased Nigrostriatal Degeneration Following Ventricular Administration of Anti-nesfatin-1 Antibody in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.621173</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.621173</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nesfatin-1 is one of several brain-gut peptides that have a close relationship with the central dopaminergic system. Our previous studies have shown that nesfatin-1 is capable of protecting nigral dopaminergic neurons against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity. A recent study also revealed a reduced blood level of nesfatin-1 in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The current study was designed to investigate whether reduced nesfatin-1 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) induces nigrostriatal system degeneration. An intra-cerebroventricular (ICV) injection technique was used to administer anti-nesfatin-1 antibody directly into the lateral ventricle of the brain. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results showed that ICV injection of anti-nesfatin-1 antibody into the lateral ventricle of the brain once daily for 2 weeks caused a significant reduction in nesfatin-1 levels in the CSF (93.1%). Treatment with anti-nesfatin-1 antibody resulted in a substantial loss (23%) of TH-positive (TH+) dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), as shown by immunofluorescence staining, a depletion in dopamine and its metabolites in the striatum detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and obvious nuclear shrinkage and mitochondrial lesions in dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, the results from our Western blot and ELISA experiments demonstrated that anti-nesfatin-1 antibody injection induced an upregulation of caspase-3 activation, increased the expression of p-ERK, and elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the SNpc. Taken together, these observations suggest that reduced nesfatin-1 in the brain may induce nigrostriatal dopaminergic system degeneration; this effect may be mediated via mitochondrial dysfunction-related apoptosis. Our data support a role of nesfatin-1 in maintaining the normal physiological function of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Pathophysiological Changes and the Role of Notch-1 Activation After Decompression in a Compressive Spinal Cord Injury Rat Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.579431</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.579431</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Surgical decompression is the primary treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) patients with compressive spinal cord injury (CSCI). However, the prognosis of patients with CSCI varies, and the pathophysiological changes following decompression remain poor. This study aimed to investigate the pathophysiological changes and the role of Notch-1 activation after decompression in a rat CSCI model. Surgical decompression was conducted at 1 week post-injury (wpi). DAPT was intraperitoneally injected to down-regulate Notch-1 expression. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores and an inclined plane test were used to evaluate the motor function recovery. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to assess pathophysiological changes, while hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), von Willebrand factor (vWF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, MMP-2, Notch-1, and Hes-1 expression in the spinal cord were examined by immunohistochemical analysis or quantitative PCR. The results show that early decompression can partially promote motor function recovery. Improvements in structural and cellular damage and hypoxic levels were also observed in the decompressed spinal cord. Moreover, decompression resulted in increased VEGF and vWF expression, but decreased MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression at 3 wpi. Expression levels of Notch-1 and its downstream gene Hes-1 were increased after decompression, and the inhibition of Notch-1 significantly reduced the decompression-induced motor function recovery. This exploratory study revealed preliminary pathophysiological changes in the compressed and decompressed rat spinal cord. Furthermore, we confirmed that early surgical decompression partially promotes motor function recovery may via activation of the Notch-1 signaling pathway after CSCI. These results could provide new insights for the development of drug therapy to enhance recovery following surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: An Inter- and Intra-Subject Transfer Calibration Scheme for Improving Feedback Performance of Sensorimotor Rhythm-Based BCI Rehabilitation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system is a typical neurophysiological application which helps paralyzed patients with human-machine communication. Stroke patients with motor disabilities are able to perform BCI tasks for clinical rehabilitation. This paper proposes an effective scheme of transfer calibration for BCI rehabilitation. The inter- and intra-subject transfer learning approaches can improve the low-precision classification performance for experimental feedback. The results imply that the systematical scheme is positive in increasing the confidence of voluntary training for stroke patients. In addition, it also reduces the time consumption of classifier calibration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: To Go or Not to Go: Degrees of Dynamic Inhibitory Control Revealed by the Function of Grip Force and Early Electrophysiological Indices</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.614978</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.614978</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A critical issue in executive control is how the nervous system exerts flexibility to inhibit a prepotent response and adapt to sudden changes in the environment. In this study, force measurement was used to capture “partial” unsuccessful trials that are highly relevant in extending the current understanding of motor inhibition processing. Moreover, a modified version of the stop-signal task was used to control and eliminate potential attentional capture effects from the motor inhibition index. The results illustrate that the non-canceled force and force rate increased as a function of stop-signal delay (SSD), offering new objective indices for gauging the dynamic inhibitory process. Motor response (time and force) was a function of delay in the presentation of novel/infrequent stimuli. A larger lateralized readiness potential (LRP) amplitude in go and novel stimuli indicated an influence of the novel stimuli on central motor processing. Moreover, an early N1 component reflects an index of motor inhibition in addition to the N2 component reported in previous studies. Source analysis revealed that the activation of N2 originated from inhibitory control associated areas: the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), pre-motor cortex, and primary motor cortex. Regarding partial responses, LRP and error-related negativity (ERNs) were associated with error correction processes, whereas the N2 component may indicate the functional overlap between inhibition and error correction. In sum, the present study has developed reliable and objective indices of motor inhibition by introducing force, force-rate and electrophysiological measures, further elucidating our understandings of dynamic motor inhibition and error correction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Determinants of Neural Plastic Changes Induced by Motor Practice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.613867</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.613867</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Short-term motor practice leads to plasticity in the primary motor cortex (M1). The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors that determine the increase in corticospinal tract (CST) excitability after motor practice, with special focus on two factors; “the level of muscle activity” and “the presence/absence of a goal of keeping the activity level constant.” Fifteen healthy subjects performed four types of rapid thumb adduction in separate sessions. In the “comfortable task” (C) and “forceful task” (F), the subjects adducted their thumb using comfortable and strong forces. In the “comfortable with a goal task” (CG) and “forceful with a goal task” (FG), subjects controlled the muscle activity at the same level as in the C and F, respectively, by adjusting the peak electromyographic amplitude within the target ranges. Paired associative stimulation (PAS), which combines peripheral nerve (median nerve) stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms (PAS25) was also done. Before and after the motor tasks and PAS25, TMS was applied to the M1. None of the four tasks showed any temporary changes in behavior, meaning no learning occurred. Motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude increased only after the FG and it exhibited a positive correlation with the MEP increase after PAS25, suggesting that FG and PAS25 share at least similar plasticity mechanisms in the M1. Resting motor threshold (RMT) decreased only after FG, suggesting that FG would also be associated with the membrane depolarization of M1 neurons. These results suggest task-dependent plasticity from the synergistic effect of forceful muscle activity and of setting a goal of keeping the activity level constant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Viability of Preictal High-Frequency Oscillation Rates as a Biomarker for Seizure Prediction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.612899</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.612899</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motivation: There is an ongoing search for definitive and reliable biomarkers to forecast or predict imminent seizure onset, but to date most research has been limited to EEG with sampling rates &amp;lt;1,000 Hz. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have gained acceptance as an indicator of epileptic tissue, but few have investigated the temporal properties of HFOs or their potential role as a predictor in seizure prediction. Here we evaluate time-varying trends in preictal HFO rates as a potential biomarker of seizure prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: HFOs were identified for all interictal and preictal periods with a validated automated detector in 27 patients who underwent intracranial EEG monitoring. We used LASSO logistic regression with several features of the HFO rate to distinguish preictal from interictal periods in each individual. We then tested these models with held-out data and evaluated their performance with the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of their receiver-operating curve (ROC). Finally, we assessed the significance of these results using non-parametric statistical tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: There was variability in the ability of HFOs to discern preictal from interictal states across our cohort. We identified a subset of 10 patients in whom the presence of the preictal state could be successfully predicted better than chance. For some of these individuals, average AUC in the held-out data reached higher than 0.80, which suggests that HFO rates can significantly differentiate preictal and interictal periods for certain patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance: These findings show that temporal trends in HFO rate can predict the preictal state better than random chance in some individuals. Such promising results indicate that future prediction efforts would benefit from the inclusion of high-frequency information in their predictive models and technological architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Importance of Childhood for Adult Health and Development—Study Protocol of the Zurich Longitudinal Studies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.612453</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evidence is accumulating that individual and environmental factors in childhood and adolescence should be considered when investigating adult health and aging-related processes. The data required for this is gathered by comprehensive long-term longitudinal studies. This article describes the protocol of the Zurich Longitudinal Studies (ZLS), a set of three comprehensive cohort studies on child growth, health, and development that are currently expanding into adulthood. Between 1954 and 1961, 445 healthy infants were enrolled in the first ZLS cohort. Their physical, motor, cognitive, and social development and their environment were assessed comprehensively across childhood, adolescence, and into young adulthood. In the 1970s, two further cohorts were added to the ZLS and assessed with largely matched study protocols: Between 1974 and 1979, the second ZLS cohort included 265 infants (103 term-born and 162 preterm infants), and between 1970 and 2002, the third ZLS cohort included 327 children of participants of the first ZLS cohort. Since 2019, the participants of the three ZLS cohorts have been traced and invited to participate in a first wave of assessments in adulthood to investigate their current health and development. This article describes the ZLS study protocol and discusses opportunities, methodological and conceptual challenges, and limitations arising from a long-term longitudinal cohort recruited from a study about development in early life. In the future, the ZLS will provide data to investigate childhood antecedents of adult health outcomes and, ultimately, will help respond to the frequent call of scientists to shift the focus of aging research into the first decades of life and, thus, to take a lifespan perspective on aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Electromyographic Patterns and the Identification of Subtypes of Awake Bruxism</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The future of awake bruxism assessment will incorporate physiological data, possibly electromyography (EMG) of the temporal muscles. But up to now, temporal muscle contraction patterns in awake bruxism have not been characterized to demonstrate clinical utility. The present study aimed to perform surface EMG evaluations of people assessed for awake bruxism to identify possible different subtypes. A 2-year active search for people with awake bruxism in three regions of the country resulted in a total of 303 participants (223 women, 38 ± 13 years, mean and SD). Their inclusion was confirmed through non-instrumental approaches for awake bruxism: self-reported questionnaire and clinical exam, performed by three experienced and calibrated dentists (Kappa = 0.75). Also, 77 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited (49 women, 36 ± 14 years). Temporalis surface EMG was performed with a portable device (Myobox; NeuroUp, Brazil). EMG signals were sent to a computer via Bluetooth 4.0 at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz. Digital signal processing was performed using the commercial neuroUP software, transformed in RMS and then normalized for peak detection (EMG peaks/min), in a 10 min session. Cluster analysis revealed three distinct subtypes of awake bruxism: phasic, tonic, and intermediate. Individuals with a predominance of EMG peaks/min were classified as the “phasic” subtype (16.8%). Those with the highest EMG rest power were classified as the “tonic” subtype (32.3%). There was also an “intermediate” subtype (50.8%), when both variables remained low. Characterization of awake bruxism physiology is important for future establishment of instrumental assessment protocols and treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: POLR3-Related Leukodystrophy: Exploring Potential Therapeutic Approaches</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.631802</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Leukodystrophies are a class of rare inherited central nervous system (CNS) disorders that affect the white matter of the brain, typically leading to progressive neurodegeneration and early death. Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies are characterized by the abnormal formation of the myelin sheath during development. POLR3-related or 4H (hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) leukodystrophy is one of the most common types of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy for which no curative treatment or disease-modifying therapy is available. This review aims to describe potential therapies that could be further studied for effectiveness in pre-clinical studies, for an eventual translation to the clinic to treat the neurological manifestations associated with POLR3-related leukodystrophy. Here, we discuss the therapeutic approaches that have shown promise in other leukodystrophies, as well as other genetic diseases, and consider their use in treating POLR3-related leukodystrophy. More specifically, we explore the approaches of using stem cell transplantation, gene replacement therapy, and gene editing as potential treatment options, and discuss their possible benefits and limitations as future therapeutic directions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Proteomic Characterization of Human Neural Stem Cells and Their Secretome During in vitro Differentiation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cell therapies represent a promising approach to slow down the progression of currently untreatable neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), as well as to support the reconstruction of functional neural circuits after spinal cord injuries. In such therapies, the grafted cells could either functionally integrate into the damaged tissue, partially replacing dead or damaged cells, modulate inflammatory reaction, reduce tissue damage, or support neuronal survival by secretion of cytokines, growth, and trophic factors. Comprehensive characterization of cells and their proliferative potential, differentiation status, and population purity before transplantation is crucial to preventing safety risks, e.g., a tumorous growth due to the proliferation of undifferentiated stem cells. We characterized changes in the proteome and secretome of human neural stem cells (NSCs) during their spontaneous (EGF/FGF2 withdrawal) differentiation and differentiation with trophic support by BDNF/GDNF supplementation. We used LC-MS/MS in SWATH-MS mode for global cellular proteome profiling and quantified almost three thousand cellular proteins. Our analysis identified substantial protein differences in the early stages of NSC differentiation with more than a third of all the proteins regulated (including known neuronal and NSC multipotency markers) and revealed that the BDNF/GDNF support affected more the later stages of the NSC differentiation. Among the pathways identified as activated during both spontaneous and BDNF/GDNF differentiation were the HIF-1 signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, and VEGF signaling pathway. Our follow-up secretome analysis using Luminex multiplex immunoassay revealed significant changes in the secretion of VEGF and IL-6 during NSC differentiation. Our results further demonstrated an increased expression of neuropilin-1 as well as catenin β-1, both known to participate in the regulation of VEGF signaling, and showed that VEGF-A isoform 121 (VEGF121), in particular, induces proliferation and supports survival of differentiating cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Characterization of Subcellular Organelles in Cortical Perisynaptic Astrocytes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.573944</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.573944</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs) carry out several different functions, from metabolite clearing to control of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity. All these functions are likely orchestrated by complex cellular machinery that resides within the PAPs and relies on a fine interplay between multiple subcellular components. However, traditional transmission electron microscopy (EM) studies have found that PAPs are remarkably poor of intracellular organelles, failing to explain how such a variety of PAP functions are achieved in the absence of a proportional complex network of intracellular structures. Here, we use serial block-face scanning EM to reconstruct and describe in three dimensions PAPs and their intracellular organelles in two different mouse cortical regions. We described five distinct organelles, which included empty and full endosomes, phagosomes, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cisternae, distributed within three PAPs categories (branches, branchlets, and leaflets). The majority of PAPs belonged to the leaflets category (~60%), with branchlets representing a minority (~37%). Branches were rarely in contact with synapses (&amp;lt;3%). Branches had a higher density of mitochondria and ER cisternae than branchlets and leaflets. Also, branches and branchlets displayed organelles more frequently than leaflets. Endosomes and phagosomes, which accounted for more than 60% of all the organelles detected, were often associated with the same PAP. Likewise, mitochondria and ER cisternae, representing ~40% of all organelles were usually associated. No differences were noted between the organelle distribution of the somatosensory and the anterior cingulate cortex. Finally, the organelle distribution in PAPs did not largely depend on the presence of a spine apparatus or a pre-synaptic mitochondrion in the synapse that PAPs were enwrapping, with some exceptions regarding the presence of phagosomes and ER cisternae, which were slightly more represented around synapses lacking a spine apparatus and a presynaptic mitochondrion, respectively. Thus, PAPs contain several subcellular organelles that could underlie the diverse astrocytic functions carried out at central synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Hypoglossal Nerve Abnormalities as Biomarkers for Central Nervous System Defects in Mouse Lines Producing Embryonically Lethal Offspring</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An essential step in researching human central nervous system (CNS) disorders is the search for appropriate mouse models that can be used to investigate both genetic and environmental factors underlying the etiology of such conditions. Identification of murine models relies upon detailed pre- and post-natal phenotyping since profound defects are not only the result of gross malformations but can be the result of small or subtle morphological abnormalities. The difficulties in identifying such defects are compounded by the finding that many mouse lines show quite a variable penetrance of phenotypes. As a result, without analysis of large numbers, such phenotypes are easily missed. Indeed for null mutations, around one-third have proved to be pre- or perinatally lethal, their analysis resting entirely upon phenotyping of accessible embryonic stages.To simplify the identification of potentially useful mouse mutants, we have conducted three-dimensional phenotype analysis of approximately 500 homozygous null mutant embryos, produced from targeting a variety of mouse genes and harvested at embryonic day 14.5 as part of the “Deciphering the Mechanisms of Developmental Disorders” www.dmdd.org.uk program. We have searched for anatomical features that have the potential to serve as biomarkers for CNS defects in such genetically modified lines. Our analysis identified two promising biomarker candidates. Hypoglossal nerve (HGN) abnormalities (absent, thin, and abnormal topology) and abnormal morphology or topology of head arteries are both frequently associated with the full spectrum of morphological CNS defects, ranging from exencephaly to more subtle defects such as abnormal nerve cell migration. Statistical analysis confirmed that HGN abnormalities (especially those scored absent or thin) indeed showed a significant correlation with CNS defect phenotypes. These results demonstrate that null mutant lines showing HGN abnormalities are also highly likely to produce CNS defects whose identification may be difficult as a result of morphological subtlety or low genetic penetrance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: New Mechanistic Insights, Novel Treatment Paradigms, and Clinical Progress in Cerebrovascular Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The past decade has brought tremendous progress in diagnostic and therapeutic options for cerebrovascular diseases as exemplified by the advent of thrombectomy in ischemic stroke, benefitting a steeply increasing number of stroke patients and potentially paving the way for a renaissance of neuroprotectants. Progress in basic science has been equally impressive. Based on a deeper understanding of pathomechanisms underlying cerebrovascular diseases, new therapeutic targets have been identified and novel treatment strategies such as pre- and post-conditioning methods were developed. Moreover, translationally relevant aspects are increasingly recognized in basic science studies, which is believed to increase their predictive value and the relevance of obtained findings for clinical application.This review reports key results from some of the most remarkable and encouraging achievements in neurovascular research that have been reported at the 10th International Symposium on Neuroprotection and Neurorepair. Basic science topics discussed herein focus on aspects such as neuroinflammation, extracellular vesicles, and the role of sex and age on stroke recovery. Translational reports highlighted endovascular techniques and targeted delivery methods, neurorehabilitation, advanced functional testing approaches for experimental studies, pre-and post-conditioning approaches as well as novel imaging and treatment strategies. Beyond ischemic stroke, particular emphasis was given on activities in the fields of traumatic brain injury and cerebral hemorrhage in which promising preclinical and clinical results have been reported. Although the number of neutral outcomes in clinical trials is still remarkably high when targeting cerebrovascular diseases, we begin to evidence stepwise but continuous progress towards novel treatment options. Advances in preclinical and translational research as reported herein are believed to have formed a solid foundation for this progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Motor Dyscoordination and Alteration of Functional Correlation Between DGKγ and PKCγ in Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Prone 8 (SAMP8)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.573966</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) is an animal model of age-related central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Although SAMP8 shows deficits in learning, memory, and emotion, its motor coordination has not been clarified. We have recently reported that DGKγ-regulated PKCγ activity is important for cerebellar motor coordination. However, involvement of the functional correlation between the kinases in age-related motor dyscoordination still remains unknown. Therefore, we have investigated the motor coordination in SAMP8 and involvement of the functional correlation between DGKγ and PKCγ in the age-related motor dyscoordination. Although 6 weeks old SAMP8 showed equivalent motor coordination with control mice (SAMR1) in the rotarod test, 24 weeks old SAMP8 exhibited significantly less latency in the rotarod test and more frequent slips in the beam test compared to the age-matched SAMR1. Furthermore, 24 weeks old SAMP8 showed the higher locomotor activity in open field test and Y-maze test. Western blotting revealed that DGKγ expression decreased in the cerebellum of 24 weeks old SAMP8, while PKCγ was upregulated. These results suggest that SAMP8 is a useful model of age-related motor dysfunction and that the DGKγ-regulated PKCγ activity is involved in the age-related motor dyscoordination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Impact of Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy in Brain Aging: Neurodegenerative Diseases and Glioblastoma</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain aging is characterized by a time-dependent decline of tissue integrity and function, and it is a major risk for neurodegenerative diseases and brain cancer. Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective form of autophagy specialized in protein degradation, which is based on the individual translocation of a cargo protein through the lysosomal membrane. Regulation of processes such as proteostasis, cellular energetics, or immune system activity has been associated with CMA, indicating its pivotal role in tissue homeostasis. Since first studies associating Parkinson’s disease (PD) to CMA dysfunction, increasing evidence points out that CMA is altered in both physiological and pathological brain aging. In this review article, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the impact of CMA during aging in brain physiopathology, highlighting the role of CMA in neurodegenerative diseases and glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive brain tumor in adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Microglial Hyperreactivity Evolved to Immunosuppression in the Hippocampus of a Mouse Model of Accelerated Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease Traits</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We sought to study the glial derangement in AD using diverse experimental models and human brain tissue. Besides classical pro-inflammatory cytokines, we analyzed chitinase 3 like 1 (CHI3L1 or YKL40) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) that are increasingly being associated with astrogliosis and microgliosis in AD, respectively. The SAMP8 mouse model of accelerated aging and AD traits showed elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and activated microglia phenotype. Furthermore, 6-month-old SAMP8 showed an exacerbated inflammatory response to peripheral lipopolysaccharide in the hippocampus and null responsiveness at the advanced age (for this strain) of 12 months. Gene expression of TREM2 was increased in the hippocampus of transgenic 5XFAD mice and in the cingulate cortex of autosomal dominant AD patients, and to a lesser extent in aged SAMP8 mice and sporadic early-onset AD patients. However, gene expression of CHI3L1 was increased in mice but not in human AD brain samples. The results support the relevance of microglia activation in the pathways leading to neurodegeneration and suggest diverse neuroinflammatory responses according to the AD process. Therefore, the SAMP8 mouse model with marked alterations in the dynamics of microglia activation and senescence may provide a complementary approach to transgenic mouse models for the study of the neuroinflammatory mechanisms underlying AD risk and progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Evolution of Apathy in Early Parkinson's Disease: A 4-Years Prospective Cohort Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.620762</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.620762</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: We investigated the prevalence, evolution, associated factors, and risk factors of apathy in a cohort of patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD), who underwent a 4-years prospective follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This study included 188 patients with PD (baseline disease duration &amp;lt;3 years) who underwent an annual evaluation using the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS). Based on the cut-off value of −21 observed on the LARS, patients were categorized as PD with and without apathy. The generalized estimating equations (GEE) model was utilized to determine the factors associated with apathy, and the Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used to determine the predictors of apathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Apathy increased from a baseline rate of 18.6–28.8% after 4 years; notably, this rate was not persistent across patients' visits. The LARS score was independently associated with the male sex (B 8.131, p = 0.009), low Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) scores (B 0.567, p = 0.011), low attention scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) test (B 0.217, p = 0.026), high Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores (B 1.362, p &amp;lt; 0.001), high Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III scores (B 1.147, p &amp;lt; 0.001), and prolonged follow-up time (B 1.785, p = 0.048). A high HDRS score was the only predictor of apathy in PD [hazard ratio (HR) 1.043, p = 0.026].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The risk of apathy is higher in men with progressive PD accompanied by disease-specific motor and non-motor symptoms. Depression during early-stage PD is a primary risk factor for apathy in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: White Matter Abnormalities in Patients With Parkinson's Disease: A Meta-Analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging Using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.610962</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.610962</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) studies based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have revealed extensive abnormalities in white matter (WM) fibers of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the results were inconsistent. Therefore, a meta-analytical approach was used in this study to find the most prominent and replicable WM abnormalities of PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Online databases were systematically searched for all TBSS studies comparing fractional anisotropy (FA) between patients with PD and controls. Subsequently, we performed the meta-analysis using a coordinate-based meta-analytic software called seed-based d mapping. Meanwhile, meta-regression was performed to explore the potential correlation between the alteration of FA and the clinical characteristics of PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Out of a total of 1,701 studies that were identified, 23 studies were included. Thirty datasets, including 915 patients (543 men) with PD and 836 healthy controls (449 men), were included in the current study. FA reduction was identified in the body of the corpus callosum (CC; 245 voxels; z = −1.739; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) 118 voxels; z = −1.182; p &amp;lt; 0.001). Both CC and IFOF maintained significance in the sensitivity analysis. No increase in FA was identified, but the percentage of male patients with PD was positively associated with the value of FA in the body of the CC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Although some limitations exist, DTI is regarded as a valid way to identify the pathophysiology of PD. It could be more beneficial to integrate DTI parameters with other MRI techniques to explore brain degeneration in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age- and Sex-Specific Standard Scores for the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The reliable, valid and economic assessment of social cognition is more relevant than ever in the field of clinical psychology. Theory of Mind is one of the most important socio-cognitive abilities but standardized assessment instruments for adults are rare. The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is well-established and captures the ability to identify mental states from gaze. Here, we computed standard scores for the German version of the RMET derived from a large, community-dwelling sample of healthy adults (20–79 years). The standardization sample contains 966 healthy adult individuals of the population-based Leipzig Research Center for Civilization Diseases (LIFE) study. Before standardization, weighting factors were applied to match the current sample with distribution characteristics of the German population regarding age, sex, and education. RMET scores were translated into percentage ranks for men and women of five age groups (20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60+ years). Age-specific percentage ranks are provided for men and women. Independent of age, men present a larger variance in test scores compared to women. Within the specific age groups, women score higher and their scoring range is less variable. With increasing age, the scoring variance increases in both men and women. This is the first study providing age- and sex-specific RMET standard scores. Data was weighted to match German population characteristics, enabling the application of standard scores across German-speaking areas. Our results contribute to the standardized assessment of socio-cognitive abilities in clinical diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the functions and regulatory mechanisms of lncRNA are largely unclear. Herein, we obtained 3,158 lncRNAs by microarray re-annotation. A global network of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) was developed for AD and normal samples were based on the gene expressions profiles. A total of 255 AD-deficient messenger RNA (mRNA)-lncRNAs were identified by the expression correlation analysis. Genes in the dysregulated ceRNAs were found to be mainly enriched in transcription factors and micro RNAs (miRNAs). Analysis of the disordered miRNA in the lncRNA-mRNA network revealed that 40 pairs of lncRNA shared more than one disordered miRNA. Among them, nine lncRNAs were closely associated with AD, Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Of note, five lncRNAs were found to be potential biomarkers for AD. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay revealed that PART1 was downregulated, while SNHG14 was upregulated in AD serum samples when compared to normal samples. This study elucidates the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of AD and presents new lncRNAs that can be exploited to design diagnostic and therapeutic agents for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), in the time of COVID-19, have received much attention in the lay press owing to their association with vaccine protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The attention is well-deserved and the association of nAbs with protection is true for many viruses (1).

	<description>We present a unifying theory to explain cancer recurrence, therapeutic resistance, and lethality. The basis of this theory is the formation of simultaneously polyploid and aneuploid cancer cells, polyaneuploid cancer cells (PACCs), that avoid the toxic effects of systemic therapy by entering a state of cell cycle arrest. The theory...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/uwDPw-1SOxU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: One is not enough: On the effects of reference genome for the mapping and subsequent analyses of short-reads</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008678</guid>

Mapping of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) reads to a single arbitrary reference genome is a frequently used approach in microbial genomics. However, the choice of a reference may represent a source of errors that may affect subsequent analyses such as the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phylogenetic inference. In this work, we evaluated the effect of reference choice on short-read sequence data from five clinically and epidemiologically relevant bacteria (&lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/i&gt;). Publicly available whole-genome assemblies encompassing the genomic diversity of these species were selected as reference sequences, and read alignment statistics, SNP calling, recombination rates, d&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;/d&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; ratios, and phylogenetic trees were evaluated depending on the mapping reference. The choice of different reference genomes proved to have an impact on almost all the parameters considered in the five species. In addition, these biases had potential epidemiological implications such as including/excluding isolates of particular clades and the estimation of genetic distances. These findings suggest that the single reference approach might introduce systematic errors during mapping that affect subsequent analyses, particularly for data sets with isolates from genetically diverse backgrounds. In any case, exploring the effects of different references on the final conclusions is highly recommended.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PhvpX7yeFZg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Sensor-based localization of epidemic sources on human mobility networks</title>

We investigate the source detection problem in epidemiology, which is one of the most important issues for control of epidemics. Mathematically, we reformulate the problem as one of identifying the relevant component in a multivariate Gaussian mixture model. Focusing on the study of cholera and diseases with similar modes of transmission, we calibrate the parameters of our mixture model using human mobility networks within a stochastic, spatially explicit epidemiological model for waterborne disease. Furthermore, we adopt a Bayesian perspective, so that prior information on source location can be incorporated (e.g., reflecting the impact of local conditions). Posterior-based inference is performed, which permits estimates in the form of either individual locations or regions. Importantly, our estimator only requires first-arrival times of the epidemic by putative observers, typically located only at a small proportion of nodes. The proposed method is demonstrated within the context of the 2000-2002 cholera outbreak in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dIhEt4T9o-0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years it has become clear that the brain maintains a temporal
memory of recent events stretching far into the past. This paper presents a
neurally-inspired algorithm to use a scale-invariant temporal representation of
the past to predict a scale-invariant future. The result is a scale-invariant
estimate of future events as a function of the time at which they are expected
to occur. The algorithm is time-local, with credit assigned to the present
event by observing how it affects the prediction of the future. To illustrate
the potential utility of this approach, we test the model on simultaneous
renewal processes with different time scales. The algorithm scales well on
these problems despite the fact that the number of states needed to describe
them as a Markov process grows exponentially.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The combining of a General-Purpose Particle Swarm Optimizer (GP-PSO) with
Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm for constrained optimization
problems has been shown to be highly beneficial to the refinement, and in some
cases, the success of finding a global optimum solution. It is shown that the
likely difference between leading algorithms are in their local search ability.
A comparison with other leading optimizers on the tested benchmark suite,
indicate the hybrid GP-PSO with implemented local search to compete along side
other leading PSO algorithms.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Particle Swarm Optimization is a global optimizer in the sense that it has
the ability to escape poor local optima. However, if the spread of information
within the population is not adequately performed, premature convergence may
occur. The convergence speed and hence the reluctance of the algorithm to
getting trapped in suboptimal solutions are controlled by the settings of the
coefficients in the velocity update equation as well as by the neighbourhood
topology. The coefficients settings govern the trajectories of the particles
towards the good locations identified, whereas the neighbourhood topology
controls the form and speed of spread of information within the population
(i.e. the update of the social attractor). Numerous neighbourhood topologies
have been proposed and implemented in the literature. This paper offers a
numerical comparison of the performances exhibited by five different
neighbourhood topologies combined with four different coefficients' settings
when optimizing a set of benchmark unconstrained problems. Despite the optimum
topology being problem-dependent, it appears that dynamic neighbourhoods with
the number of interconnections increasing as the search progresses should be
preferred for a non-problem-specific optimizer.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Population-based methods can cope with a variety of different problems,
including problems of remarkably higher complexity than those traditional
methods can handle. The main procedure consists of successively updating a
population of candidate solutions, performing a parallel exploration instead of
traditional sequential exploration. While the origins of the PSO method are
linked to bird flock simulations, it is a stochastic optimization method in the
sense that it relies on random coefficients to introduce creativity, and a
bottom-up artificial intelligence-based approach in the sense that its
intelligent behaviour emerges in a higher level than the individuals' rather
than deterministically programmed. As opposed to EAs, the PSO involves no
operator design and few coefficients to be tuned. Since this paper does not
intend to study such tuning, general-purpose settings are taken from previous
studies. The PSO algorithm requires the incorporation of some technique to
handle constraints. A popular one is the penalization method, which turns the
original constrained problem into unconstrained by penalizing infeasible
solutions. Other techniques can be specifically designed for PSO. Since these
strategies present advantages and disadvantages when compared to one another,
there is no obvious best constraint-handling technique (CHT) for all problems.
The aim here is to develop and compare different CHTs suitable for PSOs, which
are incorporated to an algorithm with general-purpose settings. The comparisons
are performed keeping the remaining features of the algorithm the same, while
comparisons to other authors' results are offered as a frame of reference for
the optimizer as a whole. Thus, the penalization, preserving feasibility and
bisection methods are discussed, implemented, and tested on two suites of
benchmark problems. Three neighbourhood sizes are also considered in the
experiments.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This thesis is concerned with continuous, static, and single-objective
optimization problems subject to inequality constraints. Nevertheless, some
methods to handle other kinds of problems are briefly reviewed. The particle
swarm optimization paradigm was inspired by previous simulations of the
cooperative behaviour observed in social beings. It is a bottom-up, randomly
weighted, population-based method whose ability to optimize emerges from local,
individual-to-individual interactions. As opposed to traditional methods, it
can deal with different problems with few or no adaptation due to the fact that
it does profit from problem-specific features of the problem at issue but
performs a parallel, cooperative exploration of the search-space by means of a
population of individuals. The main goal of this thesis consists of developing
an optimizer that can perform reasonably well on most problems. Hence, the
influence of the settings of the algorithm's parameters on the behaviour of the
system is studied, some general-purpose settings are sought, and some
variations to the canonical version are proposed aiming to turn it into a more
general-purpose optimizer. Since no termination condition is included in the
canonical version, this thesis is also concerned with the design of some
stopping criteria which allow the iterative search to be terminated if further
significant improvement is unlikely, or if a certain number of time-steps are
reached. In addition, some constraint-handling techniques are incorporated into
the canonical algorithm to handle inequality constraints. Finally, the
capabilities of the proposed general-purpose optimizers are illustrated by
optimizing a few benchmark problems.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Local homeostatic regulation of the spectral radius of echo-state networks. (arXiv:2101.10665v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10665</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recurrent cortical networks provide reservoirs of states that are thought to
play a crucial role for sequential information processing in the brain.
However, classical reservoir computing requires manual adjustments of global
network parameters, particularly of the spectral radius of the recurrent
synaptic weight matrix. It is hence not clear if the spectral radius is
accessible to biological neural networks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using random matrix theory, we show that the spectral radius is related to
local properties of the neuronal dynamics whenever the overall dynamical state
is only weakly correlated. This result allows us to introduce two local
homeostatic synaptic scaling mechanisms, termed flow control and variance
control, that implicitly drive the spectral radius towards the desired value
under working conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate the effectiveness of the two adaptation mechanisms under
different external input protocols and the network performance after adaptation
by training the network to perform a time-delayed XOR operation on binary
sequences. As our main result, we found that flow control reliably regulates
the spectral radius for different types of input statistics. Precise tuning is
however negatively affected when interneural correlations are substantial.
Furthermore, we found a consistent task performance over a wide range of input
strengths/variances. Variance control did however not yield the desired
spectral radii with the same precision, being less consistent across different
input strengths.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the effectiveness and remarkably simple mathematical form of flow
control, we conclude that self-consistent local control of the spectral radius
via an implicit adaptation scheme is an interesting and biological plausible
alternative to conventional methods using setpoint homeostatic feedback
controls of neural firing.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10629</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose a novel method for mild cognitive impairment
detection based on jointly exploiting the complex network and the neural
network paradigm. In particular, the method is based on ensembling different
brain structural &quot;perspectives&quot; with artificial neural networks. On one hand,
these perspectives are obtained with complex network measures tailored to
describe the altered brain connectivity. In turn, the brain reconstruction is
obtained by combining diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data to tractography
algorithms. On the other hand, artificial neural networks provide a means to
learn a mapping from topological properties of the brain to the presence or
absence of cognitive decline. The effectiveness of the method is studied on a
well-known benchmark data set in order to evaluate if it can provide an
automatic tool to support the early disease diagnosis. Also, the effects of
balancing issues are investigated to further assess the reliability of the
complex network approach to DWI data.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain function relies on a precisely coordinated and dynamic balance between
the functional integration and segregation of distinct neural systems.
Characterizing the way in which neural systems reconfigure their interactions
to give rise to distinct but hidden brain states remains an open challenge. In
this paper, we propose a Bayesian model-based characterization of latent brain
states and showcase a novel method based on posterior predictive discrepancy
using the latent block model to detect transitions between latent brain states
in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time series. The set of estimated
parameters in the model includes a latent label vector that assigns network
nodes to communities, and also block model parameters that reflect the weighted
connectivity within and between communities. Besides extensive in-silico model
evaluation, we also provide empirical validation (and replication) using the
Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset of 100 healthy adults. Our results
obtained through an analysis of task-fMRI data during working memory
performance show appropriate lags between external task demands and
change-points between brain states, with distinctive community patterns
distinguishing fixation, low-demand and high-demand task conditions.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Stochastic resonance (SR) refers to a faint signal being enhanced
with the addition of white noise. Previous studies have found that vestibular
perceptual thresholds are lowered with noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation
(i.e., &quot;in-channel&quot; SR). Auditory white noise has been shown to improve tactile
and visual thresholds, suggesting &quot;cross-modal&quot; SR. Objective: We aimed to
study the cross-modal impact of noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS)
(n=9 subjects) on visual and auditory thresholds. Methods: We measured auditory
and visual perceptual thresholds of human subjects across a swath of different
nGVS levels in order to determine if a subject-specific best nGVS level
elicited a reduction in thresholds as compared the no noise condition (sham).
Results: We found an 18% improvement in visual thresholds (p = 0.026). Among
the 7 of 9 subjects with reduced thresholds, the average improvement was 26%.
Subjects with higher (worse) visual thresholds with no stimulation (sham)
improved more than those with lower thresholds (p = 0.005). Auditory thresholds
were unchanged by vestibular stimulation. Conclusions: These results are the
first demonstration of cross-modal improvement with nGVS, indicating galvanic
vestibular white noise can produce cross-modal improvements in some sensory
channels, but not all.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We define a categorical notion of cybernetic system as a dynamical
realisation of a generalized open game, along with a coherence condition. We
show that this notion captures a wide class of cybernetic systems in
computational neuroscience and statistical machine learning, exposes their
compositional structure, and gives an abstract justification for the
bidirectional structure empirically observed in cortical circuits. Our
construction is built on the observation that Bayesian updates compose
optically, a fact which we prove along the way, via a fibred category of
state-dependent stochastic channels.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Classification of Schizophrenia from Functional MRI Using Large-scale Extended Granger Causality. (arXiv:2101.10471v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The literature manifests that schizophrenia is associated with alterations in
brain network connectivity. We investigate whether large-scale Extended Granger
Causality (lsXGC) can capture such alterations using resting-state fMRI data.
Our method utilizes dimension reduction combined with the augmentation of
source time-series in a predictive time-series model for estimating directed
causal relationships among fMRI time-series. The lsXGC is a multivariate
approach since it identifies the relationship of the underlying dynamic system
in the presence of all other time-series. Here lsXGC serves as a biomarker for
classifying schizophrenia patients from typical controls using a subset of 62
subjects from the Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) data
repository. We use brain connections estimated by lsXGC as features for
classification. After feature extraction, we perform feature selection by
Kendall's tau rank correlation coefficient followed by classification using a
support vector machine. As a reference method, we compare our results with
cross-correlation, typically used in the literature as a standard measure of
functional connectivity. We cross-validate 100 different training/test
(90%/10%) data split to obtain mean accuracy and a mean Area Under the receiver
operating characteristic Curve (AUC) across all tested numbers of features for
lsXGC. Our results demonstrate a mean accuracy range of [0.767, 0.940] and a
mean AUC range of [0.861, 0.983] for lsXGC. The result of lsXGC is
significantly higher than the results obtained with the cross-correlation,
namely mean accuracy of [0.721, 0.751] and mean AUC of [0.744, 0.860]. Our
results suggest the applicability of lsXGC as a potential biomarker for
schizophrenia.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Probabilistic forecasting of high dimensional multivariate time series is a
notoriously challenging task, both in terms of computational burden and
distribution modeling. Most previous work either makes simple distribution
assumptions or abandons modeling cross-series correlations. A promising line of
work exploits scalable matrix factorization for latent-space forecasting, but
is limited to linear embeddings, unable to model distributions, and not
trainable end-to-end when using deep learning forecasting. We introduce a novel
temporal latent auto-encoder method which enables nonlinear factorization of
multivariate time series, learned end-to-end with a temporal deep learning
latent space forecast model. By imposing a probabilistic latent space model,
complex distributions of the input series are modeled via the decoder.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on many popular multivariate datasets, with gains sometimes as high
as $50\%$ for several standard metrics.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In order to solve the critical issues in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs),
with concern for limited sensor lifetime, nature-inspired algorithms are
emerging as a suitable method. Getting optimal network coverage is one of those
challenging issues that need to be examined critically before any network
setup. Optimal network coverage not only minimizes the consumption of limited
energy of battery-driven sensors but also reduce the sensing of redundant
information. In this paper, we focus on nature-inspired optimization algorithms
concerning the optimal coverage in WSNs. In the first half of the paper, we
have briefly discussed the taxonomy of the optimization algorithms along with
the problem domains in WSNs. In the second half of the paper, we have compared
the performance of two nature-inspired algorithms for getting optimal coverage
in WSNs. The first one is a combined Improved Genetic Algorithm and Binary Ant
Colony Algorithm (IGABACA), and the second one is Lion Optimization (LO). The
simulation results confirm that LO gives better network coverage, and the
convergence rate of LO is faster than that of IGA-BACA. Further, we observed
that the optimal coverage is achieved at a lesser number of generations in LO
as compared to IGA-BACA. This review will help researchers to explore the
applications in this field as well as beyond this area. Keywords: Optimal
Coverage, Bio-inspired Algorithm, Lion Optimization, WSNs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The logcosh loss function for neural networks has been developed to combine
the advantage of the absolute error loss function of not overweighting outliers
with the advantage of the mean square error of continuous derivative near the
mean, which makes the last phase of learning easier. It is clear, and one
experiences it soon, that in the case of clustered data, an artificial neural
network with logcosh loss learns the bigger cluster rather than the mean of the
two. Even more so, the ANN, when used for regression of a set-valued function,
will learn a value close to one of the choices, in other words, one branch of
the set-valued function, while a mean-square-error NN will learn the value in
between. This work suggests a method that uses artificial neural networks with
logcosh loss to find the branches of set-valued mappings in parameter-outcome
sample sets and classifies the samples according to those branches.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The range of applications of traditional optimization methods are limited by
the features of the object variables, and of both the objective and the
constraint functions. In contrast, population-based algorithms whose
optimization capabilities are emergent properties, such as evolutionary
algorithms and particle swarm optimization, present almost no restriction on
those features and can handle different optimization problems with few or no
adaptations. Their main drawbacks consist of their comparatively higher
computational cost and difficulty in handling equality constraints. The
particle swarm optimization method is sometimes viewed as an evolutionary
algorithm because of their many similarities, despite not being inspired by the
same metaphor: they evolve a population of individuals taking into account
previous experiences and using stochastic operators to introduce new responses.
The advantages of evolutionary algorithms with respect to traditional methods
have been greatly discussed in the literature for decades. While the particle
swarm optimizers share such advantages, their main desirable features when
compared to evolutionary algorithms are their lower computational cost and
easier implementation, involving no operator design and few parameters to be
tuned. However, even slight modifications of these parameters greatly influence
the dynamics of the swarm. This paper deals with the effect of the settings of
the parameters of the particles' velocity update equation on the behaviour of
the system.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This work explores learning agent-agnostic synthetic environments (SEs) for
Reinforcement Learning. SEs act as a proxy for target environments and allow
agents to be trained more efficiently than when directly trained on the target
environment. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem and represent
an SE as a neural network. By using Natural Evolution Strategies and a
population of SE parameter vectors, we train agents in the inner loop on
evolving SEs while in the outer loop we use the performance on the target task
as a score for meta-updating the SE population. We show empirically that our
method is capable of learning SEs for two discrete-action-space tasks
(CartPole-v0 and Acrobot-v1) that allow us to train agents more robustly and
with up to 60% fewer steps. Not only do we show in experiments with 4000
evaluations that the SEs are robust against hyperparameter changes such as the
learning rate, batch sizes and network sizes, we also show that SEs trained
with DDQN agents transfer in limited ways to a discrete-action-space version of
TD3 and very well to Dueling DDQN.

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Blood–brain barrier permeability in Parkinson’s disease patients with and without dyskinesia</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Recent studies on a rodent model of Parkinson’s disease (PD) have raised the possibility of increased blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, demonstrated by histology, autoradiography, and positron emission tomography (PET). However, in human PD patients, in vivo evidence of increased BBB permeability is lacking. We examined the hypothesis that levodopa treatment increases BBB permeability in human subjects with PD, particularly in those with levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We used rubidium-82 (&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;82&lt;/sup&gt;Rb) and PET to quantify BBB influx in vivo in 19 PD patients, including eight with LID, and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. All subjects underwent baseline &lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;82&lt;/sup&gt;Rb scans. Seventeen chronically levodopa-treated patients were additionally rescanned during intravenous levodopa infusion. Influx rate constant, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;K&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, by compartmental modeling or net influx transport, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;K&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, by graphical approach could not be estimated reliably. However, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, the “apparent volume of distribution” based on the &lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;82&lt;/sup&gt;Rb concentration in brain tissue and blood, was estimated with good stability as a local measure of the volume of distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Rubidium influx into brain tissue was undetectable in PD patients with or without LID, scanned on and off drug. No significant differences in regional &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; were observed for PD patients with or without LID relative to healthy subjects, except in left thalamus. Moreover, changes in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; measured off- and on-levodopa infusion were also not significant for dyskinetic and non-dyskinetic subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;82&lt;/sup&gt;Rb PET did not reveal significant changes in BBB permeability in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Mechanisms and Applications of Neuromodulation Using Surface Acoustic Waves—A Mini-Review</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The study of neurons is fundamental for basic neuroscience research and treatment of neurological disorders. In recent years ultrasound has been increasingly recognized as a viable method to stimulate neurons. However, traditional ultrasound transducers are limited in the scope of their application by self-heating effects, limited frequency range and cavitation effects during neuromodulation. In contrast, surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices, which are producing wavemodes with increasing application in biomedical devices, generate less self-heating, are smaller and create less cavitation. SAW devices thus have the potential to address some of the drawbacks of traditional ultrasound transducers and could be implemented as miniaturized wearable or implantable devices. In this mini review, we discuss the potential mechanisms of SAW-based neuromodulation, including mechanical displacement, electromagnetic fields, thermal effects, and acoustic streaming. We also review the application of SAW actuation for neuronal stimulation, including growth and neuromodulation. Finally, we propose future directions for SAW-based neuromodulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Evaluation of Cerebral Blood Flow Measured by 3D PCASL as Biomarker of Vascular Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID) in a Cohort of Elderly Latinx Subjects at Risk of Small Vessel Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.627627</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) affects arterioles, capillaries, and venules and can lead to cognitive impairments and clinical symptomatology of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). VCID symptoms are similar to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) but the neurophysiologic alterations are less well studied, resulting in no established biomarkers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) as a potential biomarker of VCID in a cohort of elderly Latinx subjects at risk of cSVD. Forty-five elderly Latinx subjects (12 males, 69 ± 7 years) underwent repeated MRI scans ∼6 weeks apart. CBF was measured using 3D pCASL in the whole brain, white matter and 4 main vascular territories (leptomeningeal anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral artery (leptoACA, leptoMCA, leptoPCA), as well as MCA perforator). The test-retest repeatability of CBF was assessed by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and within-subject coefficient of variation (wsCV). Absolute and relative CBF was correlated with gross cognitive measures and domain specific assessment of executive and memory function, vascular risks, and Fazekas scores and volumes of white matter hyperintensity (WMH). Neurocognitive evaluations were performed using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and neuropsychological test battery in the Uniform Data Set v3 (UDS3). Good to excellent test-retest repeatability was achieved (ICC = 0.77–0.85, wsCV 3–9%) for CBF measurements in the whole brain, white matter, and 4 vascular territories. Relative CBF normalized by global mean CBF in the leptoMCA territory was positively correlated with the executive function composite score, while relative CBF in the leptoMCA and MCA perforator territory was positively correlated with MoCA scores, controlling for age, gender, years of education, and testing language. Relative CBF in WM was negatively correlated with WMH volume and MoCA scores, while relative leptoMCA CBF was positively correlated with WMH volume. Reliable 3D pCASL CBF measurements were achieved in the cohort of elderly Latinx subjects. Relative CBF in the leptomeningeal and perforator MCA territories were the most likely candidate biomarker of VCID. These findings need to be replicated in larger cohorts with greater variability of stages of cSVD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Stimulus Intervals Modulate the Balance of Brain Activity in the Human Primary Somatosensory Cortex: An ERP Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.571369</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal excitation and inhibition occur in the brain at the same time, and brain activation reflects changes in the sum of excitation and inhibition. This principle has been well-established in lower-level sensory systems, including vision and touch, based on animal studies. However, it is unclear how the somatosensory system processes the balance between excitation and inhibition. In the present ERP study, we modified the traditional spatial attention paradigm by adding double stimuli presentations at short intervals (i.e., 10, 30, and 100 ms). Seventeen subjects participated in the experiment. Five types of stimulation were used in the experiment: a single stimulus (one raised pin for 40 ms), standard stimulus (eight pins for 40 ms), and double stimuli presented at intervals of 10, 30, and 100 ms. The subjects were asked to attend to a particular finger and detect whether the standard stimulus was presented to that finger. The results showed a clear attention-related ERP component in the single stimulus condition, but the suppression components associated with the three interval conditions seemed to be dominant in somatosensory areas. In particular, we found the strongest suppression effect in the ISI-30 condition (interval of 30 ms) and that the suppression and enhancement effects seemed to be counterbalanced in both the ISI-10 and ISI-100 conditions (intervals of 10 and 100 ms, respectively). This type of processing may allow humans to easily discriminate between multiple stimuli on the same body part.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Relationship Between Socioeconomic Status and Scalp Event-Related Potentials: A Systematic Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.601489</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Several decades of behavioral research have established that variations in socioeconomic status (SES) are related to differences in cognitive performance. Neuroimaging and psychophysiological techniques have recently emerged as a method of choice to better understand the neurobiological processes underlying this phenomenon. Here we present a systematic review of a particular sub-domain of this field. Specifically, we used the PICOS approach to review studies investigating potential relationships between SES and scalp event-related brain potentials (ERP). This review found evidence that SES is related to amplitude variations in a diverse range of ERPs: P1, N1, N2, Error-Related Negativities (ERN), N400, auditory evoked potentials, negative difference waves (Nd), P3 and slow waves (SW). These ERPs include early, mid-latency and late potentials that reflect a broad range of cognitive processes (e.g., automatic attentional processes, overt attention, language, executive function, etc.). In this review, all SES effects on ERPs appeared to reflect an impairment or a less efficient form of task-related neural activity for low-SES compared to high-SES individuals. Overall, these results confirm that a wide variety of distinct neural processes with different functional meanings are sensitive to SES differences. The findings of this review also suggest that the relationship between SES and some ERP components may depend on the developmental stage of study participants. Results are further discussed in terms of the current limitations of this field and future avenues of research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Error-Related Negativity Predicts Self-Control Failures in Daily Life</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.614979</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adaptive behavior critically depends on performance monitoring (PM), the ability to monitor action outcomes and the need to adapt behavior. PM-related brain activity has been linked to guiding decisions about whether action adaptation is warranted. The present study examined whether PM-related brain activity in a flanker task, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), was associated with adaptive behavior in daily life. Specifically, we were interested in the employment of self-control, operationalized as self-control failures (SCFs), and measured using ecological momentary assessment. Analyses were conducted using an adaptive elastic net regression to predict SCFs from EEG in a sample of 131 participants. The model was fit using within-subject averaged response-locked EEG activity at each electrode and time point within an epoch surrounding the response. We found that higher amplitudes of the error-related negativity (ERN) were related to fewer SCFs. This suggests that lower error-related activity may relate to lower recruitment of interventive self-control in daily life. Altered cognitive control processes, like PM, have been proposed as underlying mechanisms for various mental disorders. Understanding how alterations in PM relate to regulatory control might therefore aid in delineating how these alterations contribute to different psychopathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Muscle Synergies in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis Reveal Demand-Specific Alterations in the Modular Organization of Locomotion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;For patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), deficits in gait significantly reduce the quality of life. Using the concept of muscle synergies, this study investigated the modular organization of motor control during level and inclined walking in MS patients (MSP) compared with healthy participants (HP) to identify the potential demand-specific adjustments in motor control in MSP. We hypothesized a widening of the time-dependent activation patterns (motor primitives) in MSP to increase the overlap of temporally-adjacent muscle synergies, especially during inclined walking, as a strategy to increase the robustness of motor control, thus compensating pathology-related deficits. We analyzed temporal gait parameters and muscle synergies from myoelectric signals of 13 ipsilateral leg muscles using non-negative matrix factorization. Compared with HP, MSP demonstrated a widening in the time-dependent coefficients (motor primitives), as well as altered relative muscle contribution (motor modules), in certain synergies during level and inclined walking. Moreover, inclined walking revealed a demand-specific adjustment in the modular organization in MSP, resulting in an extra synergy compared with HP. This further increased the overlap of temporally-adjacent muscle synergies to provide sufficient robustness in motor control to accomplish the more demanding motor task while coping with pathology-related motor deficits during walking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Is This Within Reach? Left but Not Right Brain Damage Affects Affordance Judgment Tendencies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.531893</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to judge accurately whether or not an action can be accomplished successfully is critical for selecting appropriate response options that enable adaptive behaviors. Such affordance judgments are thought to rely on the perceived fit between environmental properties and knowledge of one's current physical capabilities. Little, however, is currently known about the ability of individuals to judge their own affordances following a stroke, or about the underlying neural mechanisms involved. To address these issues, we employed a signal detection approach to investigate the impact of left or right hemisphere injuries on judgments of whether a visual object was located within reach while remaining still (i.e., reachability). Regarding perceptual sensitivity and accuracy in judging reachability, there were no significant group differences between healthy controls (N = 29), right brain damaged (RBD, N = 17) and left brain damaged stroke patients (LBD, N = 17). However, while healthy controls and RBD patients demonstrated a negative response criterion and thus overestimated their reach capability, LBD patients' average response criterion converged to zero, indicating no judgment tendency. Critically, the LBD group's judgment tendency pattern is consistent with previous findings in this same sample on an affordance judgment task that required estimating whether the hand can fit through apertures (Randerath et al., 2018). Lesion analysis suggests that this loss of judgment tendency may be associated with damage to the left insula, the left parietal and middle temporal lobe. Based on these results, we propose that damage to the left ventro-dorsal stream disrupts the retrieval and processing of a stable criterion, leading to stronger reliance on intact on-line body-perceptive processes computed within the preserved bilateral dorsal network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Improvement of Multiparametric MR Image Segmentation by Augmenting the Data With Generative Adversarial Networks for Glioma Patients</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Every year thousands of patients are diagnosed with a glioma, a type of malignant brain tumor. MRI plays an essential role in the diagnosis and treatment assessment of these patients. Neural networks show great potential to aid physicians in the medical image analysis. This study investigated the creation of synthetic brain T1-weighted (T1), post-contrast T1-weighted (T1CE), T2-weighted (T2), and T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (Flair) MR images. These synthetic MR (synMR) images were assessed quantitatively with four metrics. The synMR images were also assessed qualitatively by an authoring physician with notions that synMR possessed realism in its portrayal of structural boundaries but struggled to accurately depict tumor heterogeneity. Additionally, this study investigated the synMR images created by generative adversarial network (GAN) to overcome the lack of annotated medical image data in training U-Nets to segment enhancing tumor, whole tumor, and tumor core regions on gliomas. Multiple two-dimensional (2D) U-Nets were trained with original BraTS data and differing subsets of the synMR images. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used as the loss function during training as well a quantitative metric. Additionally, Hausdorff Distance 95% CI (HD) was used to judge the quality of the contours created by these U-Nets. The model performance was improved in both DSC and HD when incorporating synMR in the training set. In summary, this study showed the ability to generate high quality Flair, T2, T1, and T1CE synMR images using GAN. Using synMR images showed encouraging results to improve the U-Net segmentation performance and shows potential to address the scarcity of annotated medical images.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mitochondria: Novel Mechanisms and Therapeutic Targets for Secondary Brain Injury After Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a destructive form of stroke that often results in death or disability. However, the survivors usually experience sequelae of neurological impairments and psychiatric disorders, which affect their daily functionality and working capacity. The recent MISTIE III and STICH II trials have confirmed that early surgical clearance of hematomas does not improve the prognosis of survivors of ICH, so it is vital to find the intervention target of secondary brain injury (SBI) after ICH. Mitochondrial dysfunction, which may be induced by oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and autophagy, among others, is considered to be a novel pathological mechanism of ICH. Moreover, mitochondria play an important role in promoting neuronal survival and improving neurological function after a hemorrhagic stroke. This review summarizes the mitochondrial mechanism involved in cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inflammatory activation, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and brain edema underlying ICH. We emphasize the potential of mitochondrial protection as a potential therapeutic target for SBI after stroke and provide valuable insight into clinical strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: FOXO Regulates Neuromuscular Junction Homeostasis During Drosophila Aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.567861</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.567861</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The transcription factor foxo is a known regulator of lifespan extension and tissue homeostasis. It has been linked to the maintenance of neuronal processes across many species and has been shown to promote youthful characteristics by regulating cytoskeletal flexibility and synaptic plasticity at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). However, the role of foxo in aging neuromuscular junction function has yet to be determined. We profiled adult Drosophila foxo- null mutant abdominal ventral longitudinal muscles and found that young mutants exhibited morphological profiles similar to those of aged wild-type flies, such as larger bouton areas and shorter terminal branches. We also observed changes to the axonal cytoskeleton and an accumulation of late endosomes in foxo null mutants and motor neuron-specific foxo knockdown flies, similar to those of aged wild-types. Motor neuron-specific overexpression of foxo can delay age-dependent changes to NMJ morphology, suggesting foxo is responsible for maintaining NMJ integrity during aging. Through genetic screening, we identify several downstream factors mediated through foxo-regulated NMJ homeostasis, including genes involved in the MAPK pathway. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of p38 was increased in the motor neuron-specific foxo knockdown flies, suggesting foxo acts as a suppressor of p38/MAPK activation. Our work reveals that foxo is a key regulator for NMJ homeostasis, and it may maintain NMJ integrity by repressing MAPK signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Foxc1 establishes enhancer accessibility for craniofacial cartilage differentiation</title>

	<description>The specification of cartilage requires Sox9, a transcription factor with broad roles for organogenesis outside the skeletal system. How Sox9 and other factors gain access to cartilage-specific cis-regulatory regions during skeletal development was unknown. By analyzing chromatin accessibility during the differentiation of neural crest cells into chondrocytes of the zebrafish head, we find that cartilage-associated chromatin accessibility is dynamically established. Cartilage-associated regions that become accessible after neural crest migration are co-enriched for Sox9 and Fox transcription factor binding motifs. In zebrafish lacking Foxc1 paralogs, we find a global decrease in chromatin accessibility in chondrocytes, consistent with a later loss of dorsal facial cartilages. Zebrafish transgenesis assays confirm that many of these Foxc1-dependent elements function as enhancers with region- and stage-specific activity in facial cartilages. These results show that Foxc1 promotes chondrogenesis in the face by establishing chromatin accessibility at a number of cartilage-associated gene enhancers.</description>

	<description>Learning and decision making are interactive processes, yet cognitive modelling of error-driven learning and decision making have largely evolved separately. Recently, evidence accumulation models (EAMs) of decision making and reinforcement learning (RL) models of error-driven learning have been combined into joint RL-EAMs that can in principle address these interactions. However, we show that the most commonly used combination, based on the diffusion decision model (DDM) for binary choice, consistently fails to capture crucial aspects of response times observed during reinforcement learning. We propose a new RL-EAM based on an advantage racing diffusion (ARD) framework for choices among two or more options that not only addresses this problem but captures stimulus difficulty, speed-accuracy trade-off, and stimulus-response-mapping reversal effects. The RL-ARD avoids fundamental limitations imposed by the DDM on addressing effects of absolute values of choices, as well as extensions beyond binary choice, and provides a computationally tractable basis for wider applications.</description>

	<description>Spermatogenesis, the complex process of male germ cell proliferation, differentiation, and maturation, is the basis of male fertility. In the seminiferous tubules of the testes, spermatozoa are constantly generated from spermatogonial stem cells through a stereotyped sequence of mitotic and meiotic divisions. The basic physiological principles, however, that control both maturation and luminal transport of the still immotile spermatozoa within the seminiferous tubules remain poorly, if at all, defined. Here, we show that coordinated contractions of smooth muscle-like testicular peritubular cells provide the propulsive force for luminal sperm transport toward the rete testis. Using a mouse model for in vivo imaging, we describe and quantify spontaneous tubular contractions and show a causal relationship between peritubular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; waves and peristaltic transport. Moreover, we identify P2 receptor-dependent purinergic signaling pathways as physiological triggers of tubular contractions both in vitro and in vivo. When challenged with extracellular ATP, transport of luminal content inside the seminiferous tubules displays stage-dependent directionality. We thus suggest that paracrine purinergic signaling coordinates peristaltic recurrent contractions of the mouse seminiferous tubules to propel immotile spermatozoa to the rete testis.</description>

	<description>Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCLs) are generated by transforming primary B cells with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and are used extensively as model systems in viral oncology, immunology, and human genetics research. In this study, we characterized single-cell transcriptomic profiles of five LCLs and present a simple discrete-time simulation to explore the influence of stochasticity on LCL clonal evolution. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed substantial phenotypic heterogeneity within and across LCLs with respect to immunoglobulin isotype; virus-modulated host pathways involved in survival, activation, and differentiation; viral replication state; and oxidative stress. This heterogeneity is likely attributable to intrinsic variance in primary B cells and host-pathogen dynamics. Stochastic simulations demonstrate that initial primary cell heterogeneity, random sampling, time in culture, and even mild differences in phenotype-specific fitness can contribute substantially to dynamic diversity in populations of nominally clonal cells.</description>

	<title>eLife: Drift and termination of spiral waves in optogenetically modified cardiac tissue at sub-threshold illumination</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59954</link>
	<description>The development of new approaches to control cardiac arrhythmias requires a deep understanding of spiral wave dynamics. Optogenetics offers new possibilities for this. Preliminary experiments show that sub-threshold illumination affects electrical wave propagation in the mouse heart. However, a systematic exploration of these effects is technically challenging. Here, we use state-of-the-art computer models to study the dynamic control of spiral waves in a two-dimensional model of the adult mouse ventricle, using stationary and non-stationary patterns of sub-threshold illumination. Our results indicate a light-intensity-dependent increase in cellular resting membrane potentials, which together with diffusive cell-cell coupling leads to the development of spatial voltage gradients over differently illuminated areas. A spiral wave drifts along the positive gradient. These gradients can be strategically applied to ensure drift-induced termination of a spiral wave, both in optogenetics and in conventional methods of electrical defibrillation.</description>

	<title>eLife: Pleiotropic mutations can rapidly evolve to directly benefit self and cooperative partner despite unfavorable conditions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57838</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57838</link>
	<description>Cooperation, paying a cost to benefit others, is widespread. Cooperation can be promoted by pleiotropic 'win-win' mutations which directly benefit self ('self-serving') and partner ('partner-serving'). Previously, we showed that partner-serving should be defined as increased benefit supply rate per intake benefit (Hart &amp;amp; Pineda et al., 2019). Here, we report that win-win mutations can rapidly evolve even under conditions unfavorable for cooperation. Specifically, in a well-mixed environment we evolved engineered yeast cooperative communities where two strains exchanged costly metabolites lysine and hypoxanthine. Among cells that consumed lysine and released hypoxanthine, &lt;i&gt;ecm21&lt;/i&gt; mutations repeatedly arose. &lt;i&gt;ecm21 &lt;/i&gt;is self-serving, improving self's growth rate in limiting lysine. &lt;i&gt;ecm21&lt;/i&gt; is also partner-serving, increasing hypoxanthine release rate per lysine consumption and the steady state growth rate of partner. &lt;i&gt;ecm21&lt;/i&gt; also arose in monocultures evolving in lysine-limited chemostats. Thus, even without any history of cooperation or pressure to maintain cooperation, pleiotropic win-win mutations may readily evolve.</description>

	<title>eLife: SUMO is a pervasive regulator of meiosis</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57720</link>
	<description>Protein modification by SUMO helps orchestrate the elaborate events of meiosis to faithfully produce haploid gametes. To date, only a handful of meiotic SUMO targets have been identified. Here we delineate a multidimensional SUMO-modified meiotic proteome in budding yeast, identifying 2747 conjugation sites in 775 targets, and defining their relative levels and dynamics. Modified sites cluster in disordered regions and only a minority match consensus motifs. Target identities and modification dynamics imply that SUMOylation regulates all levels of chromosome organization and each step of meiotic prophase I. Execution-point analysis confirms these inferences, revealing functions for SUMO in S-phase, the initiation of recombination, chromosome synapsis and crossing over. K15-linked SUMO chains become prominent as chromosomes synapse and recombine, consistent with roles in these processes. SUMO also modifies ubiquitin, forming hybrid oligomers with potential to modulate ubiquitin signaling. We conclude that SUMO plays diverse and unanticipated roles in regulating meiotic chromosome metabolism.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Cortical representation variability aligns with in-class variances and can help one-shot learning</title>

	<description>Learning invariance across a set of transformations is an important step in mapping high-dimensional inputs to a limited number of classes. After understanding the set of invariances, can a new class be learned from one element? We propose a representation which can facilitate such learning: if the variability in representing individual elements across trials aligns with the variability among different elements in a class, then class boundaries learned from the variable representations of one element should be representative of the entire class. In this study, we test whether such a representation occurs in mouse visual systems. We use Neuropixels probes recording single unit activity in mice observing 200 repeats of natural movies taken from a set of 9 continuous clips. We observe that the trial-by-trial variability in the representation of individual frames is well aligned to the variability in representation of multiple frames from the same clip, but not well aligned to the variability among frames from different clips. Thus, the variable representations of images in the mouse cortex can be efficiently used to classify images into their clips. We compare these representations to those in artificial neural networks. We find that, when introducing noise in networks trained for classification (both feed-forward and recurrent networks), the variability in the representation of elements aligns with the in-class variance. The networks which best reproduce the in-vivo observed directions of variability were those trained on a hierarchical classification task. Taken together, these results point to a solution which the cortex can use for one-shot learning of a class: by using noise as a mechanism for generalization. This is a potential computational explanation for the high level of noise observed in the cortex.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Modulating short-term auditory memory with focal transcranial direct current stimulation applied to the Supramarginal Gyrus</title>

	<description>Previous studies have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can affect performance by decreasing regional excitability in a brain region that contributes to the task of interest. To our knowledge, no research to date has found both enhancing and diminishing effects on performance, depending upon which polarity of current is applied. The supramarginal gyrus (SMG) is an ideal brain region for testing tDCS effects because it is easy to identify using the 10-20 EEG coordinate system, and results of neuroimaging studies have implicated the left SMG in short-term memory for phonological and non-phonological sounds. In the present study, we found that applying tDCS to the left SMG affected pitch memory in a manner that depended upon the polarity of stimulation: cathodal tDCS had a negative impact on performance while anodal tDCS had a positive impact. These effects were significantly different from sham stimulation, which did not influence performance; they were also specific to the left hemisphere (no effect was found when applying cathodal stimulation to the right SMG) and were unique to pitch memory as opposed to memory for visual shapes. Our results provide further evidence that the left SMG is a nodal point for short-term auditory storage and demonstrate the potential of tDCS to influence cognitive performance, and to causally examine hypotheses derived from neuroimaging studies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: UNC-2 CaV2 channel localization at presynaptic active zones depends on UNC-10/RIM and SYD-2/Liprin-α in Caenorhabditis elegans.</title>

	<description>Presynaptic active zone proteins couple calcium influx with synaptic vesicle exocytosis. However, the control of presynaptic calcium channel clustering by active zone proteins is not completely understood. In a C. elegans forward genetic screen, we find that UNC-10/RIM (Rab3-interacting molecule) and SYD-2/Liprin- regulate presynaptic clustering of UNC-2, the CaV2 channel ortholog. We further quantitatively analyzed live animals using endogenously GFP-tagged UNC-2 and active zone components. Consistent with the interaction between RIM and CaV2 in mammals, the intensity and number of UNC-2 channel clusters at presynaptic terminals were greatly reduced in unc-10 mutant animals. To understand how SYD-2 regulates presynaptic UNC-2 channel clustering, we analyzed presynaptic localization of endogenous SYD-2, UNC-10, RIMB-1/RIM-BP (RIM binding protein), and ELKS-1. Our analysis revealed that while SYD-2 is the most critical for active zone assembly, loss of SYD-2 function does not completely abolish presynaptic localization of UNC-10, RIMB-1, and ELKS-1, suggesting an existence of SYD-2-independent active zone assembly. UNC-2 localization analysis in double and triple mutants of active zone components show that SYD-2 promotes UNC-2 clustering by partially controlling UNC-10 localization, and ELKS-1 and RIMB-1 also contribute to UNC-2 channel clustering. In addition, we find that core active zone proteins are unequal in their abundance. While the abundance of UNC-10 at the active zone is comparable to UNC-2, SYD-2 and ELKS-1 are twice more and RIMB-1 four times more abundant than UNC-2. Together our data show that UNC-10, SYD-2, RIMB-1, and ELKS-1 control presynaptic UNC-2 channel clustering in redundant yet distinct manners.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Astrocytic VMAT2 in the developing prefrontal cortex is required for normal grooming behavior in mice</title>

	<description>Astrocytes control synaptic activity by modulating peri-synaptic concentrations of ion and neurotransmitters including dopamine and, as such, can be critically involved in the modulation of some aspect of mammalian behavior. Here we report that genetic mouse model with a reduced medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) dopamine levels, arising from astrocyte-specific conditional deletion of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2; aVMTA2cKO mice) shows excessive grooming and anxiety-like behaviour. The VMAT2cKO mice also develop a synaptic pathology, expressed through increased relative AMPA vs. NMDA receptor currents in synapses of the dorsal striatum receiving inputs from the mPFC. Importantly, behavioural and synaptic phenotypes are prevented by re-expression of mPFC VMAT2, showing that the deficits are driven by mPFC astrocytes. By analysing human tissue samples, we found that VMAT2 is expressed in human mPFC astrocytes, corroborating the potential translational relevance of our observations in mice. Our study shows that impairments of the astrocytic-control of dopamine in the mPFC has a profound impact on circuit function and behaviours, which resemble symptoms of anxiety disorders and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Development of white matter tracts between and within the dorsal and ventral streams</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.27.428423v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The degree of interaction between the ventral and dorsal visual streams has been discussed in multiple scientific domains for decades. Recently, several white matter tracts that directly connect the dorsal and ventral streams have become possible to study using automated and reproducible methods. The developmental trajectory of this set of tracts, the posterior vertical pathway (PVP), is yet to be described. We propose an input-driven model of white matter development and provide evidence for the model by focusing on PVP development. We used reproducible cloud-computing methods and diffusion imaging from adults and children (ages 5-8 years) to compare PVP development to that of tracts within the ventral and dorsal pathways. PVP microstructure was more adult-like than dorsal stream microstructure but less adult-like than ventral stream microstructure. Additionally, PVP microstructure was more similar to the microstructure of the ventral than dorsal stream and was predicted by performance on a perceptual task in children. Overall, results suggest a key role for the PVP in the development of the dorsal visual stream that may be related to its ability to facilitate interactions between ventral and dorsal streams during learning. The results are consistent with the proposed model, suggesting that the microstructural development of major white matter pathways is related, at least in part, to the feed-forward propagation of sensory information within the visual system.</description>

	<description>Tetrameric ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system and are involved in learning, memory formation, and pathological processes. Based on structural and sequence similarities of the ligand-binding and channel domains of iGluR subunits to bacterial binding proteins and potassium channels, iGluRs are thought to have originally arisen from their fusion. Here we report the functional coupling of the bacterial ectoine binding protein EhuB to the channel pore-forming transmembrane domains of the bacterial GluR0 receptor by stabilization of dimeric binding domains. Insertion of a disulfide bridge in the dimer interface abolished desensitization of the channel current analogous to mammalian iGluRs. These results demonstrate the functional compatibility of bacterial binding proteins to the gate of the channel pore of an iGluR. Moreover, our results highlight the modular structure and crucial role of binding domain dimerization in the functional evolution of iGluRs.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Iron-loading is a prominent feature of activated microglia in Alzheimer's disease patients</title>

	<description>Brain iron accumulation has been found to accelerate disease progression in Amyloid [beta]-positive Alzheimer patients, though the mechanism is still unknown. Microglia have been identified as key-players in the disease pathogenesis, and are highly reactive cells responding to aberrations such as increased iron levels. Therefore, using histological methods, multispectral immunofluorescence and an automated in-house developed microglia segmentation and analysis pipeline, we studied the occurrence of iron-accumulating microglia and the effect on its activation state in human Alzheimer brains. We identified a subset of microglia with increased expression of the iron storage protein ferritin light chain (FTL), together with increased Iba1 expression, decreased TMEM119 and P2RY12 expression. This activated microglia subset represented iron-accumulating microglia and appeared morphologically dystrophic. Multispectral immunofluorescence allowed for spatial analysis of FTL+Iba1+-microglia, which were found to be the predominant A[beta];-plaque infiltrating microglia. Finally, an increase of FTL+Iba1+-microglia was seen in patients with high Amyloid-[beta] load and Tau load. These findings suggest iron to be taken up by microglia and to influence the functional phenotype of these cells, especially in conjunction with A[beta].</description>

	<description>Ultra-multiplexed fluorescence imaging of biomolecules is essential to studying heterogeneous biological systems. However, this is challenging due to fluorophores' spectral overlap and variation of the emission spectra. Here, we propose a strategy termed PICASSO, which enables more than 15-colour multiplexed imaging of thick tissue slices through a single imaging process and blind unmixing without reference spectra measurement. We show that PICASSO can be used to achieve a high multiplexing capability in diverse applications, such as 3D protein imaging, expansion microscopy, tissue clearing, imaging of clinical specimens, and cyclic immunofluorescence imaging. PICASSO only requires an equal number of images as the number of fluorophores, enabling such a high level of multiplexed imaging even with bandpass filter-based microscopy. As such, PICASSO would be a useful tool for the study of cancer, the immune system, and the brain, as well as for the diagnosis of cancer, as it enables ultra-multiplexed imaging of diverse specimens with minimum instrumental requirements and experimental processes.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Sensitivity enhancement and selection are shared mechanisms for spatial and feature-based attention</title>

	<description>Human observers use cues to guide visual attention to the most behaviorally relevant parts of the visual world. Cues are often separated into two forms: those that rely on spatial location and those that use features, such as motion or color. These forms of cueing are known to rely on different populations of neurons. Despite these differences in neural implementation, attention may rely on shared computational principles, enhancing and selecting sensory representations in a similar manner for all types of cues. Here we examine whether evidence for shared computational mechanisms can be obtained from how attentional cues enhance performance in estimation tasks. In our tasks, observers were cued either by spatial location or feature to two of four dot patches. They then estimated the color or motion direction of one of the cued patches, or averaged them. In all cases we found that cueing improved performance. We decomposed the effects of the cues on behavior into model parameters that separated sensitivity enhancement from sensory selection and found that both were important to explain improved performance. We found that a model which shared parameters across forms of cueing was favored by our analysis, suggesting that observers have equal sensitivity and likelihood of making selection errors whether cued by location or feature. Our perceptual data support theories in which a shared computational mechanism is re-used by all forms of attention.</description>

	<description>Sensory information from different modalities is processed in parallel, and then integrated in associative brain areas to improve object identification and the interpretation of sensory experiences. The Superior Colliculus (SC) is a midbrain structure that plays a critical role in integrating visual, auditory, and somatosensory input to assess saliency and promote action. Although the response properties of the individual SC neurons to visuoauditory stimuli have been characterized, little is known about the spatial and temporal dynamics of the integration at the population level. Here we recorded the response properties of SC neurons to spatially restricted visual and auditory stimuli using large-scale electrophysiology. We then created a general, population-level model that explains the spatial, temporal, and intensity requirements of stimuli needed for sensory integration. We found that the mouse SC contains topographically organized visual and auditory neurons that exhibit nonlinear multisensory integration. We show that nonlinear integration depends on properties of auditory but not visual stimuli. We also find that a heuristically derived nonlinear modulation function reveals conditions required for sensory integration that are consistent with previously proposed models of sensory integration such as spatial matching and the principle of inverse effectiveness.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Training neural networks to recognize speech increased their correspondence to the human auditory pathway but did not yield a shared hierarchy of acoustic features</title>

	<description>The correspondence between the activity of artificial neurons in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained to recognize objects in images and neural activity collected throughout the primate visual system has been well documented. Shallower layers of CNNs are typically more similar to early visual areas and deeper layers tend to be more similar to later visual areas, providing evidence for a shared representational hierarchy. This phenomenon has not been thoroughly studied in the auditory domain. Here, we compared the representations of CNNs trained to recognize speech (triphone recognition) to 7-Tesla fMRI activity collected throughout the human auditory pathway, including subcortical and cortical regions, while participants listened to speech. We found no evidence for a shared representational hierarchy of acoustic speech features. Instead, all auditory regions of interest were most similar to a single layer of the CNNs: the first fully-connected layer. This layer sits at the boundary between the relatively task-general intermediate layers and the highly task-specific final layers. This suggests that alternative architectural designs and/or training objectives may be needed to achieve fine-grained layer-wise correspondence with the human auditory pathway.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: BNP facilitates NMB-mediated histaminergic itch via NPRC-NMBR crosstalk</title>

	<description>B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) binds to its two cognate receptors NPRA and NPRC, encoded by Npr1 and Npr3, respectively, with equal potency and both are expressed in the spinal cord. Moreover, natriuretic peptides (NP) signal through the inhibitory cGMP pathway, raising the question of how BNP may transmit itch information. We report that Npr3 is highly restricted to laminae I-II of the dorsal horn, and partially overlaps with neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) that encodes histaminergic itch. Functional studies indicate that NPRC is required for itch evoked by histamine but not chloroquine (CQ), a nonhistaminergic pruritogen. Importantly, BNP significantly facilitates scratching behaviors mediated by NMB, but not gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) that encodes nonhistaminergic itch. Consistently, BNP evoked Ca2+ response in NMBR/NPRC HEK 293 cells and BNP-saporin that ablated both Npr1 and Npr3 neurons impaired histamine-, but not CQ-evoked, itch. These results reveal a previously unknown mechanism by which BNP changes its inhibitory mode of action to the facilitation of itch through a novel NPRC-NMBR cross-talk. Our studies suggest that neuropeptides encode histaminergic and nonhistaminergic itch not only through distinct modes but also in synergy.</description>

	<description>Towards the larger goal of understanding factors relevant for improving visuomotor control, we investigated the role of visual feedback for modulating the effectiveness of a simple hand-eye training protocol. The regimen comprised a series of curve tracing tasks undertaken over a period of one week by neurologically healthy individuals with their non-dominant hands. Our three subject groups differed in the training they experienced: those who received 'Persistent' visual feedback by seeing their hand and trace evolve in real-time superimposed upon the reference patterns, those who received 'Non-Persistent' visual-feedback seeing their hand movement but not the emerging trace, and a 'Control' group that underwent no training. Improvements in performance were evaluated along two dimensions - accuracy and steadiness, to assess visuomotor and motor skills, respectively. We found that persistent feedback leads to a significantly greater improvement in accuracy than non-persistent feedback. Steadiness, on the other hand, benefits from training irrespective of the persistence of feedback. Our results not only demonstrate the feasibility of rapid visuo-motor learning in adulthood, but more specifically, the influence of visual veridicality and a critical role for dynamically emergent visual information.</description>

	<description>The study or artificial-arms provides a unique opportunity to address long-standing questions on sensorimotor plasticity and development. Learning to use an artificial-arm arguably depends on fundamental building blocks of body representation and would therefore be impacted by early-life experience. We tested artificial-arm motor-control in two adult populations with upper-limb deficiency: congenital one-handers - who were born with a partial arm, and amputees - who lost their biological arm in adulthood. Although one-hander started using an artificial-arm at an early age, they produced increased error noise and directional errors when reaching to visual targets, relative to amputees who performed similarly to controls. However, the earlier a one-hander was fitted with an artificial-arm the better their motor control was. We suggest that visuomotor integration, underlying the observed deficits, is highly dependent on either biological- or artificial-arm experience at very young age, Subsequently, opportunities for sensorimotor plasticity become more limited.</description>

	<description>How cognitive task information emerges from brain activity is a central question in neuroscience. We identified the spatiotemporal emergence of task information in the human brain using individualized source electroencephalography and dynamic multivariate pattern analysis. We then substantially extended recently developed brain activity flow models to predict the future emergence of task information dynamics. The model simulated the flow of task-evoked activity over causally interpretable resting-state functional connections (dynamic, lagged, direct and directional) to accurately predict response information dynamics underlying cognitive task behavior. Predicting event-related spatiotemporal activity patterns and fine-grained representational geometry confirmed the model's faithfulness to how the brain veridically represents response information. Simulated network &quot;lesioning&quot; revealed cognitive control networks (CCNs) as the dominant causal drivers of response information flow. These results demonstrate the efficacy of dynamic activity flow models in predicting the emergence of task information, thereby revealing a mechanistic role for CCNs in producing behavior.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Identification of TIA1 mRNA targets during human neuronal development</title>

	<description>Background: Neuronal development is a tightly controlled process involving multi-layered regulatory mechanisms. While transcriptional pathways regulating neurodevelopment are well characterized, post-transcriptional programs are still poorly understood. TIA1 is an RNA-binding protein that can regulate splicing, stability, or translation of target mRNAs, and has been shown to play critical roles in neurodevelopment. However, the identity of mRNAs regulated by TIA1 during neurodevelopment is still unknown. Methods and Results: To identify the mRNAs targeted by TIA1 during the first stages of human neurodevelopment, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (RIP-seq) on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and cortical neurons. While there was no change in TIA1 protein levels, the number of TIA1 targeted mRNAs decreased from pluripotent cells to neurons. We identified 2400, 845, and 330 TIA1 mRNA targets in hESCs, NPC, and neurons, respectively. The vast majority of mRNA targets in hESC were genes associated with neurodevelopment and included autism spectrum disorder-risk genes that were not bound in neurons. Additionally, we found that most TIA1 mRNA targets have reduced ribosomal engagement levels. Conclusion: Our results reveal TIA1 mRNA targets in hESCs and during human neurodevelopment, indicate that translation repression is a key process targeted by TIA1 binding and implicate TIA1 function in neuronal differentiation.</description>

	<description>Sleep bruxism (SB) is a sleep-related movement disorder characterized by grinding and clenching of the teeth during sleep. We previously found a significant association between SB and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs6313, in the neuronal serotonin 2A receptor gene (HTR2A), and established human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons from SB patients with a genetic variant. To elucidate the electrophysiological characteristics of SB iPSC-derived neural cells bearing a SB-related genetic variant, we generated ventral hindbrain neurons from two SB patients and two unaffected controls and explored the intrinsic membrane properties of these neurons by patch-clamp technique. We found that the electrophysiological properties of the iPSC-derived neurons from the control line mature in a time-dependent manner in long-term cultures. In the early stage of neurogenesis, neurons from two SB lines tended to display shorter action potential (AP) half durations, which led to an increased cell capability of evoked firing. This is the first in vitro modelling of SB using disease-specific hiPSCs. The revealed electrophysiological characteristics may serve as a benchmark for further investigation of pathogenic mechanisms underlying SB.</description>

	<description>We propose a new framework for estimating neuroimaging-derived ``brain-age'' at a local level within the brain, using deep learning. The local approach, contrary to existing global methods, provides spatial anatomical information on patterns of brain ageing. We trained a U-Net model on brain MRI scans from n=3463 healthy people to produce individualised 3D maps of brain-predicted age. Testing on n=692 healthy people resulted in a median (across subject) mean absolute error (within subject) of 9.0 years. Performance was more accurate (MAE around 7 years) in the prefrontal cortex and periventricular areas. We also introduce a new voxelwise method to reduce the age-bias when predicting local brain-age ``gaps''. To validate local brain-age predictions, we tested the model in people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia using data from OASIS3 (n=267). Different local brain-age patterns were clearly evident between healthy controls and people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia, particularly in subcortical regions, with the accumbens, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus and amygdala. Comparing groups based on mean local brain-age over regions-of-interest resulted in large effects sizes, with Cohen's d values &amp;gt;1.5, for example when comparing people with stable and progressive mild cognitive impairment.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Genetic depletion of BDNF impairs both context-dependent and context-independent extinction learning of a spatial appetitive task</title>

	<description>Brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) supports neuronal survival, growth, and differentiation and is involved in forms of hippocampus-dependent learning, as well as hippocampus-dependent learning. Extinction learning (EL) comprises active inhibition of no-longer relevant learned information, in conjunction with a decreased response of a previously learned behavior. It is highly dependent on context, and evidence exists that it requires hippocampal activation. Concordantly, the participation of BDNF in hippocampus-dependent memory is experience-dependent. BDNF has been associated with synaptic plasticity needed for acquisition and extinction learning of fear conditioning. However, little is known about its influence on the extinction and renewal of spatial appetitive extinction learning (EL). In this study, in BDNF+/--mice we evaluated to what extent BDNF contributes to spatial appetitive EL in the presence (ABA) or absence (AAA) of a context change. Daily training, to reach acquisition criterion in a T-maze, resulted in a similar outcome in BDNF+/--mice or their wildtype (wt) littermates. EL was delayed in the AAA, and significantly impaired in the ABA-context compared to EL in wt littermates. When renewal was tested in the ABA paradigm we detected a significant response in wt controls, but not in BDNF+/--mice. Taken together, these results support an important role for BDNF in EL in AAA and ABA context, as well as renewal of a spatial appetitive task, processes that relate to information updating and retrieval.</description>

	<description>Microglia, the macrophages of the brain, are increasingly recognized to play a key role in synaptic plasticity and function; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is an essential protein involved in learning and memory, through neuronal mechanisms. Loss of Presenilin function in neurons impairs synapse plasticity and causes cognitive deficits in mice. Surprisingly, here we show memory enhancement in mice by deleting PS1 selectively in microglia. We further demonstrate increased synapse transmission and in vivo neuronal activity in mice by depleting PS1 during microglial development, but not after microglial maturation. Remarkably, conditional deletion of PS1 in microglia during development increased memory retention in adulthood, and was dependent on the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B. In vivo calcium imaging of freely behaving mice revealed increased amplitude of neuronal Ca2+ transients in the CA1 hippocampus of PS1 cKO mice compared to control mice, suggesting a greater CA1 engagement during novel object exploration. Finally, loss of PS1 in microglia mitigated synaptic and cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Together our results reveal a novel mechanism and function of PS1 in microglia in which modulation can enhance neuronal activity, learning and memory in mice.</description>

	<description>Attention can facilitate or impair texture segmentation, altering whether objects are isolated from their surroundings in visual scenes. We simultaneously explain several empirical phenomena of texture segmentation and its attentional modulation with a single image-computable model. At the model's core, segmentation relies on the interaction between sensory processing and attention, with different operating regimes for involuntary and voluntary attention systems. Model comparisons were used to identify computations critical for texture segmentation and attentional modulation. The model reproduced (i) the central performance drop, which is the parafoveal advantage for segmentation over the fovea, (ii) the peripheral improvements and central impairments induced by involuntary attention and (iii) the uniform improvements across eccentricity by voluntary attention. The proposed model reveals distinct functional roles for involuntary and voluntary attention and provides a generalizable quantitative framework for predicting the perceptual impact of attention across the visual field.</description>

	<description>Information about a persons available energy resources is integrated in daily behavioral choices that weigh motor costs against expected rewards. It has been posited that humans have an innate attraction towards effort minimization and that executive control is required to overcome this prepotent disposition. With sedentary behaviors increasing at the cost of millions of dollars spent in health care and productivity losses due to physical inactivity-related deaths, understanding the predictors of sedentary behaviors will improve future intervention development and precision medicine approaches. In 64 healthy older adults participating in a 6-month aerobic exercise intervention, we use neuroimaging (resting state functional connectivity), baseline measures of executive function and accelerometer measures of time spent sedentary to predict future changes in objectively measured time spent sedentary in daily life. Using cross-validation and bootstrap resampling, our results demonstrate that functional connectivity between 1) the anterior cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor area and 2) the right anterior insula and the left temporoparietal/temporooccipital junction, predict changes in time spent sedentary, whereas baseline cognitive, behavioral and demographic measures do not. Previous research has shown activation in and between the anterior cingulate and supplementary motor area as well as in the right anterior insula during effort avoidance and tasks that integrate motor costs and reward benefits in effort-based decision making. Our results add important knowledge toward understanding mechanistic associations underlying complex sedentary behaviors.</description>

	<description>Humans use rapid eye movements (saccades) to inspect stimuli with the foveola, the region of the retina where receptors are most densely packed. It is well established that visual sensitivity is generally attenuated during these movements, a phenomenon known as saccadic suppression. This effect is commonly studied with large, often peripheral, stimuli presented during instructed saccades. However, little is known about how saccades modulate the foveola and how the resulting dynamics unfold during natural visual exploration. Here we measured the foveal dynamics of saccadic suppression in a naturalistic high-acuity task, a task designed after primate's social grooming, which---like most explorations of fine patterns---primarily elicits minute saccades (microsaccades). Leveraging on recent advances in gaze-contingent display control, we were able to systematically map the peri-saccadic time-course of sensitivity across the foveola. We show that contrast sensitivity is not uniform across this region and that both the extent and dynamics of saccadic suppression vary within the foveola. Suppression is stronger and faster in the most central portion, where sensitivity is generally higher and selectively rebounds at the onset of a new fixation. These results shed new light on the modulations experienced by foveal vision during the saccade-fixation cycle and explain some of the benefits of microsaccades.</description>

	<description>Spike-based neural network models have so far not been able to reproduce the capability of the brain to learn from very few, often even from just a single example. We show that this deficiency of models disappears if one allows synaptic weights to store priors and other information that optimize the learning process, while using the network state to quickly absorb information from new examples. For that, it suffices to include biologically realistic neurons with spike frequency adaptation in the neural network model, and to optimize the learning process through meta-learning. We demonstrate this on a variety of tasks, including fast learning and deletion of attractors, adaptation of motor control to changes in the body, and solving the Morris water maze task -- a paradigm for fast learning of navigation to a new goal.</description>

	<description>Background: Recent advances in tissue clearing techniques, combined with high-speed image acquisition through light sheet microscopy, enable rapid three-dimensional (3D) imaging of biological specimens, such as whole mouse brains, in a matter of hours. Quantitative analysis of such 3D images can help us understand how changes in brain structure lead to differences in behavior or cognition, but distinguishing features of interest, such as nuclei, from background can be challenging. Recent deep learning-based nuclear segmentation algorithms show great promise for automated segmentation, but require large numbers of manually and accurately labeled nuclei as training data. Results: We present Segmentor, an open-source tool for reliable, efficient, and user-friendly manual annotation and refinement of objects (e.g., nuclei) within 3D light sheet microscopy images. Segmentor employs a hybrid 2D-3D approach for visualizing and segmenting objects and contains features for automatic region splitting, designed specifically for streamlining the process of 3D segmentation of nuclei. We show that editing simultaneously in 2D and 3D using Segmentor significantly decreases time spent on manual annotations without affecting accuracy. Conclusions: Segmentor is a tool for increased efficiency of manual annotation and refinement of 3D objects that can be used to train deep learning segmentation algorithms, and is available at https://www.nucleininja.org/ and https://github.com/RENCI/Segmentor.</description>

	<description>The microenvironments of the brain consist of specialized cell types that together influence physiological functions in health and pathological outcomes in disease. Despite apparent differences in the density of neurons and oligodendrocytes in various milieus, such as gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), the extent of structural and functional heterogeneity of other resident cells remains unclear. We profiled RNA in ~500,000 nuclei from 19 tissue types across the central nervous system of the healthy adult common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and mapped 87 identified subclusters (including neurons, glia, and vasculature) spatially onto a 3D MRI atlas. We performed cross-species comparison, explored regulatory pathways, surveyed cellular determinants of neurological disorders, and modeled regional intercellular communication. We found spatially segregated microglia, oligodendrocyte lineage cells, and astrocytes in WM and GM. WM-glia are diverse, are enriched with genes involved in stimulus response and biomolecule modification, and interact with other resident cells more extensively than their GM counterparts. GM-glia preserve the expression of developmental morphogens into adulthood and share 6 differentially enriched transcription factors that restrict the transcriptome complexity. Our work in marmoset, an experimentally tractable animal model with &amp;gt;5 times more WM volume and complexity than mouse, identifies novel WM-glia subtypes and their contributions to different neurological disorders. A companion Callithrix jacchus Primate Cell Atlas (CjPCA) is available through an online portal https://cjpca.ninds.nih.gov to facilitate data exploration.</description>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26017?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Discovery of a novel antibody would enable diagnosis and early treatment of autoimmune encephalitis. The aim was to discover a novel antibody targeting a synaptic receptor and characterize the pathogenic mechanism.


Method
We screened for unknown antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from autoimmune encephalitis patients. Samples with reactivity to rat brain sections and no reactivity to conventional antibody tests underwent further processing for antibody discovery, using immunoprecipitation to primary neuronal cells, mass‐spectrometry analysis, an antigen‐binding assay on an antigen‐overexpressing cell line, and an electrophysiological assay with cultured hippocampal neurons.


Results
Two patients had a novel antibody against CaVα2δ (voltage‐gated calcium channel alpha‐2/delta subunit). The patient samples stained neuropils of the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cortex in rat brain sections and bound to a CaVα2δ‐overexpressing cell line. Knockdown of CaVα2δ expression in cultured neurons turned off the immunoreactivity of the antibody from the patients to the neurons. The patients were associated with preceding meningitis or neuroendocrine carcinoma and responded to immunotherapy. In cultured neurons, the antibody reduced neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals by interfering with tight coupling of calcium channels and exocytosis.


Interpretation
Here, we discovered a novel autoimmune encephalitis associated with anti‐CaVα2δ antibody. Further analysis of the antibody in autoimmune encephalitis might promote early diagnosis and treatment. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

Reproducibility and reusability of the results of data-based modeling studies are essential. Yet, there has been—so far—no broadly supported format for the specification of parameter estimation problems in systems biology. Here, we introduce PEtab, a format which facilitates the specification of parameter estimation problems using Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models and a set of tab-separated value files describing the observation model and experimental data as well as parameters to be estimated. We already implemented PEtab support into eight well-established model simulation and parameter estimation toolboxes with hundreds of users in total. We provide a Python library for validation and modification of a PEtab problem and currently 20 example parameter estimation problems based on recent studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WRScUWxI6B0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Steven Phillips&lt;/p&gt;

Learning transfer (i.e. accelerated learning over a series of structurally related learning tasks) differentiates species and age-groups, but the evolutionary and developmental implications of such differences are unclear. To this end, the &lt;i&gt;relational schema induction&lt;/i&gt; paradigm employing tasks that share algebraic (group-like) structures was introduced to contrast stimulus-independent (relational) versus stimulus-dependent (associative) learning processes. However, a theory explaining this kind of relational learning transfer has not been forthcoming beyond a general appeal to some form of structure-mapping, as typically assumed in models of analogy. In this paper, we provide a theory of relational schema induction as a “reconstruction” process: the algebraic structure underlying transfer is reconstructed by comparing stimulus relations, learned within each task, for structural consistency across tasks—formally, the theory derives from a category theory version of &lt;i&gt;Tannakian reconstruction&lt;/i&gt;. The theory also applies to non-human studies of relational concepts, thereby placing human and non-human transfer on common ground for sharper comparison and contrast. As the theory and paradigm do not depend on linguistic ability, we also have a way for pinpointing where aspects of human learning diverge from other species without begging the question of language.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/quoBLkb-MjE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The Metabolically Coupled Replicator System (MCRS) model of early chemical evolution offers a plausible and efficient mechanism for the self-assembly and the maintenance of prebiotic RNA replicator communities, the likely predecessors of all life forms on Earth. The MCRS can keep different replicator species together due to their mandatory metabolic cooperation and limited mobility on mineral surfaces, catalysing reaction steps of a coherent reaction network that produces their own monomers from externally supplied compounds. The complexity of the MCRS chemical engine can be increased by assuming that each replicator species may catalyse more than a single reaction of metabolism, with different catalytic activities of the same RNA sequence being in a trade-off relation: one catalytic activity of a promiscuous ribozyme can increase only at the expense of the others on the same RNA strand. Using extensive spatially explicit computer simulations we have studied the possibility and the conditions of evolving ribozyme promiscuity in an initial community of single-activity replicators attached to a 2D surface, assuming an additional trade-off between replicability and catalytic activity. We conclude that our promiscuous replicators evolve under weak catalytic trade-off, relatively strong activity/replicability trade-off and low surface mobility of the replicators and the metabolites they produce, whereas catalytic specialists benefit from very strong catalytic trade-off, weak activity/replicability trade-off and high mobility. We argue that the combination of conditions for evolving promiscuity are more probable to occur for surface-bound RNA replicators, suggesting that catalytic promiscuity may have been a significant factor in the diversification of prebiotic metabolic reaction networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cRhd0otMmbU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Both neurophysiological and psychophysical experiments have pointed out the crucial role of recurrent and feedback connections to process context-dependent information in the early visual cortex. While numerous models have accounted for feedback effects at either neural or representational level, none of them were able to bind those two levels of analysis. Is it possible to describe feedback effects at both levels using the same model? We answer this question by combining Predictive Coding (PC) and Sparse Coding (SC) into a hierarchical and convolutional framework applied to realistic problems. In the Sparse Deep Predictive Coding (SDPC) model, the SC component models the internal recurrent processing within each layer, and the PC component describes the interactions between layers using feedforward and feedback connections. Here, we train a 2-layered SDPC on two different databases of images, and we interpret it as a model of the early visual system (V1 &amp;amp; V2). We first demonstrate that once the training has converged, SDPC exhibits oriented and localized receptive fields in V1 and more complex features in V2. Second, we analyze the effects of feedback on the neural organization beyond the classical receptive field of V1 neurons using interaction maps. These maps are similar to association fields and reflect the Gestalt principle of good continuation. We demonstrate that feedback signals reorganize interaction maps and modulate neural activity to promote contour integration. Third, we demonstrate at the representational level that the SDPC feedback connections are able to overcome noise in input images. Therefore, the SDPC captures the association field principle at the neural level which results in a better reconstruction of blurred images at the representational level.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0PM5Rx4-nSU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used high-throughput technology to measure genome-wide gene expression at the single-cell level. One of the most common analyses of scRNA-seq data detects distinct subpopulations of cells through the use of unsupervised clustering algorithms. However, recent advances in scRNA-seq technologies result in current datasets ranging from thousands to millions of cells. Popular clustering algorithms, such as &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-means, typically require the data to be loaded entirely into memory and therefore can be slow or impossible to run with large datasets. To address this problem, we developed the &lt;i&gt;mbkmeans&lt;/i&gt; R/Bioconductor package, an open-source implementation of the mini-batch &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-means algorithm. Our package allows for on-disk data representations, such as the common HDF5 file format widely used for single-cell data, that do not require all the data to be loaded into memory at one time. We demonstrate the performance of the &lt;i&gt;mbkmeans&lt;/i&gt; package using large datasets, including one with 1.3 million cells. We also highlight and compare the computing performance of &lt;i&gt;mbkmeans&lt;/i&gt; against the standard implementation of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-means and other popular single-cell clustering methods. Our software package is available in Bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/mbkmeans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kyJHJ-vbw-c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The mammalian visual system has been the focus of countless experimental and theoretical studies designed to elucidate principles of neural computation and sensory coding. Most theoretical work has focused on networks intended to reflect developing or mature neural circuitry, in both health and disease. Few computational studies have attempted to model changes that occur in neural circuitry as an organism ages non-pathologically. In this work we contribute to closing this gap, studying how physiological changes correlated with advanced age impact the computational performance of a spiking network model of primary visual cortex (V1). Our results demonstrate that deterioration of homeostatic regulation of excitatory firing, coupled with long-term synaptic plasticity, is a sufficient mechanism to reproduce features of observed physiological and functional changes in neural activity data, specifically declines in inhibition and in selectivity to oriented stimuli. This suggests a potential causality between dysregulation of neuron firing and age-induced changes in brain physiology and functional performance. While this does not rule out deeper underlying causes or other mechanisms that could give rise to these changes, our approach opens new avenues for exploring these underlying mechanisms in greater depth and making predictions for future experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WAHfXnNgVUs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Physical constraints on early blastomere packings</title>

At very early embryonic stages, when embryos are composed of just a few cells, establishing the correct packing arrangements (contacts) between cells is essential for the proper development of the organism. As early as the 4-cell stage, the observed cellular packings in different species are distinct and, in many cases, differ from the equilibrium packings expected for simple adherent and deformable particles. It is unclear what are the specific roles that different physical parameters, such as the forces between blastomeres, their division times, orientation of cell division and embryonic confinement, play in the control of these packing configurations. Here we simulate the non-equilibrium dynamics of cells in early embryos and systematically study how these different parameters affect embryonic packings at the 4-cell stage. In the absence of embryo confinement, we find that cellular packings are not robust, with multiple packing configurations simultaneously possible and very sensitive to parameter changes. Our results indicate that the geometry of the embryo confinement determines the packing configurations at the 4-cell stage, removing degeneracy in the possible packing configurations and overriding division rules in most cases. Overall, these results indicate that physical confinement of the embryo is essential to robustly specify proper cellular arrangements at very early developmental stages.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0nqXF1-vy50&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Planning to speak is a challenge for the brain, and the challenge varies between and within languages. Yet, little is known about how neural processes react to these variable challenges beyond the planning of individual words. Here, we examine how fundamental differences in syntax shape the time course of sentence planning. Most languages treat alike (i.e., align with each other) the 2 uses of a word like “gardener” in “the gardener crouched” and in “the gardener planted trees.” A minority keeps these formally distinct by adding special marking in 1 case, and some languages display both aligned and nonaligned expressions. Exploiting such a contrast in Hindi, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking to suggest that this difference is associated with distinct patterns of neural processing and gaze behavior during early planning stages, preceding phonological word form preparation. Planning sentences with aligned expressions induces larger synchronization in the theta frequency band, suggesting higher working memory engagement, and more visual attention to agents than planning nonaligned sentences, suggesting delayed commitment to the relational details of the event. Furthermore, plain, unmarked expressions are associated with larger desynchronization in the alpha band than expressions with special markers, suggesting more engagement in information processing to keep overlapping structures distinct during planning. Our findings contrast with the observation that the form of aligned expressions is simpler, and they suggest that the global preference for alignment is driven not by its neurophysiological effect on sentence planning but by other sources, possibly by aspects of production flexibility and fluency or by sentence comprehension. This challenges current theories on how production and comprehension may affect the evolution and distribution of syntactic variants in the world’s languages.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Tm2ZR7VTFaI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Tsetse transmit African trypanosomiasis, which is a disease fatal to both humans and animals. A vaccine to protect against this disease does not exist so transmission control relies on eliminating tsetse populations. Although neurotoxic insecticides are the gold standard for insect control, they negatively impact the environment and reduce populations of insect pollinator species. Here we present a promising, environment-friendly alternative to current insecticides that targets the insect tyrosine metabolism pathway. A bloodmeal contains high levels of tyrosine, which is toxic to haematophagous insects if it is not degraded and eliminated. RNA interference (RNAi) of either the first two enzymes in the tyrosine degradation pathway (tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)) was lethal to tsetse. Furthermore, nitisinone (NTBC), an FDA-approved tyrosine catabolism inhibitor, killed tsetse regardless if the drug was orally or topically applied. However, oral administration of NTBC to bumblebees did not affect their survival. Using a novel mathematical model, we show that NTBC could reduce the transmission of African trypanosomiasis in sub-Saharan Africa, thus accelerating current disease elimination programmes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/hY4KuzQ60os&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes are a population of central nervous system (CNS) cells with distinctive morphological and functional characteristics that differ within specific areas of the brain and are widely distributed throughout the CNS. There are mainly two types of astrocytes, protoplasmic and fibrous, which differ in morphologic appearance and location. Astrocytes are important cells of the CNS that not only provide structural support, but also modulate synaptic activity, regulate neuroinflammatory responses, maintain the blood‐brain barrier, and supply energy to neurons. As a result, astrocytic disruption can lead to widespread detrimental effects and can contribute to the pathophysiology of several neurological conditions. The characteristics of astrocytes in more common neuropathologies such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease have significantly been described and continue to be widely studied. However, there still exist numerous rare neurological conditions in which astrocytic involvement is unknown and needs to be explored. Accordingly, this review will summarize functional and morphological changes of astrocytes in various rare neurological conditions based on current knowledge thus far and highlight remaining neuropathologies where astrocytic involvement has yet to be investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an oral drug approved for Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) patients. Grade III lymphopenia is reported in 5–10% DMF-treated patients. Data on lymphocyte count (ALC) recovery after DMF withdrawal following prolonged lymphopenia are still scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To characterize ALC recovery and to identify predictors of slower recovery after DMF interruption.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Multicenter data from RMS patients who started DMF and developed lymphopenia during treatment were collected. In patients with grade II–III lymphopenia, ALCs were evaluated from DMF withdrawal until reaching lymphocyte counts &amp;gt; 800/mm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Among 1034 patients who started DMF, we found 198 (19.1%) patients with lymphopenia and 65 patients (6.3%) who discontinued DMF due to persistent grade II–III lymphopenia. Complete data were available for 51 patients. All patients recovered to ALC &amp;gt; 800 cells/mm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with a median time of 3.4 months. Lower ALCs at DMF suspension (HR 0.98; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.005), longer disease duration (HR 1.29; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.014) and prior exposure to MS treatments (HR 0.03; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.025) were found predictive of delayed ALC recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ALC recovery after DMF withdrawal is usually rapid, nevertheless it may require longer time in patients with lower ALC count at DMF interruption, longer disease duration and previous exposure to MS treatments, potentially leading to delayed initiation of a new therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) is a composite score which can detect the first signs of cognitive impairment, which can be of importance for research and clinical practice. It is designed to be administered in person; however, in-person assessments are costly, and are difficult during the current COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To assess the feasibility of performing the PACC assessment with videoconferencing, and to compare the validity of this remote PACC with the in-person PACC obtained previously.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Participants from the HEalth and Ageing Data IN the Game of football (HEADING) Study who had already undergone an in-person assessment were re-contacted and re-assessed remotely. The correlation between the two PACC scores was estimated. The difference between the two PACC scores was calculated and used in multiple linear regression to assess which variables were associated with a difference in PACC scores.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Of the 43 participants who were invited to this external study, 28 were re-assessed. The median duration in days between the in-person and the remote assessments was 236.5 days (7.9 months) (IQR 62.5). There was a strong positive correlation between the two assessments for the PACC score, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0·82 (95% CI 0·66, 0·98). The multiple linear regression found that the only predictor of the PACC difference was the time between assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study provides evidence on the feasibility of performing cognitive tests online, with the PACC tests being successfully administered through videoconferencing. This is relevant, especially during times when face-to-face assessments cannot be performed.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a matricellular protein involved in the extracellular matrix and interactions between cells during neural development of the central nervous system (CNS). Oxidative glutamate toxicity is involved in CNS diseases, including epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and ischemic stroke. However, the molecular mechanism of nerve injury is not fully understood in CNS diseases. Herein, the glutamate-induced nerve damage model was used to explore the molecular mechanisms affecting nerve damage. The levels of SPARC and autophagy were increased in glutamate-induced HT22 hippocampal nerve injury. In summary, the current study confirmed that SPARC regulates autophagy in HT22 hippocampal nerve cells, and its knockdown reduces the glutamate-induced HT22 hippocampal nerve injury by inhibiting autophagy. These findings suggested that SPARC plays a crucial role in nerve injury of CNS diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;WISDoM (Wishart Distributed Matrices) is a framework for the quantification of deviation of symmetric positive-definite matrices associated with experimental samples, such as covariance or correlation matrices, from expected ones governed by the Wishart distribution. WISDoM can be applied to tasks of supervised learning, like classification, in particular when such matrices are generated by data of different dimensionality (e.g., time series with same number of variables but different time sampling). We show the application of the method in two different scenarios. The first is the ranking of features associated with electro encephalogram (EEG) data with a time series design, providing a theoretically sound approach for this type of studies. The second is the classification of autistic subjects of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange study using brain connectivity measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Implementation-Independent Representation for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Humans in Processing Faces</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) nowadays can match human performance in challenging complex tasks, but it remains unknown whether DCNNs achieve human-like performance through human-like processes. Here we applied a reverse-correlation method to make explicit representations of DCNNs and humans when performing face gender classification. We found that humans and a typical DCNN, VGG-Face, used similar critical information for this task, which mainly resided at low spatial frequencies. Importantly, the prior task experience, which the VGG-Face was pre-trained to process faces at the subordinate level (i.e., identification) as humans do, seemed necessary for such representational similarity, because AlexNet, a DCNN pre-trained to process objects at the basic level (i.e., categorization), succeeded in gender classification but relied on a completely different representation. In sum, although DCNNs and humans rely on different sets of hardware to process faces, they can use a similar and implementation-independent representation to achieve the same computation goal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Leukodystrophies HBSL and LBSL—Correlates and Distinctions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) accurately charge tRNAs with their respective amino acids. As such, they are vital for the initiation of cytosolic and mitochondrial protein translation. These enzymes have become increasingly scrutinized in recent years for their role in neurodegenerative disorders caused by the mutations of ARS-encoding genes. This review focuses on two such genes—DARS1 and DARS2—which encode cytosolic and mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetases, and the clinical conditions associated with mutations of these genes. We also describe attempts made at modeling these conditions in mice, which have both yielded important mechanistic insights. Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL) is a disease caused by a range of mutations in the DARS2 gene, initially identified in 2003. Ten years later, hypomyelination with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and leg spasticity (HBSL), caused by mutations of cytosolic DARS1, was discovered. Multiple parallels have been drawn between the two conditions. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) patterns are strikingly similar, but still set these two conditions apart from other leukodystrophies. Clinically, both conditions are characterized by lower limb spasticity, often associated with other pyramidal signs. However, perhaps due to earlier detection, a wider range of symptoms, including peripheral neuropathy, as well as visual and hearing changes have been described in LBSL patients. Both HBSL and LBSL are spectrum disorders lacking genotype to phenotype correlation. While the fatal phenotype of Dars1 or Dars2 single gene deletion mouse mutants revealed that the two enzymes lack functional redundancy, further pursuit of disease modeling are required to shed light onto the underlying disease mechanism, and enable examination of experimental treatments, including gene therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Identification of Heterogeneous Subtypes of Mild Cognitive Impairment Using Cluster Analyses Based on PET Imaging of Tau and Astrogliosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.615467</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.615467</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition with diverse causes and clinical outcomes that can be categorized into subtypes. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]THK5351 has been known to detect reactive astrogliosis as well as tau which is accompanied by neurodegenerative changes. Here, we identified heterogeneous groups of MCI patients using THK retention patterns and a graph theory approach, allowing for the comparison of risk of progression to dementia in these MCI subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Ninety-seven participants including 60 MCI patients and individuals with normal cognition (NC, n = 37) were included and undertook 3T MRI, [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]THK5351 PET, and detailed neuropsychological tests. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]Flutemetamol PET was also performed in 62 participants. We calculated similarities between MCI patients using their regional standardized uptake value ratio of THK retention in 75 ROIs, and clustered subjects with similar retention patterns using the Louvain method based on the modularity of the graph. The clusters of patients identified were compared with an age-matched control group using a general linear model. Dementia conversion was evaluated after a median follow-up duration of 34.6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: MCI patients were categorized into four groups according to their THK retention patterns: (1) limbic type; (2) diffuse type; (3) sparse type; and (4) AD type (retention pattern as in AD). Subjects of the limbic type were characterized by older age, small hippocampal volumes, and reduced verbal memory and frontal/executive functions. Patients of the diffuse type had relatively large vascular burden, reduced memory capacity and some frontal/executive functions. Co-morbidity and mortality were more frequent in this subgroup. Subjects of the sparse type were younger and declined only in terms of visual memory and attention. No individuals in this subgroup converted to dementia. Patients in the AD type group exhibited the poorest cognitive function. They also had the smallest hippocampal volumes and the highest risk of progression to dementia (90.9%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Using cluster analyses with [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]THK5351 retention patterns, it is possible to identify clinically-distinct subgroups of MCI patients and those at greater risk of progression to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Involvement of Aquaporin-4 in the Interstitial Fluid Drainage Impairment Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.611494</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mechanism of brain injury following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has not yet been clarified. The glymphatic system (GS), a glia-dependent waste clearance pathway, drains away soluble waste proteins and metabolic products, even some toxic factors from the brain. Aquaporin-4 (Aqp4) is highly expressed on the astrocyte foot processes and facilitates the interstitial fluid (ISF) transportation in the GS system. In this study, the role of Aqp4 in the GS injury after SAH was explored using Aqp4 gene knockout (Aqp4&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) Sprague Dawley rats. The results of MRI, fluorescent imaging, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that, after SAH, the inflow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the brain and the clearance of ISF from the brain were both significantly decreased. Meanwhile, the expression level of Aqp4 around the artery was markedly higher than that around the vein following SAH. Aqp4 knockout exacerbated the GS damage after SAH. In summary, after SAH, there was an apparent GS impairment, and Aqp4 played key roles in modulating the function of GS in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Deleting Mecp2 from the cerebellum rather than its neuronal subtypes causes a delay in motor learning in mice</title>

	<description>Rett syndrome is a devastating childhood neurological disorder caused by mutations in &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt;. Of the many symptoms, motor deterioration is a significant problem for patients. In mice, deleting &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; from the cortex or basal ganglia causes motor dysfunction, hypoactivity, and tremor, which are abnormalities observed in patients. Little is known about the function of &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; in the cerebellum, a brain region critical for motor function. Here we show that deleting &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; from the cerebellum, but not from its neuronal subtypes, causes a delay in motor learning that is overcome by additional training. We observed irregular firing rates of Purkinje cells and altered heterochromatin architecture within the cerebellum of knockout mice. These findings demonstrate that the motor deficits present in Rett syndrome arise, in part, from cerebellar dysfunction. For Rett syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders, our results highlight the importance of understanding which brain regions contribute to disease phenotypes.</description>

	<description>Leptospirosis is the leading zoonotic disease in terms of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Effective prevention is urgently needed as the drivers of disease transmission continue to intensify. The key challenge has been developing a widely applicable vaccine that protects against the &amp;gt;300 serovars that can cause leptospirosis. Live attenuated mutants are enticing vaccine candidates and poorly explored in the field. We evaluated a recently characterized motility-deficient mutant lacking the expression of a flagellar protein, FcpA. Although the &lt;i&gt;fcpA&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mutant has lost its ability to cause disease, transient bacteremia was observed. In two animal models, immunization with a single dose of the &lt;i&gt;fcpA&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mutant was sufficient to induce a robust anti-protein antibodies response that promoted protection against infection with different pathogenic Leptospira species. Furthermore, characterization of the immune response identified a small repertoire of biologically relevant proteins that are highly conserved among pathogenic Leptospira species and potential correlates of cross-protective immunity.</description>

	<title>eLife: Charge-driven condensation of RNA and proteins suggests broad role of phase separation in cytoplasmic environments</title>

	<description>Phase separation processes are increasingly being recognized as important organizing mechanisms of biological macromolecules in cellular environments. Well established drivers of phase separation are multi-valency and intrinsic disorder. Here, we show that globular macromolecules may condense simply based on electrostatic complementarity. More specifically, phase separation of mixtures between RNA and positively charged proteins is described from a combination of multiscale computer simulations with microscopy and spectroscopy experiments. Phase diagrams were mapped out as a function of molecular concentrations in experiment and as a function of molecular size and temperature via simulations. The resulting condensates were found to retain at least some degree of internal dynamics varying as a function of the molecular composition. The results suggest a more general principle for phase separation that is based primarily on electrostatic complementarity without invoking polymer properties as in most previous studies. Simulation results furthermore suggest that such phase separation may occur widely in heterogenous cellular environment between nucleic acid and protein components.</description>

	<title>eLife: Curcumin promotes AApoAII amyloidosis and peroxisome proliferation in mice by activating the PPARα signaling pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.63538</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63538</link>
	<description>Curcumin is a polyphenol compound that exhibits multiple physiological activities. To elucidate the mechanisms by which curcumin affects systemic amyloidosis, we investigated amyloid deposition and molecular changes in a mouse model of amyloid apolipoprotein A-II (AApoAII) amyloidosis, in which mice were fed a curcumin-supplemented diet. Curcumin supplementation for 12 weeks significantly increased AApoAII amyloid deposition relative to controls, especially in the liver and spleen. Liver weights and plasma ApoA-II and high-density lipoprotein concentrations were significantly elevated in curcumin-supplemented groups. RNA-sequence analysis revealed that curcumin intake affected hepatic lipid metabolism via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathway, especially PPARα activation, resulting in increased &lt;i&gt;Apoa2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression. The increase in liver weights was due to activation of PPARα and peroxisome proliferation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that curcumin is a PPARα activator and may affect expression levels of proteins involved in amyloid deposition to influence amyloidosis and metabolism in a complex manner.</description>

	<title>eLife: A dietary sterol trade-off determines lifespan responses to dietary restriction in Drosophila melanogaster females</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62335</link>
	<description>Diet plays a significant role in maintaining lifelong health. In particular, lowering the dietary protein: carbohydrate ratio can improve lifespan. This has been interpreted as a direct effect of these macronutrients on physiology. Using &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, we show that the role of protein and carbohydrate on lifespan is indirect, acting by altering the partitioning of limiting amounts of dietary sterols between reproduction and lifespan. Shorter lifespans in flies fed on high protein: carbohydrate diets can be rescued by supplementing their food with cholesterol. Not only does this fundamentally alter the way we interpret the mechanisms of lifespan extension by dietary restriction, these data highlight the important principle that life histories can be affected by nutrient-dependent trade-offs that are indirect and independent of the nutrients (often macronutrients) that are the focus of study. This brings us closer to understanding the mechanistic basis of dietary restriction.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61644</link>
	<description>Humans have relied on sourdough starter microbial communities to make leavened bread for thousands of years, but only a small fraction of global sourdough biodiversity has been characterized. Working with a community-scientist network of bread bakers, we determined the microbial diversity of 500 sourdough starters from four continents. In sharp contrast with widespread assumptions, we found little evidence for biogeographic patterns in starter communities. Strong co-occurrence patterns observed in situ and recreated in vitro demonstrate that microbial interactions shape sourdough community structure. Variation in dough rise rates and aromas were largely explained by acetic acid bacteria, a mostly overlooked group of sourdough microbes. Our study reveals the extent of microbial diversity in an ancient fermented food across diverse cultural and geographic backgrounds.</description>

	<description>Dendrites shape information flow in neurons. Yet, there is little consensus on the level of spatial complexity at which they operate. Through carefully chosen parameter fits, solvable in the least-squares sense, we obtain accurate reduced compartmental models at any level of complexity. We show that (back-propagating) action potentials, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes, and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-D-aspartate spikes can all be reproduced with few compartments. We also investigate whether afferent spatial connectivity motifs admit simplification by ablating targeted branches and grouping affected synapses onto the next proximal dendrite. We find that voltage in the remaining branches is reproduced if temporal conductance fluctuations stay below a limit that depends on the average difference in input resistance between the ablated branches and the next proximal dendrite. Furthermore, our methodology fits reduced models directly from experimental data, without requiring morphological reconstructions. We provide software that automatizes the simplification, eliminating a common hurdle toward including dendritic computations in network models.</description>

	<title>eLife: Thermal acclimation of tropical coral reef fishes to global heat waves</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59162</link>
	<description>As climate-driven heat waves become more frequent and intense, there is increasing urgency to understand how thermally sensitive species are responding. Acute heating events lasting days to months may elicit acclimation responses to improve performance and survival. However, the coordination of acclimation responses remains largely unknown for most stenothermal species. We documented the chronology of 18 metabolic and cardiorespiratory changes that occur in the gills, blood, spleen, and muscles when tropical coral reef fishes are thermally stressed (+3.0°C above ambient). Using representative coral reef fishes (&lt;i&gt;Caesio cuning&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus&lt;/i&gt;) separated by &amp;gt;100 million years of evolution and with stark differences in major life-history characteristics (i.e. lifespan, habitat use, mobility, etc.), we show that exposure duration illicited coordinated responses in 13 tissue and organ systems over 5 weeks. The onset and duration of biomarker responses differed between species, with &lt;i&gt;C. cuning&lt;/i&gt; – an active, mobile species – initiating acclimation responses to unavoidable thermal stress within the first week of heat exposure; conversely, &lt;i&gt;C. quinquelineatus&lt;/i&gt; – a sessile, territorial species – exhibited comparatively reduced acclimation responses that were delayed through time. Seven biomarkers, including red muscle citrate synthase and lactate dehydrogenase activities, blood glucose and hemoglobin concentrations, spleen somatic index, and gill lamellar perimeter and width, proved critical in evaluating acclimation progression and completion, as these provided consistent evaluation of thermal responses across species.</description>

	<description>Reconstructing intended speech from neural activity using brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) holds great promises for people with severe speech production deficits. While decoding overt speech has progressed, decoding imagined speech have met limited success, mainly because the associated neural signals are weak and variable hence difficult to decode by learning algorithms. Using three electrocorticography datasets totalizing 1444 electrodes from 13 patients who performed overt and imagined speech production tasks, and based on recent theories of speech neural processing, we extracted consistent and specific neural features usable for future BCIs, and assessed their performance to discriminate speech items in articulatory, phonetic, vocalic, and semantic representation spaces. While high-frequency activity provided the best signal for overt speech, both low- and higher-frequency power and local cross-frequency contributed to successful imagined speech decoding, in particular in phonetic and vocalic, i.e. perceptual, spaces. These findings demonstrate that low-frequency power and cross-frequency dynamics contain key information for imagined speech decoding, and that exploring perceptual spaces offers a promising avenue for future imagined speech BCIs.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: High-order areas and auditory cortex both represent the high-level event structure of music</title>

	<description>Recent fMRI studies of event segmentation have found that default mode regions represent high-level event structure during movie watching. In these regions, neural patterns are relatively stable during events and shift at event boundaries. Music, like narratives, contains hierarchical event structure (e.g., sections are composed of phrases). Here, we tested the hypothesis that brain activity patterns in default mode regions reflect the high-level event structure of music. We used fMRI to record brain activity from 25 participants (male and female) as they listened to a continuous playlist of 16 musical excerpts, and additionally collected annotations for these excerpts by asking a separate group of participants to mark when meaningful changes occurred in each one. We then identified temporal boundaries between stable patterns of brain activity using a hidden Markov model and compared the location of the model boundaries to the location of the human annotations. We identified multiple brain regions with significant matches to the observer-identified boundaries, including auditory cortex, mPFC, parietal cortex, and angular gyrus. From these results, we conclude that both higher-order and sensory areas contain information relating to the high-level event structure of music. Moreover, the higher-order areas in this study overlap with areas found in previous studies of event perception in movies and audio narratives, including regions in the default mode network.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Comparison of mouse models reveals the molecular bases for psychotic illness in Prader-Willi syndrome</title>

	<description>Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations affecting paternal chromosome 15q11-q13, characterized by hypotonia, hyperphagia, impaired cognition and behavioural problems. Psychotic illness is a challenging problem for individuals with PWS, and has different rates of prevalence in distinct PWS genotypes. Previously, we demonstrated behavioural and cognitive endophenotypes of relevance to psychiatric illness in a mouse model for one of the associated PWS genotypes, namely PWS-IC, in which deletion of the imprinting centre leads to loss of paternal imprinted gene expression and over-expression of Ube3a. Here we examine the broader gene expression changes that are specific to the psychiatric endophenotypes seen in this model. To do this we compared the brain transcriptomic profile of the PWS-IC mouse to the PWS-cr model that carries a deletion of the PWS minimal critical interval spanning the snoRNA Snord116 and Ipw. Firstly, we examined the same behavioural and cognitive endophenotypes of relevance to psychiatric illness in the PWS-cr mice. PWS-cr exhibit no differences in locomotor activity, sensory-motor gating and attention of relevance to psychotic illness, and previously seen in the PWS-IC mice. RNA-seq analysis of neonatal brain revealed a greater number of transcriptional changes between PWS-IC and wild-type littermates, than between PWS-cr and wild-type littermates. Moreover, the differentially expressed genes in PWS-IC brain were enriched for GWAS variants associated with episodes of psychotic illness but, interestingly, not schizophrenia. These data illustrate the molecular pathways that may underpin psychotic illness in PWS and have implication for potential therapeutic interventions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Modulation of the spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity in the triple resting-state networks following the visual oddball paradigm</title>

	<description>The default mode network (DMN), the salience network (SN), and the central executive network (CEN) could be considered as the core resting-state brain networks (RSN) due to their involvement in a wide range of cognitive tasks. Despite the large body of knowledge relating to their regional spontaneous activity (RSA) and functional connectivity (FC) of these networks, less is known about the influence of task-associated activity on these parameters and on the interaction between these three networks. We have investigated the effects of the visual-oddball paradigm on three fMRI measures (amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations for RSA, regional homogeneity for local FC, and degree centrality for global FC) in these three core RSN networks. A rest-task-rest paradigm was used and the RSNs were identified using independent component analysis (ICA) on the resting-state data. We found that the task-related brain activity induced different patterns of significant changes within the three RS networks. Most changes were strongly associated with the task performance. Furthermore, the task-activity significantly increased the inter-network correlations between the SN and CEN as well as between the DMN and CEN, but not between the DMN and SN. A significant dynamical change in RSA, alongside local and global FC within the three core resting-state networks following a simple cognitive activity may be an expression of the distinct involvement of these networks in the performance of the task and their various outcomes.</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Protein expression alteration in hippocampus upon genetic repression of AMPKα isoforms</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a molecular sensor to help maintain cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex and its enzymatic catalytic subunit includes two isoforms: α1 and α2. Dysregulation of AMPK signaling is linked to neuronal diseases characterized with cognitive impairments. Emerging evidence also suggest isoform‐specific roles of AMPK in the brain. AMPK regulates protein synthesis, which is critical for memory formation and neuronal plasticity. However, the consequence of altering AMPK activity on the translation of specific proteins in the brain is unknown. Here, we use unbiased mass spectrometry‐based proteomics approach to analyze protein profile alterations in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of transgenic mice in which the genes for the two AMPKα isoforms are conditionally deleted. The study revealed identities of proteins whose expression is sensitive to suppression of AMPKα1 and/or α2 isoform. These data may serve as a basis for future in‐depth study. Elucidation of the functional relevance of the alteration of specific proteins could provide insights into identification of novel therapeutic targets for neuronal disorders characterized with AMPK signaling dysregulation and impaired cellular energy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Mitochondria are vital organelles inside the cell and contribute to intracellular calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) dynamics directly and indirectly via calcium exchange, ATP generation, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Arrhythmogenic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; alternans in cardiac myocytes has been observed in experiments under abnormal mitochondrial depolarization. However, complex signaling pathways and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cycling between mitochondria and cytosol make it difficult in experiments to reveal the underlying mechanisms of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; alternans under abnormal mitochondrial depolarization. In this study, we use a newly developed spatiotemporal ventricular myocyte computer model that integrates mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cycling and complex signaling pathways to investigate the mechanisms of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; alternans during mitochondrial depolarization. We find that elevation of ROS in response to mitochondrial depolarization plays a critical role in promoting Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; alternans. Further examination reveals that the redox effect of ROS on ryanodine receptors and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase synergistically promote alternans. Upregulation of mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uniporter promotes Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; alternans via Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. Due to their relatively slow kinetics, oxidized Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activation and ATP do not play significant roles acutely in the genesis of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; alternans after mitochondrial depolarization, but their roles can be significant in the long term, mainly through their effects on sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase activity. In conclusion, mitochondrial depolarization promotes Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; alternans acutely via the redox effect of ROS and chronically by ATP reduction. It suppresses Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; alternans chronically through oxidized Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_0Mtlp4mxNI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Motivation &lt;p&gt;A comprehensive characterization of the humoral response towards a specific antigen requires quantification of the B-cell receptor repertoire (BCR-Seq) by next generation sequencing, as well as the analysis of serum antibodies against this antigen, using proteomics. The proteomic analysis is challenging since it necessitates the mapping of antigen-specific peptides to individual B-cell clones.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The PASA web server provides a robust computational platform for the analysis and integration of data obtained from proteomics of serum antibodies. PASA maps peptides derived from antibodies raised against a specific antigen to corresponding antibody sequences. It then analyzes and integrates proteomics and BCR-Seq data, thus providing a comprehensive characterization of the humoral response. The PASA web server is freely available at https://pasa.tau.ac.il and open to all users without a login requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8lxTQ15ibhE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Active probing to highlight approaching transitions to ictal states in coupled neural mass models</title>

The extraction of electrophysiological features that reliably forecast the occurrence of seizures is one of the most challenging goals in epilepsy research. Among possible approaches to tackle this problem is the use of active probing paradigms in which responses to stimuli are used to detect underlying system changes leading up to seizures. This work evaluates the theoretical and mechanistic underpinnings of this strategy using two coupled populations of the well-studied Wendling neural mass model. Different model settings are evaluated, shifting parameters (excitability, slow inhibition, or inter-population coupling gains) from normal towards ictal states while probing stimuli are applied every 2 seconds to the input of either one or both populations. The correlation between the extracted features and the ictogenic parameter shifting indicates if the impending transition to the ictal state may be identified in advance. Results show that not only can the response to the probing stimuli forecast seizures but this is true regardless of the altered ictogenic parameter. That is, similar feature changes are highlighted by probing stimuli responses in advance of the seizure including: increased response variance and lag-1 autocorrelation, decreased skewness, and increased mutual information between the outputs of both model subsets. These changes were mostly restricted to the stimulated population, showing a local effect of this perturbational approach. The transition latencies from normal activity to sustained discharges of spikes were not affected, suggesting that stimuli had no pro-ictal effects. However, stimuli were found to elicit interictal-like spikes just before the transition to the ictal state. Furthermore, the observed feature changes highlighted by probing the neuronal populations may reflect the phenomenon of critical slowing down, where increased recovery times from perturbations may signal the loss of a systems’ resilience and are common hallmarks of an impending critical transition. These results provide more evidence that active probing approaches highlight information about underlying system changes involved in ictogenesis and may be able to play a role in assisting seizure forecasting methods which can be incorporated into early-warning systems that ultimately enable closing the loop for targeted seizure-controlling interventions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3UYEz0x6e1I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cancer treatments can be highly toxic and frequently only a subset of the patient population will benefit from a given treatment. Tumour genetic makeup plays an important role in cancer drug sensitivity. We suspect that gene expression markers could be used as a decision aid for treatment selection or dosage tuning. Using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cancer cell line dose-response and gene expression data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) project, we build a dose-varying regression model. Unlike existing approaches, this allows us to estimate dosage-dependent associations with gene expression. We include the transcriptomic profiles as dose-invariant covariates into the regression model and assume that their effect varies smoothly over the dosage levels. A two-stage variable selection algorithm (variable screening followed by penalized regression) is used to identify genetic factors that are associated with drug response over the varying dosages. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method using simulation studies focusing on the choice of tuning parameters and cross-validation for predictive accuracy assessment. We further apply the model to data from five &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt; targeted compounds applied to different cancer cell lines under different dosage levels. We highlight the dosage-dependent dynamics of the associations between the selected genes and drug response, and we perform pathway enrichment analysis to show that the selected genes play an important role in pathways related to tumorigenesis and DNA damage response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cE4mAPnWZ4U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Metabolic engineering in the post-genomic era is characterised by the development of new methods for metabolomics and fluxomics, supported by the integration of genetic engineering tools and mathematical modelling. Particularly, constraint-based stoichiometric models have been widely studied: (i) flux balance analysis (FBA) (&lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;), and (ii) metabolic flux analysis (MFA) (&lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;). Recent studies have enabled the incorporation of thermodynamics and metabolomics data to improve the predictive capabilities of these approaches. However, an in-depth comparison and evaluation of these methods is lacking. This study presents a thorough analysis of two different &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; methods tested against experimental data (metabolomics and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-MFA) for the mesophile &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. In particular, a modified version of the recently published matTFA toolbox was created, providing a broader range of physicochemical parameters. Validating against experimental data allowed the determination of the best physicochemical parameters to perform the TFA (Thermodynamics-based Flux Analysis). An analysis of flux pattern changes in the central carbon metabolism between &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-MFA and TFA highlighted the limited capabilities of both approaches for elucidating the anaplerotic fluxes. In addition, a method based on centrality measures was suggested to identify important metabolites that (if quantified) would allow to further constrain the TFA. Finally, this study emphasised the need for standardisation in the fluxomics community: novel approaches are frequently released but a thorough comparison with currently accepted methods is not always performed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LBucAJYS5o0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Robust point-process Granger causality analysis in presence of exogenous temporal modulations and trial-by-trial variability in spike trains</title>

Assessing directional influences between neurons is instrumental to understand how brain circuits process information. To this end, Granger causality, a technique originally developed for time-continuous signals, has been extended to discrete spike trains. A fundamental assumption of this technique is that the temporal evolution of neuronal responses must be due only to endogenous interactions between recorded units, including self-interactions. This assumption is however rarely met in neurophysiological studies, where the response of each neuron is modulated by other exogenous causes such as, for example, other unobserved units or slow adaptation processes. Here, we propose a novel point-process Granger causality technique that is robust with respect to the two most common exogenous modulations observed in real neuronal responses: within-trial temporal variations in spiking rate and between-trial variability in their magnitudes. This novel method works by explicitly including both types of modulations into the generalized linear model of the neuronal conditional intensity function (CIF). We then assess the causal influence of neuron &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; onto neuron &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt; by measuring the relative reduction of neuron &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;’s point process likelihood obtained considering or removing neuron &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;. CIF’s hyper-parameters are set on a per-neuron basis by minimizing Akaike’s information criterion. In synthetic data sets, generated by means of random processes or networks of integrate-and-fire units, the proposed method recovered with high accuracy, sensitivity and robustness the underlying ground-truth connectivity pattern. Application of presently available point-process Granger causality techniques produced instead a significant number of false positive connections. In real spiking responses recorded from neurons in the monkey pre-motor cortex (area F5), our method revealed many causal relationships between neurons as well as the temporal structure of their interactions. Given its robustness our method can be effectively applied to real neuronal data. Furthermore, its explicit estimate of the effects of unobserved causes on the recorded neuronal firing patterns can help decomposing their temporal variations into endogenous and exogenous components.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6btRMGNrBGM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The selection pressures that have shaped the evolution of complex traits in humans remain largely unknown, and in some contexts highly contentious, perhaps above all where they concern mean trait differences among groups. To date, the discussion has focused on whether such group differences have any genetic basis, and if so, whether they are without fitness consequences and arose via random genetic drift, or whether they were driven by selection for different trait optima in different environments. Here, we highlight a plausible alternative that many complex traits evolve under stabilizing selection in the face of shifting environmental effects. Under this scenario, there will be rapid evolution at the loci that contribute to trait variation, even when the trait optimum remains the same. These considerations underscore the strong assumptions about environmental effects that are required in ascribing trait differences among groups to genetic differences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rzF9EYLWEHA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PINK1&lt;/em&gt; mutations are the second most common cause of recessive, early-onset Parkinson’s disease (EOPD), of which 15% are cases of juvenile PD. PD is a progressive neurological disease that primarily affects middle-aged and older people. Thus PD patients experiencing pregnancy is uncommon, especially in patients with juvenile PD caused by &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PINK1&lt;/em&gt; mutations. We are first to report a woman from a Chinese family diagnosed with sporadic juvenile PD and treated with levodopa/benserazide throughout pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Whole exome sequencing was performed on this patient, and pedigree verification was performed on her parents. This patient received levodopa/benserazide treatment with regular outpatient follow-up exams.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing identified a heterozygous nonsense mutation (c.1474C &amp;gt; T, p.R492X) and a splicing mutation (c.1488 + 1G &amp;gt; A) that were in exon 7 of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PINK1&lt;/em&gt; gene, co-segregating with the PD phenotype and exhibiting an autosomal recessive pattern. With regular outpatient follow-up exams, this patient delivered a healthy boy without complications. Her PD symptoms were stable with the levodopa/benserazide treatment throughout her pregnancy except in the postpartum period.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Our findings further demonstrated the safety of levodopa with dopa-decarboxylase treatment in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PINK1&lt;/em&gt;-associated juvenile PD during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Defined Tau Phosphospecies Differentially Inhibit Fast Axonal Transport Through Activation of Two Independent Signaling Pathways</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.610037</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tau protein is subject to phosphorylation by multiple kinases at more than 80 different sites. Some of these sites are associated with tau pathology and neurodegeneration, but other sites are modified in normal tau as well as in pathological tau. Although phosphorylation of tau at residues in the microtubule-binding repeats is thought to reduce tau association with microtubules, the functional consequences of other sites are poorly understood. The AT8 antibody recognizes a complex phosphoepitope site on tau that is detectable in a healthy brain but significantly increased in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Previous studies showed that phosphorylation of tau at the AT8 site leads to exposure of an N-terminal sequence that promotes activation of a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)/glycogen synthase 3 (GSK3) signaling pathway, which inhibits kinesin-1-based anterograde fast axonal transport (FAT). This finding suggests that phosphorylation may control tau conformation and function. However, the AT8 includes three distinct phosphorylated amino acids that may be differentially phosphorylated in normal and disease conditions. To evaluate the effects of specific phosphorylation sites in the AT8 epitope, recombinant, pseudophosphorylated tau proteins were perfused into the isolated squid axoplasm preparation to determine their effects on axonal signaling pathways and FAT. Results from these studies suggest a mechanism where specific phosphorylation events differentially impact tau conformation, promoting activation of independent signaling pathways that differentially affect FAT. Implications of findings here to our understanding of tau function in health and disease conditions are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Insights Into the Role and Potential of Schwann Cells for Peripheral Nerve Repair From Studies of Development and Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.608442</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve injuries arising from trauma or disease can lead to sensory and motor deficits and neuropathic pain. Despite the purported ability of the peripheral nerve to self-repair, lifelong disability is common. New molecular and cellular insights have begun to reveal why the peripheral nerve has limited repair capacity. The peripheral nerve is primarily comprised of axons and Schwann cells, the supporting glial cells that produce myelin to facilitate the rapid conduction of electrical impulses. Schwann cells are required for successful nerve regeneration; they partially “de-differentiate” in response to injury, re-initiating the expression of developmental genes that support nerve repair. However, Schwann cell dysfunction, which occurs in chronic nerve injury, disease, and aging, limits their capacity to support endogenous repair, worsening patient outcomes. Cell replacement-based therapeutic approaches using exogenous Schwann cells could be curative, but not all Schwann cells have a “repair” phenotype, defined as the ability to promote axonal growth, maintain a proliferative phenotype, and remyelinate axons. Two cell replacement strategies are being championed for peripheral nerve repair: prospective isolation of “repair” Schwann cells for autologous cell transplants, which is hampered by supply challenges, and directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells or lineage conversion of accessible somatic cells to induced Schwann cells, with the potential of “unlimited” supply. All approaches require a solid understanding of the molecular mechanisms guiding Schwann cell development and the repair phenotype, which we review herein. Together these studies provide essential context for current efforts to design glial cell-based therapies for peripheral nerve regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Electrical Source Imaging in Freely Moving Rats: Evaluation of a 12-Electrode Cortical Electroencephalography System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.589228</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.589228</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This work presents and evaluates a 12-electrode intracranial electroencephalography system developed at the National Institute of Mental Health (Klecany, Czech Republic) in terms of an electrical source imaging (ESI) technique in rats. The electrode system was originally designed for translational research purposes. This study demonstrates that it is also possible to use this well-established system for ESI, and estimates its precision, accuracy, and limitations. Furthermore, this paper sets a methodological basis for future implants. Source localization quality is evaluated using three approaches based on surrogate data, physical phantom measurements, and in vivo experiments. The forward model for source localization is obtained from the FieldTrip-SimBio pipeline using the finite-element method. Rat brain tissue extracted from a magnetic resonance imaging template is approximated by a single-compartment homogeneous tetrahedral head model. Four inverse solvers were tested: standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA), linear constrained minimum variance (LCMV), and dynamic imaging of coherent sources. Based on surrogate data, this paper evaluates the accuracy and precision of all solvers within the brain volume using error distance and reliability maps. The mean error distance over the whole brain was found to be the lowest in the eLORETA solution through signal to noise ratios (SNRs) (0.2 mm for 25 dB SNR). The LCMV outperformed eLORETA under higher SNR conditions, and exhibiting higher spatial precision. Both of these inverse solvers provided accurate results in a phantom experiment (1.6 mm mean error distance across shallow and 2.6 mm across subcortical testing dipoles). Utilizing the developed technique in freely moving rats, an auditory steady-state response experiment provided results in line with previously reported findings. The obtained results support the idea of utilizing a 12-electrode system for ESI and using it as a solid basis for the development of future ESI dedicated implants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Analysis of Human Gait Using Hybrid EEG-fNIRS-Based BCI System: A Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.613254</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.613254</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human gait is a complex activity that requires high coordination between the central nervous system, the limb, and the musculoskeletal system. More research is needed to understand the latter coordination's complexity in designing better and more effective rehabilitation strategies for gait disorders. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) are among the most used technologies for monitoring brain activities due to portability, non-invasiveness, and relatively low cost compared to others. Fusing EEG and fNIRS is a well-known and established methodology proven to enhance brain–computer interface (BCI) performance in terms of classification accuracy, number of control commands, and response time. Although there has been significant research exploring hybrid BCI (hBCI) involving both EEG and fNIRS for different types of tasks and human activities, human gait remains still underinvestigated. In this article, we aim to shed light on the recent development in the analysis of human gait using a hybrid EEG-fNIRS-based BCI system. The current review has followed guidelines of preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-Analyses (PRISMA) during the data collection and selection phase. In this review, we put a particular focus on the commonly used signal processing and machine learning algorithms, as well as survey the potential applications of gait analysis. We distill some of the critical findings of this survey as follows. First, hardware specifications and experimental paradigms should be carefully considered because of their direct impact on the quality of gait assessment. Second, since both modalities, EEG and fNIRS, are sensitive to motion artifacts, instrumental, and physiological noises, there is a quest for more robust and sophisticated signal processing algorithms. Third, hybrid temporal and spatial features, obtained by virtue of fusing EEG and fNIRS and associated with cortical activation, can help better identify the correlation between brain activation and gait. In conclusion, hBCI (EEG + fNIRS) system is not yet much explored for the lower limb due to its complexity compared to the higher limb. Existing BCI systems for gait monitoring tend to only focus on one modality. We foresee a vast potential in adopting hBCI in gait analysis. Imminent technical breakthroughs are expected using hybrid EEG-fNIRS-based BCI for gait to control assistive devices and Monitor neuro-plasticity in neuro-rehabilitation. However, although those hybrid systems perform well in a controlled experimental environment when it comes to adopting them as a certified medical device in real-life clinical applications, there is still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Case Report: Deep Brain Stimulation to the Ventral Internal Capsule/Ventral Striatum Induces Repeated Transient Episodes of Voltage-Dependent Tourette-Like Behaviors</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an invasive device-based neuromodulation technique that allows the therapeutic direct stimulation of subcortical and deep cortical structures following the surgical placement of stimulating electrodes. DBS is approved by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration for the treatment of movement disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder, while new indications, including Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), are in experimental development. We report the case of a patient with MDD who received DBS to the ventral internal capsule and ventral striatum bilaterally and presented with 2 weeks of voltage-dependent Tourette-like symptoms including brief transient episodes of abrupt-onset and progressively louder coprolalia and stuttered speech; tic-like motor behavior in his right arm and leg; rushes of anxiety, angry prosody, angry affect; and moderate amnesia without confusion. We describe the results of the inpatient neuropsychiatric workup leading to the diagnosis of iatrogenic voltage-dependent activation of cortico-subcortical circuits and discuss insights into the pathophysiology of Tourette as well as safety considerations raised by the case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Event-Related Alpha-Band Power Changes During Self-reflection and Working Memory Tasks in Healthy Individuals</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dysfunctional attentional control is observed in patients with mental disorders. However, there is no established neurophysiological method to assess attention in such patients. We showed a discrepancy in alpha-band power in the tasks that evoked internal and external attention event-related alpha-band power changes in healthy subjects during self-reflection (SR) and working memory (WM) tasks in a preliminary study. In this study, we aimed at elucidating event-related alpha-band power changes in healthy subjects during the tasks, addressing the shortcomings of the previous study. Sixteen healthy volunteers were examined for the event-related power (ERpow) change during the tasks. The results demonstrated the discrepancy of alpha-band ERpow at 8, 10, and 12 Hz in the parieto-occipital area between the WM and SR tasks for a period between a target stimulus and a command stimulus, where a participant switched to internal attention from external attention according to the SR task and remained at external attention according to the WM task. The results suggest that alpha-band ERpow in this area is associated with the direction of attention in response to cognitive stimuli, indicating that the findings of ERpow during the two tasks would potentially aid in the clarification of the pathophysiology of the dysfunctional change in attention in patients with psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Influence of Background Musical Emotions on Attention in Congenital Amusia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.566841</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.566841</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Congenital amusia in its most common form is a disorder characterized by a musical pitch processing deficit. Although pitch is involved in conveying emotion in music, the implications for pitch deficits on musical emotion judgements is still under debate. Relatedly, both limited and spared musical emotion recognition was reported in amusia in conditions where emotion cues were not determined by musical mode or dissonance. Additionally, assumed links between musical abilities and visuo-spatial attention processes need further investigation in congenital amusics. Hence, we here test to what extent musical emotions can influence attentional performance. Fifteen congenital amusic adults and fifteen healthy controls matched for age and education were assessed in three attentional conditions: executive control (distractor inhibition), alerting, and orienting (spatial shift) while music expressing either joy, tenderness, sadness, or tension was presented. Visual target detection was in the normal range for both accuracy and response times in the amusic relative to the control participants. Moreover, in both groups, music exposure produced facilitating effects on selective attention that appeared to be driven by the arousal dimension of musical emotional content, with faster correct target detection during joyful compared to sad music. These findings corroborate the idea that pitch processing deficits related to congenital amusia do not impede other cognitive domains, particularly visual attention. Furthermore, our study uncovers an intact influence of music and its emotional content on the attentional abilities of amusic individuals. The results highlight the domain-selectivity of the pitch disorder in congenital amusia, which largely spares the development of visual attention and affective systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Orientation selectivity, as an emergent property of neurons in the visual cortex, is of critical importance in the processing of visual information. Characterizing the orientation selectivity based on neuronal firing activities or local field potentials (LFPs) is a hot topic of current research. In this paper, we used cross-frequency coupling and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to predict the grating orientations in V1 and V4 of two rhesus monkeys. The experimental data were recorded by utilizing two chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays, which were placed, respectively, in V1 and V4 of two rhesus monkeys performing a selective visual attention task. The phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) and amplitude–amplitude coupling (AAC) were employed to characterize the cross-frequency coupling of LFPs under sinusoidal grating stimuli with different orientations. Then, a LASSO logistic regression model was constructed to predict the grating orientation based on the strength of PAC and AAC. Moreover, the cross-validation method was used to evaluate the performance of the model. It was found that the average accuracy of the prediction based on the combination of PAC and AAC was 73.9%, which was higher than the predicting accuracy with PAC or AAC separately. In conclusion, a LASSO logistic regression model was introduced in this study, which can predict the grating orientations with relatively high accuracy by using PAC and AAC together. Our results suggest that the principle behind the LASSO model is probably an alternative direction to explore the mechanism for generating orientation selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Motor Progression in Early-Stage Parkinson's Disease: A Clinical Prediction Model and the Role of Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.627199</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The substantial heterogeneity of clinical symptoms and lack of reliable progression markers in Parkinson's disease (PD) present a major challenge in predicting accurate progression and prognoses. Increasing evidence indicates that each component of the neurovascular unit (NVU) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption may take part in many neurodegenerative diseases. Since some portions of CSF are eliminated along the neurovascular unit and across the BBB, disturbing the pathways may result in changes of these substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Four hundred seventy-four participants from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study (NCT01141023) were included in the study. Thirty-six initial features, including general information, brief clinical characteristics and the current year's classical scale scores, were used to build five regression models to predict PD motor progression represented by the coming year's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III score after redundancy removal and recursive feature elimination (RFE)-based feature selection. Then, a threshold range was added to the predicted value for more convenient model application. Finally, we evaluated the CSF and blood biomarkers' influence on the disease progression model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Eight hundred forty-nine cases were included in the study. The adjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; values of three different categories of regression model, linear, Bayesian and ensemble, all reached 0.75. Models of the same category shared similar feature combinations. The common features selected among the categories were the MDS-UPDRS Part III score, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) and Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder Questionnaire (RBDSQ) score. It can be seen more intuitively that the model can achieve certain prediction effect through threshold range. Biomarkers had no significant impact on the progression model within the data in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: By using machine learning and routinely gathered assessments from the current year, we developed multiple dynamic models to predict the following year's motor progression in the early stage of PD. These methods will allow clinicians to tailor medical management to the individual and identify at-risk patients for future clinical trials examining disease-modifying therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Protective Effect of the α7 Nicotinic Receptor Agonist PNU-282987 on Dopaminergic Neurons Against 6-Hydroxydopamine, Regulating Anti-neuroinflammatory and the Immune Balance Pathways in Rat</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation and inner immune dysfunction are increasingly accepted as important components of the etiopathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). According to emerging evidence, a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR), a ligand-gated ion channel, plays an important role in inflammatory reactions and is also expressed on the surface of T cells. In particular, regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical for the maintenance of immunological tolerance. In the present study, we investigated the roles of α7nAChR in inhibiting inflammation and maintaining the immune balance in rats with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced lesions and the possible mechanisms regulating the proportion of Tregs in vivo. Adult male Wistar rats (n = 90) were subjected to a unilateral injection of 6-OHDA into the left medial forebrain bundle, and PNU-282987, an α7nAChR agonist, was intraperitoneally injected 2 h prior to the induction of lesions by 6-OHDA and again at days 1, 7, and 13 postlesion. Behavioral tests and immunohistochemical staining to detect the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the bilateral substantial nigra (SN) were performed. Subsequently, CD4+ T lymphocytes and the expression of forkhead/winged helix transcription factor p3 (Foxp3, which is a marker of Treg cells) in the SN were also assessed using immunofluorescence staining. The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the SN was determined by performing immunohistochemical staining. Additionally, the protein levels of α7nAChR, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) phosphorylated-Erk (p-Erk) and Foxp3 in the ventral midbrain were determined using Western blotting, and the relative expression of the TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10 mRNAs were detected using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We found that PNU-282987 significantly improved the motor deficits induced by 6-OHDA, reduced the loss of TH in the SN, suppressed the overactivation of GFAP+ cells and expression of related inflammatory cytokines, and increased the number of Foxp3+ cells. In addition, we also showed that PNU-282987 significantly increased the protein expression of the a7nAchR, p-Erk, and Foxp3 in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats (p &amp;lt; 0.05). These results indicated that α7nAChR activation could exert an anti-inflammatory effect and participate in the process of modulating the immune balance during 6-OHDA-induced injury, potentially through the α7nAChR/p-Erk/Foxp3 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Dynamics and Concordance Abnormalities Among Indices of Intrinsic Brain Activity in Individuals With Subjective Cognitive Decline: A Temporal Dynamics Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.584863</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) are more likely to develop into Alzheimer disease (AD) in the future. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies have shown alterations of intrinsic brain activity (IBA) in SCD individuals. However, rs-fMRI studies to date have mainly focused on static characteristics of IBA, with few studies reporting dynamics- and concordance-related changes in IBA indices in SCD individuals. To investigate these aberrant changes, a temporal dynamic analysis of rs-fMRI data was conducted on 94 SCD individuals (71.07 ± 6.18 years, 60 female), 75 (74.36 ± 8.42 years, 35 female) mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 82 age-, gender-, and education-matched controls (NCs; 73.88 ± 7.40 years, 49 female) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The dynamics and concordance of the rs-fMRI indices were calculated. The results showed that SCD individuals had a lower amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations dynamics in bilateral hippocampus (HP)/parahippocampal gyrus (PHG)/fusiform gyrus (FG) and bilateral cerebellum, a lower fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation dynamics in bilateral precuneus (PreCu) and paracentral lobule, and a lower regional homogeneity dynamics in bilateral cerebellum, vermis, and left FG compared with the other two groups, whereas those in MCI patients were higher (Gaussian random field–corrected, voxel-level P &amp;lt; 0.001, cluster-level P &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, SCD individuals had higher concordance in bilateral HP/PHG/FG, temporal lobe, and left midcingulate cortex than NCs, but those in MCI were lower than those in NCs. No correlation between concordance values and neuropsychological scale scores was found. SCD individuals showed both dynamics and concordance-related alterations in IBA, which indicates a compensatory mechanism in SCD individuals. Temporal dynamics analysis offers a novel approach to capturing brain alterations in individuals with SCD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: A novel motif of Rad51 serves as an interaction hub for recombination auxiliary factors</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.64131</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64131</link>
	<description>Homologous recombination (HR) is essential for maintaining genome stability. Although Rad51 is the key protein that drives HR, multiple auxiliary factors interact with Rad51 to potentiate its activity. Here, we present an interdisciplinary characterization of the interactions between Rad51 and these factors. Through structural analysis, we identified an evolutionarily conserved acidic patch of Rad51. The neutralization of this patch completely abolished recombinational DNA repair due to defects in the recruitment of Rad51 to DNA damage sites. This acidic patch was found to be important for the interaction with Rad55-Rad57 and essential for the interaction with Rad52. Furthermore, biochemical reconstitutions demonstrated that neutralization of this acidic patch also impaired the interaction with Rad54, indicating that a single motif is important for the interaction with multiple auxiliary factors. We propose that this patch is a fundamental motif that facilitates interactions with auxiliary factors and is therefore essential for recombinational DNA repair.</description>

	<title>eLife: Asymmetric random walks reveal that the chemotaxis network modulates flagellar rotational bias in Helicobacter pylori</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.63936</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63936</link>
	<description>The canonical chemotaxis network modulates the bias for a particular direction of rotation in the bacterial flagellar motor to help the cell migrate toward favorable chemical environments. How the chemotaxis network in &lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; modulates flagellar functions is unknown, which limits our understanding of chemotaxis in this species. Here, we determined that &lt;i&gt;H. pylori&lt;/i&gt; swim faster (slower) whenever their flagella rotate counterclockwise (clockwise) by analyzing their hydrodynamic interactions with bounding surfaces. This asymmetry in swimming helped quantify the rotational bias. Upon exposure to a chemo-attractant, the bias decreased and the cells tended to swim exclusively in the faster mode. In the absence of a key chemotaxis protein, CheY, the bias was zero. The relationship between the reversal frequency and the rotational bias was unimodal. Thus, &lt;i&gt;H. pylori&lt;/i&gt;’s chemotaxis network appears to modulate the probability of clockwise rotation in otherwise counterclockwise-rotating flagella, similar to the canonical network.</description>

	<title>eLife: TRIM37 prevents formation of centriolar protein assemblies by regulating Centrobin</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.62640</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62640</link>
	<description>TRIM37 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase mutated in Mulibrey nanism, a disease with impaired organ growth and increased tumor formation. TRIM37 depletion from tissue culture cells results in supernumerary foci bearing the centriolar protein Centrin. Here, we characterize these centriolar protein assemblies (Cenpas) to uncover the mechanism of action of TRIM37. We find that an atypical &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; assembly pathway can generate Cenpas that act as microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs), including in Mulibrey patient cells. Correlative light electron microscopy reveals that Cenpas are centriole-related or electron-dense structures with stripes. TRIM37 regulates the stability and solubility of Centrobin, which accumulates in elongated entities resembling the striped electron dense structures upon TRIM37 depletion. Furthermore, Cenpas formation upon TRIM37 depletion requires PLK4, as well as two parallel pathways relying respectively on Centrobin and PLK1. Overall, our work uncovers how TRIM37 prevents Cenpas formation, which would otherwise threaten genome integrity, including in Mulibrey patients.</description>

	<description>Dengue virus (DENV) cycles between mosquito and mammalian hosts. To examine how DENV populations adapt to these different host environments we used serial passage in human and mosquito cell lines and estimated fitness effects for all single-nucleotide variants in these populations using ultra-deep sequencing. This allowed us to determine the contributions of beneficial and deleterious mutations to the collective fitness of the population. Our analysis revealed that the continuous influx of a large burden of deleterious mutations counterbalances the effect of rare, host-specific beneficial mutations to shape the path of adaptation. Beneficial mutations preferentially map to intrinsically disordered domains in the viral proteome and cluster to defined regions in the genome. These phenotypically redundant adaptive alleles may facilitate host-specific DENV adaptation. Importantly, the evolutionary constraints described in our simple system mirror trends observed across DENV and Zika strains, indicating it recapitulates key biophysical and biological constraints shaping long-term viral evolution.</description>

	<description>Alternation between morphologically distinct haploid and diploid life forms is a defining feature of most plant and algal life cycles, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern these transitions remain unclear. Here, we explore the dynamic relationship between chromatin accessibility and epigenetic modifications during life form transitions in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. The diploid-to-haploid life form transition is governed by the loss of H3K9me2 and DNA demethylation of transposon-associated &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-regulatory elements. This event is associated with dramatic changes in chromatin accessibility and transcriptional reprogramming. In contrast, the global loss of H3K27me3 in the haploid form shapes a chromatin accessibility landscape that is poised to re-initiate the transition back to diploid life after fertilization. Hence, distinct epigenetic reprogramming events rewire transcription through major reorganization of the regulatory epigenome to guide the alternation of generations in flowering plants.</description>

	<title>eLife: Supervised mutational signatures for obesity and other tissue-specific etiological factors in cancer</title>

	<description>Determining the etiologic basis of the mutations that are responsible for cancer is one of the fundamental challenges in modern cancer research. Different mutational processes induce different types of DNA mutations, providing 'mutational signatures' that have led to key insights into cancer etiology. The most widely used signatures for assessing genomic data are based on unsupervised patterns that are then retrospectively correlated with certain features of cancer. We show here that supervised machine-learning techniques can identify signatures, called SuperSigs, that are more predictive than those currently available. Surprisingly, we found that aging yields different SuperSigs in different tissues, and the same is true for environmental exposures. We were able to discover SuperSigs associated with obesity, the most important lifestyle factor contributing to cancer in Western populations.</description>

	<title>eLife: Roles of the ClC chloride channel CLH-1 in food-associated salt chemotaxis behavior of C. elegans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.55701</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55701</link>
	<description>The ability of animals to process dynamic sensory information facilitates foraging in an ever-changing environment. However, molecular and neural mechanisms underlying such ability remain elusive. The ClC anion channels/transporters play a pivotal role in cellular ion homeostasis across all phyla. Here, we find a ClC chloride channel is involved in salt concentration chemotaxis of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Genetic screening identified two altered-function mutations of &lt;i&gt;clh-1&lt;/i&gt; that disrupt experience-dependent salt chemotaxis. Using genetically encoded fluorescent sensors, we demonstrate that CLH-1 contributes to regulation of intracellular anion and calcium dynamics of salt-sensing neuron, ASER. The mutant CLH-1 reduced responsiveness of ASER to salt stimuli in terms of both temporal resolution and intensity, which disrupted navigation strategies for approaching preferred salt concentrations. Furthermore, other ClC genes appeared to act redundantly in salt chemotaxis. These findings provide insights into the regulatory mechanism of neuronal responsivity by ClCs that contribute to modulation of navigation behavior.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Noradrenaline‐induced l‐lactate production requires d‐glucose entry and transit through the glycogen shunt in single‐cultured rat astrocytes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24783?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24783?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Noradrenaline‐induced l‐lactate production requires d‐glucose entry and transit through the glycogen shunt in single‐cultured rat astrocytes&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a304576b-bfc9-4946-a3f0-44ef934f0f5f/jnr24783-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐glucose uptake in astrocytes is an essential source for the noradrenaline‐induced increase in intracellular L‐lactate. We found that intracellular &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;‐lactate arises exclusively from the glycogen—a temporary energy store in the brain. The glycolytic pathway intermediates also support oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. At rest, a large proportion of &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐glucose is metabolized in the Krebs cycle, since the resting &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;‐lactate concentration is low. This is increased when the Krebs cycle is blocked or when cells are stimulated with noradrenaline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During cognitive efforts mediated by local neuronal networks, approximately 20% of additional energy is required; this is mediated by chemical messengers such as noradrenaline (NA). NA targets astroglial aerobic glycolysis, the hallmark of which is the end product &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;‐lactate, a fuel for neurons. Biochemical studies have revealed that astrocytes exhibit a prominent glycogen shunt, in which a portion of &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐glucose molecules entering the cytoplasm is transiently incorporated into glycogen, a buffer and source of &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐glucose during increased energy demand. Here, we studied single astrocytes by measuring cytosolic L‐lactate ([lac]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) with the FRET nanosensor Laconic. We examined whether NA‐induced increase in [lac]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is influenced by: (a) 2‐deoxy‐&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐glucose (2‐DG, 3 mM), a molecule that enters the cytosol and inhibits the glycolytic pathway; (b) 1,4‐dideoxy‐1,4‐imino‐d‐arabinitol (DAB, 300 µM), a potent inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen degradation; and (c) 3‐nitropropionic acid (3‐NPA, 1 mM), an inhibitor of the Krebs cycle. The results of these pharmacological experiments revealed that &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐glucose uptake is essential for the NA‐induced increase in [lac]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, and that this exclusively arises from glycogen degradation, indicating that most, if not all, &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐glucose molecules in NA‐stimulated cells transit the glycogen shunt during glycolysis. Moreover, under the defined transmembrane &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐glucose gradient, the glycolytic intermediates were not only used to produce &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;‐lactate, but also to significantly support oxidative phosphorylation, as demonstrated by an elevation in [lac]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; when Krebs cycle was inhibited. We conclude that &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;‐lactate production via aerobic glycolysis is an essential energy pathway in NA‐stimulated astrocytes; however, oxidative metabolism is important at rest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The presence of metabolically viable brain tissue that may be salvageable with rapid cerebral blood flow restoration is the fundament rationale for reperfusion therapy in patients with large vessel occlusion stroke. The effect of endovascular treatment (EVT) on functional outcome largely depends on the degree of recanalization. However, the relationship of recanalization degree and penumbra salvage has not yet been investigated. We hypothesized that penumbra salvage volume mediates the effect of thrombectomy on functional outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;99 acute anterior circulation stroke patients who received multimodal CT and underwent thrombectomy with resulting partial to complete reperfusion (modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scale (mTICI) ≥ 2a) were retrospectively analyzed. Penumbra volume was quantified on CT perfusion and penumbra salvage volume (PSV) was calculated as difference of penumbra and net infarct growth from admission to follow-up imaging.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In patients with complete reperfusion (mTICI ≥ 2c), the median PSV was significantly higher than the median PSV in patients with partial or incomplete (mTICI 2a–2b) reperfusion (median 224 mL, IQR: 168–303 versus 158 mL, IQR: 129–225; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). A higher degree of recanalization was associated with increased PSV (+ 63 mL per grade, 95% CI: 17–110; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Higher PSV was also associated with improved functional outcome (OR/mRS shift: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.85–0.95, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSV may be an important mediator between functional outcome and recanalization degree in EVT patients and could serve as a more accurate instrument to compare treatment effects than infarct volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Morpho‐physiological Properties and Connectivity of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide‐expressing Interneurons in the Mouse Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/19c26a5d-7073-46e8-90a0-fc2765f230ef/cne25116-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wei et al. characterized morpho‐physiological properties and connectivity of VIP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons in the mouse dentate gyrus. VIP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons comprise four morphologically distinct subtypes with variable physiological properties and preferentially innervate GABAergic interneurons over glutamatergic principal cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is a key brain structure for cognitive and emotional functions. Among the hippocampal subregions, the dentate gyrus (DG) is the first station that receives multimodal sensory information from the cortex. Local‐circuit inhibitory GABAergic interneurons (INs) regulate the excitation–inhibition balance in the DG principal neurons (PNs) and therefore are critical for information processing. Similar to PNs, GABAergic INs also receive distinct inhibitory inputs. Among various classes of INs, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide‐expressing (VIP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) INs preferentially target other INs in several brain regions and thereby directly modulate the GABAergic system. However, the morpho‐physiological characteristics and postsynaptic targets of VIP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; INs in the DG are poorly understood. Here, we report that VIP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; INs in the mouse DG are highly heterogeneous based on their morpho‐physiological characteristics. In approximately two‐thirds of morphologically reconstructed cells, their axons ramify in the hilus. The remaining cells project their axons exclusively to the molecular layer (15%), to both the molecular layer and hilus (10%), or throughout the entire DG layers (8%). Generally, VIP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; INs display variable intrinsic properties and discharge patterns without clear correlation with their morphologies. Finally, VIP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; INs are recruited with a long latency in response to theta‐band cortical inputs and preferentially innervate GABAergic INs over glutamatergic PNs. In summary, VIP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; INs in the DG are composed of highly diverse subpopulations and control the DG output via disinhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The Opsin 3/Teleost multiple tissue opsin system: mRNA localization in the retina and brain of medaka (Oryzias latipes)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b61f21fd-dd22-493e-adda-ff860a03f7cb/cne25106-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Opsin 3 (Opn3)/Teleost multiple tissue (Tmt) opsins are putative blue‐light‐sensitive photoreceptor protein found in animals. The distributions of mRNA of &lt;i&gt;opn3/tmt‐opsins&lt;/i&gt; in the retina and brain of medaka were investigated by in situ hybridization. These opsins are differentially expressed in the multiple retinal and brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photoreceptor protein, opsin, is one of the major components for vision and photoreceptive function in animals. Although many opsins have been discovered from animal genomes, only a few nonimage‐forming functions mediated by opsins have been identified. Understanding the mRNA distribution of photoreceptor proteins is one crucial step in uncovering their photoreceptive function in animals. Here, we focus on the medaka fish (&lt;i&gt;Oryzias latipes&lt;/i&gt;) Opsin 3 (Opn3)/Teleost multiple opsin (Tmt) system, which constitutes a separate phylogenetic group, having putative blue light photoreceptors for nonimage‐forming functions. In medaka, there is one &lt;i&gt;opn3&lt;/i&gt; and five &lt;i&gt;tmt‐opsin&lt;/i&gt; orthologs. The expression pattern of the &lt;i&gt;opn3/tmt‐opsins&lt;/i&gt; in the retina and brain was investigated by in situ hybridization. mRNAs for &lt;i&gt;opn3/tmt‐opsins&lt;/i&gt; were distributed in the retinal ganglion cells as well as interneurons and specific brain nuclei. Specifically, hybridization signals were observed in the &lt;i&gt;glutamate decarboxylase 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;gad1&lt;/i&gt;)‐expressing amacrine cells for &lt;i&gt;opn3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;tmt1a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;tmt1b&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;tmt2&lt;/i&gt;, in the caudal lobe of the cerebellum for &lt;i&gt;tmt1b&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;tmt2&lt;/i&gt;, in the cranial nerve nuclei for &lt;i&gt;opn3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;tmt1a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;tmt1b&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;tmt2&lt;/i&gt;, and in the rostral pars distalis (adenohypophysis) for &lt;i&gt;opn3&lt;/i&gt;. These expression patterns suggest that blue light sensing in the fish retina and brain may be involved in the integration of visual inputs, vestibular function, somatosensation, motor outputs, and pituitary endocrine regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, is responsible for the outbreak of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It is evident that the COVID-19 pandemic has become a challenging world issue. Although most COVID-19 patients primarily develop respiratory symptoms, an increasing number of neurological symptoms and manifestations associated with COVID-19 have been observed. In this narrative review, we elaborate on proposed neurotropic mechanisms and various neurological symptoms, manifestations, and complications of COVID-19 reported in the present literature. For this purpose, a review of all current published literature (studies, case reports, case series, reviews, editorials, and other articles) was conducted and neurological sequelae of COVID-19 were summarized. Essential and common neurological symptoms including gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions, myalgia, headache, altered mental status, confusion, delirium, and dizziness are presented separately in sections. Moreover, neurological manifestations and complications that are of great concern such as stroke, cerebral (sinus) venous thrombosis, seizures, meningoencephalitis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, Miller Fisher syndrome, acute myelitis, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) are also addressed systematically. Future studies that examine the impact of neurological symptoms and manifestations on the course of the disease are needed to further clarify and assess the link between neurological complications and the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19. To limit long-term consequences, it is crucial that healthcare professionals can early detect possible neurological symptoms and are well versed in the increasingly common neurological manifestations and complications of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by cognitive disability, speech impairment, hyperactivity and seizures. Movement disorders have been reported in almost all AS subjects and they are described as “tremulous movements of limbs, unsteadiness, clumsiness or quick, jerky motions”. The presence of dystonia has barely been mentioned in subjects with AS and has never been studied in detail. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence, clinical features and severity of dystonia in a series of adolescents and adults with AS.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Whole body video recordings of patients with genetically confirmed AS were evaluated. Dystonia was evaluated by mean of the movement subscale of Burke–Fahn–Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFM).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Forty-four subjects with AS were evaluated. Fourteen recordings were excluded due to poor cooperation. We finally analyzed data of 30 subjects (15 F) with a median age of 28 years (range 15–51). Dystonia was present in 28/30 (93.3%) subjects. Among these, dystonia involved the upper limbs in 28/28 (100%), lower limbs in 8/28 (28.5%), mouth in 7/28 (25%), neck in 3/28 (10.7%), trunk in 1/28 (3.6%). Severity of dystonia ranged from slight to moderate. There was a linear correlation between severity of dystonia and increasing age. There was no difference in terms of severity of dystonia among genetic subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Dystonia is a common and previously underrecognized clinical feature of adults and adolescents with AS.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;</description>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mitochondrial disorders are clinically complex and have highly variable phenotypes among all inherited disorders. Mutations in mitochon
      drial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear genome or both have been reported in mitochondrial diseases suggesting common pathophysiological pathways. Considering the clinical heterogeneity of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) phenotype including focal neurological deficits, it is important to look beyond mitochondrial gene mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The clinical, histopathological, biochemical analysis for OXPHOS enzyme activity, and electron microscopic, and neuroimaging analysis was performed to diagnose 11 patients with MELAS syndrome with a multisystem presentation. In addition, whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole mitochondrial genome sequencing were performed to identify nuclear and mitochondrial mutations.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Analysis of whole mtDNA sequence identified classical pathogenic mutation m.3243A &amp;gt; G in seven out of 11 patients. Exome sequencing identified pathogenic mutation in several nuclear genes associated with mitochondrial encephalopathy, sensorineural hearing loss, diabetes, epilepsy, seizure and cardiomyopathy (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;POLG&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;DGUOK&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SUCLG2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TRNT1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LOXHD1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KCNQ1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;KCNQ2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NEUROD1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MYH7&lt;/em&gt;) that may contribute to classical mitochondrial disease phenotype alone or in combination with m.3243A &amp;gt; G mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Individuals with MELAS exhibit clinical phenotypes with varying degree of severity affecting multiple systems including auditory, visual, cardiovascular, endocrine, and nervous system. This is the first report to show that nuclear genetic factors influence the clinical outcomes/manifestations of MELAS subjects alone or in combination with m.3243A &amp;gt; G mutation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Aversive teaching signals from individual dopamine neurons in larval Drosophila show qualitative differences in their temporal “fingerprint”</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Aversive teaching signals from individual dopamine neurons in larval Drosophila show qualitative differences in their temporal “fingerprint”&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/535de768-e986-4790-afff-f72254565fcd/cne25037-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Punishment feels bad, but relief from it feels good. Correspondingly, negative memories are formed for cues when these are associated with the occurrence of punishment. In contrast, positive memories result from their association with relief. Such timing‐dependent valence reversal is observed in humans and in animals alike. Using &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae, Weiglein et al. present an odor cue either before or after optogenetically activating single, identified dopaminergic neurons known to mediate punishment. This reveals that these dopaminergic neurons are heterogeneous: DAN‐f1 establishes timing‐dependent valence reversal, whereas DAN‐d1 does not. Together with recent findings in the reward domain and from adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, this suggests that such heterogeneity might be a more general principle of reinforcement processing through dopamine neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine serves many functions, and dopamine neurons are correspondingly diverse. We use a combination of optogenetics, behavioral experiments, and high‐resolution video‐tracking to probe for the functional capacities of two single, identified dopamine neurons in larval &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. The DAN‐f1 and the DAN‐d1 neuron were recently found to carry aversive teaching signals during Pavlovian olfactory learning. We enquire into a fundamental feature of these teaching signals, namely their temporal “fingerprint”. That is, receiving punishment feels bad, whereas being relieved from it feels good, and animals and humans alike learn with opposite valence about the occurrence and the termination of punishment (the same principle applies in the appetitive domain, with opposite sign). We find that DAN‐f1 but not DAN‐d1 can mediate such timing‐dependent valence reversal: presenting an odor before DAN‐f1 activation leads to learned avoidance of the odor (punishment memory), whereas presenting the odor upon termination of DAN‐f1 activation leads to learned approach (relief memory). In contrast, DAN‐d1 confers punishment memory only. These effects are further characterized in terms of the impact of the duration of optogenetic activation, the temporal stability of the memories thus established, and the specific microbehavioral patterns of locomotion through which they are expressed. Together with recent findings in the appetitive domain and from adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, our results suggest that heterogeneity in the temporal fingerprint of teaching signals might be a more general principle of reinforcement processing through dopamine neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Chronic stress has different immediate and delayed effects on hippocampal calretinin‐ and somatostatin‐positive cells</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23285?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23285?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past studies find that chronic stress alters inhibitory, GABAergic circuitry of neurons in distinct hippocampal subregions. Less clear is whether these effects persist weeks after chronic stress ends, and whether these effects involve changes in the total number of hippocampal GABAergic neurons or modulates the function of specific GABAergic subtypes. A transgenic mouse line (&lt;i&gt;VGAT:Cre Ai9&lt;/i&gt;) containing an indelible marker for GABAergic neurons (tdTomato) throughout the brain was used to determine whether chronic stress alters total GABAergic neuronal number or the expression of two key GABAergic cell subtypes, calretinin expressing (CR+) and somatostatin expressing (SOM+) neurons, and whether these changes endure weeks later. Male and female mice were chronically stressed in wire mesh restrainers for 6h/d/21d (Str) or not (Con), and then allowed a 3 week rest period (Str‐Rest) and compared to those without a rest period (Str‐NoRest). Epifluorescent microscope images of immunohistochemistry‐processed brains were quantified to estimate the total number of fluorescently‐labeled hippocampal GABAergic neurons and the proportion that were CR+ or SOM+. Neither chronic stress nor sex altered the total number of GABAergic cells. In contrast, chronic stress reduced the expression of CR+ in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in both males and females, with robust reductions in the DG region of males, but not females, and these changes reversed following a rest period. Chronic stress also reduced the proportion of hippocampal SOM+ neurons and this reduction persisted even with a rest period. These results show chronic stress dynamically reduced CR expression without changing total inhibitory neuronal number and point to CR as a potential new lead to understand mechanisms by which chronic stress alters hippocampal function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal theta oscillations have been implicated in spatial memory function in both rodents and humans. What is less clear is how hippocampal theta interacts with higher frequency oscillations to support long‐term memory. Here we asked 10 presurgical epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial EEG recording to perform a long‐term spatial memory task in desktop virtual reality and found that increased theta power in two discrete bands (“low” 2‐5 Hz and “high” 6‐11 Hz) during cued retrieval was associated with improved task performance. Similarly, increased coupling between “low” theta phase and gamma amplitude during the same period was associated with improved task performance. Finally, low and high gamma amplitude appeared to peak at different phases of the theta cycle; providing a novel connection between human hippocampal function and rodent data. These results help to elucidate the role of theta oscillations and theta‐gamma phase‐amplitude coupling in human long‐term memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theta oscillations in the hippocampus have many behavioral correlates, with the magnitude and vigor of ongoing movement being the most salient. Many consider correlates of locomotion with hippocampal theta to be a confound in delineating theta contributions to cognitive processes. Theory and empirical experiments suggest theta‐movement relationships are important if spatial navigation is to support higher cognitive processes. In the current study, we tested if variations in speed modulation of hippocampal theta can predict spatial learning rates in the water maze. Using multi‐step regression, we find that the magnitude and robustness of hippocampal theta frequency versus speed scaling can predict water maze learning rates. Using a generalized linear model, we also demonstrate that speed and water maze learning are the best predictors of hippocampal theta frequency and amplitude. Our findings suggest movement‐speed correlations with hippocampal theta frequency may be actively used in spatial learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: The effect of body mass index on hippocampal morphology and memory performance in late childhood and adolescence</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Childhood obesity is associated with negative physiological and cognitive health outcomes. The hippocampus is a diverse subcortical structure involved in learned feeding behaviors and energy regulation, and research has shown that the hippocampus is vulnerable to the effects of excess adiposity. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced hippocampal volume in overweight and obese children; however, it is unclear if certain subregions are selectively affected. The purpose of this study was to determine how excess body weight influences regional hippocampal surface morphology and memory performance in a large cross‐sectional cohort of 588 children and adolescents between 8.33 and 19.92 years of age using body mass index expressed as a percentage of the 95th percentile cutoff (%BMIp95). We demonstrate %BMIp95 is associated with reduced radial thickness in the superior anterior region of the left hippocampus, and this relationship is predominantly driven by children younger than 14 years. We also found %BMIp95 was associated with worse performance on a spatial episodic memory task and this relationship was partially mediated by the radial thickness of the significant shape cluster. These results demonstrate the differential influence of excess body weight on regional hippocampal structure and hippocampal‐dependent behavior in children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Bidirectional modulation of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity by post‐weaning obesogenic diet intake in male rats: Influence of the duration of diet exposure</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity is a chronic condition associated with adverse memory and emotional outcomes in humans and animal models. We have recently demonstrated that post‐weaning (i.e., periadolescent) high‐fat diet (HFD)‐induced obesity has opposite effect on hippocampal and amygdala‐dependent memory in rodents: while HFD consumption impairs spatial and relational memory, it enhances cue‐dependent emotional memory. However, it is still not clear whether this bidirectional HFD effect on memory is related to bidirectional alterations of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity and if it is influenced by the duration of diet intake. In the current study, we compared in male rats the impact of 2–3 and 6–7 months of HFD intake starting at weaning, thus covering adolescence, on in vivo long‐term potentiation (LTP) recorded simultaneously in the hippocampal area CA1 and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). As expected, 6–7 months of HFD intake abolished LTP in the CA1 and enhanced LTP in the BLA. However, 2–3 months of of HFD exposure enhanced LTP in both CA1 and BLA suggesting a transient compensatory mechanism in hippocampus. These results indicate that post‐weaning HFD intake progressively leads to bidirectional modulation of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity, as we previously demonstrated for related memory processes, yet with a different temporal dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Effects of adolescent experience of food restriction and exercise on spatial learning and open field exploration of female rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23275?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23275?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus carries out multiple functions: spatial cognition dorsally (DH) and regulation of emotionality‐driven behavior ventrally (VH). Previously, we showed that dendrites of DH and VH pyramidal neurons of female rats are still developing robustly during adolescence and are altered by the experience of food restriction and voluntary exercise on a wheel. We tested whether such anatomical changes during adolescence impact anxiety‐like behavior and spatial cognition. Four groups of female rats were evaluated for these behaviors: those with wheel access in its cage from postnatal day (P) 36–44 (EX); those with food access restricted to 1 hr per day, from P40 to 44 (FR); those with EX from P36 to 44, combined with FR from P40 to 44, which we will refer to as EX + FR; and controls, CON (no EX, no FR). Open field test for anxiety‐like behavior and active place avoidance test for spatial cognition were conducted at P47–49, the age when food restricted animals have restored body weight, or at P54–56, to identify more enduring effects. Anxiety‐like behavior was elevated for the EX and FR groups at P47–49 but not for the EX + FR group. By P54–56, the EX + FR and EX groups exhibited less anxiety‐like behavior, indicating a beneficial delayed main effect of exercise. There was a beneficial main effect of food restriction upon cognition, as the FR group showed cognition superior to CONs' at P44–46 and P54–56, while the EX + FR animals also showed enhanced spatial learning at P54–56. EX + FR animals with best adaptation to the feeding schedule showed the best spatial learning performance but with a delay. The EX group exhibited only a transient improvement. These findings indicate that FR, EX, and EX + FR in mid‐adolescence are all beneficial in reducing anxiety‐like behavior and improving spatial cognition but with subtle differences in the timing of their manifestation, possibly reflecting the protracted maturation of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Enhancement of intrinsic neuronal excitability‐mediated by a reduction in hyperpolarization‐activated cation current (Ih) in hippocampal CA1 neurons in a rat model of traumatic brain injury</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with epileptiform activity in the hippocampus; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully determined. The goal was to understand what changes take place in intrinsic neuronal physiology in the hippocampus after blunt force trauma to the cortex. In this context, hyperpolarization‐activated cation current (I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) currents may have a critical role in modulating the neuronal intrinsic membrane excitability; therefore, its contribution to the TBI‐induced hyperexcitability was assessed. In a model of TBI caused by controlled cortical impact (CCI), the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons were examined 1 week after TBI induction in rats. Whole‐cell patch‐clamp recordings were performed under current‐ and voltage‐clamp conditions following ionotropic receptors blockade. Induction of TBI caused changes in the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons, as shown by a significant increase and decrease in firing frequency and in the rheobase current, respectively (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .05). The evoked firing rate and the action potential time to peak were also significantly increased and decreased, respectively (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .05). In the TBI group, the amplitude of instantaneous and steady‐state I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; currents was both significantly smaller than those in the control group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .05). The I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; current density was also significantly decreased (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .001). Findings indicated that TBI led to an increase in the intrinsic excitability in CA1 pyramidal neurons and changes in I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; current could be, in part, one of the underlying mechanisms involved in this hyperexcitability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Molecular mechanisms within the dentate gyrus and the perirhinal cortex interact during discrimination of similar nonspatial memories</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differentiating between similar memories is a crucial cognitive function that enables correct episodic memory formation. The ability to separate the components of memories into distinct representations is thought to rely on a computational process known as pattern separation, by which differences are amplified to disambiguate similar events. Although pattern separation has been localized to the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and shown to occur in a spatial domain, this cognitive function takes place also during processing of other types of information. In particular, there is some debate on whether the DG participates in pattern separation of nonspatial representations. Considering the classic role of the Prh in the acquisition and storage of object memories in general and tasks with similar features in particular, this cognitive function could rely more heavily on perirhinal regions when object‐related information is processed. Here we show that two plasticity‐related proteins, BDNF, and Arc, are required in the DG for nonspatial mnemonic differentiation. Moreover, we found that the crucial role of the DG is transient since activity of AMPAR is only required in the Prh but not the DG during differentiated object memory retrieval. Additionally, this memory is not modifiable by postacquisition rhBDNF infusions in the DG that are known to improve memory when given in the Prh. This highlights a differential role of Prh and DG during differentiated object memory consolidation. Additionally, we found that these molecular mechanisms actively interact in the DG and Prh for the formation of distinguishable memories, with infusions of rhBDNF in the Prh being able to rescue mnemonic deficits caused by reduced Arc expression in the DG. These results reveal a complex interaction between plasticity mechanisms in the Prh and DG for nonspatial pattern separation and posit the Prh as the key structure where unique object representations are stored.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Multi‐omics analysis suggests enhanced epileptogenesis in the Cornu Ammonis 3 of the pilocarpine model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by the occurrence of seizures, and histopathological abnormalities in the mesial temporal lobe structures, mainly hippocampal sclerosis (HS). We used a multi‐omics approach to determine the profile of transcript and protein expression in the dorsal and ventral hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and &lt;i&gt;Cornu Ammonis&lt;/i&gt; 3 (CA3) in an animal model of MTLE induced by pilocarpine. We performed label‐free proteomics and RNAseq from laser‐microdissected tissue isolated from pilocarpine‐induced Wistar rats. We divided the DG and CA3 into dorsal and ventral areas and analyzed them separately. We performed a data integration analysis and evaluated enriched signaling pathways, as well as the integrated networks generated based on the gene ontology processes. Our results indicate differences in the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles among the DG and the CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. Moreover, our data suggest that epileptogenesis is enhanced in the CA3 region when compared to the DG, with most abnormalities in transcript and protein levels occurring in the CA3. Furthermore, our results show that the epileptogenesis in the pilocarpine model involves predominantly abnormal regulation of excitatory neuronal mechanisms mediated by N‐methyl D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors, changes in the serotonin signaling, and neuronal activity controlled by calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase (CaMK) regulation and leucine‐rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)/WNT signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;US females compared to US males had: 1) more &lt;i&gt;PENK&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing granule cells; 2) fewer &lt;i&gt;OPRD1&lt;/i&gt; expressing granule cells; and 3) more &lt;i&gt;OPRM1&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing interneurons in CA3b. CIS females compared to CIS males had less: 1) &lt;i&gt;PDYN&lt;/i&gt; expression in granule cells; 2) OPRD1 expression in interneurons in CA3b; 3) &lt;i&gt;OPRM1&lt;/i&gt; probe expression in CA2/3a and granule cell expression; 4) &lt;i&gt;OPRK1&lt;/i&gt; expression in interneurons in CA2/3a and the hilus of the dentate gyrus.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic immobilization stress (CIS) results in sex‐dependent changes in opioid peptide levels and receptor subcellular distributions within the rat dorsal hippocampus which are paralleled with an inability for males to acquire conditioned place preference (CPP) to oxycodone. Here, RNAScope &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization was used to determine the expression of hippocampal opioid peptides and receptors in unstressed (US) and CIS estrus female and male adult (~ 14 wk) Sprague Dawley rats. In all groups, dentate granule cells expressed &lt;i&gt;PENK&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PDYN&lt;/i&gt;; additionally, numerous interneurons expressed &lt;i&gt;PENK&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;OPRD1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;OPRM1&lt;/i&gt; were primarily expressed in interneurons, and to a lesser extent, in pyramidal and granule cells. &lt;i&gt;OPRK1&lt;/i&gt;‐was expressed in sparsely distributed interneurons. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;There were few baseline sex differences&lt;/span&gt;: US females compared to US males had more &lt;i&gt;PENK‐&lt;/i&gt;expressing and fewer &lt;i&gt;OPRD1&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing granule cells and more &lt;i&gt;OPRM1‐&lt;/i&gt;expressing CA3b interneurons. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Several expression differences emerged after CIS&lt;/span&gt;. Both CIS females and males compared to their US counterparts had elevated: 1) &lt;i&gt;PENK&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing dentate granule cells and interneurons in CA1 and CA2/3a; 2) &lt;i&gt;OPRD1&lt;/i&gt; probe number and cell expression in CA1, CA2/3a and CA3b and the dentate gyrus; and 3) &lt;i&gt;OPRK1&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing interneurons in the dentate hilus. Also, CIS males compared to US males had elevated: 1) &lt;i&gt;PDYN&lt;/i&gt; expression in granule cells; 2) &lt;i&gt;OPRD1&lt;/i&gt; probe and interneuron expression in CA2/3a; 3) &lt;i&gt;OPRM1&lt;/i&gt; in granule cells; and 4) &lt;i&gt;OPRK1&lt;/i&gt; interneuron expression in CA2/3a. The sex‐specific changes in hippocampal opioid gene expression may impact network properties and synaptic plasticity processes that may contribute to the attenuation of oxycodone CPP in CIS males.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Administration of 5‐bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine interferes with neuroblast proliferation and promotes apoptotic cell death in the rat cerebellar neuroepithelium&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5e6772af-a992-434c-a9a0-3061cbe7ad1a/cne25005-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study reveals that low doses of BrdU (from 25 to 75 μg/g) have no deleterious effects on the development of the rat cerebellar neuroepithelium. Our results also denote that the BrdU injection at doses ranging from 100 to 300 μg/g alters neuroblasts proliferation and induces the activation of apoptotic cellular events in the prenatal cerebellum.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study was conducted to assess whether a single administration of 5‐bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine (BrdU) interferes with cell proliferation and leads to the activation of apoptotic cellular events in the prenatal cerebellum. BrdU effects across a wide range of doses (25–300 μg/g b.w.) were analyzed using immunohistochemical and ultrastructural procedures. The pregnant rats were injected with BrdU at embryonic day 13, and their fetuses were sacrificed from 5 to 35 hr after exposure. The quantification of several parameters such as the density of mitotic figures, and BrdU and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)‐reactive cells showed that, in comparison with the saline injected rats, the administration of BrdU impairs the proliferative behavior of neuroepithelial cells. The above‐mentioned parameters were significantly reduced in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The reduction was more evident using 200 μg/g b.w. The most severe effects were found with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The present findings also revealed that high doses of BrdU lead to the activation of apoptotic cellular events as evidenced by both terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick‐end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemistry for active caspase‐3. In comparison with saline rats, many apoptotic cells were found in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The number of dying cells increased with 200 μg/g b.w. The most important number of apoptotic cells were observed in animals injected with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the presence of neuroblasts at different stages of apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The SNARE regulator Complexin3 is a target of the cone circadian clock&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f760be5f-301f-47fc-8d1d-7f8a57417d93/cne25004-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complexin3 (CPLX3) is a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses. Here, we show that the expression of CPLX3 is rhythmic at the synaptic terminal of cone photoreceptors with high values during the day and lower values at night. Silencing the circadian clock specifically in cones eliminates rhythmic expression of the protein in cone pedicles. Rhythmic expression of CPLX3 may modulate the synaptic transmission of cone signals to downstream retinal circuits between day and night.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMAL1 is a core component of the mammalian circadian clockwork. Removal of BMAL1 from the retina significantly affects visual information processing in both rod and cone pathways. To identify potential pathways and/or molecules through which BMAL1 alters signal transmission at the cone pedicle, we performed an RNA‐seq differential expression analysis between cone‐specific &lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt; knockout cones (cone‐&lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) and wild‐type (WT) cones. We found 88 genes differentially expressed. Among these, &lt;i&gt;Complexin3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cplx3&lt;/i&gt;), a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses, was downregulated fivefold in the mutant cones. The purpose of this work was to determine whether BMAL1 and/or the cone clock controls CPLX3 protein expression at cone pedicles. We found that CPLX3 expression level was decreased twofold in cone‐&lt;i&gt;Bmal1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; cones. Furthermore, CPLX3 expression was downregulated at night compared to the day in WT cones but remained constitutively low in mutant cones both day and night. The transcript and protein expression levels of &lt;i&gt;Cplx4—&lt;/i&gt;the other complexin expressed in cones—were similar in WT and mutant cones; in WT cones, CPLX4 protein level did not change with the time of day. In silico analysis revealed four potential BMAL1:CLOCK binding sites upstream from exon one of &lt;i&gt;Cplx3&lt;/i&gt; and none upstream of exon one of &lt;i&gt;Cplx4&lt;/i&gt;. Our results suggest that CPLX3 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by the cone clock. The modulation of CPLX3 may be a mechanism by which the clock controls the cone synaptic transfer function to second‐order cells and thereby impacts retinal signal processing during the day/night cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Ontogeny of the electric organ discharge and of the papillae of the electrocytes in the weakly electric fish Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus (Teleostei: Mormyridae)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6fd5fe4c-132f-4b15-8ffa-f24a690a3c8e/cne25003-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electric organ (EO) of mormyrid weakly electric fish is located in the tail on either side of the spinal cord. It consists of dorsal and ventral columns of serially arranged electrocytes which are derivatives of muscle cells. In &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus&lt;/i&gt; it produces a long triphasic discharge. We investigated the development of the EOD and the morphology of the electrocytes in order to correlate ontogenetic changes in length and shape of the EOD with dynamic morphological characteristics of the electrocyte, in particular the formation of surface evaginations (papillae) of the anterior face of electrocytes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electric organ of the mormyrid weakly electric fish, &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus&lt;/i&gt; (Boulenger, 1898), undergoes changes in both the electric organ discharge (EOD) and the light and electron microscopic morphology as the fish mature from the juvenile to the adult form. Of particular interest was the appearance of papillae, surface specializations of the uninnervated anterior face of the electrocyte, which have been hypothesized to increase the duration of the EOD. In a 24.5 mm long juvenile the adult electric organ (EO) was not yet functional, and the electrocytes lacked papillae. A 40 mm long juvenile, which produced a short biphasic EOD of 1.3 ms duration, shows small papillae (average area 136 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast, the EOD of a 79 mm long juvenile was triphasic. The large increase in duration of the EOD to 23.2 ms was accompanied by a small change in size of the papillae (average area 159 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Similarly, a 150 mm long adult produced a triphasic EOD of comparable duration to the younger stage (24.7 ms) but featured a prominent increase in size of the papillae (average area 402 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, there was no linear correlation between EOD duration and papillary size. The most prominent ultrastructural change was at the level of the myofilaments, which regularly extended into the papillae, only in the oldest specimen—probably serving a supporting function. Physiological mechanisms, like gene expression levels, as demonstrated in some &lt;i&gt;Campylomormyrus&lt;/i&gt; species, might be more important concerning the duration of the EOD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Acetylcholinesterase and Nissl‐staining in the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin Hippocampal Formation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cetacean hippocampal formation has been noted to be one of the smallest relative to brain size of all mammals studied. This region, comprised of the dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum and the entorhinal cortex, is important in learning, memory, and navigation. There have been a number of studies detailing the distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the hippocampal formation of terrestrial mammals with the goal of gaining a greater understanding of some aspects of the cholinergic innervation to this region, as well as its parcellation. The present study was undertaken to describe the organization, cytoarchitecture, and distribution of AChE in the hippocampal formation of the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin (AWSD) with the view to understand similarities and differences between this aquatic mammal and terrestrial mammals. Nissl‐staining demonstrated cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal formation in the AWSD comparable to that reported in other cetaceans. In addition, the AWSD had a rich pattern of AChE staining that distinctly varied between regions and laminae. A number of differences in the distribution of AChE staining in areas comparable to those of terrestrial species reported suggested possible alterations in connectivity of this region. Overall, however, AChE‐staining suggested that cholinergic innervation, neural pathways and function of the hippocampal formation of the AWSD is conserved, similar to other mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Evolution of the speech‐ready brain: The voice/jaw connection in the human motor cortex&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1765cc53-e38e-4c53-a89a-2ef00173a12d/cne24997-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of syllable structure in speech depended upon a coupling between vocalization and oscillatory movement of the jaw. Using functional MRI, we identify the neural basis of this coupling by demonstrating overlapping representations between the larynx and the jaw muscles in the human motor cortex.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prominent model of the origins of speech, known as the “frame/content” theory, posits that oscillatory lowering and raising of the jaw provided an evolutionary scaffold for the development of syllable structure in speech. Because such oscillations are nonvocal in most nonhuman primates, the evolution of speech required the addition of vocalization onto this scaffold in order to turn such jaw oscillations into vocalized syllables. In the present functional MRI study, we demonstrate overlapping somatotopic representations between the larynx and the jaw muscles in the human primary motor cortex. This proximity between the larynx and jaw in the brain might support the coupling between vocalization and jaw oscillations to generate syllable structure. This model suggests that humans inherited voluntary control of jaw oscillations from ancestral species, but added voluntary control of vocalization onto this via the evolution of a new brain area that came to be situated near the jaw region in the human motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Cannabinoid receptor Type 1 densities reflect social organization in Microtus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8c7bd8dd-a279-4fd7-8f00-6fc355802b5e/cne24996-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Validation of [3H] CP‐55,940 for autoradiography of endocannabinoid receptors in prairie vole brains. Three adjacent sections of brain tissue were incubated with [3H] CP‐55,940 with or without an unlabeled receptor competitor. Coincubation of the radioligand with the CB2 blocker (HU308) had no discernible impact on binding in the hippocampus but increased binding in the prefrontal cortex relative to control. Coincubation of the radioligand with the CB1 blocker (AM251) significantly decreased signal in both regions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across many species, endocannabinoids play an important role in regulating social play, reward, and anxiety. These processes are mediated through at least two distinct cannabinoid receptors (CB), CB1 and CB2. CB1 expression is found in appreciable densities across regions of the brain that integrate memory with socio‐spatial information; many of these regions have been directly linked to the neurobiology of pair bonding in monogamous species. Using receptor autoradiography, we provide the first distributional map of CB1 within the brains of closely related monogamous prairie voles and promiscuous meadow voles, and compare receptor densities across sexes and species in limbic regions. We observe CB1‐specific signal using [3H] CP‐55,940 and [3H] SR141716A, though the latter exhibited a lower signal to noise ratio. We confirmed the presence of CB2 in prairie vole spleen tissue using [3H] CP‐55,940. However, we found no evidence of CB2 in the brain using either [3H] CP‐55,940 or [3H] A‐836,339. The overall distribution of putative CB1 in the brain was similar across vole species and followed the pattern of CB1 expression observed in other species—high intensity binding within the telencephalon, moderate binding within the diencephalon, and mild binding within the mesencephalon and metencephalon (aside from the cerebellar cortex). However, we found profound differences in CB1 densities across species, with prairie voles having higher CB1 binding in regions implicated in social attachment and spatial memory (e.g., periaqueductal gray, hippocampus). These findings suggest that CB1 densities, but not distribution, correlate with the social systems of vole species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Female reproductive state is associated with changes in distinct arginine vasotocin cell types in the preoptic area of Astatotilapia burtoni</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Female reproductive state is associated with changes in distinct arginine vasotocin cell types in the preoptic area of Astatotilapia burtoni&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0312d617-0ea5-4a90-9458-49a4a7a4057a/cne24995-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used multiple methods for examining the arginine vasotocin (AVT) system in female African cichlid fish &lt;i&gt;Astatotilapia burtoni&lt;/i&gt;. AVT‐ir cell size varied with female reproductive state in a cell type‐dependent manner. Ovulated females had larger magnocellular and gigantocelluar cells than brooding females, and gigantocellular AVT‐ir cell size correlated with the number of days brooding. Overall, our data indicate that AVT neurons change across the reproductive cycle in female fishes, similar to that seen in males.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonapeptides play a crucial role in mediating reproduction, aggression, and parental care across taxa. In fishes, &lt;i&gt;arginine vasotocin&lt;/i&gt; (AVT) expression is related to social and/or reproductive status in most male fishes studied to date, and is linked to territorial defense, paternal care, and courtship. Despite a plethora of studies examining AVT in male fishes, relatively little is known about how AVT expression varies with female reproductive state or its role in female social behaviors. We used multiple methods for examining the AVT system in female African cichlid fish &lt;i&gt;Astatotilapia burtoni&lt;/i&gt;, including immunohistochemistry for AVT, in situ hybridization for &lt;i&gt;avt&lt;/i&gt;‐mRNA, and quantitative PCR. Ovulated and mouthbrooding females had similar numbers of parvocellular, magnocellular, and gigantocellular AVT cells in the preoptic area. However, ovulated females had larger magnocellular and gigantocellular cells compared to mouthbrooding females, and gigantocellular AVT cell size correlated with the number of days brooding, such that late‐stage brooding females had larger AVT cells than mid‐stage brooding females. In addition, we found that ventral hypothalamic cells were more prominent in females compared to males, and were larger in mouthbrooding compared to ovulated females, suggesting a role in maternal care. Together, these data indicate that AVT neurons change across the reproductive cycle in female fishes, similar to that seen in males. These data on females complement studies in male &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burtoni&lt;/i&gt;, providing a comprehensive picture of the regulation and potential function of different AVT cell types in reproduction and social behaviors in both sexes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Identification of regenerative processes in neonatal spinal cord injury in the opossum (Monodelphis domestica): A transcriptomic study&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ee12c72d-fe3a-4b77-b9f0-18854c9fb660/cne24994-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In opossums, spinal injury early in development results in spontaneous axon growth through the injury, but this regeneration diminishes with maturity until it is lost entirely. Analysis of the postinjury transcriptomes suggests that there is a more complex transcriptomic response in nonregenerating cords, suggesting a stronger influence of non‐neuronal cells in the outcome after injury, and suggesting that a prolonged immune response may be inhibitory to spinal cord regeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the response to spinal cord injury in the gray short‐tailed opossum (&lt;i&gt;Monodelphis domestica&lt;/i&gt;). In opossums spinal injury early in development results in spontaneous axon growth through the injury, but this regenerative potential diminishes with maturity until it is lost entirely. The mechanisms underlying this regeneration remain unknown. RNA sequencing was used to identify differential gene expression in regenerating (SCI at postnatal Day 7, P7SCI) and nonregenerating (SCI at Day 28, P28SCI) cords +1d, +3d, and +7d after complete spinal transection, compared to age‐matched controls. Genes showing significant differential expression (log2FC ≥ 1, &lt;i&gt;Padj&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.05) were used for downstream analysis. Across all time‐points 233 genes altered expression after P7SCI, and 472 genes altered expression after P28SCI. One hundred and forty‐seven genes altered expression in both injury ages (63% of P7SCI data set). The majority of changes were gene upregulations. Gene ontology overrepresentation analysis in P7SCI gene‐sets showed significant overrepresentations only in immune‐associated categories, while P28SCI gene‐sets showed overrepresentations in these same immune categories, along with other categories such as “cell proliferation,” “cell adhesion,” and “apoptosis.” Cell‐type–association analysis suggested that, regardless of injury age, injury‐associated gene transcripts were most strongly associated with microglia and endothelial cells, with strikingly fewer astrocyte, oligodendrocyte and neuron‐related genes, the notable exception being a cluster of mostly downregulated oligodendrocyte‐associated genes in the P7SCI + 7d gene‐set. Our findings demonstrate a more complex transcriptomic response in nonregenerating cords, suggesting a strong influence of non‐neuronal cells in the outcome after injury and providing the largest survey yet of the transcriptomic changes occurring after SCI in this model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum is a neurodegenerative disease due to mutations in TUBB4A. Auditory evoked potentials are abnormal in this disease. Human mutation D249N impairs central function. A302T‐mutant &lt;i&gt;taiep&lt;/i&gt; rats presents longer latencies in central waves. Both mutations severely impair the central hearing pathway by progressive central white matter degeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H‐ABC) is a neurodegenerative disease due to mutations in TUBB4A. Patients suffer from extrapyramidal movements, spasticity, ataxia, and cognitive deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging features are hypomyelination and atrophy of the striatum and cerebellum. A correlation between the mutations and their cellular, tissue and organic effects is largely missing. The effects of these mutations on sensory functions have not been described so far. We have previously reported a rat carrying a TUBB4A (A302T) mutation and sharing most of the clinical and radiological signs with H‐ABC patients. Here, for the first time, we did a comparative study of the hearing function in an H‐ABC patient and in this mutant model. By analyzing hearing function, we found that there are no significant differences in the auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds between mutant rats and WT controls. Nevertheless, ABRs show longer latencies in central waves (II–IV) that in some cases disappear when compared to WT. The patient also shows abnormal AEPs presenting only Waves I and II. Distortion product of otoacoustic emissions and immunohistochemistry in the rat show that the peripheral hearing function and morphology of the organ of Corti are normal. We conclude that the tubulin mutation severely impairs the central hearing pathway most probably by progressive central white matter degeneration. Hearing function might be affected in a significant fraction of patients with H‐ABC; therefore, screening for auditory function should be done on patients with tubulinopathies to evaluate hearing support therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Neurons of the dorsomedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTdm) project onto hypothalamic nuclei including the paraventricular (PVH), dorsomedial (DMH), arcuate (ARH) nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). In particular, BNSTdm neurons innervate proopiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti‐related peptide (AgRP), melanin‐concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin (ORX) expressing neurons of the ARH and the LHA, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stressful environment is a potent modulator of feeding, we seek in the present work to decipher the neuroanatomical basis for an interplay between stress and feeding behaviors. For this, we combined anterograde and retrograde tracing with immunohistochemical approaches to investigate the patterns of projections between the dorsomedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), well connected to the amygdala, and hypothalamic structures such as the paraventricular (PVH) and dorsomedial (DMH), the arcuate (ARH) nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic areas (LHA) known to control feeding and motivated behaviors. We particularly focused our study on afferences to proopiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti‐related peptide (AgRP), melanin‐concentrating‐hormone (MCH) and orexin (ORX) neurons characteristics of the ARH and the LHA, respectively. We found light to intense innervation of all these hypothalamic nuclei. We particularly showed an innervation of POMC, AgRP, MCH and ORX neurons by the dorsomedial and dorsolateral divisions of the BNST. Therefore, these results lay the foundation for a better understanding of the neuroanatomical basis of the stress‐related feeding behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We describe a novel method to culture the intact spinal cord of the chicken embryo for live imaging of axon guidance at the midline. The stability of this ex vivo method allowed us to characterize key aspects of midline crossing, such as axonal growth, timing of crossing, dynamic morphological changes of the growth cones, and growth cone‐floor plate cell interactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During neural circuit formation, axons navigate several choice points to reach their final target. At each one of these intermediate targets, growth cones need to switch responsiveness from attraction to repulsion in order to move on. Molecular mechanisms that allow for the precise timing of surface expression of a new set of receptors that support the switch in responsiveness are difficult to study in vivo. Mostly, mechanisms are inferred from the observation of snapshots of many different growth cones analyzed in different preparations of tissue harvested at distinct time points. However, to really understand the behavior of growth cones at choice points, a single growth cone should be followed arriving at and leaving the intermediate target. Existing ex vivo preparations, like cultures of an “open‐book” preparation of the spinal cord have been successfully used to study floor plate entry and exit, but artifacts prevent the analysis of growth cone behavior at the floor plate exit site. Here, we describe a novel spinal cord preparation that allows for live imaging of individual axons during navigation in their intact environment. When comparing growth cone behavior in our ex vivo system with snapshots from in vivo navigation, we do not see any differences. The possibility to observe the dynamics of single growth cones navigating their intermediate target allows for measuring growth speed, changes in morphology, or aberrant behavior, like stalling and wrong turning. Moreover, observation of the intermediate target—the floor plate—revealed its active participation and interaction with commissural axons during midline crossing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Understanding how animals navigate complex environments is a fundamental challenge in biology and a source of inspiration for the design of autonomous systems in engineering. Animal orientation and navigation is a complex process that integrates multiple senses, whose function and contribution are yet to be fully clarified. Here, we propose a data-driven mathematical model of adult zebrafish engaging in counter-flow swimming, an innate behavior known as rheotaxis. Zebrafish locomotion in a two-dimensional fluid flow is described within the finite-dipole model, which consists of a pair of vortices separated by a constant distance. The strength of these vortices is adjusted in real time by the fish to afford orientation and navigation control, as a function of the multi-sensory input from vision, lateral line, and touch. Model parameters for the resulting stochastic differential equations are calibrated through a series of experiments, in which zebrafish swam in a water channel under different illumination conditions. The accuracy of the model is validated through the study of a series of measures of rheotactic behavior, contrasting results of real and &lt;i&gt;in-silico&lt;/i&gt; experiments. Our results point at a critical role of hydromechanical feedback during rheotaxis, in the form of a gradient-following strategy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wT0dfK3gKyM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In human microbiota, the prevention or promotion of invasions can be crucial to human health. Invasion outcomes, in turn, are impacted by the composition of resident communities and interactions of resident members with the invader. Here we study how interactions influence invasion outcomes in microbial communities, when interactions are primarily mediated by chemicals that are released into or consumed from the environment. We use a previously developed dynamic model which explicitly includes species abundances and the concentrations of chemicals that mediate species interaction. Using this model, we assessed how species interactions impact invasion by simulating a new species being introduced into an existing resident community. We classified invasion outcomes as resistance, augmentation, displacement, or disruption depending on whether the richness of the resident community was maintained or decreased and whether the invader was maintained in the community or went extinct. We found that as the number of invaders introduced into the resident community increased, disruption rather than augmentation became more prevalent. With more facilitation of the invader by the resident community, resistance outcomes were replaced by displacement and augmentation. By contrast, with more facilitation among residents, displacement outcomes shifted to resistance. When facilitation of the resident community by the invader was eliminated, the majority of augmentation outcomes turned into displacement, while when inhibition of residents by invaders was eliminated, invasion outcomes were largely unaffected. Our results suggest that a better understanding of interactions within resident communities and between residents and invaders is crucial to predicting the success of invasions into microbial communities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7fxnabkFZPk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Efforts to suppress transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK have seen non-pharmaceutical interventions being invoked. The most severe measures to date include all restaurants, pubs and cafes being ordered to close on 20th March, followed by a “stay at home” order on the 23rd March and the closure of all non-essential retail outlets for an indefinite period. Government agencies are presently analysing how best to develop an exit strategy from these measures and to determine how the epidemic may progress once measures are lifted. Mathematical models are currently providing short and long term forecasts regarding the future course of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK to support evidence-based policymaking. We present a deterministic, age-structured transmission model that uses real-time data on confirmed cases requiring hospital care and mortality to provide up-to-date predictions on epidemic spread in ten regions of the UK. The model captures a range of age-dependent heterogeneities, reduced transmission from asymptomatic infections and produces a good fit to the key epidemic features over time. We simulated a suite of scenarios to assess the impact of differing approaches to relaxing social distancing measures from 7th May 2020 on the estimated number of patients requiring inpatient and critical care treatment, and deaths. With regard to future epidemic outcomes, we investigated the impact of reducing compliance, ongoing shielding of elder age groups, reapplying stringent social distancing measures using region based triggers and the role of asymptomatic transmission. We find that significant relaxation of social distancing measures from 7th May onwards can lead to a rapid resurgence of COVID-19 disease and the health system being quickly overwhelmed by a sizeable, second epidemic wave. In all considered age-shielding based strategies, we projected serious demand on critical care resources during the course of the pandemic. The reintroduction and release of strict measures on a regional basis, based on ICU bed occupancy, results in a long epidemic tail, until the second half of 2021, but ensures that the health service is protected by reintroducing social distancing measures for all individuals in a region when required. Our work confirms the effectiveness of stringent non-pharmaceutical measures in March 2020 to suppress the epidemic. It also provides strong evidence to support the need for a cautious, measured approach to relaxation of lockdown measures, to protect the most vulnerable members of society and support the health service through subduing demand on hospital beds, in particular bed occupancy in intensive care units.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BPSPhRtBDXA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Owing to their plasticity, intrinsically disordered and multidomain proteins require descriptions based on multiple conformations, thus calling for techniques and analysis tools that are capable of dealing with conformational ensembles rather than a single protein structure. Here, we introduce DEER-PREdict, a software program to predict Double Electron-Electron Resonance distance distributions as well as Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement rates from ensembles of protein conformations. DEER-PREdict uses an established rotamer library approach to describe the paramagnetic probes which are bound covalently to the protein.DEER-PREdict has been designed to operate efficiently on large conformational ensembles, such as those generated by molecular dynamics simulation, to facilitate the validation or refinement of molecular models as well as the interpretation of experimental data. The performance and accuracy of the software is demonstrated with experimentally characterized protein systems: HIV-1 protease, T4 Lysozyme and Acyl-CoA-binding protein. DEER-PREdict is open source (GPLv3) and available at github.com/KULL-Centre/DEERpredict and as a Python PyPI package pypi.org/project/DEERPREdict.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9j3_K5_OcuI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Contrasting mechanisms for hidden hearing loss: Synaptopathy vs myelin defects</title>

Hidden hearing loss (HHL) is an auditory neuropathy characterized by normal hearing thresholds but reduced amplitudes of the sound-evoked auditory nerve compound action potential (CAP). In animal models, HHL can be caused by moderate noise exposure or aging, which induces loss of inner hair cell (IHC) synapses. In contrast, recent evidence has shown that transient loss of cochlear Schwann cells also causes permanent auditory deficits in mice with similarities to HHL. Histological analysis of the cochlea after auditory nerve remyelination showed a permanent disruption of the myelination patterns at the heminode of type I spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) peripheral terminals, suggesting that this defect could be contributing to HHL. To shed light on the mechanisms of different HHL scenarios observed in animals and to test their impact on type I SGN activity, we constructed a reduced biophysical model for a population of SGN peripheral axons whose activity is driven by a well-accepted model of cochlear sound processing. We found that the amplitudes of simulated sound-evoked SGN CAPs are lower and have greater latencies when heminodes are disorganized, i.e. they occur at different distances from the hair cell rather than at the same distance as in the normal cochlea. These results confirm that disruption of heminode positions causes desynchronization of SGN spikes leading to a loss of temporal resolution and reduction of the sound-evoked SGN CAP. Another mechanism resulting in HHL is loss of IHC synapses, i.e., synaptopathy. For comparison, we simulated synaptopathy by removing high threshold IHC-SGN synapses and found that the amplitude of simulated sound-evoked SGN CAPs decreases while latencies remain unchanged, as has been observed in noise exposed animals. Thus, model results illuminate diverse disruptions caused by synaptopathy and demyelination on neural activity in auditory processing that contribute to HHL as observed in animal models and that can contribute to perceptual deficits induced by nerve damage in humans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XuDLG3sJGiA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Microbial conversion of dietary or drug substrates into small bioactive molecules represents a regulatory mechanism by which the gut microbiota alters intestinal physiology. Here, we show that a wide variety of gut bacteria can metabolize the dietary supplement and antidepressant 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) to 5-hydroxyindole (5-HI) via the tryptophanase (TnaA) enzyme. Oral administration of 5-HTP results in detection of 5-HI in fecal samples of healthy volunteers with interindividual variation. The production of 5-HI is inhibited upon pH reduction in in vitro studies. When administered orally in rats, 5-HI significantly accelerates the total gut transit time (TGTT). Deciphering the underlying mechanisms of action reveals that 5-HI accelerates gut contractility via activation of L-type calcium channels located on the colonic smooth muscle cells. Moreover, 5-HI stimulation of a cell line model of intestinal enterochromaffin cells results in significant increase in serotonin production. Together, our findings support a role for bacterial metabolism in altering gut motility and lay the foundation for microbiota-targeted interventions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/-M6xa0R8kNU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The BMP signaling gradient is interpreted through concentration thresholds in dorsal–ventral axial patterning</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Hannah Greenfeld, Jerome Lin, Mary C. Mullins&lt;/p&gt;

Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) patterns the dorsal–ventral (DV) embryonic axis in all vertebrates, but it is unknown how cells along the DV axis interpret and translate the gradient of BMP signaling into differential gene activation that will give rise to distinct cell fates. To determine the mechanism of BMP morphogen interpretation in the zebrafish gastrula, we identified 57 genes that are directly activated by BMP signaling. By using Seurat analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we found that these genes are expressed in at least 3 distinct DV domains of the embryo. We distinguished between 3 models of BMP signal interpretation in which cells activate distinct gene expression through interpretation of thresholds of (1) the BMP signaling gradient slope; (2) the BMP signal duration; or (3) the level of BMP signal activation. We tested these 3 models using quantitative measurements of phosphorylated Smad5 (pSmad5) and by examining the spatial relationship between BMP signaling and activation of different target genes at single-cell resolution across the embryo. We found that BMP signaling gradient slope or BMP exposure duration did not account for the differential target gene expression domains. Instead, we show that cells respond to 3 distinct levels of BMP signaling activity to activate and position target gene expression. Together, we demonstrate that distinct pSmad5 threshold levels activate spatially distinct target genes to pattern the DV axis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/S2FGF5XjcJs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Seipin is a disk-like oligomeric endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein important for lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis and triacylglycerol (TAG) delivery to growing LDs. Here we show through biomolecular simulations bridged to experiments that seipin can trap TAGs in the ER bilayer via the luminal hydrophobic helices of the protomers delineating the inner opening of the seipin disk. This promotes the nanoscale sequestration of TAGs at a concentration that by itself is insufficient to induce TAG clustering in a lipid membrane. We identify Ser166 in the α3 helix as a favored TAG occupancy site and show that mutating it compromises the ability of seipin complexes to sequester TAG in silico and to promote TAG transfer to LDs in cells. While the S166D-seipin mutant colocalizes poorly with promethin, the association of nascent wild-type seipin complexes with promethin is promoted by TAGs. Together, these results suggest that seipin traps TAGs via its luminal hydrophobic helices, serving as a catalyst for seeding the TAG cluster from dissolved monomers inside the seipin ring, thereby generating a favorable promethin binding interface.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Qbl1rGxhj9I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The protein α‐synuclein is central to Parkinson's disease. For the first time, we report that α‐synuclein from Parkinson's patients brain samples caused signaling deficits in brain cells, and novel drug candidates known to block the sigma‐2 receptor complex reversed these deficits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;α‐Synuclein oligomers are thought to have a pivotal role in sporadic and familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and related α‐synucleinopathies, causing dysregulation of protein trafficking, autophagy/lysosomal function, and protein clearance, as well as synaptic function impairment underlying motor and cognitive symptoms of PD. Moreover, trans‐synaptic spread of α‐synuclein oligomers is hypothesized to mediate disease progression. Therapeutic approaches that effectively block α‐synuclein oligomer‐induced pathogenesis are urgently needed. Here, we show for the first time that α‐synuclein species isolated from human PD patient brain and recombinant α‐synuclein oligomers caused similar deficits in lipid vesicle trafficking rates in cultured rat neurons and glia, while α‐synuclein species isolated from non‐PD human control brain samples did not. Recombinant α‐synuclein oligomers also increased neuronal expression of lysosomal‐associated membrane protein‐2A (LAMP‐2A), the lysosomal receptor that has a critical role in chaperone‐mediated autophagy. Unbiased screening of several small molecule libraries (including the NIH Clinical Collection) identified sigma‐2 receptor antagonists as the most effective at blocking α‐synuclein oligomer‐induced trafficking deficits and LAMP‐2A upregulation in a dose‐dependent manner. These results indicate that antagonists of the sigma‐2 receptor complex may alleviate α‐synuclein oligomer‐induced neurotoxicity and are a novel therapeutic approach for disease modification in PD and related α‐synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Multisite Study of Evoked Potentials in Rett Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26029</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26029?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The aim of the current study was to evaluate the utility of evoked potentials as a biomarker of cortical function in Rett syndrome (RTT). As a number of disease‐modifying therapeutics are currently under development, there is a pressing need for biomarkers to objectively and precisely assess the effectiveness of these treatments.


Method
Yearly visual (VEP) and auditory (AEP) evoked potentials were acquired from individuals with RTT, aged 2 to 37 years, and control participants across five sites as part of the Rett Syndrome and Related Disorders Natural History Study. Baseline and Year 1 data, when available, were analyzed and the repeatability of the results was tested. Two syndrome‐specific measures from the Natural History Study were used for evaluating the clinical relevance of the VEP and AEP parameters.


Results
At the baseline study, group level comparisons revealed reduced VEP and AEP amplitude in RTT compared to control participants. Further analyses within the RTT group indicated that this reduction was associated with RTT‐related symptoms, with greater severity associated with lower VEP and AEP amplitude. In participants with RTT, VEP and AEP amplitude was also negatively associated with age. Year 1 follow‐up data analyses yielded similar findings and evidence of repeatability of EPs at the individual level.


Interpretation
The present findings indicate the promise of EPs as an objective measure of disease severity in individuals with RTT. Our multisite approach demonstrates potential research and clinical applications to provide unbiased assessment of disease staging, prognosis, and response to therapy.

	<description>Objective
To assess the impact of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies on the severity of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid‐19) in people with MS (PwMS).


Methods
We retrospectively collected data of PwMS with suspected or confirmed Covid‐19. All the patients had complete follow up to death or recovery. Severe Covid‐19 was defined by a 3‐level variable: mild disease not requiring hospitalization vs pneumonia or hospitalization vs Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission or death. We evaluated baseline characteristics and MS therapies associated to a severe Covid‐19 by multivariable and Propensity‐Score (PS)‐weighted ordinal logistic models. Sensitivity analyses were run to confirm the results.


Results
Of 844 PwMS with suspected (n = 565) or confirmed (n = 279) Covid‐19, 13 (1.54%) died: 11 of them were in a progressive MS phase, and 8 were without any therapy. Thirty‐eight (4.5%) were admitted to an ICU; 99 (11.7%) had a radiologically documented pneumonia; 96 (11.4%) were hospitalized.
After adjusting for region, age, sex, progressive MS course, EDSS, disease duration, BMI, comorbidities and recent methylprednisolone use, the therapy with an anti‐CD20 agent (Ocrelizumab or Rituximab) was significantly associated (OR = 2.37,95%CI = 1.18–4.74,p = 0.015) with an increased risk of severe Covid‐19. Recent use (&amp;lt;1 month) of methylprednisolone was also associated with a worse outcome (OR = 5.24,95%CI = 2.20–12.53, p = 0.001). Results were confirmed by the PS‐weighted and by all the sensitivity analyses.


Interpretation
This study showed an acceptable level of safety of therapies with a broad array of mechanisms of action. However, some specific elements of risk emerged. These will need to be considered while the Covid‐19 pandemic is persisting.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: NPY and Gene Therapy for Epilepsy: How, When,... and Y</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neuropeptide abundantly expressed in the mammalian central and peripheral nervous system. NPY is a pleiotropic molecule, which influences cell proliferation, cardiovascular and metabolic function, pain and neuronal excitability. In the central nervous system, NPY acts as a neuromodulator, affecting pathways that range from cellular (excitability, neurogenesis) to circuit level (food intake, stress response, pain perception). NPY has a broad repertoire of receptor subtypes, each activating specific signaling pathways in different tissues and cellular sub-regions. In the context of epilepsy, NPY is thought to act as an endogenous anticonvulsant that performs its action through Y2 and Y5 receptors. In fact, its overexpression in the brain with the aid of viral vectors can suppress seizures in animal models of epilepsy. Therefore, NPY-based gene therapy may represent a novel approach for the treatment of epilepsy patients, particularly for pharmaco-resistant and genetic forms of the disease. Nonetheless, considering all the aforementioned aspects of NPY signaling, the study of possible NPY applications as a therapeutic molecule is not devoid of critical aspects. The present review will summarize data related to NPY biology, focusing on its anti-epileptic effects, with a critical appraisal of key elements that could be exploited to improve the already existing NPY-based gene therapy approaches for epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Does Impairment of Adult Neurogenesis Contribute to Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease? A Still Open Question</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.578211</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a physiological mechanism contributing to hippocampal memory formation. Several studies associated altered hippocampal neurogenesis with aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether amyloid-β protein (Aβ)/tau accumulation impairs adult hippocampal neurogenesis and, consequently, the hippocampal circuitry, involved in memory formation, or altered neurogenesis is an epiphenomenon of AD neuropathology contributing negligibly to the AD phenotype, is, especially in humans, still debated. The detrimental effects of Aβ/tau on synaptic function and neuronal viability have been clearly addressed both in in vitro and in vivo experimental models. Until some years ago, studies carried out on in vitro models investigating the action of Aβ/tau on proliferation and differentiation of hippocampal neural stem cells led to contrasting results, mainly due to discrepancies arising from different experimental conditions (e.g., different cellular/animal models, different Aβ and/or tau isoforms, concentrations, and/or aggregation profiles). To date, studies investigating in situ adult hippocampal neurogenesis indicate severe impairment in most of transgenic AD mice; this impairment precedes by several months cognitive dysfunction. Using experimental tools, which only became available in the last few years, research in humans indicated that hippocampal neurogenesis is altered in cognitive declined individuals affected by either mild cognitive impairment or AD as well as in normal cognitive elderly with a significant inverse relationship between the number of newly formed neurons and cognitive impairment. However, despite that such information is available, the question whether impaired neurogenesis contributes to AD pathogenesis or is a mere consequence of Aβ/pTau accumulation is not definitively answered. Herein, we attempted to shed light on this complex and very intriguing topic by reviewing relevant literature on impairment of adult neurogenesis in mouse models of AD and in AD patients analyzing the temporal relationship between the occurrence of altered neurogenesis and the appearance of AD hallmarks and cognitive dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Rapamycin Preserves Neural Tissue, Promotes Schwann Cell Myelination and Reduces Glial Scar Formation After Hemi-Contusion Spinal Cord Injury in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.574041</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Protecting white matter is one of the key treatment strategies for spinal cord injury (SCI), including alleviation of myelin loss and promotion of remyelination. Rapamycin has been shown neuroprotective effects against SCI and cardiotoxic effects while enhancing autophagy. However, specific neuroprotection of rapamycin for the white matter after cervical SCI has not been reported. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the role of rapamycin in neuroprotection after hemi-contusion SCI in mice. Forty-six 8-week-old mice were randomly assigned into the rapamycin group (n = 16), vehicle group (n = 16), and sham group (n = 10). All mice of the rapamycin and vehicle groups received a unilateral contusion with 1.2-mm displacement at C5 followed by daily intraperitoneal injection of rapamycin or dimethyl sulfoxide solution (1.5 mg⋅kg&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅day&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;). The behavioral assessment was conducted before the injury, 3 days and every 2 weeks post-injury (WPI). The autophagy-related proteins, the area of spared white matter, the number of oligodendrocytes (OLs) and axons were evaluated at 12 WPI, as well as the glial scar and the myelin sheaths formed by Schwann cells at the epicenter. The 1.2 mm contusion led to a consistent moderate–severe SCI in terms of motor function and tissue damage. Rapamycin administration promoted autophagy in spinal cord tissue after injury and reduced the glial scar at the epicenter. Additionally, rapamycin increased the number of OLs and improved motor function significantly than in the vehicle group. Furthermore, the rapamycin injection resulted in an increase of Schwann cell-mediated remyelination and weight loss. Our results suggest that rapamycin can enhance autophagy, promote Schwann cell myelination and motor function recovery by preserved neural tissue, and reduce glial scar after hemi-contusive cervical SCI, indicating a potential strategy for SCI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Case Report: PNPLA2 Gene Complex Heterozygous Mutation Leading to Neutral Lipid Storage Disease With Myopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.554724</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate the clinical features, skeletal muscle imaging, muscle pathology, blood smear and so on of neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy (NLSDM) caused by PNPLA2 gene mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The clinical data, skeletal muscle imaging, pathological data, and genetic test results of a patient with NLSDM treated in our hospital were collected in detail, and the previous literature was reviewed and compared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The main symptoms were muscle weakness and muscular atrophy. Pathological findings of muscle biopsy showed fat deposition in muscle fibers with border cavitation. Fatty droplets were seen in the cytoplasm of neutrophils in peripheral blood. Magnetic resonance imaging of the muscles of both lower extremities showed that muscle in the thigh vastus intermedius, lateral muscles, biceps, and the muscle abdominal area of the middle leg were filled or replaced by fat. Genetic test results suggested mutations in the PNPLA2 gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: NLSDM is a rare clinical myopathy with abnormal lipid metabolism. Characteristic changes can be seen in skeletal muscle imaging and pathology. The detection of PNPLA2 gene mutation is an important basis for diagnosing NLSDM. Asymmetry and progressive limb weakness are the clinical features. Muscle MRI is mainly involved in the posterior group of the lower limbs. Jordans bodies in the peripheral blood smear and a large number of coarse-grained lipid deposits with rimmed vacuoles in muscle fibers are the characteristic pathological changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Association Study of Alcohol Dehydrogenase and Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Polymorphism With Alzheimer Disease in the Taiwanese Population</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.625885</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) are two major alcohol-metabolizing enzymes. Moderate alcohol intake is a protective modified factor in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) while heavy alcohol intake and abstinence increased dementia risk. The associations between Alzheimer’s disease and alcohol-metabolizing genes are uncertain. This study examined the association of AD with seven ADH/ALDH single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), ADH1C rs2241894, ADH1B rs1229984, ALDH1B1 rs2073478, ALDH2 rs886205, rs4767944, rs4648328, and rs671. We enrolled 157 AD and 168 age- and sex-matched control subjects in pilot study to examine the association of AD with ADH/ALDH SNPs. Reconstructed ALDH2 haplotypes were performed. We measured plasma level of ADH1C and checked the interaction effect of AD–rs2241894 genotype on plasma ADH1C level. In extension study, we further examined 339 AD and 2,504 healthy control from the Taiwan Biobank. In pilot study, we observed that ADH1C rs2241894 TT genotype was negatively associated with AD in a recessive genetic model (OR = 0.25, 95% CI 0.09–0.75, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) in women. A strong linkage disequilibrium was observed among the four examined SNPs of ALDH2. No haplotype was related to AD. The plasma ADH1C level in AD was higher than that in control. After adjusted by age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol, we found a significant interaction effect of AD–rs2241894 genotype on plasma ADH1C level (p = 0.04). This interaction effect was attributable to the association between AD and plasma ADH1C level (β estimate = 366, 95% CI 92.7∼639.4, p = 0.009). The genetic distribution of ADH1C rs2241894 showed strong ethnic heterogeneity, in which the T allele was the minor allele accounting for 28.5% in our study and 23.6% in East Asians, while it was a major allele in Americans, Europeans, and the global populations. No association was discovered between AD and the five SNPs: rs2241894, rs1229984, rs2073478, rs886205, and rs671 in the extension study. In summary, this study revealed a suggestive association between ADH1C rs2241894 and female AD in the pilot study, but failed to confirm this finding in a population database. Further age-matched and large sample size case-control studies are needed before rs2241894 can be interpreted as a protective genetic factor of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Jia-Ji Electro-Acupuncture Improves Locomotor Function With Spinal Cord Injury by Regulation of Autophagy Flux and Inhibition of Necroptosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.616864</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Jia-Ji electro-acupuncture (EA) has been widely applied in clinic to exhibit curative effects on spinal cord injury (SCI). However, its underlying mechanisms leading to improvement of motor function after SCI remain unclear. Allen’s method was made by NYU Impactor M-III equipment to create the SCI rats model. Rats were randomly divided into four groups: Sham (only laminectomy), Model (SCI group), EA (SCI + Jia-Ji EA treatment), EA + CQ (SCI + Jia-Ji EA treatment + inhibitor chloroquine). Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan assessment showed improvement of hind limb motor function after Jia-Ji electro-acupuncture treatment. Histological change of injured spinal cord tissue was alleviated after treatment, observed by hematoxylin-eosin and Nissl staining. The mRNA and protein expression levels of RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL were decreased in EA group. Besides, the increased expression of LC3 and reduced expression of P62 after treatment compared with Model group, confirmed that Jia-Ji electro-acupuncture could enhance the autophagy flux. Electron microscopy imaging showed increasing the number of lysosomes, autophagosomes, and autolysosomes after Jia-Ji electro-acupuncture treatment. Furthermore, inhibition of lysosome function with CQ led to partly eliminate the effect of EA on reducing necroptosis. These data make the case that Jia-Ji electro-acupuncture treatment may improve locomotor function by promoting autophagy flux and inhibiting necroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging Detects Axonal Loss After Transient Dexamethasone Treatment in Optic Neuritis Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.592063</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Optic neuritis is a frequent first symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS) for which corticosteroids are a widely employed treatment option. The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) reported that corticosteroid treatment does not improve long-term visual acuity, although the evolution of underlying pathologies is unclear. In this study, we employed non-invasive diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI)-derived fiber volume to quantify 11% axonal loss 2 months after corticosteroid treatment (vs. baseline) in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse optic nerves affected by optic neuritis. Longitudinal DBSI was performed at baseline (before immunization), after a 2-week corticosteroid treatment period, and 1 and 2 months after treatment, followed by histological validation of neuropathology. Pathological metrics employed to assess the optic nerve revealed axonal protection and anti-inflammatory effects of dexamethasone treatment that were transient. Two months after treatment, axonal injury and loss were indistinguishable between PBS- and dexamethasone-treated optic nerves, similar to results of the human ONTT. Our findings in mice further support that corticosteroid treatment alone is not sufficient to prevent eventual axonal loss in ON, and strongly support the potential of DBSI as an in vivo imaging outcome measure to assess optic nerve pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Presenilin-Deficient Neurons and Astrocytes Display Normal Mitochondrial Phenotypes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.586108</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.586108</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Presenilin 1 (PS1) and Presenilin 2 (PS2) are predominantly known as the catalytic subunits of the γ-secretase complex that generates the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, the major constituent of the senile plaques found in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Apart from their role in γ-secretase activity, a growing number of cellular functions have been recently attributed to PSs. Notably, PSs were found to be enriched in mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) where mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) interact. PS2 was more specifically reported to regulate calcium shuttling between these two organelles by controlling the formation of functional MAMs. We have previously demonstrated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) an altered mitochondrial morphology along with reduced mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis in PS2-deficient cells (PS2KO). This phenotype was restored by the stable re-expression of human PS2. Still, all these results were obtained in immortalized cells, and one bottom-line question is to know whether these observations hold true in central nervous system (CNS) cells. To that end, we carried out primary cultures of PS1 knockdown (KD), PS2KO, and PS1KD/PS2KO (PSdKO) neurons and astrocytes. They were obtained from the same litter by crossing PS2 heterozygous; PS1 floxed (PS2&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt;; PS1&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt;) animals. Genetic downregulation of PS1 was achieved by lentiviral expression of the Cre recombinase in primary cultures. Strikingly, we did not observe any mitochondrial phenotype in PS1KD, PS2KO, or PSdKO primary cultures in basal conditions. Mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential were similar in all models, as were the glycolytic flux and NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/NADH ratio. Likewise, mitochondrial morphology and content was unaltered by PS expression. We further investigated the differences between results we obtained here in primary nerve cells and those previously reported in MEF cell lines by analyzing PS2KO primary fibroblasts. We found no mitochondrial dysfunction in this model, in line with observations in PS2KO primary neurons and astrocytes. Together, our results indicate that the mitochondrial phenotype observed in immortalized PS2-deficient cell lines cannot be extrapolated to primary neurons, astrocytes, and even to primary fibroblasts. The PS-dependent mitochondrial phenotype reported so far might therefore be the consequence of a cell immortalization process and should be critically reconsidered regarding its relevance to AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Basis and Motor Imagery Intervention Methodology Based on Neuroimaging Studies in Children With Developmental Coordination Disorders: A Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.620599</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.620599</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although the neural bases of the brain associated with movement disorders in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) are becoming clearer, the information is not sufficient because of the lack of extensive brain function research. Therefore, it is controversial about effective intervention methods focusing on brain function. One of the rehabilitation techniques for movement disorders involves intervention using motor imagery (MI). MI is often used for movement disorders, but most studies involve adults and healthy children, and the MI method for children with DCD has not been studied in detail. Therefore, a review was conducted to clarify the neuroscientific basis of the methodology of intervention using MI for children with DCD. The neuroimaging review included 20 magnetic resonance imaging studies, and the neurorehabilitation review included four MI intervention studies. In addition to previously reported neural bases, our results indicate decreased activity of the bilateral thalamus, decreased connectivity of the sensory-motor cortex and the left posterior middle temporal gyrus, bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, cerebellum, and basal ganglia, loss of connectivity superiority in the abovementioned areas. Furthermore, reduction of gray matter volume in the right superior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus, lower fractional anisotropy, and axial diffusivity in regions of white matter pathways were found in DCD. As a result of the review, children with DCD had less activation of the left brain, especially those with mirror neurons system (MNS) and sensory integration functions. On the contrary, the area important for the visual space processing of the right brain was activated. Regarding of characteristic of the MI methods was that children observed a video related to motor skills before the intervention. Also, they performed visual-motor tasks before MI training sessions. Adding action observation during MI activates the MNS, and performing visual-motor tasks activates the basal ganglia. These methods may improve the deactivated brain regions of children with DCD and may be useful as conditioning before starting training. Furthermore, we propose a process for sharing the contents of MI with the therapist in language and determining exercise strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Electrical Stimulation-Induced Seizures and Breathing Dysfunction: A Systematic Review of New Insights Into the Epileptogenic and Symptomatogenic Zones</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.617061</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Electrical stimulation (ES) potentially delineates epileptogenic cortex through induction of typical seizures. Although frequently employed, its value for epilepsy surgery remains controversial. Similarly, ES is used to identify symptomatogenic zones, but with greater success and a long-standing evidence base. Recent work points to new seizure symptoms such as ictal central apnea (ICA) that may enhance presurgical hypotheses. The aims of this review are 2-fold: to determine the value of ES-induced seizures (ESIS) in epilepsy surgery and to analyze current evidence on ICA as a new surrogate of symptomatogenic cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Three databases were searched for ESIS. Investigators independently selected studies according to pre-specified criteria. Studies reporting postoperative outcome in patients with ESIS were included in a meta-analysis. For ES-induced apnea, a thorough search was performed and reference list searching was employed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Of 6,314 articles identified for ESIS, 25 were considered eligible to be reviewed in full text. Fourteen studies were included in the qualitative synthesis (1,069 patients); six studies were included in the meta-analysis (530 patients). The meta-analysis showed that favorable outcome is associated with ESIS prior to surgery (OR: 2.02; 95% CI: 1.332–3.08). In addition, the overall estimation of the occurrence of favorable outcome among cases with ESIS is 68.13% (95% CI: 56.62–78.7). On the other hand, recent studies have shown that stimulation of exclusively mesial temporal lobe structures elicits central apnea and represents symptomatogenic anatomic substrates of ICA. This is in variance with traditional teaching that mesial temporal ES is non-symptomatogenic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: ES is a tool highly likely to aid in the delineation of the epileptogenic zone, since ESIS is associated with favorable postoperative outcomes (Engel I). There is an urgent need for prospective evaluation of this technique, including effective stimulation parameters and surgical outcomes, that will provide knowledge base for practice. In addition, ES-induced apnea studies suggest that ICA, especially when it is the first or only clinical sign, is an important semiological feature in localizing the symptomatogenic zone to mesial temporal lobe structures, which must be considered in SEEG explorations where this is planned, and in surgical resection strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Attention, Not Performance, Correlates With Afterdischarge Termination During Cortical Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.609188</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cortical stimulation has been used for brain mapping for over a century, and a standard assumption is that stimulation interferes with task execution due to local effects at the stimulation site. Stimulation can however produce afterdischarges which interfere with functional localization and can lead to unwanted seizures. We previously showed that (a) cognitive effort can terminate these afterdischarges, (b) when termination thus occurs, there are electrocorticography changes throughout the cortex, not just at sites with afterdischarges or sites thought functionally important for the cognitive task used, and (c) thresholds for afterdischarges and functional responses can change among stimulation trials. We here show that afterdischarge termination can occur prior to overt performance of the cognitive tasks used to terminate them. These findings, taken together, demonstrate that task-related brain changes are not limited to one or a group of functional regions or a specific network, and not limited to the time directly surrounding overt task execution. Discrete locations, networks and times importantly underpin clinical behaviors. However, brain activity that is diffuse in location and extended in time also affect task execution and can affect brain mapping. This may in part reflect fluctuating levels of attention, engagement, or motivation during testing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Nonlinear Control in the Nematode C. elegans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.616639</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.616639</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent whole-brain calcium imaging recordings of the nematode C. elegans have demonstrated that the neural activity associated with behavior is dominated by dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold that can be clustered according to behavioral states. Previous models of C. elegans dynamics have either been linear models, which cannot support the existence of multiple fixed points in the system, or Markov-switching models, which do not describe how control signals in C. elegans neural dynamics can produce switches between stable states. It remains unclear how a network of neurons can produce fast and slow timescale dynamics that control transitions between stable states in a single model. We propose a global, nonlinear control model which is minimally parameterized and captures the state transitions described by Markov-switching models with a single dynamical system. The model is fit by reproducing the timeseries of the dominant PCA mode in the calcium imaging data. Long and short time-scale changes in transition statistics can be characterized via changes in a single parameter in the control model. Some of these macro-scale transitions have experimental correlates to single neuro-modulators that seem to act as biological controls, allowing this model to generate testable hypotheses about the effect of these neuro-modulators on the global dynamics. The theory provides an elegant characterization of control in the neuron population dynamics in C. elegans. Moreover, the mathematical structure of the nonlinear control framework provides a paradigm that can be generalized to more complex systems with an arbitrary number of behavioral states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Selective Participation of Single Cortical Neurons in Neuronal Avalanches</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.620052</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.620052</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal avalanches are scale-invariant neuronal population activity patterns in the cortex that emerge in vivo in the awake state and in vitro during balanced excitation and inhibition. Theory and experiments suggest that avalanches indicate a state of cortex that improves numerous aspects of information processing by allowing for the transient and selective formation of local as well as system-wide spanning neuronal groups. If avalanches are indeed involved with information processing, one might expect that single neurons would participate in avalanche patterns selectively. Alternatively, all neurons could participate proportionally to their own activity in each avalanche as would be expected for a population rate code. Distinguishing these hypotheses, however, has been difficult as robust avalanche analysis requires technically challenging measures of their intricate organization in space and time at the population level, while also recording sub- or suprathreshold activity from individual neurons with high temporal resolution. Here, we identify repeated avalanches in the ongoing local field potential (LFP) measured with high-density microelectrode arrays in the cortex of awake nonhuman primates and in acute cortex slices from young and adult rats. We studied extracellular unit firing in vivo and intracellular responses of pyramidal neurons in vitro. We found that single neurons participate selectively in specific LFP-based avalanche patterns. Furthermore, we show in vitro that manipulating the balance of excitation and inhibition abolishes this selectivity. Our results support the view that avalanches represent the selective, scale-invariant formation of neuronal groups in line with the idea of Hebbian cell assemblies underlying cortical information processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Top-Down Inference in the Auditory System: Potential Roles for Corticofugal Projections</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.615259</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.615259</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has become widely accepted that humans use contextual information to infer the meaning of ambiguous acoustic signals. In speech, for example, high-level semantic, syntactic, or lexical information shape our understanding of a phoneme buried in noise. Most current theories to explain this phenomenon rely on hierarchical predictive coding models involving a set of Bayesian priors emanating from high-level brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex) that are used to influence processing at lower-levels of the cortical sensory hierarchy (e.g., auditory cortex). As such, virtually all proposed models to explain top-down facilitation are focused on intracortical connections, and consequently, subcortical nuclei have scarcely been discussed in this context. However, subcortical auditory nuclei receive massive, heterogeneous, and cascading descending projections at every level of the sensory hierarchy, and activation of these systems has been shown to improve speech recognition. It is not yet clear whether or how top-down modulation to resolve ambiguous sounds calls upon these corticofugal projections. Here, we review the literature on top-down modulation in the auditory system, primarily focused on humans and cortical imaging/recording methods, and attempt to relate these findings to a growing animal literature, which has primarily been focused on corticofugal projections. We argue that corticofugal pathways contain the requisite circuitry to implement predictive coding mechanisms to facilitate perception of complex sounds and that top-down modulation at early (i.e., subcortical) stages of processing complement modulation at later (i.e., cortical) stages of processing. Finally, we suggest experimental approaches for future studies on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Resting-State Co-activation Patterns as Promising Candidates for Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease in Aged Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.612529</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.612529</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder marked by accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques leads to progressive loss of memory and cognitive function. Resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) studies have provided links between these two observations in terms of disruption of default mode and task-positive resting-state networks (RSNs). Important insights underlying these disruptions were recently obtained by investigating dynamic fluctuations in RS-fMRI signals in old TG2576 mice (a mouse model of amyloidosis) using a set of quasi-periodic patterns (QPP). QPPs represent repeating spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity of predefined temporal length. In this article, we used an alternative methodology of co-activation patterns (CAPs) that represent instantaneous and transient brain configurations that are likely contributors to the emergence of commonly observed RSNs and QPPs. We followed a recently published approach for obtaining CAPs that divided all time frames, instead of those corresponding to supra-threshold activations of a seed region as done traditionally, to extract CAPs from RS-fMRI recordings in 10 TG2576 female mice and eight wild type littermates at 18 months of age. Subsequently, we matched the CAPs from the two groups using the Hungarian method and compared the temporal (duration, occurrence rate) and the spatial (lateralization of significantly co-activated and co-deactivated voxels) properties of matched CAPs. We found robust differences in the spatial components of matched CAPs. Finally, we used supervised learning to train a classifier using either the temporal or the spatial component of CAPs to distinguish the transgenic mice from the WT. We found that while duration and occurrence rates of all CAPs performed the classification with significantly higher accuracy than the chance-level, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals of significantly activated voxels from individual CAPs turned out to be a significantly better predictive feature demonstrating a near-perfect classification accuracy. Our results demonstrate resting-state co-activation patterns are a promising candidate in the development of a diagnostic, and potentially, prognostic RS-fMRI biomarker of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Megalencephalic Leukoencephalopathy: Insights Into Pathophysiology and Perspectives for Therapy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.627887</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.627887</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is a rare genetic disorder belonging to the group of vacuolating leukodystrophies. It is characterized by megalencephaly, loss of motor functions, epilepsy, and mild mental decline. In brain biopsies of MLC patients, vacuoles were observed in myelin and in astrocytes surrounding blood vessels. It is mainly caused by recessive mutations in MLC1 and HEPACAM (also called GLIALCAM) genes. These disease variants are called MLC1 and MLC2A with both types of patients sharing the same clinical phenotype. Besides, dominant mutations in HEPACAM were also identified in a subtype of MLC patients (MLC2B) with a remitting phenotype. MLC1 and GlialCAM proteins form a complex mainly expressed in brain astrocytes at the gliovascular interface and in Bergmann glia at the cerebellum. Both proteins regulate several ion channels and transporters involved in the control of ion and water fluxes in glial cells, either directly influencing their location and function, or indirectly regulating associated signal transduction pathways. However, the MLC1/GLIALCAM complex function and the related pathological mechanisms leading to MLC are still unknown. It has been hypothesized that, in MLC, the role of glial cells in brain ion homeostasis is altered in both physiological and inflammatory conditions. There is no therapy for MLC patients, only supportive treatment. As MLC2B patients show an MLC reversible phenotype, we speculated that the phenotype of MLC1 and MLC2A patients could also be mitigated by the re-introduction of the correct gene even at later stages. To prove this hypothesis, we injected in the cerebellar subarachnoid space of Mlc1 knockout mice an adeno-associated virus (AAV) coding for human MLC1 under the control of the glial-fibrillary acidic protein promoter. MLC1 expression in the cerebellum extremely reduced myelin vacuolation at all ages in a dose-dependent manner. This study could be considered as the first preclinical approach for MLC. We also suggest other potential therapeutic strategies in this review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Semi-Automated Cell and Tissue Analyses Reveal Regionally Specific Morphological Alterations of Immune and Neural Cells in a Porcine Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Model of Stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Histopathological analysis of cellular changes in the stroked brain provides critical information pertaining to inflammation, cell death, glial scarring, and other dynamic injury and recovery responses. However, commonly used manual approaches are hindered by limitations in speed, accuracy, bias, and the breadth of morphological information that can be obtained. Here, a semi-automated high-content imaging (HCI) and CellProfiler histological analysis method was developed and used in a Yucatan miniature pig permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model of ischemic stroke to overcome these limitations. Evaluation of 19 morphological parameters in IBA1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia/macrophages, GFAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; astrocytes, NeuN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neuronal, FactorVIII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; vascular endothelial, and DCX&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neuroblast cell areas was conducted on porcine brain tissue 4 weeks post pMCAO. Out of 19 morphological parameters assessed in the stroke perilesional and ipsilateral hemisphere regions (38 parameters), a significant change in 3838 measured IBA1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; parameters, 3438 GFAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; parameters, 3238 NeuN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; parameters, 3138 FactorVIII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; parameters, and 2838 DCX&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; parameters were observed in stroked vs. non-stroked animals. Principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analyses demonstrated that stroke-induced significant and predictable morphological changes that demonstrated strong relationships between IBA1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, GFAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and NeuN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; areas. Ultimately, this unbiased, semi-automated HCI and CellProfiler histopathological analysis approach revealed regional and cell specific morphological signatures of immune and neural cells after stroke in a highly translational porcine model. These identified features can provide information of disease pathogenesis and evolution with high resolution, as well as be used in therapeutic screening applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Lipopolysaccharide Pre-conditioning Attenuates Pro-inflammatory Responses and Promotes Cytoprotective Effect in Differentiated PC12 Cell Lines via Pre-activation of Toll-Like Receptor-4 Signaling Pathway Leading to the Inhibition of Caspase-3/Nuclear Factor-κappa B Pathway</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Lipopolysacharide (LPS) pre-conditioning (PC), has been shown to exert protective effects against cytotoxic effects. Therefore, we hypothesized, the tolerance produced by LPS PC will be resulted by the alterations and modifications in gene and protein expression. With reference to the results of MTT assays, AO/PI staining, and Annexin V-FITC analyses of LPS concentration (0.7815–50 μg/mL) and time-dependent (12–72 h) experiments, the pre-exposure to 3 μg/mL LPS for 12 h protected the differentiated PC12 cells against 0.75 mg/mL LPS apoptotic concentration. LPS-treated cells secreted more inflammatory cytokines like IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-17, IFN-γ, and TNF-α than LPS-PC cells. The production of inflammatory mediators ROS and NO was also higher in the LPS-induced cells compared to LPS-PC cells. Conversely, anti-inflammatory cytokines (like IL-10, IL-13, CNTF, and IL-1Ra) were upregulated in the LPS-PC cells but not in the LPS-induced cells. Meanwhile, the LPS initiated caspase-8 which in turn activates effector caspase 3/7. When the activities of caspases in the LPS-induced cells were inhibited using z-VADfmk and z-DEVDfmk, the expressions of c-MYC and Hsp70 were increased, but p53 was reduced. The potential molecules associated with protective and destructive effect was measured by RT&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Profiler PCR array to elucidate the signaling pathways and suggested inhibition NF-κB/caspase-3 signaling pathway regulates the cytoprotective genes and proto-oncogenes. In conclusion, this study provides a basis for future research to better understand the molecular mechanism underlying LPS pre-conditioning /TLR4 pre-activation and its functional role in offering cytoprotective response in neuronal environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mild Cognitive Impairment Patients Have Higher Regulatory T-Cell Proportions Compared With Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementia Patients</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: The role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has attracted much attention recently. Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) play an important role in modulating inflammation. We aimed to explore the Treg-related immunosuppression status at different stages of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Thirty healthy control (HC) subjects, 26 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 30 patients with mild probable AD-related dementia, and 28 patients with moderate-to-severe probable AD-related dementia underwent detailed clinical history taking, structural MRI scanning, and neuropsychological assessment. Peripheral blood samples were taken to measure the percentage of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD25&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD127&lt;sup&gt;low/−&lt;/sup&gt; Tregs by flow cytometry and the levels of interleukin (IL-10), interleukin (IL-35), and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) by ELISA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The percentage of Tregs in the blood of MCI patients was the highest (9.24%); there was a significant difference between patients with MCI and patients with probable AD-related dementia. The level of TGF-β in patients with MCI (47.02 ng/ml) was significantly increased compared with patients with AD-related dementia. There were positive correlations between Treg percentage, IL-35, and Mini-mental state evaluation scores in patients with MCI and probable AD-related dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Patients with MCI have stronger Treg-related immunosuppression status compared with patients with probable AD-related dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Visual Abnormalities Associate With Hippocampus in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Early Alzheimer's Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background and Objective: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been shown to affect vision in human patients and animal models. This study was conducted to explore ocular abnormalities in the primary visual pathway and their relationship with hippocampal atrophy in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The aim of this study was to investigate the potential value of ocular examinations as a biomarker during the AD progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Patients with MCI (n = 23) or AD (n = 17) and age-matched cognitively normal controls (NC; n = 19) were enrolled. Pattern visual-evoked potentials (PVEP), flash electroretinogram (FERG) recordings and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed for all participants. Hippocampal volumes were measured by 3T magnetic resonance imaging. Cognitive function was assessed by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). Pearson correlation was employed to analyze the potential associations between ocular abnormalities and hippocampal volumes. Hierarchical regression models were conducted to determine associations between cognitive performances and ocular abnormalities as well as hippocampal volumes after adjusting for confounding factors including age, sex, cognitive reserve, and APOE4 status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: PVEP amplitude of P100 waveform was significantly decreased in AD patients compared to MCI and normal individuals. In FERG test, delayed latencies of rod response, rod cone response and 3.0 flicker time were found in cognitively impaired groups, indicating dysfunctions of both the rod and cone systems in the disease progression. OCT test revealed reduced macular retinal nerve fiber layer (m-RNFL) thickness in MCI and AD patients, which significantly correlated with brain structure of hippocampus particularly vulnerable during the progression of AD. Interestingly, P100 amplitude showed a significant association with hippocampal volumes even after adjusting confounding factors including age, sex, and cognitive reserve. Hierarchical regression analysis further demonstrated that m-RNFL thickness, as well as hippocampal volumes, significantly associated with ADAS-cog scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: P100 amplitude and m-RNFL thickness showed significant correlations with brain structure involved in AD-related neurodegeneration, and therefore proved to be potential indicators of brain imaging pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Early Long-Term Memory Impairment and Changes in the Expression of Synaptic Plasticity-Associated Genes, in the McGill-R-Thy1-APP Rat Model of Alzheimer's-Like Brain Amyloidosis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accruing evidence supports the hypothesis that memory deficits in early Alzheimer Disease (AD) might be due to synaptic failure caused by accumulation of intracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers, then secreted to the extracellular media. Transgenic mouse AD models provide valuable information on AD pathology. However, the failure to translate these findings to humans calls for models that better recapitulate the human pathology. McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic (Tg) rat expresses the human amyloid precursor protein (APP751) with the Swedish and Indiana mutations (of familial AD), leading to an AD-like slow-progressing brain amyloid pathology. Therefore, it offers a unique opportunity to investigate learning and memory abilities at early stages of AD, when Aβ accumulation is restricted to the intracellular compartment, prior to plaque deposition. Our goal was to further investigate early deficits in memory, particularly long-term memory in McGill-R-Thy1-APP heterozygous (Tg+/–) rats. Short-term- and long-term habituation to an open field were preserved in 3-, 4-, and 6-month-old (Tg+/–). However, long-term memory of inhibitory avoidance to a foot-shock, novel object-recognition and social approaching behavior were seriously impaired in 4-month-old (Tg+/–) male rats, suggesting that they are unable to either consolidate and/or evoke such associative and discriminative memories with aversive, emotional and spatial components. The long-term memory deficits were accompanied by increased transcript levels of genes relevant to synaptic plasticity, learning and memory processing in the hippocampus, such as Grin2b, Dlg4, Camk2b, and Syn1. Our findings indicate that in addition to the previously well-documented deficits in learning and memory, McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats display particular long-term-memory deficits and deep social behavior alterations at pre-plaque early stages of the pathology. This highlights the importance of Aβ oligomers and emphasizes the validity of the model to study AD-like early processes, with potentially predictive value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>In budding yeast, the mitotic exit network (MEN), a GTPase signaling cascade, integrates spatial and temporal cues to promote exit from mitosis. This signal integration requires transmission of a signal generated on the cytoplasmic face of spindle pole bodies (SPBs; yeast equivalent of centrosomes) to the nucleolus, where the MEN effector protein Cdc14 resides. Here, we show that the MEN activating signal at SPBs is relayed to Cdc14 in the nucleolus through the dynamic localization of its terminal kinase complex Dbf2-Mob1. Cdc15, the protein kinase that activates Dbf2-Mob1 at SPBs, also regulates its nuclear access. Once in the nucleus, priming phosphorylation of Cfi1/Net1, the nucleolar anchor of Cdc14, by the Polo-like kinase Cdc5 targets Dbf2-Mob1 to the nucleolus. Nucleolar Dbf2-Mob1 then phosphorylates Cfi1/Net1 and Cdc14, activating Cdc14. The kinase-primed transmission of the MEN signal from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus exemplifies how signaling cascades can bridge distant inputs and responses.</description>

	<title>eLife: Properdin oligomers adopt rigid extended conformations supporting function</title>

	<description>Properdin stabilizes convertases formed upon activation of the complement cascade within the immune system. The biological activity of properdin depends on the oligomerization state, but whether properdin oligomers are rigid and how their structure links to function remains unknown. We show by combining electron microscopy and solution scattering, that properdin oligomers adopt extended rigid and well-defined conformations that are well approximated by single models of apparent n-fold rotational symmetry with dimensions of 230-360 Å. Properdin monomers are pretzel shaped molecules with limited flexibility. In solution, properdin dimers are curved molecules whereas trimers and tetramers are close to being planar molecules. Structural analysis indicates that simultaneous binding through all binding sites to surface linked convertases is unlikely for properdin trimer and tetramers. We show that multivalency alone is insufficient for full activity in a cell lysis assay. Hence, the observed rigid extended oligomer structure is an integral component of properdin function.</description>

COVID-19 abatement strategies have risks and uncertainties which could lead to repeating waves of infection. We show—as proof of concept grounded on rigorous mathematical evidence—that periodic, high-frequency alternation of into, and out-of, lockdown effectively mitigates second-wave effects, while allowing continued, albeit reduced, economic activity. Periodicity confers (i) predictability, which is essential for economic sustainability, and (ii) robustness, since lockdown periods are not activated by uncertain measurements over short time scales. In turn—while not eliminating the virus—this fast switching policy is sustainable over time, and it mitigates the infection until a vaccine or treatment becomes available, while alleviating the social costs associated with long lockdowns. Typically, the policy might be in the form of 1-day of work followed by 6-days of lockdown every week (or perhaps 2 days working, 5 days off) and it can be modified at a slow-rate based on measurements filtered over longer time scales. Our results highlight the potential efficacy of high frequency switching interventions in post lockdown mitigation. All code is available on Github at https://github.com/V4p1d/FPSP_Covid19. A software tool has also been developed so that interested parties can explore the proof-of-concept system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6rMcm-n10lg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Neuroplasticity is essential to learning and memory in the brain; it has therefore also been implicated in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, making measuring the state of neuroplasticity of foremost importance to clinical neuroscience. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a key mechanism of neuroplasticity and has been studied extensively, and invasively in non-human animals. Translation to human application largely relies on the validation of non-invasive measures of LTP. The current study presents a generative thalamocortical computational model of visual cortex for investigating and replicating interlaminar connectivity changes using non-invasive EEG recording of humans. The model is combined with a commonly used visual sensory LTP paradigm and fit to the empirical EEG data using dynamic causal modelling. The thalamocortical model demonstrated remarkable accuracy recapitulating post-tetanus changes seen in invasive research, including increased excitatory connectivity from thalamus to layer IV and from layer IV to II/III, established major sites of LTP in visual cortex. These findings provide justification for the implementation of the presented thalamocortical model for ERP research, including to provide increased detail on the nature of changes that underlie LTP induced in visual cortex. Future applications include translating rodent findings to non-invasive research in humans concerning deficits to LTP that may underlie neurological and psychiatric disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VD1evloAD3U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Friendly-rivalry solution to the iterated &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-person public-goods game</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yohsuke Murase, Seung Ki Baek&lt;/p&gt;

Repeated interaction promotes cooperation among rational individuals under the shadow of future, but it is hard to maintain cooperation when a large number of error-prone individuals are involved. One way to construct a cooperative Nash equilibrium is to find a ‘friendly-rivalry’ strategy, which aims at full cooperation but never allows the co-players to be better off. Recently it has been shown that for the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma in the presence of error, a friendly rival can be designed with the following five rules: Cooperate if everyone did, accept punishment for your own mistake, punish defection, recover cooperation if you find a chance, and defect in all the other circumstances. In this work, we construct such a friendly-rivalry strategy for the iterated &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-person public-goods game by generalizing those five rules. The resulting strategy makes a decision with referring to the previous &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; = 2&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; − 1 rounds. A friendly-rivalry strategy for &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2 inherently has evolutionary robustness in the sense that no mutant strategy has higher fixation probability in this population than that of a neutral mutant. Our evolutionary simulation indeed shows excellent performance of the proposed strategy in a broad range of environmental conditions when &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2 and 3.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/msfDcb5GU5w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Role of the reuniens and rhomboid thalamic nuclei in anxiety‐like avoidance behavior in the rat</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleus reuniens (RE) and rhomboid (RH) nuclei of the ventral midline thalamus are reciprocally connected with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HF) and serve as key intermediaries between these structures, regulating cognitive and emotional behaviors. Regarding affective behavior, several recent reports have described the involvement of RE/RH in the acquisition and retention of conditioned fear, but little is known regarding their role (RE/RH) in anxiety‐like behaviors. We examined the role of RH/RE on avoidance and defensive behaviors in male Long Evans rats using the elevated plus maze (EPM). We found that the reversible suppression of RE/RH with muscimol increased avoidance behavior to the open arms of the plus maze as shown by: (a) significant reductions in open arm entries; (b) reductions in the mean duration of time spent in the open arms; and (c) significant increases in retreats during open arm exploration. This was coupled with decreases in the number of head dips in the maze. Consistent with these behavioral effects, a single exposure of naïve rats to the plus maze produced significant increases in c‐fos expression selectively in RE and RH of midline thalamic nuclei. We posit that RE/RH normally acts to optimize adaptive responses to anxiety‐eliciting situations, and disruptions of RE/RH produce severe deficits in coping behaviors—or as shown here increases in avoidance/defensive behaviors. In sum, the present results establish a novel role for RE/RH in anxiety‐like avoidance behavior. In addition to its role in attention, working memory, and executive control, RE/RH also regulates adaptative responses to not only fear but also to anxiogenic stimuli. As such, dysfunction of RE/RH may contribute to the amalgamation of symptoms common to many mental health disorders including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Tuber Locations Associated with Infantile Spasms Map to a Common Brain Network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26015</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26015?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Approximately 50% of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex develop infantile spasms, a sudden onset epilepsy syndrome associated with poor neurological outcomes. An increased burden of tubers confers an elevated risk of infantile spasms, but it remains unknown whether some tuber locations confer higher risk than others. Here, we test whether tuber location and connectivity are associated with infantile spasms.


Methods
We segmented tubers from 123 children with (n = 74) and without (n = 49) infantile spasms from a prospective observational cohort. We used voxelwise lesion symptom mapping to test for an association between spasms and tuber location. We then used lesion network mapping to test for an association between spasms and connectivity with tuber locations. Finally, we tested the discriminability of identified associations with logistic regression and cross‐validation as well as statistical mediation.


Results
Tuber locations associated with infantile spasms were heterogenous, and no single location was significantly associated with spasms. However, &amp;gt;95% of tuber locations associated with spasms were functionally connected to the globi pallidi and cerebellar vermis. These connections were specific compared to tubers in patients without spasms. Logistic regression found that globus pallidus connectivity was a stronger predictor of spasms (odds ratio [OR] = 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10–3.50, p = 0.02) than tuber burden (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 0.90–3.04, p = 0.11), with a mean receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.73 (±0.1) during repeated cross‐validation.


Interpretation
Connectivity between tuber locations and the bilateral globi pallidi is associated with infantile spasms. Our findings lend insight into spasm pathophysiology and may identify patients at risk. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: The Effect of Spinal Cord Stimulation Frequency on the Neural Response and Perceived Sensation in Patients With Chronic Pain</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;The effect of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) amplitude on the activation of dorsal column fibres has been widely studied through the recording of Evoked Compound Action Potentials (ECAPs), the sum of all action potentials elicited by an electrical stimulus applied to the fibres. ECAP amplitude grows linearly with stimulus current after a threshold, and a larger ECAP results in a stronger stimulus sensation for patients. This study investigates the effect of stimulus frequency on both the ECAP amplitude as well as the perceived stimulus sensation in patients undergoing SCS therapy for chronic back and/or leg pain.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Patients suffering with chronic neuropathic lower-back and/or lower-limb pain undergoing an epidural SCS trial were recruited. Patients were implanted according to standard practice, having two 8-contact leads (8 mm inter-electrode spacing) which overlapped 2–4 contacts around the T9/T10 interspace. Both lead together thus spanning about three vertebral levels. Neurophysiological recordings were taken during the patient’s trial phase at two routine follow-ups using a custom external stimulator capable of recording ECAPs in real-time from all non-stimulating contacts. Stimulation was performed at various vertebral levels, varying the frequency (ranging from 2 to 455 Hz) while all other stimulating variables were kept constant. During the experiments subjects were asked to rate the stimulation-induced sensation (paraesthesia) on a scale from 0 to 10.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Frequency response curves showed an inverse relationship between stimulation sensation strength and ECAP amplitude, with higher frequencies generating smaller ECAPs but stronger stimulation-induced paraesthesia (at constant stimulation amplitude). Both relationships followed logarithmic trends against stimulus frequency meaning that the effects on ECAP amplitude and sensation are larger for smaller frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This work supports the hypothesis that SCS-induced paraesthesia is conveyed through both frequency coding and population coding, fitting known psychophysics of tactile sensory information processing. The inverse relationship between ECAP amplitude and sensation for increasing frequencies at fixed stimulus amplitude questions common assumptions of monotonic relationships between ECAP amplitude and sensation strength.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have overlapping symptoms, and accurate differential diagnosis is important for targeted intervention and treatment. Previous studies suggest that the deep learning (DL) techniques have the potential to solve the differential diagnosis problem of FTD, AD and normal controls (NCs), but its performance is still unclear. In addition, existing DL-assisted diagnostic studies still rely on hypothesis-based expert-level preprocessing. On the one hand, it imposes high requirements on clinicians and data themselves; On the other hand, it hinders the backtracking of classification results to the original image data, resulting in the classification results cannot be interpreted intuitively. In the current study, a large cohort of 3D T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes (n = 4,099) was collected from two publicly available databases, i.e., the ADNI and the NIFD. We trained a DL-based network directly based on raw T1 images to classify FTD, AD and corresponding NCs. And we evaluated the convergence speed, differential diagnosis ability, robustness and generalizability under nine scenarios. The proposed network yielded an accuracy of 91.83% based on the most common T1-weighted sequence [magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE)]. The knowledge learned by the DL network through multiple classification tasks can also be used to solve subproblems, and the knowledge is generalizable and not limited to a specified dataset. Furthermore, we applied a gradient visualization algorithm based on guided backpropagation to calculate the contribution graph, which tells us intuitively why the DL-based networks make each decision. The regions making valuable contributions to FTD were more widespread in the right frontal white matter regions, while the left temporal, bilateral inferior frontal and parahippocampal regions were contributors to the classification of AD. Our results demonstrated that DL-based networks have the ability to solve the enigma of differential diagnosis of diseases without any hypothesis-based preprocessing. Moreover, they may mine the potential patterns that may be different from human clinicians, which may provide new insight into the understanding of FTD and AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies show that fibrinogen plays a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which may be crucial to neurovascular damage and cognitive impairment. However, there are few clinical studies on the relationship between fibrinogen and AD. 59 &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-PiB-PET diagnosed AD patients and 76 age- and gender-matched cognitively normal controls were included to analyze the correlation between plasma β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau levels with fibrinogen levels. 35 AD patients and 76 controls with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were included to further analyze the correlation between CSF Aβ and tau levels with fibrinogen levels. In AD patients, plasma fibrinogen levels were positively correlated with plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels, and negatively correlated with CSF Aβ42 levels. Besides, fibrinogen levels were positively correlated with CSF total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau) levels and positively correlated with the indicators of Aβ deposition in the brain, such as t-tau/Aβ42, p-tau/Aβ42 levels. In normal people, fibrinogen levels lack correlation with Aβ and tau levels in plasma and CSF. This study suggests that plasma fibrinogen levels are positively correlated with Aβ levels in the plasma and brain in AD patients. Fibrinogen may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Edge-Aware Pyramidal Deformable Network for Unsupervised Registration of Brain MR Images</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.620235</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deformable image registration is of essential important for clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. However, most existing registration solutions require separate rigid alignment before deformable registration, and may not well handle the large deformation circumstances. We propose a novel edge-aware pyramidal deformable network (referred as EPReg) for unsupervised volumetric registration. Specifically, we propose to fully exploit the useful complementary information from the multi-level feature pyramids to predict multi-scale displacement fields. Such coarse-to-fine estimation facilitates the progressive refinement of the predicted registration field, which enables our network to handle large deformations between volumetric data. In addition, we integrate edge information with the original images as dual-inputs, which enhances the texture structures of image content, to impel the proposed network pay extra attention to the edge-aware information for structure alignment. The efficacy of our EPReg was extensively evaluated on three public brain MRI datasets including Mindboggle101, LPBA40, and IXI30. Experiments demonstrate our EPReg consistently outperformed several cutting-edge methods with respect to the metrics of Dice index (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), and average symmetric surface distance (ASSD). The proposed EPReg is a general solution for the problem of deformable volumetric registration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Interaction Between Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Retinal Degenerative Microenvironment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Retinal degenerative diseases (RDDs) are a group of diseases contributing to irreversible vision loss with yet limited therapies. Stem cell-based therapy is a promising novel therapeutic approach in RDD treatment. Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a leading cell source due to their neurotrophic and immunomodulatory capabilities, limited ethical concerns, and low risk of tumor formation. Several pre-clinical studies have shown that MSCs have the potential to delay retinal degeneration, and recent clinical trials have demonstrated promising safety profiles for the application of MSCs in retinal disease. However, some of the clinical-stage MSC therapies have been unable to meet primary efficacy end points, and severe side effects were reported in some retinal “stem cell” clinics. In this review, we provide an update of the interaction between MSCs and the RDD microenvironment and discuss how to balance the therapeutic potential and safety concerns of MSCs' ocular application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Nogo-C Inhibits Peripheral Nerve Regeneration by Regulating Schwann Cell Apoptosis and Dedifferentiation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.616258</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.616258</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;While Nogo protein demonstrably inhibits nerve regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), its effect on Schwann cells in peripheral nerve repair and regeneration following sciatic nerve injury remains unknown. In this research, We assessed the post-injury expression of Nogo-C in an experimental mouse model of sciatic nerve-crush injury. Nogo-C knockout (Nogo-C&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) mouse was generated to observe the effect of Nogo-C on sciatic nerve regeneration, Schwann cell apoptosis, and myelin disintegration after nerve injury, and the effects of Nogo-C on apoptosis and dedifferentiation of Schwann cells were observed in vitro. We found that the expression of Nogo-C protein at the distal end of the injured sciatic nerve increased in wild type (WT) mice. Compared with the injured WT mice, the proportion of neuronal apoptosis was significantly diminished and the myelin clearance rate was significantly elevated in injured Nogo-C&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice; the number of nerve fibers regenerated and the degree of myelination were significantly elevated in Nogo-C&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice on Day 14 after injury. In addition, the recovery of motor function was significantly accelerated in the injured Nogo-C&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. The overexpression of Nogo-C in primary Schwann cells using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer promoted Schwann cells apoptosis. Nogo-C significantly reduced the ratio of c-Jun/krox-20 expression, indicating its inhibition of Schwann cell dedifferentiation. Above all, we hold the view that the expression of Nogo-C increases following peripheral nerve injury to promote Schwann cell apoptosis and inhibit Schwann cell dedifferentiation, thereby inhibiting peripheral nerve regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Alterations of Iron Level in the Bilateral Basal Ganglia Region in Patients With Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.608058</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.608058</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background and Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the changes of iron level using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in the bilateral basal ganglia region in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) patients with long-term ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty-seven healthy controls and nine patients with MCAO were recruited, and their QSM images were obtained. The bilateral caudate nucleus (Cd), putamen (Pt), and globus pallidus (Gp) were selected as the regions of interest (ROIs). Susceptibility values of bilateral ROIs were calculated and compared between the affected side and unaffected side in patients with MCAO and between patients with MCAO and healthy controls. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to evaluate the diagnostic capability of susceptibility values in differentiating healthy controls and patients with MCAO by the area under the curve (AUC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The susceptibility values of bilateral Cd were asymmetric in healthy controls; however, this asymmetry disappeared in patients with MCAO. In addition, compared with healthy controls, the average susceptibility values of the bilateral Pt in patients with MCAO were increased (P &amp;lt; 0.05), and the average susceptibility value of the bilateral Gp was decreased (P &amp;lt; 0.05). ROC curves showed that the susceptibility values of the Pt and Gp had a larger AUC (AUC = 0.700 and 0.889, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: As measured by QSM, the iron levels of the bilateral basal ganglia region were significantly changed in patients with MCAO. Iron dyshomeostasis in the basal ganglia region might be involved in the pathophysiological process of middle cerebral artery stenosis and occlusion. These findings may provide a novel insight to profoundly address the pathophysiological mechanisms of MCAO.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Effects of Long-Term Meditation Practices on Sensorimotor Rhythm-Based Brain-Computer Interface Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.584971</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.584971</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensorimotor rhythm (SMR)-based brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) provide an alternative pathway for users to perform motor control using motor imagery. Despite the non-invasiveness, ease of use, and low cost, this kind of BCI has limitations due to long training times and BCI inefficiency—that is, the SMR BCI control paradigm may not work well on a subpopulation of users. Meditation is a mental training method to improve mindfulness and awareness and is reported to have positive effects on one’s mental state. Here, we investigated the behavioral and electrophysiological differences between experienced meditators and meditation naïve subjects in one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) cursor control tasks. We found numerical evidence that meditators outperformed control subjects in both tasks (1D and 2D), and there were fewer BCI inefficient subjects in the meditator group. Finally, we also explored the neurophysiological difference between the two groups and showed that the meditators had a higher resting SMR predictor, more stable resting mu rhythm, and a larger control signal contrast than controls during the task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: The Effects of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy on Spastic Muscle of the Wrist Joint in Stroke Survivors: Evidence From Neuromechanical Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.580762</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.580762</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: This study combined neuromechanical modeling analysis, muscle tone measurement from mechanical indentation and electrical impedance myography to assess the neural and peripheral contribution to spasticity post stroke at wrist joint. It also investigated the training effects and explored the underlying mechanism of radial extracorporeal shock wave (rESW) on spasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: People with first occurrence of stroke were randomly allocated to rESW intervention or control group. The intervention group received one session of rESW therapy, followed by routine therapy which was the same frequency and intensity as the control group. Outcome measures were: (1) NeuroFlexor method measured neural component (NC), elastic component (EC) and viscosity component (VC), and (2) myotonometer measured muscle tone (F) and stiffness (S), (3) electrical impedance myography measured resistance (R), reactance (X) and phase angle (θ); (4) modified Asworth scale; (5) Fugl Meyer Upper limb scale. All outcome measures were recorded at baseline, immediately post rESW and at 1-week follow-up. The differences between the paretic and non-paretic side were assessed by t-test. The effectiveness of rESW treatment were analyzed by repeated-measures one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at different time points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Twenty-seven participants completed the study. NC, EC, and VC of the Neuroflexor method, F and S from myotonometer were all significantly higher on the paretic side than those from the non-paretic side. R, X, and θ from electrical impedance were significantly lower on the paretic side than the non-paretic side. Immediately after rESW intervention, VC, F, and S were significantly reduced, and X was significantly increased. The clinical scores showed improvements immediate post rESW and at 1-week follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The observed changes in upper limb muscle properties adds further support to the theory that both the neural and peripheral components play a role in muscle spasticity. ESW intervention may be more effective in addressing the peripheral component of spasticity in terms of muscle mechanical properties changes. The clinical management of post stroke spasticity should take into consideration of both the neural and non-neural factors in order to identify optimal intervention regime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Formulation of the Challenges in Brain-Computer Interfaces as Optimization Problems—A Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.546656</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.546656</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the common modalities of monitoring the mental activities. Owing to the non-invasive availability of this system, its applicability has seen remarkable developments beyond medical use-cases. One such use case is brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Such systems require the usage of high resolution-based multi-channel EEG devices so that the data collection spans multiple locations of the brain like the occipital, frontal, temporal, and so on. This results in huge data (with high sampling rates) and with multiple EEG channels with inherent artifacts. Several challenges exist in analyzing data of this nature, for instance, selecting the optimal number of EEG channels or deciding what best features to rely on for achieving better performance. The selection of these variables is complicated and requires a lot of domain knowledge and non-invasive EEG monitoring, which is not feasible always. Hence, optimization serves to be an easy to access tool in deriving such parameters. Considerable efforts in formulating these issues as an optimization problem have been laid. As a result, various multi-objective and constrained optimization functions have been developed in BCI that has achieved reliable outcomes in device control like neuro-prosthetic arms, application control, gaming, and so on. This paper makes an attempt to study the usage of optimization techniques in formulating the issues in BCI. The outcomes, challenges, and major observations of these approaches are discussed in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Resting State Functional Connectivity of Brain With Electroconvulsive Therapy in Depression: Meta-Analysis to Understand Its Mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.616054</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.616054</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a commonly used brain stimulation treatment for treatment-resistant or severe depression. This study was planned to find the effects of ECT on brain connectivity by conducting a systematic review and coordinate-based meta-analysis of the studies performing resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) in patients with depression receiving ECT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We systematically searched the databases published up to July 31, 2020, for studies in patients having depression that compared resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) before and after a course of pulse wave ECT. Meta-analysis was performed using the activation likelihood estimation method after extracting details about coordinates, voxel size, and method for correction of multiple comparisons corresponding to the significant clusters and the respective rsFC analysis measure with its method of extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Among 41 articles selected for full-text review, 31 articles were included in the systematic review. Among them, 13 articles were included in the meta-analysis, and a total of 73 foci of 21 experiments were examined using activation likelihood estimation in 10 sets. Using the cluster-level interference method, one voxel-wise analysis with the measure of amplitude of low frequency fluctuations and one seed-voxel analysis with the right hippocampus showed a significant reduction (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) in the left cingulate gyrus (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) and a significant increase (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) in the right hippocampus with the right parahippocampal gyrus, respectively. Another analysis with the studies implementing network-wise (posterior default mode network: dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) resting state functional connectivity showed a significant increase (p &amp;lt; 0.001) in bilateral posterior cingulate cortex. There was considerable variability as well as a few key deficits in the preprocessing and analysis of the neuroimages and the reporting of results in the included studies. Due to lesser studies, we could not do further analysis to address the neuroimaging variability and subject-related differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The brain regions noted in this meta-analysis are reasonably specific and distinguished, and they had significant changes in resting state functional connectivity after a course of ECT for depression. More studies with better neuroimaging standards should be conducted in the future to confirm these results in different subgroups of depression and with varied aspects of ECT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Functional MRI Paradigm for Efficient Mapping of Memory Encoding Across Sensory Conditions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.591721</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.591721</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a new and time-efficient memory-encoding paradigm for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This paradigm is optimized for mapping multiple contrasts using a mixed design, using auditory (environmental/vocal) and visual (scene/face) stimuli. We demonstrate that the paradigm evokes robust neuronal activity in typical sensory and memory networks. We were able to detect auditory and visual sensory-specific encoding activities in auditory and visual cortices. Also, we detected stimulus-selective activation in environmental-, voice-, scene-, and face-selective brain regions (parahippocampal place and fusiform face area). A subsequent recognition task allowed the detection of sensory-specific encoding success activity (ESA) in both auditory and visual cortices, as well as sensory-unspecific positive ESA in the hippocampus. Further, sensory-unspecific negative ESA was observed in the precuneus. Among others, the parallel mixed design enabled sustained and transient activity comparison in contrast to rest blocks. Sustained and transient activations showed great overlap in most sensory brain regions, whereas several regions, typically associated with the default-mode network, showed transient rather than sustained deactivation. We also show that the use of a parallel mixed model had relatively little influence on positive or negative ESA. Together, these results demonstrate a feasible, versatile, and brief memory-encoding task, which includes multiple sensory stimuli to guarantee a comprehensive measurement. This task is especially suitable for large-scale clinical or population studies, which aim to test task-evoked sensory-specific and sensory-unspecific memory-encoding performance as well as broad sensory activity across the life span within a very limited time frame.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: An Evolutionary Perspective of Dyslexia, Stress, and Brain Network Homeostasis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.575546</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.575546</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evolution fuels interindividual variability in neuroplasticity, reflected in brain anatomy and functional connectivity of the expanding neocortical regions subserving reading ability. Such variability is orchestrated by an evolutionarily conserved, competitive balance between epigenetic, stress-induced, and cognitive-growth gene expression programs. An evolutionary developmental model of dyslexia, suggests that prenatal and childhood subclinical stress becomes a risk factor for dyslexia when physiological adaptations to stress promoting adaptive fitness, may attenuate neuroplasticity in the brain regions recruited for reading. Stress has the potential to blunt the cognitive-growth functions of the predominantly right hemisphere Ventral and Dorsal attention networks, which are primed with high entropic levels of synaptic plasticity, and are critical for acquiring beginning reading skills. The attentional networks, in collaboration with the stress-responsive Default Mode network, modulate the entrainment and processing of the low frequency auditory oscillations (1–8 Hz) and visuospatial orienting linked etiologically to dyslexia. Thus, dyslexia may result from positive, but costly adaptations to stress system dysregulation: protective measures that reset the stress/growth balance of processing to favor the Default Mode network, compromising development of the attentional networks. Such a normal-variability conceptualization of dyslexia is at odds with the frequent assumption that dyslexia results from a neurological abnormality. To put the normal-variability model in the broader perspective of the state of the field, a traditional evolutionary account of dyslexia is presented to stimulate discussion of the scientific merits of the two approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Examination of the Neural Correlates of Cognitive Shifting in Dimensional Change Card Sort Task</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561223</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561223</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study aims to examine the neural correlates of cognitive shifting during the Dimensional Change Card Sort Task (DCCS) task with functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Altogether 49 children completed the DCCS tasks, and 25 children (M&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 68.66, SD = 5.3) passing all items were classified into the Switch group. Twenty children (M&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 62.05, SD = 8.13) committing more than one perseverative errors were grouped into the Perseverate group. The Switch group had Brodmann Area (BA) 9 and 10 activated in the pre-switch period and BA 6, 9, 10, 40, and 44 in the post-switch period. In contrast, the Perseverate group had BA 9 and 10 activated in the pre-switch period and BA 8, 9, 10 in the post-switch period. The general linear model results afford strong support to the “V-shape curve” hypothesis by identifying a significant decrease–increase cycle in BA 9 and 44, the neural correlations of cognitive shifting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Alzheimer’s Disease Projection From Normal to Mild Dementia Reflected in Functional Network Connectivity: A Longitudinal Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.593263</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.593263</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common age-related problem and progresses in different stages, including mild cognitive impairment (early stage), mild dementia (middle-stage), and severe dementia (late-stage). Recent studies showed changes in functional network connectivity obtained from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) during the transition from healthy aging to AD. By assuming that the brain interaction is static during the scanning time, most prior studies are focused on static functional or functional network connectivity (sFNC). Dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) explores temporal patterns of functional connectivity and provides additional information to its static counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;We used longitudinal rs-fMRI from 1385 scans (from 910 subjects) at different stages of AD (from normal to very mild AD or vmAD). We used group-independent component analysis (group-ICA) and extracted 53 maximally independent components (ICs) for the whole brain. Next, we used a sliding-window approach to estimate dFNC from the extracted 53 ICs, then group them into 3 different brain states using a clustering method. Then, we estimated a hidden Markov model (HMM) and the occupancy rate (OCR) for each subject. Finally, we investigated the link between the clinical rate of each subject with state-specific FNC, OCR, and HMM.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;All states showed significant disruption during progression normal brain to vmAD one. Specifically, we found that subcortical network, auditory network, visual network, sensorimotor network, and cerebellar network connectivity decrease in vmAD compared with those of a healthy brain. We also found reorganized patterns (i.e., both increases and decreases) in the cognitive control network and default mode network connectivity by progression from normal to mild dementia. Similarly, we found a reorganized pattern of between-network connectivity when the brain transits from normal to mild dementia. However, the connectivity between visual and sensorimotor network connectivity decreases in vmAD compared with that of a healthy brain. Finally, we found a normal brain spends more time in a state with higher connectivity between visual and sensorimotor networks.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our results showed the temporal and spatial pattern of whole-brain FNC differentiates AD form healthy control and suggested substantial disruptions across multiple dynamic states. In more detail, our results suggested that the sensory network is affected more than other brain network, and default mode network is one of the last brain networks get affected by AD In addition, abnormal patterns of whole-brain dFNC were identified in the early stage of AD, and some abnormalities were correlated with the clinical score.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This mini-review focuses on the emergence of locomotor-related movements in early infancy. In particular, we consider multiples precursor behaviors of locomotion as a manifestation of the development of the neuronal networks and their link in the establishment of precocious locomotor skills. Despite the large variability of motor behavior observed in human babies, as in animals, afferent information is already processed to shape the behavior to specific situations and environments. Specifically, we argue that the closed-loop interaction between the neural output and the physical dynamics of the mechanical system should be considered to explore the complexity and flexibility of pattern generation in human and animal neonates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Attenuation of Native Hyperpolarization-Activated, Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channel Function by the Volatile Anesthetic Sevoflurane in Mouse Thalamocortical Relay Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As thalamocortical relay neurons are ascribed a crucial role in signal propagation and information processing, they have attracted considerable attention as potential targets for anesthetic modulation. In this study, we analyzed the effects of different concentrations of sevoflurane on the excitability of thalamocortical relay neurons and hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic-nucleotide gated (HCN) channels, which play a decisive role in regulating membrane properties and rhythmic oscillatory activity. The effects of sevoflurane on single-cell excitability and native HCN channels were investigated in acutely prepared brain slices from adult wild-type mice with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, using voltage-clamp and current-clamp protocols. Sevoflurane dose-dependently depressed membrane biophysics and HCN-mediated parameters of neuronal excitability. Respective half-maximal inhibitory and effective concentrations ranged between 0.30 (95% CI, 0.18–0.50) mM and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.40–2.20) mM. We witnessed a pronounced reduction of HCN dependent I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; current amplitude starting at a concentration of 0.45 mM [relative change at −133 mV; 0.45 mM sevoflurane: 0.85 (interquartile range, 0.79–0.92), n = 12, p = 0.011; 1.47 mM sevoflurane: 0.37 (interquartile range, 0.34–0.62), n = 5, p &amp;lt; 0.001] with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.40–2.20) mM. In contrast, effects on voltage-dependent channel gating were modest with significant changes only occurring at 1.47 mM [absolute change of half-maximal activation potential; 1.47 mM: −7.2 (interquartile range, −10.3 to −5.8) mV, n = 5, p = 0.020]. In this study, we demonstrate that sevoflurane inhibits the excitability of thalamocortical relay neurons in a concentration-dependent manner within a clinically relevant range. Especially concerning its effects on native HCN channel function, our findings indicate substance-specific differences in comparison to other anesthetic agents. Considering the importance of HCN channels, the observed effects might mechanistically contribute to the hypnotic properties of sevoflurane.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Accurate Neuronal Soma Segmentation Using 3D Multi-Task Learning U-Shaped Fully Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal soma segmentation is a crucial step for the quantitative analysis of neuronal morphology. Automated neuronal soma segmentation methods have opened up the opportunity to improve the time-consuming manual labeling required during the neuronal soma morphology reconstruction for large-scale images. However, the presence of touching neuronal somata and variable soma shapes in images brings challenges for automated algorithms. This study proposes a neuronal soma segmentation method combining 3D U-shaped fully convolutional neural networks with multi-task learning. Compared to existing methods, this technique applies multi-task learning to predict the soma boundary to split touching somata, and adopts U-shaped architecture convolutional neural network which is effective for a limited dataset. The contour-aware multi-task learning framework is applied to the proposed method to predict the masks of neuronal somata and boundaries simultaneously. In addition, a spatial attention module is embedded into the multi-task model to improve neuronal soma segmentation results. The Nissl-stained dataset captured by the micro-optical sectioning tomography system is used to validate the proposed method. Following comparison to four existing segmentation models, the proposed method outperforms the others notably in both localization and segmentation. The novel method has potential for high-throughput neuronal soma segmentation in large-scale optical imaging data for neuron morphology quantitative analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mini Review: Correlations of Cognitive Domains With Cerebrospinal Fluid α-Synuclein Levels in Patients With Parkinson's Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The level of α-synuclein, a component of Lewy bodies, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in Parkinson's disease (PD) has attracted recent attention. Most meta-analyses conclude that CSF levels of α-synuclein are decreased in PD. Patients with PD present with cognitive impairment, including frontal/executive dysfunction in the early phase and later emergence of visuospatial and mnemonic deficits. To examine whether CSF α-synuclein levels reflect the activities of various cognitive domains, we reviewed reports examining the association of these levels with cognitive performance in each domain in PD. Among 13 cross-sectional studies, five showed that a lower CSF α-synuclein level was associated with worse cognitive function. In four of these five reports, frontal/executive function showed this association, suggesting a link of the pathophysiology with Lewy bodies. In three other reports, a higher CSF α-synuclein level was associated with temporal-parieto-occipital cognitive deterioration such as memory. In the other five reports, the CSF α-synuclein level did not correlate with cognitive performance for any domain. In four longitudinal studies, a higher baseline CSF α-synuclein level was associated with a worse cognitive outcome, including cognitive processing speed, visuospatial function and memory in two, but not with any cognitive outcome in the other two. The different associations may reflect the heterogeneous pathophysiology in PD, including different pathogenic proteins, neurotransmitters. Thus, more studies of the association between cognitive domains and CSF levels of pathogenic proteins are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.607685</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this review article is to provide a resource for longitudinal studies, using animal models, directed at understanding and modifying the relationship between cognition and brain structure and function throughout life. We propose that forthcoming longitudinal studies will build upon a wealth of knowledge gleaned from prior cross-sectional designs to identify early predictors of variability in cognitive function during aging, and characterize fundamental neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the vulnerability to, and the trajectory of, cognitive decline. Finally, we present examples of biological measures that may differentiate mechanisms of the cognitive reserve at the molecular, cellular, and network level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;A histological study of the song system of the carrion crow (Corvus corone)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/99b89b99-cea3-424f-a77b-ad476308655b/cne25112-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The song system of songbirds (oscines) is one of the best explored neuroethological model systems. The study presents a histological investigation of the nuclei of the extended song system of the carrion crow (&lt;i&gt;Corvus corone&lt;/i&gt;), a songbird of the corvid family that has become an interesting model system for cognitive neuroscience.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The song system of songbirds (oscines) is one of the best studied neuroethological model systems. So far, it has been treated as a relatively constrained sensorimotor system. Some songbirds, however, are also known for their capability to cognitively control their audio‐vocal system. Yet, the neuroanatomy of the corvid song system has never been explored systematically. We aim to close this scientific gap by presenting a stereotactic investigation of the extended song system of the carrion crow (&lt;i&gt;Corvus corone&lt;/i&gt;), an oscine songbird of the corvid family that has become an interesting model system for cognitive neuroscience. In order to identify and delineate the song nuclei, the ascending auditory nuclei, and the descending vocal‐motor nuclei, four stains were applied. In addition to the classical Nissl‐, myelin‐, and a combination of Nissl‐and‐myelin staining, staining for tyrosine hydroxylase was used to reveal the distribution of catecholaminergic neurons (dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and adrenergic) in the song system. We show that the crow brain contains the important song‐related nuclei, including auditory input and motor output structures, and map them throughout the brain. Fiber‐stained sections reveal putative connection patterns between the crow’s song nuclei comparable to other songbirds.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Functional alterations of retinal neurons and vascular involvement progress simultaneously in the Psammomys obesus model of diabetic retinopathy</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Functional alterations of retinal neurons and vascular involvement progress simultaneously in the Psammomys obesus model of diabetic retinopathy&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a606b315-2b0c-4c83-98ce-c01eeec9eb20/cne25114-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diabetic retinopathy in the diurnal rodent &lt;i&gt;Psammomys obesus&lt;/i&gt; is manifested by a functional and structural dysfunction. The functional alteration detected by the decrease of the amplitude of the ERG components over time following the diabetic induction. Whereas the structural dysfunction is evinced by the disruption of retinal architecture and the appearance of exudates at an advanced stage of the disease progression as well as the decrease of the retinal thinness.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in a new diurnal animal model, we monitored clinically the DR in &lt;i&gt;Psammomys obesus (P.obesus)&lt;/i&gt; during 7 months using Electroretinography (ERG) and imaging techniques. After the onset of DR, all ERG components decreased progressively. In scotopic conditions, by 3‐months of disease progression the diabetic &lt;i&gt;P.obesus&lt;/i&gt; displayed a significant decrease in amplitude of b‐max, b‐wave responses and mixed b‐waves. While mixed a‐wave decreased between 4 and 7 months. Significant differences of OP2 appeared following 1 month of disease. In photopic conditions, we noticed a decrease of the a‐wave at 2 months, while it took more than 5 months in b‐wave amplitude. The PhNR and the i‐wave amplitudes decreased following 4 and 5 months. OP1 and OP2 were the first to be altered and a significant decrease in the amplitude started after 3 months. Finally, 30 Hz‐flicker and photopic S‐cone were impaired after 2 and 3 months, respectively. The assessment of the eye fundus of the retina revealed an abnormal vascular architecture appeared at months 6 and 7. In addition, we noticed exudates in the superior periphery of the retina at the same stage. The retina thickness showed a significant reduction at month 7. Our results indicate that the clinical correlates of human DR are present in diabetic &lt;i&gt;P.obesus.&lt;/i&gt; The depressed of ERGs, disruption of retinal architecture and the appearance of exudates may reflect vascular and neuronal damage throughout the retina as are seen in the advanced stages of human DR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expression patterns of all CRH/UCN family genes have not been thoroughly described in any fish species. In a highly social cichlid fish, &lt;i&gt;Astatotilapia burtoni&lt;/i&gt;, we used in situ hybridization to map mRNA expression patterns of &lt;i&gt;crhb&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;uts1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ucn2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ucn3&lt;/i&gt;. Phylogenetic analyses revealed evolutionary relationships and novel urocortin orthologs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corticotropin‐releasing hormone and urocortin family of peptides consists of five members in many vertebrates: CRH (&lt;i&gt;crha&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;crhb&lt;/i&gt; in teleosts), CRH2, UCN/UTS1, UCN2, and UCN3. These genes differ in expression pattern, as well as receptor affinity, allowing them to serve a wide range of functions in a variety of species. To better understand the roles of these genes in a single species, we examined their expression patterns in the cichlid fish &lt;i&gt;Astatotilapia burtoni&lt;/i&gt;. In situ hybridization to map mRNA expression patterns of &lt;i&gt;crhb&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;uts1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ucn2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ucn3&lt;/i&gt; in the brain revealed conserved and distinct spatial features of expression. &lt;i&gt;crhb&lt;/i&gt;‐ and &lt;i&gt;uts1&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing cells were the most broadly expressed, with several areas of co‐regionalization. &lt;i&gt;ucn3&lt;/i&gt; was less abundant but found in discrete regions throughout the extent of the brain, with high expression in the cerebellum, while &lt;i&gt;ucn2&lt;/i&gt; was restricted to only a few areas. RT‐PCR showed that while &lt;i&gt;crhb, uts1,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ucn3&lt;/i&gt; are found in several body tissues and widespread throughout the brain, &lt;i&gt;ucn2&lt;/i&gt; is quite restricted in the brain, and &lt;i&gt;crha&lt;/i&gt; is only expressed in the eye. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses identified detailed relationships and novel orthologs in the urocortin family. We found evidence for a UCN2 gene loss in some reptiles. Our detailed description of the complete family of genes in the central nervous system of a model organism will inform future studies on the function of these genes in &lt;i&gt;A. burtoni&lt;/i&gt;, and provides a foundation for comparative studies with teleosts and other vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Aggregative cycles evolve as a solution to conflicts in social investment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Leonardo Miele, Silvia De Monte&lt;/p&gt;

Multicellular organization is particularly vulnerable to conflicts between different cell types when the body forms from initially isolated cells, as in aggregative multicellular microbes. Like other functions of the multicellular phase, coordinated collective movement can be undermined by conflicts between cells that spend energy in fuelling motion and ‘cheaters’ that get carried along. The evolutionary stability of collective behaviours against such conflicts is typically addressed in populations that undergo extrinsically imposed phases of aggregation and dispersal. Here, via a shift in perspective, we propose that aggregative multicellular cycles may have emerged as a way to temporally compartmentalize social conflicts. Through an eco-evolutionary mathematical model that accounts for individual and collective strategies of resource acquisition, we address regimes where different motility types coexist. Particularly interesting is the oscillatory regime that, similarly to life cycles of aggregative multicellular organisms, alternates on the timescale of several cell generations phases of prevalent solitary living and starvation-triggered aggregation. Crucially, such self-organized oscillations emerge as a result of evolution of cell traits associated to conflict escalation within multicellular aggregates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JHMnwc2zVAQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Estimating and interpreting secondary attack risk: Binomial considered biased</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008601</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yushuf Sharker, Eben Kenah&lt;/p&gt;

The household secondary attack risk (SAR), often called the secondary attack rate or secondary infection risk, is the probability of infectious contact from an infectious household member &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; to a given household member &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;, where we define infectious contact to be a contact sufficient to infect &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; if he or she is susceptible. Estimation of the SAR is an important part of understanding and controlling the transmission of infectious diseases. In practice, it is most often estimated using binomial models such as logistic regression, which implicitly attribute all secondary infections in a household to the primary case. In the simplest case, the number of secondary infections in a household with &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; susceptibles and a single primary case is modeled as a binomial(&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;) random variable where &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; is the SAR. Although it has long been understood that transmission within households is not binomial, it is thought that multiple generations of transmission can be neglected safely when &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; is small. We use probability generating functions and simulations to show that this is a mistake. The proportion of susceptible household members infected can be substantially larger than the SAR even when &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; is small. As a result, binomial estimates of the SAR are biased upward and their confidence intervals have poor coverage probabilities even if adjusted for clustering. Accurate point and interval estimates of the SAR can be obtained using longitudinal chain binomial models or pairwise survival analysis, which account for multiple generations of transmission within households, the ongoing risk of infection from outside the household, and incomplete follow-up. We illustrate the practical implications of these results in an analysis of household surveillance data collected by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4DK-2-pneSA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A streaming assembly pipeline utilising real-time Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing data is important for saving sequencing resources and reducing time-to-result. A previous approach implemented in npScarf provided an efficient streaming algorithm for hybrid assembly but was relatively prone to mis-assemblies compared to other graph-based methods. Here we present npGraph, a streaming hybrid assembly tool using the assembly graph instead of the separated pre-assembly contigs. It is able to produce more complete genome assembly by resolving the path finding problem on the assembly graph using long reads as the traversing guide. Application to synthetic and real data from bacterial isolate genomes show improved accuracy while still maintaining a low computational cost. npGraph also provides a graphical user interface (GUI) which provides a real-time visualisation of the progress of assembly. The tool and source code is available at https://github.com/hsnguyen/assembly.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/U6WB6NiFkuM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Experimental Zika virus infection in non-human primates results in acute viral load dynamics that can be well-described by mathematical models. The inoculum dose that would be received in a natural infection setting is likely lower than the experimental infections and how this difference affects the viral dynamics and immune response is unclear. Here we study a dataset of experimental infection of non-human primates with a range of doses of Zika virus. We develop new models of infection incorporating both an innate immune response and viral interference with that response. We find that such a model explains the data better than models with no interaction between virus and the immune response. We also find that larger inoculum doses lead to faster dynamics of infection, but approximately the same total amount of viral production.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_E57eoRutSA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Extra‐striatal dopamine in Parkinson's disease with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/be9dddb8-c5df-43c8-a6e3-eec80b589a02/jnr24779-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This PET study characterized D2 receptor (D2R) availability within extra‐striatal regions in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with (+) and without (−) REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). With disease progression, only PD‐RBD+ patients showed steep decline in D2R availability within the left uncus parahippocampus. Beyond the striatum, extra‐striatal dopaminergic system may also contribute to PD‐RBD in advanced stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a common condition found in more than 50% of the patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Molecular imaging shows that PD with RBD (PD‐RBD+) have lower striatal dopamine transporter activity within the caudate and putamen relative to PD without RBD (PD‐RBD−). However, the characterization of the extra‐striatal dopamine within the mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways remains unknown. We aim to elucidate this with PET imaging in 15 PD‐RBD+ and 15 PD‐RBD− patients, while having 15 age‐matched healthy controls (HC). Each participant underwent a single PET scan with [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]FLB‐457 to detect the D2 receptor availability within the extra‐striatal regions of interest (ROI), including the prefrontal, temporal, and limbic areas. [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]FLB‐457 retention was expressed as the nondisplaceable binding potential. Our results reveal that relative to HC, PD‐RBD+ and PD‐RBD− patients have lower levels of D2 receptor availability within the uncus parahippocampus, superior, lateral, and inferior temporal cortex. PD‐RBD+ showed steep decline in D2 receptors within the left uncus parahippocampus with increasing disease severity, but this was not observed for PD‐RBD− patients. Findings imply that extra‐striatal dopaminergic system may play a role in contributing to symptomatic progress in PD patients with RBD. However, validation with more advanced PD patients are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Enhanced GABAergic Inhibition of Cholinergic Interneurons in the zQ175+/− Mouse Model of Huntington's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.626412</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that initially manifests itself in the striatum. How intrastriatal circuitry is altered by the disease is poorly understood. To help fill this gap, the circuitry linking spiny projection neurons (SPNs) to cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) was examined using electrophysiological and optogenetic approaches in ex vivo brain slices from wildtype mice and zQ175&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; models of HD. These studies revealed a severalfold enhancement of GABAergic inhibition of ChIs mediated by collaterals of indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs), but not direct pathway SPNs (dSPNs). This cell-specific alteration in synaptic transmission appeared in parallel with the emergence of motor symptoms in the zQ175&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; model. The adaptation had a presynaptic locus, as it was accompanied by a reduction in paired-pulse ratio but not in the postsynaptic response to GABA. The alterations in striatal GABAergic signaling disrupted spontaneous ChI activity, potentially contributing to the network dysfunction underlying the hyperkinetic phase of HD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Scale-Free Dynamics in Animal Groups and Brain Networks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Collective phenomena fascinate by the emergence of order in systems composed of a myriad of small entities. They are ubiquitous in nature and can be found over a vast range of scales in physical and biological systems. Their key feature is the seemingly effortless emergence of adaptive collective behavior that cannot be trivially explained by the properties of the system's individual components. This perspective focuses on recent insights into the similarities of correlations for two apparently disparate phenomena: flocking in animal groups and neuronal ensemble activity in the brain. We first will summarize findings on the spontaneous organization in bird flocks and macro-scale human brain activity utilizing correlation functions and insights from critical dynamics. We then will discuss recent experimental findings that apply these approaches to the collective response of neurons to visual and motor processing, i.e., to local perturbations of neuronal networks at the meso- and microscale. We show how scale-free correlation functions capture the collective organization of neuronal avalanches in evoked neuronal populations in nonhuman primates and between neurons during visual processing in rodents. These experimental findings suggest that the coherent collective neural activity observed at scales much larger than the length of the direct neuronal interactions is demonstrative of a phase transition and we discuss the experimental support for either discontinuous or continuous phase transitions. We conclude that at or near a phase-transition neuronal information can propagate in the brain with similar efficiency as proposed to occur in the collective adaptive response observed in some animal groups.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Chronic Intermittent Hypobaric Hypoxia Restores Hippocampus Function and Rescues Cognitive Impairments in Chronic Epileptic Rats via Wnt/β-catenin Signaling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a complex neurological disorder with frequent psychiatric, cognitive, and social comorbidities in addition to recurrent seizures. Cognitive impairment, one of the most common comorbidities, has severe adverse effects on quality of life. Chronic intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (CIHH) has demonstrated neuroprotective efficacy in several neurological disease models. In the present study, we examined the effects of CIHH on cognition and hippocampal function in chronic epileptic rats. CIHH treatment rescued deficits in spatial and object memory, hippocampal neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity in pilocarpine-treated epileptic rats. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway has been implicated in neural stem cell proliferation and synapse development, and Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibition effectively blocked the neurogenic effects of CIHH. Our findings indicate that CIHH rescues cognitive deficits in epileptic rats via Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation. This study establishes CIHH and Wnt/β-catenin pathway regulators as potential treatments for epilepsy- induced cognitive impairments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Ambroxol Upregulates Glucocerebrosidase Expression to Promote Neural Stem Cells Differentiation Into Neurons Through Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway After Ischemic Stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke has been becoming one of the leading causes resulting in mortality and adult long-term disability worldwide. Post-stroke pneumonia is a common complication in patients with ischemic stroke and always associated with 1-year mortality. Though ambroxol therapy often serves as a supplementary treatment for post-stroke pneumonia in ischemic stroke patients, its effect on functional recovery and potential mechanism after ischemic stroke remain elusive. In the present study, the results indicated that administration of 70 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg enhanced functional recovery by virtue of decreasing infarct volume. The potential mechanism, to some extent, was due to promoting NSCs differentiation into neurons and interfering NSCs differentiation into astrocytes through increasing GCase expression to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in penumbra after ischemic stroke, which advanced basic knowledge of ambroxol in regulating NSCs differentiation and provided a feasible therapy for ischemic stroke treatment, even in other brain disorders in clinic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Development and Health of Adults Formerly Placed in Infant Care Institutions – Study Protocol of the LifeStories Project</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A growing volume of research from global data demonstrates that institutional care under conditions of deprivation is profoundly damaging to children, particularly during the critical early years of development. However, how these individuals develop over a life course remains unclear. This study uses data from a survey on the health and development of 420 children mostly under the age of three, placed in 12 infant care institutions between 1958 and 1961 in Zurich, Switzerland. The children exhibited significant delays in cognitive, social, and motor development in the first years of life. Moreover, a follow-up of a subsample of 143 children about 10 years later revealed persistent difficulties, including depression, school related-problems, and stereotypies. Between 2019 and 2021, these formerly institutionalized study participants were located through the Swiss population registry and invited to participate once again in the research project. Now in their early sixties, they are studied for their health, further development, and life-course trajectories. A mixed-methods approach using questionnaires, neuropsychological assessments, and narrative biographical interviews was implemented by a multidisciplinary team. Combining prospective and retrospective data with standardized quantitative and biographical qualitative data allows a rich reconstruction of life histories. The availability of a community sample from the same geographic location, the 1954–1961 cohort of the Zurich Longitudinal Studies, described in detail in a paper in this issue (Wehrle et al., 2020), enables comparison with an unaffected cohort. This article describes the study design and study participants in detail and discusses the potential and limitations of a comparison with a community sample. It outlines a set of challenges and solutions encountered in the process of a lifespan longitudinal study from early childhood into the cusp of old age with a potentially vulnerable sample and summarizes the lessons learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Animal Models for Anorexia Nervosa—A Systematic Review</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image which usually leads to low caloric intake and hyperactivity. The underlying mechanism and pathogenesis of anorexia nervosa is still poorly understood. In order to learn more about the underlying pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa and to find further possible treatment options, several animal models mimicking anorexia nervosa have been developed. The aim of this review is to systematically search different databases and provide an overview of existing animal models and to discuss the current knowledge gained from animal models of anorexia nervosa. For the systematic data search, the Pubmed—Medline database, Embase database, and Web of Science database were searched. After removal of duplicates and the systematic process of selection, 108 original research papers were included in this systematic review. One hundred and six studies were performed with rodents and 2 on monkeys. Eighteen different animal models for anorexia nervosa were used in these studies. Parameters assessed in many studies were body weight, food intake, physical activity, cessation of the estrous cycle in female animals, behavioral changes, metabolic and hormonal alterations. The most commonly used animal model (75 of the studies) is the activity-based anorexia model in which typically young rodents are exposed to time-reduced access to food (a certain number of hours a day) with unrestricted access to a running wheel. Of the genetic animal models, one that is of particular interest is the anx/anx mice model. Animal models have so far contributed many findings to the understanding of mechanisms of hunger and satiety, physical activity and cognition in an underweight state and other mechanisms relevant for anorexia nervosa in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: BCNNM: A Framework for in silico Neural Tissue Development Modeling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral (“brain”) organoids are high-fidelity in vitro cellular models of the developing brain, which makes them one of the go-to methods to study isolated processes of tissue organization and its electrophysiological properties, allowing to collect invaluable data for in silico modeling neurodevelopmental processes. Complex computer models of biological systems supplement in vivo and in vitro experimentation and allow researchers to look at things that no laboratory study has access to, due to either technological or ethical limitations. In this paper, we present the Biological Cellular Neural Network Modeling (BCNNM) framework designed for building dynamic spatial models of neural tissue organization and basic stimulus dynamics. The BCNNM uses a convenient predicate description of sequences of biochemical reactions and can be used to run complex models of multi-layer neural network formation from a single initial stem cell. It involves processes such as proliferation of precursor cells and their differentiation into mature cell types, cell migration, axon and dendritic tree formation, axon pathfinding and synaptogenesis. The experiment described in this article demonstrates a creation of an in silico cerebral organoid-like structure, constituted of up to 1 million cells, which differentiate and self-organize into an interconnected system with four layers, where the spatial arrangement of layers and cells are consistent with the values of analogous parameters obtained from research on living tissues. Our in silico organoid contains axons and millions of synapses within and between the layers, and it comprises neurons with high density of connections (more than 10). In sum, the BCNNM is an easy-to-use and powerful framework for simulations of neural tissue development that provides a convenient way to design a variety of tractable in silico experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A Hypomorphic Dars1D367Y Model Recapitulates Key Aspects of the Leukodystrophy HBSL</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.625879</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hypomyelination with brain stem and spinal cord involvement and leg spasticity (HBSL) is a leukodystrophy caused by missense mutations of the aspartyl-tRNA synthetase-encoding gene DARS1. The clinical picture includes the regression of acquired motor milestones, spasticity, ataxia, seizures, nystagmus, and intellectual disabilities. Morphologically, HBSL is characterized by a distinct pattern of hypomyelination in the central nervous system including the anterior brainstem, the cerebellar peduncles and the supratentorial white matter as well as the dorsal columns and the lateral corticospinal tracts of the spinal cord. Adequate HBSL animal models are lacking. Dars1 knockout mice are embryonic lethal precluding examination of the etiology. To address this, we introduced the HBSL-causing Dars1&lt;sup&gt;D367Y&lt;/sup&gt; point mutation into the mouse genome. Surprisingly, mice carrying this mutation homozygously were phenotypically normal. As hypomorphic mutations are more severe in trans to a deletion, we crossed Dars1&lt;sup&gt;D367Y/D367Y&lt;/sup&gt; mice with Dars1-null carriers. The resulting Dars1&lt;sup&gt;D367Y/−&lt;/sup&gt; offspring displayed a strong developmental delay compared to control Dars1&lt;sup&gt;D367Y/+&lt;/sup&gt; littermates, starting during embryogenesis. Only a small fraction of Dars1&lt;sup&gt;D367Y/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice were born, and half of these mice died with hydrocephalus during the first 3 weeks of life. Of the few Dars1&lt;sup&gt;D367Y/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice that were born at term, 25% displayed microphthalmia. Throughout postnatal life, Dars1&lt;sup&gt;D367Y/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice remained smaller and lighter than their Dars1&lt;sup&gt;D367Y/+&lt;/sup&gt; littermates. Despite this early developmental deficit, once they made it through early adolescence Dars1&lt;sup&gt;D367Y/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice were phenotypically inconspicuous for most of their adult life, until they developed late onset motor deficits as well as vacuolization and demyelination of the spinal cord white matter. Expression levels of the major myelin proteins were reduced in Dars1&lt;sup&gt;D367Y/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared to controls. Taken together, Dars1&lt;sup&gt;D367Y/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice model aspects of the clinical picture of the corresponding missense mutation in HBSL. This model will enable studies of late onset deficits, which is precluded in Dars1 knockout mice, and can be leveraged to test potential HBSL therapeutics including DARS1 gene replacement therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Examinations of Bilateral Epileptiform Activities in Hippocampal Slices Obtained From Young Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bilateral interconnections through the hippocampal commissure play important roles in synchronizing or spreading hippocampal seizure activities. Intact hippocampi or bilateral hippocampal slices have been isolated from neonatal or immature rats (6–7 or 12–21 days old, respectively) and the mechanisms underlying the bilateral synchrony of hippocampal epileptiform activities have been investigated. However, the feasibility of examining bilateral epileptiform activities of more developed hippocampal circuitry in vitro remains to be explored. For this, we prepared bilateral hippocampal slices from C57 black mice, a strain commonly used in neuroscience and for genetic/molecular modifications. Young mice (21–24-day-old) were used in most experiments. A 600-μm-thick slice was obtained from each mouse by horizontal vibratome sectioning. Bilateral dorsal hippocampal and connecting dorsal hippocampal commissure (DHC) tissues were preserved in the slice and extrahippocampal tissues were removed. Slices were recorded in a submerged chamber mainly at a room temperature (21–22°C). Bilateral CA3 areas were monitored by extracellular recordings, and unilateral electrical stimulation was used to elicit CA3 synaptic field potentials. The unilateral stimulation could elicit population spikes in the contralateral CA3 area. These contralateral spikes were attenuated by inhibiting synaptic transmission with cobalt-containing medium and were abolished when a cut was made at the DHC. Self-sustained and bilaterally correlated epileptiform potentials were observed following application of 4-aminopyradine and became independent after the DHC cut. Bilateral hippocampal activities were detectable in some slices of adult mice and/or at 35–36°C, but with smaller amplitudes and variable waveforms compared to those observed from slices of young mice and at the room temperature. Together, these observations suggested that examining bilateral epileptiform activities in hippocampal slices of young mice is feasible. The weaknesses and limitations of this preparation and our experimentation are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microglia regulate neuronal development during embryogenesis, postnatal development, and in specialized microenvironments of the adult brain. Recent evidence demonstrates that in adulthood, microglia secrete factors which modulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis by inhibiting cell proliferation and survival both in vitro and in vivo, maintaining a balance between cell division and cell death in neurogenic niches. These resident immune cells also shape the nervous system by actively pruning synapses during critical periods of learning and engulfing excess neurons. In neurodegenerative diseases, aberrant microglial activity can impede the proper formation and prevent the development of appropriate functional properties of adult born granule cells. Ablating microglia has been presented as a promising therapeutic approach to alleviate the brain of maladaptive immune response. Here, we review key mechanisms through which the immune system actively shapes neurogenic niches throughout the lifespan of the mammalian brain in both health and disease. We discuss how interactions between immune cells and developing neurons may be leveraged for pharmacological intervention and as a means to preserve adult neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The long-term prognosis of cognitive function in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the long-term prognosis of cognitive function in patients with iNPH, as well as the factors related to it. It included 48 patients with iNPH who were treated with cerebrospinal fluid shunting between January 2015 and December 2017 at Osaka Medical College Hospital, with follow-up evaluation of their cognitive function for &amp;gt;2 years. Cognitive function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) preoperatively and at 3 months, 1 and 2 years post-operatively. The mean MMSE score (22.4 ± 5.4 preoperatively) improved at 3 months [23.8 ± 5.0 (p = 0.0002)] and 1 year [23.7 ± 4.8 (p = 0.004)] post-operatively. At 2 years post-operatively, they were able to maintain their preoperative level (22.6 ± 5.3). The patients were classified in to the cognitive decline group [11 (23%) patients; a decrease in the MMSE score by ≥ 2 points 2 years after surgery] and the maintenance/improvement group [37 (77%) patients]. Univariate and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed for the two groups to identify factors associated with cognitive prognosis. In both groups, the patients who were younger (p = 0.009) or had milder symptoms (p = 0.035) had a better long-term prognosis of cognitive function. The cutoffs for age and disease severity (idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus grading scale; INPHGS) were 78 years (area under the curve = 0.77) and 5 points (area under the curve = 0.71), respectively. In conclusion, most patients (77%) were able to improve and maintain cognitive function for at least 2 years after surgery. The fact that disease severity and age are associated with cognitive prognosis suggests that early iNPH intervention is desirable to improve cognitive prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: AD7c-NTP Impairs Adult Striatal Neurogenesis by Affecting the Biological Function of MeCP2 in APP/PSl Transgenic Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The processes by which neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural precursor cells (NPCs) transform into the characteristic lineages observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are poorly characterized. Understanding these processes is of critical importance due to the increased prevalence of AD and the lack of effective AD strategies. Here, we used immunohistochemistry and Western blot to find out if MeCP2 was phosphorylated at a specific amino acid residue, Serine 421 (S421), and activated in response to AD-induced damage in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PSl transgenic mice, altering its nuclear to cytoplasmic shuttling. Epigenetic examinations combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation revealed that the translocation of MeCP2 from the nucleus to cytoplasm led to the loss of lineage-specific gene promoters (such as Gfap, Nestin, and Dcx), decreased transcriptional repression, and the activation of gene expression. Immunofluorescence data demonstrated that neurogenic progenitors with high levels of active phosphorylated MeCP2 at S421 (MeCP2 pS421) possessed a high probability of development into doublecortin (DCX)-expressing cells. AD7c-NTP will control neurogenic progenitor regeneration through its effects on MeCP2 pS421, leading to altered lineage-specific gene expression. This adds to the growing list of biological effects of AD7c-NTP in the brain and highlights MeCP2 as relevant to the plasticity of neural cells in the AD mice striatum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Past, Present, and Future of Non-invasive Brain Stimulation Approaches to Treat Cognitive Impairment in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Time for a Comprehensive Critical Review</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Low birth rates and increasing life expectancy experienced by developed societies have placed an unprecedented pressure on governments and the health system to deal effectively with the human, social and financial burden associated to aging-related diseases. At present, ∼24 million people worldwide suffer from cognitive neurodegenerative diseases, a prevalence that doubles every five years. Pharmacological therapies and cognitive training/rehabilitation have generated temporary hope and, occasionally, proof of mild relief. Nonetheless, these approaches are yet to demonstrate a meaningful therapeutic impact and changes in prognosis. We here review evidence gathered for nearly a decade on non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), a less known therapeutic strategy aiming to limit cognitive decline associated with neurodegenerative conditions. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, two of the most popular NIBS technologies, use electrical fields generated non-invasively in the brain to long-lastingly enhance the excitability/activity of key brain regions contributing to relevant cognitive processes. The current comprehensive critical review presents proof-of-concept evidence and meaningful cognitive outcomes of NIBS in eight of the most prevalent neurodegenerative pathologies affecting cognition: Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), behavioral variant of Frontotemporal Dementia, Corticobasal Syndrome, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, and Posterior Cortical Atrophy. We analyzed a total of 70 internationally published studies: 33 focusing on Alzheimer’s disease, 19 on PPA and 18 on the remaining neurodegenerative pathologies. The therapeutic benefit and clinical significance of NIBS remains inconclusive, in particular given the lack of a sufficient number of double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials using multiday stimulation regimes, the heterogeneity of the protocols, and adequate behavioral and neuroimaging response biomarkers, able to show lasting effects and an impact on prognosis. The field remains promising but, to make further progress, research efforts need to take in account the latest evidence of the anatomical and neurophysiological features underlying cognitive deficits in these patient populations. Moreover, as the development of in vivo biomarkers are ongoing, allowing for an early diagnosis of these neuro-cognitive conditions, one could consider a scenario in which NIBS treatment will be personalized and made part of a cognitive rehabilitation program, or useful as a potential adjunct to drug therapies since the earliest stages of suh diseases. Research should also integrate novel knowledge on the mechanisms and constraints guiding the impact of electrical and magnetic fields on cerebral tissues and brain activity, and incorporate the principles of information-based neurostimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Early appearance of developmental alterations in the dendritic tree of the hippocampal granule cells in the Ts65Dn model of Down syndrome</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down syndrome (DS), a genetic condition caused by triplication of chromosome 21, is characterized by alterations in various cognitive domains, including hippocampus‐dependent memory functions, starting from early life stages. The major causes of intellectual disability in DS are prenatal neurogenesis alterations followed by impairment of dendritic development in early infancy. While there is evidence that the Ts65Dn mouse, the most widely used model of DS, exhibits dendritic alterations in adulthood, no studies are available regarding the onset of dendritic pathology. The goal of the current study was to establish whether this model exhibits early dendritic alterations in the hippocampus, a region whose function is severely damaged in DS. To this purpose, in Golgi‐stained brains, we evaluated the dendritic arborization and dendritic spines of the granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus in Ts65Dn mice aged 8 (P8) and 15 (P15) days. While P15 Ts65Dn mice exhibited a notably hypotrophic dendritic arbor and a reduced spine density, P8 mice exhibited a moderate reduction in the number of dendritic ramifications and no differences in spine density in comparison with their euploid counterparts. Both in P8 and P15 mice, spines were longer and had a longer neck, suggesting possible alterations in synaptic function. Moreover, P8 and P15 Ts65Dn mice had more thin spines and fewer stubby spines in comparison with euploid mice. Our study provides novel evidence on the onset of dendritic pathology, one of the causes of intellectual disability in DS, showing that it is already detectable in the dentate gyrus of Ts65Dn pups. This evidence strengthens the suitability of this model of DS as a tool to study dendritic pathology in DS and to test the efficacy of early therapeutic interventions aimed at ameliorating hippocampal development and, therefore, memory functions in children with DS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Heterogeneous exposure to mosquitoes determines an individual’s contribution to vector-borne pathogen transmission. Particularly for dengue virus (DENV), there is a major difficulty in quantifying human-vector contacts due to the unknown coupled effect of key heterogeneities. To test the hypothesis that the reduction of human out-of-home mobility due to dengue illness will significantly influence population-level dynamics and the structure of DENV transmission chains, we extended an existing modeling framework to include social structure, disease-driven mobility reductions, and heterogeneous transmissibility from different infectious groups. Compared to a baseline model, naïve to human pre-symptomatic infectiousness and disease-driven mobility changes, a model including both parameters predicted an increase of 37% in the probability of a DENV outbreak occurring; a model including mobility change alone predicted a 15.5% increase compared to the baseline model. At the individual level, models including mobility change led to a reduction of the importance of out-of-home onward transmission (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;, the fraction of secondary cases predicted to be generated by an individual) by symptomatic individuals (up to -62%) at the expense of an increase in the relevance of their home (up to +40%). An individual’s positive contribution to &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; could be predicted by a GAM including a non-linear interaction between an individual’s biting suitability and the number of mosquitoes in their home (&amp;gt;10 mosquitoes and 0.6 individual attractiveness significantly increased &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;). We conclude that the complex fabric of social relationships and differential behavioral response to dengue illness cause the fraction of symptomatic DENV infections to concentrate transmission in specific locations, whereas asymptomatic carriers (including individuals in their pre-symptomatic period) move the virus throughout the landscape. Our findings point to the difficulty of focusing vector control interventions reactively on the home of symptomatic individuals, as this approach will fail to contain virus propagation by visitors to their house and asymptomatic carriers.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8_Ukh19uplw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The coronavirus causing the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, uses −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) to control the relative expression of viral proteins. As modulating −1 PRF can inhibit viral replication, the RNA pseudoknot stimulating −1 PRF may be a fruitful target for therapeutics treating COVID-19. We modeled the unusual 3-stem structure of the stimulatory pseudoknot of SARS-CoV-2 computationally, using multiple blind structural prediction tools followed by μs-long molecular dynamics simulations. The results were compared for consistency with nuclease-protection assays and single-molecule force spectroscopy measurements of the SARS-CoV-1 pseudoknot, to determine the most likely conformations. We found several possible conformations for the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot, all having an extended stem 3 but with different packing of stems 1 and 2. Several conformations featured rarely-seen threading of a single strand through junctions formed between two helices. These structural models may help interpret future experiments and support efforts to discover ligands inhibiting −1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iLErDmUCwW8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Working memory capacity can be improved by recoding the memorized information in a condensed form. Here, we tested the theory that human adults encode binary sequences of stimuli in memory using an abstract internal language and a recursive compression algorithm. The theory predicts that the psychological complexity of a given sequence should be proportional to the length of its shortest description in the proposed language, which can capture any nested pattern of repetitions and alternations using a limited number of instructions. Five experiments examine the capacity of the theory to predict human adults’ memory for a variety of auditory and visual sequences. We probed memory using a sequence violation paradigm in which participants attempted to detect occasional violations in an otherwise fixed sequence. Both subjective complexity ratings and objective violation detection performance were well predicted by our theoretical measure of complexity, which simply reflects a weighted sum of the number of elementary instructions and digits in the shortest formula that captures the sequence in our language. While a simpler transition probability model, when tested as a single predictor in the statistical analyses, accounted for significant variance in the data, the goodness-of-fit with the data significantly improved when the language-based complexity measure was included in the statistical model, while the variance explained by the transition probability model largely decreased. Model comparison also showed that shortest description length in a recursive language provides a better fit than six alternative previously proposed models of sequence encoding. The data support the hypothesis that, beyond the extraction of statistical knowledge, human sequence coding relies on an internal compression using language-like nested structures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9JJMKDfVIoo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Ocean acidification boosts reproduction in fish via indirect effects</title>

Ocean acidification affects species populations and biodiversity through direct negative effects on physiology and behaviour. The indirect effects of elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are less well known and can sometimes be counterintuitive. Reproduction lies at the crux of species population replenishment, but we do not know how ocean acidification affects reproduction in the wild. Here, we use natural CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; vents at a temperate rocky reef and show that even though ocean acidification acts as a direct stressor, it can indirectly increase energy budgets of fish to stimulate reproduction at no cost to physiological homeostasis. Female fish maintained energy levels by compensation: They reduced activity (foraging and aggression) to increase reproduction. In male fish, increased reproductive investment was linked to increased energy intake as mediated by intensified foraging on more abundant prey. Greater biomass of prey at the vents was linked to greater biomass of algae, as mediated by a fertilisation effect of elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on primary production. Additionally, the abundance and aggression of paternal carers were elevated at the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; vents, which may further boost reproductive success. These positive indirect effects of elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were only observed for the species of fish that was generalistic and competitively dominant, but not for 3 species of subordinate and more specialised fishes. Hence, species that capitalise on future resource enrichment can accelerate their reproduction and increase their populations, thereby altering species communities in a future ocean.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vQjQ6S65pfA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Plants and insects often use the same compounds for chemical communication, but not much is known about the genetics of convergent evolution of chemical signals. The terpene (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-β-ocimene is a common component of floral scent and is also used by the butterfly &lt;i&gt;Heliconius melpomene&lt;/i&gt; as an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone. While the biosynthesis of terpenes has been described in plants and microorganisms, few terpene synthases (TPSs) have been identified in insects. Here, we study the recent divergence of 2 species, &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;melpomene&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Heliconius cydno&lt;/i&gt;, which differ in the presence of (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-β-ocimene; combining linkage mapping, gene expression, and functional analyses, we identify 2 novel TPSs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that one, HmelOS, is able to synthesise (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-β-ocimene in vitro. We find no evidence for TPS activity in HcydOS (HmelOS ortholog of &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cydno&lt;/i&gt;), suggesting that the loss of (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-β-ocimene in this species is the result of coding, not regulatory, differences. The TPS enzymes we discovered are unrelated to previously described plant and insect TPSs, demonstrating that chemical convergence has independent evolutionary origins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0CoZQrOBUrg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Mitochondrial dysfunction, mitophagy, and role of dynamin‐related protein 1 in Alzheimer's disease&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7a133357-74b3-459c-9927-8bd7f52e40be/jnr24781-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress implicates mitochondrial damage and effects on mitochondrial function, production of ATP, mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis. The mitochondrial dysfunction eventually demonstrates its lethal behaviour on Aβ clearance and mitochondrial fission, especially on the protein Drp1. In AD pathogenesis, Drp1 can play an important regulatory role in mitophagy and autophagy. The miR‐499 causes suppression of calcineurin‐mediated dephosphorylation of Drp1, whereas miR‐30a inhibits mitochondrial fission by suppressing p53 and subsequent Drp‐1 downstream signaling. Mitochondrial targeted antioxidant (MTA) molecules such as Mdivi1, SS31 and Dynasore can reduce excessive mitochondrial fission activity of Drp1 and restore normal mitochondrial functions, fusion‐fission activities, mitophagy and autophagy functions in clearing dead mitochondria for normal synaptic functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and progressive neurodegenerative disease. The presence of β‐amyloid (Aβ) plaques and phosphorylated Tau tangles are considered to be the two main hallmarks of AD. Recent findings have shown that different changes in the structure and dynamics of mitochondria play an important role in AD pathology progression. Mitochondrial changes in AD are expressed as enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation, altered mitochondrial dynamics, and changes in the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis genes in vitro and in vivo models. Therefore, targeting mitochondria and associated mitochondrial proteins seems to be a promising alternative instead of targeting Aβ and Tau in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease. The dynamin‐related protein (Drp1) is one such protein that plays an important role in the regulation of mitochondrial division and maintenance of mitochondrial structures. Few researchers have shown that inhibition of Drp1 GTPase activity in neuronal cells rescues excessive mitochondrial fragmentation. In addition, the growing evidence revealed that Drp1 can interact with both Aβ and Tau protein in human brain tissues and mouse models. In this review, we would like to update existing knowledge about various changes in and around mitochondria related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, with particular emphasis on mitophagy and autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Class I HDAC Inhibitor Improves Synaptic Proteins and Repairs Cytoskeleton Through Regulating Synapse-Related Genes In vitro and In vivo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.619866</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;β-amyloid (Aβ) is an important protein molecule in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Accumulation of Aβ leads to the loss of dendritic spines and synapses. These impairments can be ameliorated by histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI). However, the mechanisms of HDACIs underlying the effect on synapse are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the relationship between HDAC activity and synapse-related genes and proteins by the administration of a class I HDAC inhibitor, BG45, in the exogenous Aβ-treated cells and mice. Our studies showed that the treatment of HF-488-Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; to SH-SY5Y cells first increased the expression of the postsynaptic dendritic protein (PSD), then decreased it after 36 h. BG45 can alleviate the reduction of the expression of PSD-95 as well as spinophilin and cytoskeletal protein induced by HF-488-Aβ&lt;sup&gt;1–42&lt;/sup&gt; aggregation in SH-SY5Y cells. Similar to the results in vitro, PSD-95 in the hippocampus was temporarily increased in the early days of intravenous injection HF-488-Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; to the mice, followed by the decreased expression of PSD-95 on the 9th day. In further studies, for the mice treated with Aβ for 9 days, we found that BG45 decreased the expression of HDAC1 and 2, increased the expression of PSD-95, spinophilin, and synaptophysin (SYP). Our data also showed that BG45 upregulated levels of three synapse-related genes and proteins GRIK2, SCN3B, and SYNPR. These findings suggest that the exogenous Aβ may stimulate transiently the expression of PSD-95 at an early stage, but subsequently contribute to synaptic defects. HDAC1 and 2 are involved in synaptic defects, and BG45 may improve the expression of synaptic and cytoskeletal proteins and repair cytoskeletal damage by specifically inhibiting HDAC1 and 2, thereby modulating synapse-related genes. BG45 might be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of an early stage of Aβ-related neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Adoptive transfer of JC virus‐specific T lymphocytes for the treatment of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26020</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26020?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is still burdened by high mortality in a subset of patients, such as those affected by hematological malignancies. The aim of this study was to analyze the safety and evaluate preliminary efficacy of polyomavirus JC (JCPyV)‐specific T cell therapy in a cohort of hematological patients with PML.


Methods
Between 2014 and 2019, nine patients with a diagnosis of “definite PML” according to the 2013 consensus showing progressive clinical deterioration received JCPyV‐specific T cells (JCPyV‐LTC). Cell lines were expanded from autologous or allogenic peripheral blood mononuclear cells by stimulation with JCPyV antigen‐derived peptides.


Results
None of the patients experienced treatment‐related adverse events. In the evaluable patients, an increase in the frequency of circulating JCPyV‐specific lymphocytes was observed, with a decrease or clearance of JCPyV viral load in cerebrospinal fluid. In responsive patients, transient appearance of punctate areas of contrast enhancement within, or close to, PML lesions was observed, that was interpreted as a sign of immune control and that regressed spontaneously without the need for steroid treatment. Six out of nine patients achieved PML control, with five alive and in good clinical conditions at their last follow‐up.


Interpretation
Among other novel treatments, T cell therapy is emerging as a viable treatment option in patients with PML, particularly for those not amenable to restoration of specific immunity. Neurologists should be encouraged to refer PML patients to specialized centers to allow access to this treatment strategy.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Immunocytochemical and Ultrastructural Organization of the Taste Thalamus of the Tree Shrew (Tupaia belangeri)</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Immunocytochemical and Ultrastructural Organization of the Taste Thalamus of the Tree Shrew (Tupaia belangeri)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/50a25aad-cf74-4de1-981b-1da3633f88f0/cne25109-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synaptic circuitry of primary sensory thalamic nuclei has been well characterized and show striking similarities both in terminal morphology and chemical characteristics. The exception to this is the taste thalamus, the VPMP. A past study of synaptic circuitry in the rat taste thalamus (VPMpc) revealed marked differences from other nuclei like the LGN and MGN. Our data demonstrates that the tree shrew VPMP shares synaptic characteristics common to primary sensory thalamic nuclei including presynaptic interneuron dendrites, large VGluT2 positive terminals, and triadic arrangements in glomeruli.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ventroposterior medialis parvocellularis (VPMP) nucleus of the primate thalamus receives direct input from the nucleus of the solitary tract, whereas the homologous thalamic structure in the rodent does not. To reveal whether the synaptic circuitries in these nuclei lend evidence for conservation of design principles in the taste thalamus across species or across sensory thalamus in general, we characterized the ultrastructural and molecular properties of the VPMP in a close relative of primates, the tree shrew (&lt;i&gt;Tupaia belangeri&lt;/i&gt;), and compared these to known properties of the taste thalamus in rodent, and the visual thalamus in mammals. Electron microscopy analysis to categorize the synaptic inputs in the VPMP revealed that the largest‐size terminals contained many vesicles and formed large synaptic zones with thick postsynaptic density on multiple, medium‐caliber dendrite segments. Some formed triads within glomerular arrangements. Smaller‐sized terminals contained dark mitochondria; most formed a single asymmetric or symmetric synapse on small‐diameter dendrites. Immuno‐EM experiments revealed that the large‐size terminals contained VGLUT2, whereas the small‐size terminal populations contained VGLUT1 or ChAT. These findings provide evidence that the morphological and molecular characteristics of synaptic circuitry in the tree shrew VPMP are similar to that in non‐chemical sensory thalamic nuclei. Furthermore, the results indicate that all primary sensory nuclei of the thalamus in higher mammals share a structural template for processing thalamocortical sensory information. In contrast, substantial morphological and molecular differences in rodent versus tree shrew taste nuclei suggest a fundamental divergence in cellular processing mechanisms of taste input in these two species.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Transmembrane Collagens in Neuromuscular Development and Disorders</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.635375</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.635375</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromuscular development is a multistep process and involves interactions among various extracellular and transmembrane molecules that facilitate the precise targeting of motor axons to synaptogenic regions of the target muscle. Collagenous proteins with transmembrane domains have recently emerged as molecules that play essential roles in multiple aspects of neuromuscular formation. Membrane-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (MACITs) are classified as an unconventional subtype of the collagen superfamily and have been implicated in cell adhesion in a variety of tissues, including the neuromuscular system. Collagen XXV, the latest member of the MACITs, plays an essential role in motor axon growth within the developing muscle. In humans, loss-of-function mutations of collagen XXV result in developmental ocular motor disorders. In contrast, collagen XIII contributes to the formation and maintenance of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), and disruption of its function leads to the congenital myasthenic syndrome. Transmembrane collagens are conserved not only in mammals but also in organisms such as C. elegans, where a single MACIT, COL-99, has been documented to function in motor innervation. Furthermore, in C. elegans, a collagen-like transmembrane protein, UNC-122, is implicated in the structural and functional integrity of the NMJ. This review article summarizes recent advances in understanding the roles of transmembrane collagens and underlying molecular mechanisms in multiple aspects of neuromuscular development and disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Temporal Vestibular Deficits in synaptojanin 1 (synj1) Mutants</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.604189</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.604189</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The lipid phosphatase synaptojanin 1 (synj1) is required for the disassembly of clathrin coats on endocytic compartments. In neurons such activity is necessary for the recycling of endocytosed membrane into synaptic vesicles. Mutations in zebrafish synj1 have been shown to disrupt the activity of ribbon synapses in sensory hair cells. After prolonged mechanical stimulation of hair cells, both phase locking of afferent nerve activity and the recovery of spontaneous release of synaptic vesicles are diminished in synj1 mutants. Presumably as a behavioral consequence of these synaptic deficits, synj1 mutants are unable to maintain an upright posture. To probe vestibular function with respect to postural control in synj1 mutants, we developed a method for assessing the vestibulospinal reflex (VSR) in larvae. We elicited the VSR by rotating the head and recorded tail movements. As expected, the VSR is completely absent in pcdh15a and lhfpl5a mutants that lack inner ear function. Conversely, lhfpl5b mutants, which have a selective loss of function of the lateral line organ, have normal VSRs, suggesting that the hair cells of this organ do not contribute to this reflex. In contrast to mechanotransduction mutants, the synj1 mutant produces normal tail movements during the initial cycles of rotation of the head. Both the amplitude and temporal aspects of the response are unchanged. However, after several rotations, the VSR in synj1 mutants was strongly diminished or absent. Mutant synj1 larvae are able to recover, but the time required for the reappearance of the VSR after prolonged stimulation is dramatically increased in synj1 mutants. Collectively, the data demonstrate a behavioral correlate of the synaptic defects caused by the loss of synj1 function. Our results suggest that defects in synaptic vesicle recycling give rise to fatigue of ribbons synapses and possibly other synapses of the VS circuit, leading to the loss of postural control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Gonadal Cycle-Dependent Expression of Genes Encoding Peptide-, Growth Factor-, and Orphan G-Protein-Coupled Receptors in Gonadotropin- Releasing Hormone Neurons of Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rising serum estradiol triggers the surge release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) at late proestrus leading to ovulation. We hypothesized that proestrus evokes alterations in peptidergic signaling onto GnRH neurons inducing a differential expression of neuropeptide-, growth factor-, and orphan G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) genes. Thus, we analyzed the transcriptome of GnRH neurons collected from intact, proestrous and metestrous GnRH-green fluorescent protein (GnRH-GFP) transgenic mice using Affymetrix microarray technique. Proestrus resulted in a differential expression of genes coding for peptide/neuropeptide receptors including Adipor1, Prokr1, Ednrb, Rtn4r, Nmbr, Acvr2b, Sctr, Npr3, Nmur1, Mc3r, Cckbr, and Amhr2. In this gene cluster, Adipor1 mRNA expression was upregulated and the others were downregulated. Expression of growth factor receptors and their related proteins was also altered showing upregulation of Fgfr1, Igf1r, Grb2, Grb10, and Ngfrap1 and downregulation of Egfr and Tgfbr2 genes. Gpr107, an orphan GPCR, was upregulated during proestrus, while others were significantly downregulated (Gpr1, Gpr87, Gpr18, Gpr62, Gpr125, Gpr183, Gpr4, and Gpr88). Further affected receptors included vomeronasal receptors (Vmn1r172, Vmn2r-ps54, and Vmn1r148) and platelet-activating factor receptor (Ptafr), all with marked downregulation. Patch-clamp recordings from mouse GnRH-GFP neurons carried out at metestrus confirmed that the differentially expressed IGF-1, secretin, and GPR107 receptors were operational, as their activation by specific ligands evoked an increase in the frequency of miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs). These findings show the contribution of certain novel peptides, growth factors, and ligands of orphan GPCRs to regulation of GnRH neurons and their preparation for the surge release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Seizure Freedom After Epilepsy Surgery and Higher Baseline Cognition May Be Associated With a Negatively Correlated Epilepsy Network in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.629667</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.629667</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Brain regions positively correlated with the epileptogenic zone in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy vary in spread across the brain and in the degree of correlation to the temporal lobes, thalamus, and limbic structures, and these parameters have been associated with pre-operative cognitive impairment and seizure freedom after epilepsy surgery, but negatively correlated regions have not been as well studied. We hypothesize that connectivity within a negatively correlated epilepsy network may predict which patients with temporal lobe epilepsy will respond best to surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Scalp EEG and resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) were collected from 19 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and used to estimate the irritative zone. Using patients’ rsfMRI, the negatively correlated epilepsy network was mapped by determining all the brain voxels that were negatively correlated with the voxels in the epileptogenic zone and the spread and average connectivity within the network was determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Pre-operatively, connectivity within the negatively correlated network was inversely related to the spread (diffuseness) of that network and positively associated with higher baseline verbal and logical memory. Pre-operative connectivity within the negatively correlated network was also significantly higher in patients who would go on to be seizure free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Patients with higher connectivity within brain regions negatively correlated with the epilepsy network had higher baseline memory function, narrower network spread, and were more likely to be seizure free after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Secondary Degeneration of White Matter After Focal Sensorimotor Cortical Ischemic Stroke in Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic lesions could lead to secondary degeneration in remote regions of the brain. However, the spatial distribution of secondary degeneration along with its role in functional deficits is not well understood. In this study, we explored the spatial and connectivity properties of white matter (WM) secondary degeneration in a focal unilateral sensorimotor cortical ischemia rat model, using advanced microstructure imaging on a 14 T MRI system. Significant axonal degeneration was observed in the ipsilateral external capsule and even remote regions including the contralesional external capsule and corpus callosum. Further fiber tractography analysis revealed that only fibers having direct axonal connections with the primary lesion exhibited a significant degeneration. These results suggest that focal ischemic lesions may induce remote WM degeneration, but limited to fibers tied to the primary lesion. These “direct” fibers mainly represent perilesional, interhemispheric, and subcortical axonal connections. At last, we found that primary lesion volume might be the determining factor of motor function deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The incidence of metabolic disorders, as well as of neurodegenerative diseases—mainly the sporadic forms of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease—are increasing worldwide. Notably, obesity, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia have been indicated as early risk factors for sporadic forms of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. These conditions share a range of molecular and cellular features, including protein aggregation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction, all of which contribute to neuronal death and cognitive impairment. Rodent models of obesity, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia exhibit all the hallmarks of these degenerative diseases, and represent an interesting approach to the study of the phenotypic features and pathogenic mechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders. We review the main pathological aspects of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease as summarized in rodent models of obesity, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are highly susceptible to developing dementia, especially for those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but its underlying cause is still unclear. In this study, we performed a battery of neuropsychological tests and high-resolution sagittal T1-weighted structural imaging to explore how T2DM affects white matter volume (WMV) and cognition in 30 T2DM-MCI patients, 30 T2DM with normal cognition (T2DM-NC) patients, and 30 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy control (HC) individuals. The WMV of the whole brain was obtained with automated segmentation methods. Correlations between the WMV of each brain region and neuropsychological tests were analyzed in the T2DM patients. The T2DM-NC patients and HC individuals did not reveal any significant differences in WMV. Compared with the T2DM-NC group, the T2DM-MCI group showed statistically significant reduction in the WMV of seven brain regions, mainly located in the frontotemporal lobe and limbic system, five of which significantly correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. Subsequently, we evaluated the discriminative ability of these five regions for MCI in T2DM patients. The WMV of four regions, including left posterior cingulate, precuneus, insula, and right rostral middle frontal gyrus had high diagnostic value for MCI detection in T2DM patients (AUC &amp;gt; 0.7). Among these four regions, left precuneus WMV presented the best diagnostic value (AUC: 0.736; sensitivity: 70.00%; specificity: 73.33%; Youden index: 0.4333), but with no significant difference relative to the minimum AUC. In conclusion, T2DM could give rise to the white matter atrophy of several brain regions. Each WMV of left posterior cingulate, precuneus, insula, and right rostral middle frontal gyrus could be an independent imaging biomarker to detect cognitive impairment at the early stage in T2DM patients and play an important role in its pathophysiological mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Advances in the ability to monitor freely-moving mice may prove valuable for the study of behavior and its neural correlates. Here we present a head-mounted multi-camera system comprised of inexpensive miniature analog camera modules, and illustrate its use for investigating natural behaviors such as prey capture, courtship, sleep, jumping, and exploration. With a four-camera headset, monitoring the eyes, ears, whiskers, rhinarium, and binocular visual field can all be achieved simultaneously with high-density electrophysiology. With appropriate focus and positioning, all eye movements can be captured, including cyclotorsion. For studies of vision and eye movements, cyclotorsion provides the final degree of freedom required to reconstruct the visual scene in retinotopic coordinates or to investigate the vestibulo-ocular reflex in mice. Altogether, this system allows for comprehensive measurement of freely-moving mouse behavior, enabling a more holistic, and multimodal approach to investigate ethological behaviors and other processes of active perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Purpose&lt;p&gt;To quantitatively assess the blood oxygen levels of the cerebral vein using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and to analyze the correlation between magnetic susceptibility value (MSV) and clinical laboratory indicators/cognitive scores in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifty-nine patients (21 males and 38 females) with clinically confirmed AD (AD group) and 22 control subjects (12 males, 10 females; CON group) were recruited. Clinical data and laboratory examination indexes were collected. All patients underwent Mini-mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Clock Drawing Task, and Activity of Daily Living Scale test, as well as a routine MRI and enhanced gradient echo T2 star weighted angiography (ESWAN).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Higher cerebral venous MSV was observed in AD group compared to CON group, significant differences were observed for bilateral thalamus veins and left dentate nucleus veins. The MSV of bilateral thalamus veins, bilateral internal cerebral veins, and bilateral dentate nucleus veins had significant negative correlation with Mini-mental State Examination score; the MSV of bilateral thalamus veins, bilateral dentate nucleus veins, right septal vein had a significant negative correlation with Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores; a significant negative correlation between the MSV of bilateral thalamus veins, left dentate nucleus vein, right septal vein and the Clock Drawing Task score; the MSV of bilateral thalamus veins, left dentate nucleus vein had a significant negative correlation with Activity of Daily Living Scale score. The MSV of left dentate nucleus vein was positively correlated with the course of the disease, the MSV of bilateral septal vein were positively correlated with the total cholesterol, and the MSV of left septal vein had a positive correlation with LDL.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Decreasing cerebral venous oxygen level in AD patients may affect cognitive status, and associated with the deterioration of the disease in AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: A Physical Perspective to the Inductive Function of Myelin—A Missing Piece of Neuroscience</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.562005</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.562005</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Starting from the inductance in neurons, two physical origins are discussed, which are the coil inductance of myelin and the piezoelectric effect of the cell membrane. The direct evidence of the coil inductance of myelin is the opposite spiraling phenomenon between adjacent myelin sheaths confirmed by previous studies. As for the piezoelectric effect of the cell membrane, which has been well-known in physics, the direct evidence is the mechanical wave accompany with action potential. Therefore, a more complete physical nature of neural signals is provided. In conventional neuroscience, the neural signal is a pure electrical signal. In our new theory, the neural signal is an energy pulse containing electrical, magnetic, and mechanical components. Such a physical understanding of the neural signal and neural systems significantly improve the knowledge of the neurons. On the one hand, we achieve a corrected neural circuit of an inductor-capacitor-capacitor (LCC) form, whose frequency response and electrical characteristics have been validated by previous studies and the modeling fitting of artifacts in our experiments. On the other hand, a number of phenomena observed in neural experiments are explained. In particular, they are the mechanism of magnetic nerve stimulations and ultrasound nerve stimulations, the MRI image contrast issue and Anode Break Excitation. At last, the biological function of myelin is summarized. It is to provide inductance in the process of neural signal, which can enhance the signal speed in peripheral nervous systems and provide frequency modulation function in central nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: HMGA1 Induction of miR-103/107 Forms a Negative Feedback Loop to Regulate Autophagy in MPTP Model of Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.620020</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.620020</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autophagy dysfunction has been directly linked with the onset and progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD), but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. High-mobility group A1 (HMGA1), well-known chromatin remodeling proteins, play pivotal roles in diverse biological processes and diseases. Their function in neural cell death in PD, however, have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we report that HMGA1 is highly induced during dopaminergic cell death in vitro and mice models of PD in vivo. Functional studies using genetic knockdown of endogenous HMGA1 show that HMGA1 signaling inhibition accelerates neural cell death, at least partially through aggravating MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced autophagic flux reduction resulting from partial block in autophagic flux at the terminal stages, indicating a novel potential neuroprotective role for HMGA1 in dopaminergic neurons death. MicroRNA-103/107 (miR-103/107) family, which is highly expressed in neuron, coordinately ensures proper end-stage autophagy. We further illustrate that MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced HMGA1 elevation counterparts the effect of miR-103/107 downregulation by directly binding to their promoters, respectively, sustaining their expression in MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-damaged MN9D cells and modulates autophagy through CDK5R1/CDK5 signaling pathway. We also find that HMGA1 is a direct target of miR-103/107 family. Thus, our results suggest that HMGA1 forms a negative feedback loop with miR-103/107-CDK5R1/CDK5 signaling to regulate the MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/MPTP-induced autophagy impairment and neural cell death. Collectively, we identify a paradigm for compensatory neuroprotective HMGA1 signaling in dopaminergic neurons that could have important therapeutic implications for PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Microvascular Alterations in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.618986</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with continual decline in cognition and ability to perform routine functions such as remembering familiar places or understanding speech. For decades, amyloid beta (Aβ) was viewed as the driver of AD, triggering neurodegenerative processes such as inflammation and formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). This approach has not yielded therapeutics that cure the disease or significant improvements in long-term cognition through removal of plaques and Aβ oligomers. Some researchers propose alternate mechanisms that drive AD or act in conjunction with amyloid to promote neurodegeneration. This review summarizes the status of AD research and examines research directions including and beyond Aβ, such as tau, inflammation, and protein clearance mechanisms. The effect of aging on microvasculature is highlighted, including its contribution to reduced blood flow that impairs cognition. Microvascular alterations observed in AD are outlined, emphasizing imaging studies of capillary malfunction. The review concludes with a discussion of two therapies to protect tissue without directly targeting Aβ for removal: (1) administration of growth factors to promote vascular recovery in AD; (2) inhibiting activity of a calcium-permeable ion channels to reduce microglial activation and restore cerebral vascular function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dorsal-Ventral Differences in Retinal Structure in the Pigmented Royal College of Surgeons Model of Retinal Degeneration</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Retinitis pigmentosa is a family of inherited retinal degenerations associated with gradual loss of photoreceptors, that ultimately leads to irreversible vision loss. The Royal College of Surgeon's (RCS) rat carries a recessive mutation affecting mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (merTK), that models autosomal recessive disease. The aim of this study was to understand the glial, microglial, and photoreceptor changes that occur in different retinal locations with advancing disease. Pigmented RCS rats (RCS-p&lt;sup&gt;+/&lt;/sup&gt;LAV) and age-matched isogenic control rdy (RCS-rdy &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/LAV) rats aged postnatal day 18 to 6 months were evaluated for in vivo retinal structure and function using optical coherence tomography and electroretinography. Retinal tissues were assessed using high resolution immunohistochemistry to evaluate changes in photoreceptors, glia and microglia in the dorsal, and ventral retina. Photoreceptor dysfunction and death occurred from 1 month of age. There was a striking difference in loss of photoreceptors between the dorsal and ventral retina, with a greater number of photoreceptors surviving in the dorsal retina, despite being adjacent a layer of photoreceptor debris within the subretinal space. Loss of photoreceptors in the ventral retina was associated with fragmentation of the outer limiting membrane, extension of glial processes into the subretinal space that was accompanied by possible adhesion and migration of mononuclear phagocytes in the subretinal space. Overall, these findings highlight that breakdown of the outer limiting membrane could play an important role in exacerbating photoreceptor loss in the ventral retina. Our results also highlight the value of using the RCS rat to model sectorial retinitis pigmentosa, a disease known to predominantly effect the inferior retina.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Impact of COVID-19 Quarantine on Patients With Dementia and Family Caregivers: A Nation-Wide Survey</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.625781</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.625781</link>
	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Previous studies showed that quarantine for pandemic diseases is associated with several psychological and medical effects. The consequences of quarantine for COVID-19 pandemic in patients with dementia are unknown. We investigated the clinical changes in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, and evaluated caregivers’ distress during COVID-19 quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The study involved 87 Italian Dementia Centers. Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Vascular Dementia (VD) were eligible for the study. Family caregivers of patients with dementia were interviewed by phone in April 2020, 45 days after quarantine declaration. Main outcomes were patients’ changes in cognitive, behavioral, and motor symptoms. Secondary outcomes were effects on caregivers’ psychological features.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;4913 patients (2934 females, 1979 males) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Caregivers reported a worsening in cognitive functions in 55.1% of patients, mainly in subjects with DLB and AD. Aggravation of behavioral symptoms was observed in 51.9% of patients. In logistic regression analysis, previous physical independence was associated with both cognitive and behavioral worsening (odds ratio 1.85 [95% CI 1.42–2.39], 1.84 [95% CI 1.43–2.38], respectively). On the contrary, pandemic awareness was a protective factor for the worsening of cognitive and behavioral symptoms (odds ratio 0.74 [95% CI 0.65–0.85]; and 0.72 [95% CI 0.63–0.82], respectively). Approximately 25.9% of patients showed the onset of new behavioral symptoms. A worsening in motor function was reported by 36.7% of patients. Finally, caregivers reported a high increase in anxiety, depression, and distress.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study shows that quarantine for COVID-19 is associated with an acute worsening of clinical symptoms in patients with dementia as well as increase of caregivers’ burden. Our findings emphasize the importance to implement new strategies to mitigate the effects of quarantine in patients with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Sleep Disturbance is Associated With Higher Plasma Aβ Levels in Cognitively Normal Adults—A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.615838</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.615838</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Growing evidence suggests that sleep disturbance is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the brain is a main pathophysiology of AD. Considering that peripheral Aβ level is associated with brain Aβ deposition, the present study investigated the relationship between sleep disturbance and plasma Aβ levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This is a population-based cross-sectional study. A total of 1,459 participants from a village in the suburbs of Xi'an, China, were enrolled from January 3, 2017 to March 26, 2017. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and a PSQI score of &amp;lt;5 points was considered as good sleep quality and a PSQI score of &amp;gt;10 points as poor sleep quality. Cognitive function was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Fasting venous blood was taken in the morning, and the plasma Aβ levels were measured using ELISA. The relationships between plasma Aβ levels and sleep quality were analyzed using multiple linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Among the participants, 231 had poor sleep quality (15.83%). The log-transformed Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; level had significant differences among the different sleep groups (F = 3.216, p = 0.040). The log-transformed Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; level was higher in the poor sleep quality group than that in the general sleep quality group [87.17 (73.42, 107.34) vs. 89.69 (74.81, 125.79) pg/ml, p = 0.016]. In bivariate analysis, sleep quality was negatively associated with the log-transformed plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; level (β = −0.025, p = 0.011).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In the community population, poorer sleep quality is associated with a higher plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; level. This indicated that sleep disturbance might also involve in dysfunction of peripheral Aβ clearance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Using a Discourse Task to Explore Semantic Ability in Persons With Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.607449</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.607449</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper uses a discourse task to explore aspects of semantic production in persons with various degree of cognitive impairment and healthy controls. The purpose of the study was to test if an in-depth semantic analysis of a cognitive-linguistic challenging discourse task could differentiate persons with a cognitive decline from those with a stable cognitive impairment. Both quantitative measures of semantic ability, using tests of oral lexical retrieval, and qualitative analysis of a narrative were used to detect semantic difficulties. Besides group comparisons a classification experiment was performed to investigate if the discourse features could be used to improve classification of the participants who had a stable cognitive impairment from those who had cognitively declined. In sum, both types of assessment methods captured difficulties between the groups, but tests of oral lexical retrieval most successfully differentiated between the cognitively stable and the cognitively declined group. Discourse features improved classification accuracy and the best combination of features discriminated between participants with a stable cognitive impairment and those who had cognitively declined with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Associated Differences of Modules and Hubs in Brain Functional Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.607445</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Healthy aging is usually accompanied by changes in the functional modular organization of the human brain, which may result in the decline of cognition and underlying brain dysfunction. However, the relationship between age-related brain functional modular structure differences and cognition remain debatable. In this study, we investigated the age-associated differences of modules and hubs from young, middle and old age groups, using resting-state fMRI data from a large cross-sectional adulthood sample. We first divided the subjects into three age groups and constructed an individual-level network for each subject. Subsequently, a module-guided group-level network construction method was applied to form a weighted network for each group from which functional modules were detected. The intra- and inter-modular connectivities were observed negatively correlated with age. According to the detected modules, we found the number of connector hubs in the young group was more than middle-age and old group, while the quantity of provincial hubs in middle-age group was discovered more than other two groups. Further ROI-wise analysis shows that different hubs have distinct age-associated trajectories of intra- and inter-modular connections, which suggests the different types of topological role transitions in functional networks across age groups. Our results indicated an inverse association between functional segregation/integration with age, which demonstrated age-associated differences in communication effeciency. This study provides a new perspective and useful information to better understand the normal aging of brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Multiple coordinated cellular dynamics mediate CA1 map plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23300?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the hippocampus, spatial and nonspatial information are jointly represented as a neural map in which locations associated with salient features are over‐represented by increased densities of relevant place cells. Although we recently demonstrated that experience‐dependent establishment of these disproportionate maps is governed by selective stabilization of salient place cells following their conversion from non‐place cells, the underlying mechanism for pre‐established map reorganization remained to be understood. To this end, we investigated the changes in CA1 functional cellular maps imaged using two‐photon calcium imaging in mice performing a reward‐rearrangement task in virtual reality. Mice were pre‐trained on a virtual linear track with a visual landmark and a reward in two distinct locations. Then, they were re‐trained on the same track with the exception that the location of reward was shifted to match the landmark location. We found that, in contrast to de novo map formation, robust map reorganization occurred through parallel coordination of new place field formation, lateral shifting of existing place fields, and selective stabilization of place fields encoding salient locations. Our findings demonstrate that intricate interplay between multiple forms of cellular dynamics enables rapid updating of information stored in hippocampal maps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Diagnostic Accuracy of Amyloid versus 18F‐Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography in Autopsy‐Confirmed Dementia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25968</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25968?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of antemortem 11C‐Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) and 18F‐fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) versus autopsy diagnosis in a heterogenous sample of patients.


Methods
One hundred one participants underwent PIB and FDG PET during life and neuropathological assessment. PET scans were visually interpreted by 3 raters blinded to clinical information. PIB PET was rated as positive or negative for cortical retention, whereas FDG scans were read as showing an Alzheimer disease (AD) or non‐AD pattern. Neuropathological diagnoses were assigned using research criteria. Majority visual reads were compared to intermediate–high AD neuropathological change (ADNC).


Results
One hundred one participants were included (mean age = 67.2 years, 41 females, Mini‐Mental State Examination = 21.9, PET‐to‐autopsy interval = 4.4 years). At autopsy, 32 patients showed primary AD, 56 showed non‐AD neuropathology (primarily frontotemporal lobar degeneration [FTLD]), and 13 showed mixed AD/FTLD pathology. PIB showed higher sensitivity than FDG for detecting intermediate–high ADNC (96%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 89–100% vs 80%, 95% CI = 68–92%, p = 0.02), but equivalent specificity (86%, 95% CI = 76–95% vs 84%, 95% CI = 74–93%, p = 0.80). In patients with congruent PIB and FDG reads (77/101), combined sensitivity was 97% (95% CI = 92–100%) and specificity was 98% (95% CI = 93–100%). Nine of 24 patients with incongruent reads were found to have co‐occurrence of AD and non‐AD pathologies.


Interpretation
In our sample enriched for younger onset cognitive impairment, PIB‐PET had higher sensitivity than FDG‐PET for intermediate–high ADNC, with similar specificity. When both modalities are congruent, sensitivity and specificity approach 100%, whereas mixed pathology should be considered when PIB and FDG are incongruent. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:389–401</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The Impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on Stroke Epidemiology and Care: A Meta‐Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25967</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25967?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Emerging data indicate an increased risk of cerebrovascular events with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and highlight the potential impact of coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) on the management and outcomes of acute stroke. We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis to evaluate the aforementioned considerations.


Methods
We performed a meta‐analysis of observational cohort studies reporting on the occurrence and/or outcomes of patients with cerebrovascular events in association with their SARS‐CoV‐2 infection status. We used a random‐effects model. Summary estimates were reported as odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).


Results
We identified 18 cohort studies including 67,845 patients. Among patients with SARS‐CoV‐2, 1.3% (95% CI = 0.9–1.6%, I2 = 87%) were hospitalized for cerebrovascular events, 1.1% (95% CI = 0.8–1.3%, I2 = 85%) for ischemic stroke, and 0.2% (95% CI = 0.1–0.3%, I2 = 64%) for hemorrhagic stroke. Compared to noninfected contemporary or historical controls, patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection had increased odds of ischemic stroke (OR = 3.58, 95% CI = 1.43–8.92, I2 = 43%) and cryptogenic stroke (OR = 3.98, 95% CI = 1.62–9.77, I2 = 0%). Diabetes mellitus was found to be more prevalent among SARS‐CoV‐2 stroke patients compared to noninfected historical controls (OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.00–1.94, I2 = 0%). SARS‐CoV‐2 infection status was not associated with the likelihood of receiving intravenous thrombolysis (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 0.65–3.10, I2 = 0%) or endovascular thrombectomy (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.35–1.74, I2 = 0%) among hospitalized ischemic stroke patients during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Odds of in‐hospital mortality were higher among SARS‐CoV‐2 stroke patients compared to noninfected contemporary or historical stroke patients (OR = 5.60, 95% CI = 3.19–9.80, I2 = 45%).


Interpretation
SARS‐CoV‐2 appears to be associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, and potentially cryptogenic stroke in particular. It may also be related to an increased mortality risk. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:380–388</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Development and Validation of the Pediatric Charcot–Marie–Tooth Disease Quality of Life Outcome Measure</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25966</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25966?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) reduces health‐related quality of life (QOL), especially in children. Defining QOL in pediatric CMT can help physicians monitor disease burden clinically and in trials. We identified items pertaining to QOL in children with CMT and conducted validation studies to develop a pediatric CMT‐specific QOL outcome measure (pCMT‐QOL).


Methods
Development and validation of the pCMT‐QOL patient‐reported outcome measure were iterative, involving identifying relevant domains, item pool generation, prospective pilot testing and clinical assessments, structured focus‐group interviews, and psychometric testing. Testing was conducted in children with CMT seen at participating sites from the USA, United Kingdom, and Australia.


Results
We conducted systematic literature reviews and analysis of generic QOL measures to identify 6 domains relevant to QOL in children with CMT. Sixty items corresponding to those domains were developed de novo, or identified from literature review and CMT‐specific modification of items from the pediatric Neuro‐QOL measures. The draft version underwent prospective feasibility and face content validity assessments to develop a working version of the pCMT‐QOL measure. From 2010 to 2016, the pCMT‐QOL working version was administered to 398 children aged 8 to 18 years seen at the participating study sites of the Inherited Neuropathies Consortium. The resulting data underwent rigorous psychometric analysis, including factor analysis, test–retest reliability, internal consistency, convergent validity, item response theory analysis, and longitudinal analysis, to develop the final pCMT‐QOL patient‐reported outcome measure.


Interpretation
The pCMT‐QOL patient‐reported outcome measure is a reliable, valid, and sensitive measure of health‐related QOL for children with CMT. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:369–379</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Perfusion‐Dependent Cerebral Autoregulation Impairment in Hemispheric Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25963</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25963?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Loss of cerebral autoregulation (CA) plays a key role in secondary neurologic injury. However, the regional distribution of CA impairment after acute cerebral injury remains unclear because, in clinical practice, CA is only assessed within a limited compartment. Here, we performed large‐scale regional mapping of cortical perfusion and CA in patients undergoing decompressive surgery for malignant hemispheric stroke.


Methods
In 24 patients, autoregulation over the affected hemisphere was calculated based on direct, 15 to 20‐minute cortical perfusion measurement with intraoperative laser speckle imaging and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) recording. Cortical perfusion was normalized against noninfarcted tissue and 6 perfusion categories from 0% to &amp;gt;100% were defined. The interaction between cortical perfusion and MAP was estimated using a linear random slope model and Pearson correlation.


Results
Cortical perfusion and CA impairment were heterogeneously distributed across the entire hemisphere. The degree of CA impairment was significantly greater in areas with critical hypoperfusion (40–60%: 0.42% per mmHg and 60–80%: 0.46% per mmHg) than in noninfarcted (&amp;gt; 100%: 0.22% per mmHg) or infarcted (0–20%: 0.29% per mmHg) areas (*p &amp;lt; 0.001). Pearson correlation confirmed greater CA impairment at critically reduced perfusion (20–40%: r = 0.67; 40–60%: r = 0.68; and 60–80%: r = 0.68) compared to perfusion &amp;gt; 100% (r = 0.36; *p &amp;lt; 0.05). Tissue integrity had no impact on the degree of CA impairment.


Interpretation
In hemispheric stroke, CA is impaired across the entire hemisphere to a variable extent. Autoregulation impairment was greatest in hypoperfused and potentially viable tissue, suggesting that precise localization of such regions is essential for effective tailoring of perfusion pressure‐based treatment strategies.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25962?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Isolated (or idiopathic) rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is associated with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Biomarkers are lacking to predict conversion to a dementia or a motor‐first phenotype. Here, we aimed at identifying a brain‐clinical signature that predicts dementia in iRBD.


Methods
A brain‐clinical signature was identified in 48 patients with polysomnography‐confirmed iRBD using partial least squares between brain deformation and 27 clinical variables. The resulting variable was applied to 78 patients with iRBD followed longitudinally to predict conversion to a synucleinopathy, specifically DLB. The deformation scores from patients with iRBD were compared with 207 patients with PD, DLB, or prodromal DLB to assess if scores were higher in DLB compared to PD.


Results
One latent variable explained 31% of the brain‐clinical covariance in iRBD, combining cortical and subcortical deformation and subarachnoid/ventricular expansion to cognitive and motor variables. The deformation score of this signature predicted conversion to a synucleinopathy in iRBD (p = 0.036, odds ratio [OR] = 2.249; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.053–4.803), specifically to DLB (OR = 4.754; 95% CI = 1.283–17.618, p = 0.020) and not PD (p = 0.286). Patients with iRBD who developed dementia had scores similar to clinical and prodromal patients with DLB but higher scores compared with patients with PD. The deformation score also predicted cognitive performance over 1, 2, and 4 years in patients with PD.


Interpretation
We identified a brain‐clinical signature that predicts conversion in iRBD to more severe/dementing forms of synucleinopathy. This pattern may serve as a new biomarker to optimize patient care, target risk reduction strategies, and administer neuroprotective trials. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:341–357</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A Pilot Randomized, Controlled, Double‐Blind Trial of Bumetanide to Treat Neonatal Seizures</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25959</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25959?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
In the absence of controlled trials, treatment of neonatal seizures has changed minimally despite poor drug efficacy. We tested bumetanide added to phenobarbital to treat neonatal seizures in the first trial to include a standard‐therapy control group.


Methods
A randomized, double‐blind, dose‐escalation design was employed. Neonates with postmenstrual age 33 to 44 weeks at risk of or with seizures were eligible. Subjects with electroencephalography (EEG)‐confirmed seizures after ≥20 and &amp;lt;40mg/kg phenobarbital were randomized to receive additional phenobarbital with either placebo (control) or 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3mg/kg bumetanide (treatment). Continuous EEG monitoring data from ≥2 hours before to ≥48 hours after study drug administration (SDA) were analyzed for seizures.


Results
Subjects were randomized to treatment (n = 27) and control (n = 16) groups. Pharmacokinetics were highly variable among subjects and altered by hypothermia. The only statistically significant adverse event was diuresis in treated subjects (48% vs 13%, p = 0.02). One treated (4%) and 3 control subjects died (19%, p = 0.14). Among survivors, 2 of 26 treated subjects (8%) and 0 of 13 control subjects had hearing impairment, as did 1 nonrandomized subject. Total seizure burden varied widely, with much higher seizure burden in treatment versus control groups (median = 3.1 vs 1.2 min/h, p = 0.006). There was significantly greater reduction in seizure burden 0 to 4 hours and 2 to 4 hours post‐SDA (both p &amp;lt; 0.01) compared with 2‐hour baseline in treatment versus control groups with adjustment for seizure burden.


Interpretation
Although definitive proof of efficacy awaits an appropriately powered phase 3 trial, this randomized, controlled, multicenter trial demonstrated an additional reduction in seizure burden attributable to bumetanide over phenobarbital without increased serious adverse effects. Future trials of bumetanide and other drugs should include a control group and balance seizure severity. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:327–340</description>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25958?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
This study was undertaken to gain insights into structural networks associated with stimulation‐induced dysarthria (SID) and to predict stimulation‐induced worsening of intelligibility in essential tremor patients with bilateral thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS).


Methods
Monopolar reviews were conducted in 14 essential tremor patients. Testing included determination of SID thresholds, intelligibility ratings, and a fast syllable repetition task. Volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) were calculated to identify discriminative fibers for stimulation‐induced worsening of intelligibility in a structural connectome. The resulting fiber‐based atlas structure was then validated in a leave‐one‐out design.


Results
Fibers determined as discriminative for stimulation‐induced worsening of intelligibility were mainly connected to the ipsilateral precentral gyrus as well as to both cerebellar hemispheres and the ipsilateral brain stem. In the thalamic area, they ran laterally to the thalamus and posteromedially to the subthalamic nucleus, in close proximity, mainly anterolaterally, to fibers beneficial for tremor control as published by Al‐Fatly et al in 2019. The overlap of the respective clinical stimulation setting's VTAs with these fibers explained 62.4% (p &amp;lt; 0.001) of the variance of stimulation‐induced change in intelligibility in a leave‐one‐out analysis.


Interpretation
This study demonstrates that SID in essential tremor patients is associated with both motor cortex and cerebellar connectivity. Furthermore, the identified fiber‐based atlas structure might contribute to future postoperative programming strategies to achieve optimal tremor control without speech impairment in essential tremor patients with thalamic DBS.

	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25956</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25956?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Epilepsy develops in 70 to 90% of children with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and is often resistant to medication. Recently, the concept of preventive antiepileptic treatment to modify the natural history of epilepsy has been proposed. EPISTOP was a clinical trial designed to compare preventive versus conventional antiepileptic treatment in TSC infants.


Methods
In this multicenter study, 94 infants with TSC without seizure history were followed with monthly video electroencephalography (EEG), and received vigabatrin either as conventional antiepileptic treatment, started after the first electrographic or clinical seizure, or preventively when epileptiform EEG activity before seizures was detected. At 6 sites, subjects were randomly allocated to treatment in a 1:1 ratio in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). At 4 sites, treatment allocation was fixed; this was denoted an open‐label trial (OLT). Subjects were followed until 2 years of age. The primary endpoint was the time to first clinical seizure.


Results
In 54 subjects, epileptiform EEG abnormalities were identified before seizures. Twenty‐seven were included in the RCT and 27 in the OLT. The time to the first clinical seizure was significantly longer with preventive than conventional treatment [RCT: 364 days (95% confidence interval [CI] = 223–535) vs 124 days (95% CI = 33–149); OLT: 426 days (95% CI = 258–628) vs 106 days (95% CI = 11–149)]. At 24 months, our pooled analysis showed preventive treatment reduced the risk of clinical seizures (odds ratio [OR] = 0.21, p = 0.032), drug‐resistant epilepsy (OR = 0.23, p = 0.022), and infantile spasms (OR = 0, p &amp;lt; 0.001). No adverse events related to preventive treatment were noted.


Interpretation
Preventive treatment with vigabatrin was safe and modified the natural history of seizures in TSC, reducing the risk and severity of epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:304–314</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Timeline of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder in Overt Alpha‐Synucleinopathies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25952</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25952?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The aim was to analyze the timeline, prevalence, and survival of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in patients who developed alpha‐synucleinopathies (Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson disease dementia) compared with age‐ and sex‐matched controls in a population‐based incident‐cohort study.


Methods
We used a population‐based, 1991 to 2010 incident‐cohort study of alpha‐synucleinopathies. A movement‐disorder specialist reviewed medical records to confirm diagnoses. RBD was diagnosed by reported dream‐enactment symptoms or polysomnography. Probable RBD and polysomnographically confirmed RBD were analyzed separately and combined.


Results
Among the 444 incident cases of alpha‐synucleinopathy, 86 were clinically diagnosed with RBD (19.8%), including 30 (35%) by polysomnography and 56 (65%) as probable. The prevalence of idiopathic RBD at alpha‐synucleinopathy diagnosis was 3.4%, increasing to 23.8% after 15 years. Cumulative lifetime incidence was 53 times greater in alpha‐synucleinopathy patients than in controls (odds ratio [OR] = 53.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.0–217.2, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), higher in dementia with Lewy bodies than in Parkinson disease (OR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.50–4.40, p = 0.0004), and higher in men than in women with Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or Parkinson disease dementia (OR = 3.70, 95% CI: 2.07–6.62, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), but did not increase mortality risk.


Interpretation
Our cohort had RBD incidence of 3.4%. Overall RBD increased to 23.8% after 15 years, with an overall incidence of 2.5 cases per 100 person‐years. With 53 times greater lifetime incidence in alpha‐synucleinopathy patients than in controls, RBD was more likely to develop in dementia with Lewy bodies than in Parkinson disease or Parkinson disease dementia, and in men than in women, but did not increase mortality risk within our cohort.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Very Low Residual Dystrophin Quantity Is Associated with Milder Dystrophinopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25951</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25951?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
This study was undertaken to determine whether a low residual quantity of dystrophin protein is associated with delayed clinical milestones in patients with DMD mutations.


Methods
We performed a retrospective multicentric cohort study by using molecular and clinical data from patients with DMD mutations registered in the Universal Mutation Database–DMD France database. Patients with intronic, splice site, or nonsense DMD mutations, with available muscle biopsy Western blot data, were included irrespective of whether they presented with severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Patients were separated into 3 groups based on dystrophin protein levels. Clinical outcomes were ages at appearance of first symptoms; loss of ambulation; fall in vital capacity and left ventricular ejection fraction; interventions such as spinal fusion, tracheostomy, and noninvasive ventilation; and death.


Results
Of 3,880 patients with DMD mutations, 90 with mutations of interest were included. Forty‐two patients expressed no dystrophin (group A), and 31 of 42 (74%) developed DMD. Thirty‐four patients had dystrophin quantities &amp;lt; 5% (group B), and 21 of 34 (61%) developed BMD. Fourteen patients had dystrophin quantities ≥ 5% (group C), and all but 4 who lost ambulation beyond 24 years of age were ambulant. Dystrophin quantities of &amp;lt;5%, as low as &amp;lt;0.5%, were associated with milder phenotype for most of the evaluated clinical outcomes, including age at loss of ambulation (p &amp;lt; 0.001).


Interpretation
Very low residual dystrophin protein quantity can cause a shift in disease phenotype from DMD toward BMD. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:280–292</description>

	<description>Advances in genetic discoveries have created substantial opportunities for precision medicine in neurodevelopmental disorders. Many of the genes implicated in these diseases encode proteins that regulate gene expression, such as chromatin‐associated proteins, transcription factors, and RNA‐binding proteins. The identification of targeted therapeutics for individuals carrying mutations in these genes remains a challenge, as the encoded proteins can theoretically regulate thousands of downstream targets in a considerable number of cell types. Here, we propose the application of a drug discovery approach originally developed for cancer called “transcriptome reversal” for these neurodevelopmental disorders. This approach attempts to identify compounds that reverse gene‐expression signatures associated with disease states. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:199–211</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Association between Computed Tomographic Biomarkers of Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases and Long‐Term Outcome after Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25949</guid>

	<description>Objective
A study was undertaken to assess whether cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) computed tomographic (CT) biomarkers are associated with long‐term outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage.


Methods
We performed a prospective, community‐based cohort study of adults diagnosed with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage between June 1, 2010 and May 31, 2013. A neuroradiologist rated the diagnostic brain CT for acute intracerebral hemorrhage features and SVD biomarkers. We used severity of white matter lucencies and cerebral atrophy, and the number of lacunes to calculate the CT SVD score. We assessed the association between CT SVD biomarkers and either death, or death or dependence (modified Rankin Scale scores = 4–6) 1 year after first‐ever intracerebral hemorrhage using logistic regression, adjusting for known predictors of outcome.


Results
Within 1 year of intracerebral hemorrhage, 224 (56%) of 402 patients died. In separate models, 1‐year death was associated with severe atrophy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.44–4.49, p = 0.001) but not lacunes or severe white matter lucencies, and CT SVD sum score ≥ 1 (aOR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.40–4.45, p = 0.002). Two hundred seventy‐seven (73%) of 378 patients with modified Rankin Scale data were dead or dependent at 1 year. In separate models, 1‐year death or dependence was associated with severe atrophy (aOR = 3.67, 95% CI = 1.71–7.89, p = 0.001) and severe white matter lucencies (aOR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.06–4.51, p = 0.035) but not lacunes, and CT SVD sum score ≥ 1 (aOR = 2.81, 95% CI = 1.45–5.46, p = 0.002).


Interpretation
SVD biomarkers on the diagnostic brain CT are associated with 1‐year death and dependence after intracerebral hemorrhage, independent of known predictors of outcome. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:266–279</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Socioeconomic Status Mediates Racial Differences Seen Using the AT(N) Framework</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25948</guid>

	<description>Objectives
African Americans are at greater risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia than non‐Hispanic whites. In addition to biological considerations (eg, genetic influences and comorbid disorders), social and environmental factors may increase the risk of AD dementia. This paper (1) assesses neuroimaging biomarkers of amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) for potential racial differences and (2) considers mediating effects of socioeconomic status (SES) and measures of small vessel and cardiovascular disease on observed race differences.


Methods
Imaging measures of AT(N) (amyloid and tau positron emission tomography [PET]) structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and resting state functional connectivity (rs‐fc) were collected from African American (n = 131) and white (n = 685) cognitively normal participants age 45 years and older. Measures of small vessel and cardiovascular disease (white matter hyperintensities [WMHs] on MRI, blood pressure, and body mass index [BMI]) and area‐based SES were included in mediation analyses.


Results
Compared to white participants, African American participants had greater neurodegeneration, as measured by decreased cortical volumes (Cohen's f2 = 0.05, p &amp;lt; 0.001). SES mediated the relationship between race and cortical volumes. There were no significant race effects for amyloid, tau, or rs‐fc signature.


Interpretation
Modifiable factors, such as differences in social contexts and resources, particularly area‐level SES, may contribute to observed racial differences in AD. Future studies should emphasize collection of relevant psychosocial factors in addition to the development of intentional diversity and inclusion efforts to improve the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic representativeness of AD studies.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy Caused by a Homozygous Splicing Variant of SLC7A6OS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25941</guid>

	<description>Exome sequencing was performed in 2 unrelated families with progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Affected individuals from both families shared a rare, homozygous c.191A &amp;gt; G variant affecting a splice site in SLC7A6OS. Analysis of cDNA from lymphoblastoid cells demonstrated partial splice site abolition and the creation of an abnormal isoform. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot showed a marked reduction of protein expression. Haplotype analysis identified a ~0.85cM shared genomic region on chromosome 16q encompassing the c.191A &amp;gt; G variant, consistent with a distant ancestor common to both families. Our results suggest that biallelic loss‐of‐function variants in SLC7A6OS are a novel genetic cause of progressive myoclonus epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:402–407</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Association between Migraine and Cryptogenic Ischemic Stroke in Young Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25937</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25937?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
To assess the association between migraine and cryptogenic ischemic stroke (CIS) in young adults, with subgroup analyses stratified by sex and presence of patent foramen ovale (PFO).


Methods
We prospectively enrolled 347 consecutive patients aged 18 to 49 years with a recent CIS and 347 age‐ and sex‐matched (±5 years) stroke‐free controls. Any migraine and migraine with (MA) and migraine without aura (MO) were identified by a screener, which we validated against a headache neurologist. We used conditional logistic regression adjusting for age, education, hypertension, diabetes, waist‐to‐hip ratio, physical inactivity, current smoking, heavy drinking, and oral estrogen use to assess independent association between migraine and CIS. The effect of PFO on the association between migraine and CIS was analyzed with logistic regression in a subgroup investigated with transcranial Doppler bubble screen.


Results
The screener performance was excellent (Cohen kappa &amp;gt; 0.75) in patients and controls. Compared with nonmigraineurs, any migraine (odds ratio [OR] = 2.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.63–3.76) and MA (OR = 3.50, 95% CI = 2.19–5.61) were associated with CIS, whereas MO was not. The association emerged in both women (OR = 2.97 for any migraine, 95% CI = 1.61–5.47; OR = 4.32 for MA, 95% CI = 2.16–8.65) and men (OR = 2.47 for any migraine, 95% CI = 1.32–4.61; OR = 3.61 for MA, 95% CI = 1.75–7.45). Specifically for MA, the association with CIS remained significant irrespective of PFO. MA prevalence increased with increasing magnitude of the right‐to‐left shunt in patients with PFO.


Interpretation
MA has a strong association with CIS in young patients, independent of vascular risk factors and presence of PFO. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:242–253</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neocortical Slow Oscillations Implicated in the Generation of Epileptic Spasms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.25935</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25935?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Epileptic spasms are a hallmark of severe seizure disorders. The neurophysiological mechanisms and the neuronal circuit(s) that generate these seizures are unresolved and are the focus of studies reported here.


Methods
In the tetrodotoxin model, we used 16‐channel microarrays and microwires to record electrophysiological activity in neocortex and thalamus during spasms. Chemogenetic activation was used to examine the role of neocortical pyramidal cells in generating spasms. Comparisons were made to recordings from infantile spasm patients.


Results
Current source density and simultaneous multiunit activity analyses indicate that the ictal events of spasms are initiated in infragranular cortical layers. A dramatic pause of neuronal activity was recorded immediately prior to the onset of spasms. This preictal pause is shown to share many features with the down states of slow wave sleep. In addition, the ensuing interictal up states of slow wave rhythms are more intense in epileptic than control animals and occasionally appear sufficient to initiate spasms. Chemogenetic activation of neocortical pyramidal cells supported these observations, as it increased slow oscillations and spasm numbers and clustering. Recordings also revealed a ramp‐up in the number of neocortical slow oscillations preceding spasms, which was also observed in infantile spasm patients.


Interpretation
Our findings provide evidence that epileptic spasms can arise from the neocortex and reveal a previously unappreciated interplay between brain state physiology and spasm generation. The identification of neocortical up states as a mechanism capable of initiating epileptic spasms will likely provide new targets for interventional therapies.
