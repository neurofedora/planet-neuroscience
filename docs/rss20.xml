	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Object Based Attention Through Internal Gating. (arXiv:2106.04540v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Object-based attention is a key component of the visual system, relevant for
perception, learning, and memory. Neurons tuned to features of attended objects
tend to be more active than those associated with non-attended objects. There
is a rich set of models of this phenomenon in computational neuroscience.
However, there is currently a divide between models that successfully match
physiological data but can only deal with extremely simple problems and models
of attention used in computer vision. For example, attention in the brain is
known to depend on top-down processing, whereas self-attention in deep learning
does not. Here, we propose an artificial neural network model of object-based
attention that captures the way in which attention is both top-down and
recurrent. Our attention model works well both on simple test stimuli, such as
those using images of handwritten digits, and on more complex stimuli, such as
natural images drawn from the COCO dataset. We find that our model replicates a
range of findings from neuroscience, including attention-invariant tuning,
inhibition of return, and attention-mediated scaling of activity. Understanding
object based attention is both computationally interesting and a key problem
for computational neuroscience.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been demonstrated many times that the behavior of the human visual
system is connected to the statistics of natural images. Since machine learning
relies on the statistics of training data as well, the above connection has
interesting implications when using perceptual distances (which mimic the
behavior of the human visual system) as a loss function. In this paper, we aim
to unravel the non-trivial relationship between the probability distribution of
the data, perceptual distances, and unsupervised machine learning. To this end,
we show that perceptual sensitivity is correlated with the probability of an
image in its close neighborhood. We also explore the relation between distances
induced by autoencoders and the probability distribution of the data used for
training them, as well as how these induced distances are correlated with human
perception. Finally, we discuss why perceptual distances might not lead to
noticeable gains in performance over standard Euclidean distances in common
image processing tasks except when data is scarce and the perceptual distance
provides regularization.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Theories for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been formulated at different
levels: ranging from physiological observations to perceptual and behavioural
descriptions. Understanding the physiological underpinnings of perceptual
traits in ASD remains a significant challenge in the field. Here we show how a
recurrent neural circuit model which had been optimized to perform
sampling-based inference and displays characteristic features of cortical
dynamics can help bridge this gap. The model was able to establish a
mechanistic link between two descriptive levels for ASD: a physiological level,
in terms of inhibitory dysfunction, neural variability and oscillations, and a
perceptual level, in terms of hypopriors in Bayesian computations. We took two
parallel paths: inducing hypopriors in the probabilistic model, and an
inhibitory dysfunction in the network model, which lead to consistent results
in terms of the represented posteriors, providing support for the view that
both descriptions might constitute two sides of the same coin.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Exploration and preference satisfaction trade-off in reward-free learning. (arXiv:2106.04316v1 [cs.AI])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Biological agents have meaningful interactions with their environment despite
the absence of a reward signal. In such instances, the agent can learn
preferred modes of behaviour that lead to predictable states -- necessary for
survival. In this paper, we pursue the notion that this learnt behaviour can be
a consequence of reward-free preference learning that ensures an appropriate
trade-off between exploration and preference satisfaction. For this, we
introduce a model-based Bayesian agent equipped with a preference learning
mechanism (pepper) using conjugate priors. These conjugate priors are used to
augment the expected free energy planner for learning preferences over states
(or outcomes) across time. Importantly, our approach enables the agent to learn
preferences that encourage adaptive behaviour at test time. We illustrate this
in the OpenAI Gym FrozenLake and the 3D mini-world environments -- with and
without volatility. Given a constant environment, these agents learn confident
(i.e., precise) preferences and act to satisfy them. Conversely, in a volatile
setting, perpetual preference uncertainty maintains exploratory behaviour. Our
experiments suggest that learnable (reward-free) preferences entail a trade-off
between exploration and preference satisfaction. Pepper offers a
straightforward framework suitable for designing adaptive agents when reward
functions cannot be predefined as in real environments.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: On the role of feedback in visual processing: a predictive coding perspective. (arXiv:2106.04225v1 [cs.CV])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-inspired machine learning is gaining increasing consideration,
particularly in computer vision. Several studies investigated the inclusion of
top-down feedback connections in convolutional networks; however, it remains
unclear how and when these connections are functionally helpful. Here we
address this question in the context of object recognition under noisy
conditions. We consider deep convolutional networks (CNNs) as models of
feed-forward visual processing and implement Predictive Coding (PC) dynamics
through feedback connections (predictive feedback) trained for reconstruction
or classification of clean images. To directly assess the computational role of
predictive feedback in various experimental situations, we optimize and
interpret the hyper-parameters controlling the network's recurrent dynamics.
That is, we let the optimization process determine whether top-down connections
and predictive coding dynamics are functionally beneficial. Across different
model depths and architectures (3-layer CNN, ResNet18, and EfficientNetB0) and
against various types of noise (CIFAR100-C), we find that the network
increasingly relies on top-down predictions as the noise level increases; in
deeper networks, this effect is most prominent at lower layers. In addition,
the accuracy of the network implementing PC dynamics significantly increases
over time-steps, compared to its equivalent forward network. All in all, our
results provide novel insights relevant to Neuroscience by confirming the
computational role of feedback connections in sensory systems, and to Machine
Learning by revealing how these can improve the robustness of current vision
models.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: The Randomness of Input Data Spaces is an A Priori Predictor for Generalization. (arXiv:2106.04181v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Over-parameterized models can perfectly learn various types of data
distributions, however, generalization error is usually lower for real data in
comparison to artificial data. This suggests that the properties of data
distributions have an impact on generalization capability. This work focuses on
the search space defined by the input data and assumes that the correlation
between labels of neighboring input values influences generalization. If
correlation is low, the randomness of the input data space is high leading to
high generalization error. We suggest to measure the randomness of an input
data space using Maurer's universal. Results for synthetic classification tasks
and common image classification benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR10, and Microsoft's
cats vs. dogs data set) find a high correlation between the randomness of input
data spaces and the generalization error of deep neural networks for binary
classification problems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Effective control and prediction of dynamical systems often require
appropriate handling of continuous-time and discrete, event-triggered
processes. Stochastic hybrid systems (SHSs), common across engineering domains,
provide a formalism for dynamical systems subject to discrete, possibly
stochastic, state jumps and multi-modal continuous-time flows. Despite the
versatility and importance of SHSs across applications, a general procedure for
the explicit learning of both discrete events and multi-mode continuous
dynamics remains an open problem. This work introduces Neural Hybrid Automata
(NHAs), a recipe for learning SHS dynamics without a priori knowledge on the
number of modes and inter-modal transition dynamics. NHAs provide a systematic
inference method based on normalizing flows, neural differential equations and
self-supervision. We showcase NHAs on several tasks, including mode recovery
and flow learning in systems with stochastic transitions, and end-to-end
learning of hierarchical robot controllers.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Embodied negation and levels of concreteness: A TMS Study on German and Italian language processing. (arXiv:2106.04123v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04123</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;According to the embodied cognition perspective, linguistic negation may
block the motor simulations induced by language processing. Transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied to the left primary motor cortex (hand
area) of monolingual Italian and German healthy participants during a rapid
serial visual presentation of sentences from their own language. In these
languages, the negative particle is located at the beginning and at the end of
the sentence, respectively. The study investigated whether the interruption of
the motor simulation processes, accounted for by reduced motor evoked
potentials (MEPs), takes place similarly in two languages differing on the
position of the negative marker. Different levels of sentence concreteness were
also manipulated to investigate if negation exerts generalized effects or if it
is affected by the semantic features of the sentence. Our findings indicate
that negation acts as a block on motor representations, but independently from
the language and words concreteness level.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Credit Assignment Through Broadcasting a Global Error Vector. (arXiv:2106.04089v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04089</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04089</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Backpropagation (BP) uses detailed, unit-specific feedback to train deep
neural networks (DNNs) with remarkable success. That biological neural circuits
appear to perform credit assignment, but cannot implement BP, implies the
existence of other powerful learning algorithms. Here, we explore the extent to
which a globally broadcast learning signal, coupled with local weight updates,
enables training of DNNs. We present both a learning rule, called global
error-vector broadcasting (GEVB), and a class of DNNs, called vectorized
nonnegative networks (VNNs), in which this learning rule operates. VNNs have
vector-valued units and nonnegative weights past the first layer. The GEVB
learning rule generalizes three-factor Hebbian learning, updating each weight
by an amount proportional to the inner product of the presynaptic activation
and a globally broadcast error vector when the postsynaptic unit is active. We
prove that these weight updates are matched in sign to the gradient, enabling
accurate credit assignment. Moreover, at initialization, these updates are
exactly proportional to the gradient in the limit of infinite network width.
GEVB matches the performance of BP in VNNs, and in some cases outperforms
direct feedback alignment (DFA) applied in conventional networks. Unlike DFA,
GEVB successfully trains convolutional layers. Altogether, our theoretical and
empirical results point to a surprisingly powerful role for a global learning
signal in training DNNs.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming (GSGP) is a state-of-the-art machine
learning method based on evolutionary computation. GSGP performs search
operations directly at the level of program semantics, which can be done more
efficiently then operating at the syntax level like most GP systems. Efficient
implementations of GSGP in C++ exploit this fact, but not to its full
potential. This paper presents GSGP-CUDA, the first CUDA implementation of GSGP
and the most efficient, which exploits the intrinsic parallelism of GSGP using
GPUs. Results show speedups greater than 1,000X relative to the
state-of-the-art sequential implementation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interface (BCI) is used for communication between humans and
devices by recognizing status and intention of humans. Communication between
humans and a drone using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is one of the most
challenging issues in the BCI domain. In particular, the control of drone
swarms (the direction and formation) has more advantages compared to the
control of a drone. The visual imagery (VI) paradigm is that subjects visually
imagine specific objects or scenes. Reduction of the variability among EEG
signals of subjects is essential for practical BCI-based systems. In this
study, we proposed the subepoch-wise feature encoder (SEFE) to improve the
performances in the subject-independent tasks by using the VI dataset. This
study is the first attempt to demonstrate the possibility of generalization
among subjects in the VI-based BCI. We used the leave-one-subject-out
cross-validation for evaluating the performances. We obtained higher
performances when including our proposed module than excluding our proposed
module. The DeepConvNet with SEFE showed the highest performance of 0.72 among
six different decoding models. Hence, we demonstrated the feasibility of
decoding the VI dataset in the subject-independent task with robust
performances by using our proposed module.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inverse molecular design, i.e., designing molecules with specific target
properties, can be posed as an optimization problem. High-dimensional
optimization tasks in the natural sciences are commonly tackled via
population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as evolutionary
algorithms. However, expensive property evaluation, which is often required,
can limit the widespread use of such approaches as the associated cost can
become prohibitive. Herein, we present JANUS, a genetic algorithm that is
inspired by parallel tempering. It propagates two populations, one for
exploration and another for exploitation, improving optimization by reducing
expensive property evaluations. Additionally, JANUS is augmented by a deep
neural network that approximates molecular properties via active learning for
enhanced sampling of the chemical space. Our method uses the SELFIES molecular
representation and the STONED algorithm for the efficient generation of
structures, and outperforms other generative models in common inverse molecular
design tasks achieving state-of-the-art performance.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The field of computational modeling of the brain is advancing so rapidly that
now it is possible to model large scale networks representing different brain
regions with a high level of biological detail in terms of numbers and
synapses. For a theoretician approaching a neurobiological question, it is
important to analyze the pros and cons of each of the models available. Here,
we provide a tutorial review on recent models for different brain circuits,
which are based on experimentally obtained connectivity maps. We discuss
particularities that may be relevant to the modeler when choosing one of the
reviewed models. The objective of this review is to give the reader a fair
notion of the computational models covered, with emphasis on the corresponding
connectivity maps, and how to use them.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Impact of the activation rate of the hyperpolarization-activated current Ih on the neuronal membrane time constant and synaptic potential duration. (arXiv:2106.03902v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03902</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The temporal dynamics of membrane voltage changes in neurons is controlled by
ionic currents. These currents are characterized by two main properties:
conductance and kinetics. The hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) strongly
modulates subthreshold potential changes by shortening the excitatory
postsynaptic potentials and decreasing their temporal summation. Whereas the
shortening of the synaptic potentials caused by the Ih conductance is well
understood, the role of the Ih kinetics remains unclear. Here, we use a model
of the Ih current model with either fast or slow kinetics to determine its
influence on the membrane time constant ($\tau_m$) of a CA1 pyramidal cell
model. Our simulation results show that the Ih with fast kinetics decreases
$\tau_m$ and attenuates and shortens the excitatory postsynaptic potentials
more than the slow Ih. We conclude that the Ih activation kinetics is able to
modulate $\tau_m$ and the temporal properties of excitatory postsynaptic
potentials (EPSPs) in CA1 pyramidal cells. In order to elucidate the mechanisms
by which Ih kinetics controls $\tau_m$, we propose a new concept called &quot;time
scaling factor&quot;. Our main finding is that the Ih kinetics influences $\tau_m$
by modulating the contribution of the Ih derivative conductance to $\tau_m$.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress appears to be a key feature of many neurodegenerative diseases either as a cause or consequence of disease. A range of molecules are subject to oxidation, but in particular, proteins are an important target and measure of oxidative stress. Proteins are subject to a range of oxidative modifications at reactive cysteine residues, and depending on the level of oxidative stress, these modifications may be reversible or irreversible. A range of experimental approaches has been developed to characterize cysteine oxidation of proteins. In particular, mass spectrometry-based proteomic methods have emerged as a powerful means to identify and quantify cysteine oxidation sites on a proteome scale; however, their application to study neurodegenerative diseases is limited to date. Here we provide a guide to these approaches and highlight the under-exploited utility of these methods to measure oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases for biomarker discovery, target engagement and to understand disease mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcriptional regulation is essential for the correct functioning of cells during development and in postnatal life. The basic Helix-loop-Helix (bHLH) superfamily of transcription factors is well conserved throughout evolution and plays critical roles in tissue development and tissue maintenance. A subgroup of this family, called neural lineage bHLH factors, is critical in the development and function of the central nervous system. In this review, we will focus on the function of one subgroup of neural lineage bHLH factors, the Neurod family. The Neurod family has four members: Neurod1, Neurod2, Neurod4, and Neurod6. Available evidence shows that these four factors are key during the development of the cerebral cortex but also in other regions of the central nervous system, such as the cerebellum, the brainstem, and the spinal cord. We will also discuss recent reports that link the dysfunction of these transcription factors to neurological disorders in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Right Inferior Parietal Lobule Activity Is Associated With Handwriting Spontaneous Tempo</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Handwriting is a complex activity including motor planning and visuomotor integration and referring to some brain areas identified as “writing centers.” Although temporal features of handwriting are as important as spatial ones, to our knowledge, there is no evidence of the description of specific brain areas associated with handwriting tempo. People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) show handwriting impairments that are mainly referred to as the temporal features of the task. The aim of this work was to assess differences in the brain activation pattern elicited by handwriting between PwMS and healthy controls (HC), with the final goal of identifying possible areas specific for handwriting tempo. Subjects were asked to write a sentence at their spontaneous speed. PwMS differed only in temporal handwriting features from HC and showed reduced activation with a subset of the clusters observed in HC. Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed between handwriting temporal parameters and the activity in the brain areas resulting from the contrast analysis, HC &amp;gt; PwMS. We found that the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) negatively correlated with the duration of the sentence, indicating that the higher the right IPL activity, the faster the handwriting performance. We propose that the right IPL might be considered a “writing tempo center.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Disrupted Asymmetry of Inter- and Intra-Hemispheric Functional Connectivity at Rest in Medication-Free Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Disrupted functional asymmetry of cerebral hemispheres may be altered in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, little is known about whether anomalous brain asymmetries originate from inter- and/or intra-hemispheric functional connectivity (FC) at rest in OCD. In this study, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was applied to 40 medication-free patients with OCD and 38 gender-, age-, and education-matched healthy controls (HCs). Data were analyzed using the parameter of asymmetry (PAS) and support vector machine methods. Patients with OCD showed significantly increased PAS in the left posterior cingulate cortex, left precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus, and right inferior occipital gyrus and decreased PAS in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilateral middle cingulate cortex (MCC), left inferior parietal lobule, and left cerebellum Crus I. A negative correlation was found between decreased PAS in the left DLPFC and Yale–Brown Obsessive-compulsive Scale compulsive behavior scores in the patients. Furthermore, decreased PAS in the bilateral MCC could be used to distinguish OCD from HCs with a sensitivity of 87.50%, an accuracy of 88.46%, and a specificity of 89.47%. These results highlighted the contribution of disrupted asymmetry of intra-hemispheric FC within and outside the cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuits at rest in the pathophysiology of OCD, and reduced intra-hemispheric FC in the bilateral MCC may serve as a potential biomarker to classify individuals with OCD from HCs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The electroencephalography (EEG) is a well-established non-invasive method in neuroscientific research and clinical diagnostics. It provides a high temporal but low spatial resolution of brain activity. To gain insight about the spatial dynamics of the EEG, one has to solve the inverse problem, i.e., finding the neural sources that give rise to the recorded EEG activity. The inverse problem is ill-posed, which means that more than one configuration of neural sources can evoke one and the same distribution of EEG activity on the scalp. Artificial neural networks have been previously used successfully to find either one or two dipole sources. These approaches, however, have never solved the inverse problem in a distributed dipole model with more than two dipole sources. We present ConvDip, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, that solves the EEG inverse problem in a distributed dipole model based on simulated EEG data. We show that (1) ConvDip learned to produce inverse solutions from a single time point of EEG data and (2) outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all focused performance measures. (3) It is more flexible when dealing with varying number of sources, produces less ghost sources and misses less real sources than the comparison methods. It produces plausible inverse solutions for real EEG recordings from human participants. (4) The trained network needs &amp;lt;40 ms for a single prediction. Our results qualify ConvDip as an efficient and easy-to-apply novel method for source localization in EEG data, with high relevance for clinical applications, e.g., in epileptology and real-time applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Approximate Number Sense in Students With Severe Hearing Loss: A Modality-Neutral Cognitive Ability</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.688144</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.688144</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Approximate Number System (ANS) allows humans and non-human animals to estimate large quantities without counting. It is most commonly studied in visual contexts (i.e., with displays containing different numbers of dots), although the ANS may operate on all approximate quantities regardless of modality (e.g., estimating the number of a series of auditory tones). Previous research has shown that there is a link between ANS and mathematics abilities, and that this link is resilient to differences in visual experience (Kanjlia et al., 2018). However, little is known about the function of the ANS and its relationship to mathematics abilities in the absence of other types of sensory input. Here, we investigated the acuity of the ANS and its relationship with mathematics abilities in a group of students from the Sichuan Province in China, half of whom were deaf. We found, consistent with previous research, that ANS acuity improves with age. We found that mathematics ability was predicted by Non-verbal IQ and Inhibitory Control, but not visual working memory capacity or Attention Network efficiencies. Even above and beyond these predictors, ANS ability still accounted for unique variance in mathematics ability. Notably, there was no interaction with hearing, which indicates that the role played by the ANS in explaining mathematics competence is not modulated by hearing capacity. Finally, we found that age, Non-verbal IQ and Visual Working Memory capacity were predictive of ANS performance when controlling for other factors. In fact, although students with hearing loss performed slightly worse than students with normal hearing on the ANS task, hearing was no longer significantly predictive of ANS performance once other factors were taken into account. These results indicate that the ANS is able to develop at a consistent pace with other cognitive abilities in the absence of auditory experience, and that its relationship with mathematics ability is not contingent on sensory input from hearing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Genome-Wide Association Study of Motor Coordination</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to finely control our movement is key to achieving many of the educational milestones and life-skills we develop throughout our lives. Despite the centrality of coordination to early development, there is a vast gap in our understanding of the underlying biology. Like most complex traits, both genetics and environment influence motor coordination, however, the specific genes, early environmental risk factors and molecular pathways are unknown. Previous studies have shown that about 5% of school-age children experience unexplained difficulties with motor coordination. These children are said to have Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). For children with DCD, these motor coordination difficulties significantly impact their everyday life and learning. DCD is associated with poorer academic achievement, reduced quality of life, it can constrain career opportunities and increase the risk of mental health issues in adulthood. Despite the high prevalence of coordination difficulties, many children remain undiagnosed by healthcare professionals. Compounding under-diagnosis in the clinic, research into the etiology of DCD is severely underrepresented in the literature. Here we present the first genome-wide association study to examine the genetic basis of early motor coordination in the context of motor difficulties. Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children we generate a derived measure of motor coordination from four components of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, providing an overall measure of coordination across the full range of ability. We perform the first genome-wide association analysis focused on motor coordination (N = 4542). No single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) met the threshold for genome-wide significance, however, 59 SNPs showed suggestive associations. Three regions contained multiple suggestively associated SNPs, within five preliminary candidate genes: IQSEC1, LRCC1, SYNJ2B2, ADAM20, and ADAM21. Association to the gene IQSEC1 suggests a potential link to axon guidance and dendritic projection processes as a potential underlying mechanism of motor coordination difficulties. This represents an interesting potential mechanism, and whilst further validation is essential, it generates a direct window into the biology of motor coordination difficulties. This research has identified potential biological drivers of DCD, a first step towards understanding this common, yet neglected neurodevelopmental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Entrainment Meets Behavior: The Stability Index as a Neural Outcome Measure of Auditory-Motor Coupling</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding rhythmic behavior in the context of coupled auditory and motor systems has been of interest to neurological rehabilitation, in particular, to facilitate walking. Recent work based on behavioral measures revealed an entrainment effect of auditory rhythms on motor rhythms. In this study, we propose a method to compute the neural component of such a process from an electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. A simple auditory-motor synchronization paradigm was used, where 28 healthy participants were instructed to synchronize their finger-tapping with a metronome. The computation of the neural outcome measure was carried out in two blocks. In the first block, we used Generalized Eigendecomposition (GED) to reduce the data dimensionality to the component which maximally entrained to the metronome frequency. The scalp topography pointed at brain activity over contralateral sensorimotor regions. In the second block, we computed instantaneous frequency from the analytic signal of the extracted component. This returned a time-varying measure of frequency fluctuations, whose standard deviation provided our “stability index” as a neural outcome measure of auditory-motor coupling. Finally, the proposed neural measure was validated by conducting a correlation analysis with a set of behavioral outcomes from the synchronization task: resultant vector length, relative phase angle, mean asynchrony, and tempo matching. Significant moderate negative correlations were found with the first three measures, suggesting that the stability index provided a quantifiable neural outcome measure of entrainment, with selectivity towards phase-correction mechanisms. We address further adoption of the proposed approach, especially with populations where sensorimotor abilities are compromised by an underlying pathological condition. The impact of using stability index can potentially be used as an outcome measure to assess rehabilitation protocols, and possibly provide further insight into neuropathological models of auditory-motor coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Bilateral Amygdala Radio-Frequency Ablation for Refractory Aggressive Behavior Alters Local Cortical Thickness to a Pattern Found in Non-refractory Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.653631</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aggressive behaviors comprise verbal and/or physical aggression directed toward oneself, others, or objects and are highly prevalent among psychiatric patients, especially patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and severe intellectual disabilities. Some of these patients are considered refractory to treatment, and functional neurosurgery targeting the amygdala can result in widespread plastic brain changes that might reflect ceasing of some abnormal brain function, offering symptom alleviation. This study investigated cortical thickness changes in refractory aggressive behavior patients that were treated with bilateral amygdala ablation and compared to control patients presenting non-refractory aggressive behavior [three refractory and seven non-refractory patients, all males diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities]. The Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) was used to quantify behavior and magnetic resonance imaging was performed to investigate cortical thickness. Before surgery, both groups presented similar total OAS score, however refractory patients presented higher physical aggression against others. After surgery the refractory group showed 88% average reduction of aggressive behavior. Imaging analysis showed that while refractory patients present an overall reduction in cortical thickness compared to non-refractory patients across both timepoints, the local pattern of thickness difference found in areas of the neurocircuitry of aggressive behavior present before surgery is diminished and no longer detected after surgery. These results corroborate the hypotheses on induction of widespread neuronal plasticity following functional neurosurgical procedures resulting in modifications in brain morphology and improvement in behavior. Further studies are necessary to determine the underlying cause of these morphological changes and to better understand and improve treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Oxytocin Regulates Synaptic Transmission in the Sensory Cortices in a Developmentally Dynamic Manner</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.673439</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.673439</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The development and stabilization of neuronal circuits are critical to proper brain function. Synapses are the building blocks of neural circuits. Here we examine the effects of the neuropeptide oxytocin on synaptic transmission in L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the barrel field of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1BF). We find that perfusion of oxytocin onto acute brain slices significantly increases the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC) of S1BF L2/3 pyramidal neurons at P10 and P14, but reduces it at the later ages of P22 and P28; the transition occurs at around P18. Since oxytocin expression is itself regulated by sensory experience, we also examine whether the effects of oxytocin on excitatory synaptic transmission correlate with that of sensory experience. We find that, indeed, the effects of sensory experience and oxytocin on excitatory synaptic transmission of L2/3 pyramidal neurons both peak at around P14 and plateau around P18, suggesting that they regulate a specific form of synaptic plasticity in L2/3 pyramidal neurons, with a sensitive/critical period ending around P18. Consistently, oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) expression in glutamatergic neurons of the upper layers of the cerebral cortex peaks around P14. By P28, however, Oxtr expression becomes more prominent in GABAergic neurons, especially somatostatin (SST) neurons. At P28, oxytocin perfusion increases inhibitory synaptic transmission and reduces excitatory synaptic transmission, effects that result in a net reduction of neuronal excitation, in contrast to increased excitation at P14. Using oxytocin knockout mice and Oxtr conditional knockout mice, we show that loss-of-function of oxytocin affects baseline excitatory synaptic transmission, while Oxtr is required for oxytocin-induced changes in excitatory synaptic transmission, at both P14 and P28. Together, these results demonstrate that oxytocin has complex and dynamic functions in regulating synaptic transmission in cortical L2/3 pyramidal neurons. These findings add to existing knowledge of the function of oxytocin in regulating neural circuit development and plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dementia describes a set of symptoms that occur in neurodegenerative disorders and that is characterized by gradual loss of cognitive and behavioral functions. Recently, non-invasive neurofeedback training has been explored as a potential complementary treatment for patients suffering from dementia or mild cognitive impairment. Here we systematically reviewed studies that explored neurofeedback training protocols based on electroencephalography or functional magnetic resonance imaging for these groups of patients. From a total of 1,912 screened studies, 10 were included in our final sample (N = 208 independent participants in experimental and N = 81 in the control groups completing the primary endpoint). We compared the clinical efficacy across studies, and evaluated their experimental designs and reporting quality. In most studies, patients showed improved scores in different cognitive tests. However, data from randomized controlled trials remains scarce, and clinical evidence based on standardized metrics is still inconclusive. In light of recent meta-research developments in the neurofeedback field and beyond, quality and reporting practices of individual studies are reviewed. We conclude with recommendations on best practices for future studies that investigate the effects of neurofeedback training in dementia and cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The amygdala is a brain area involved in emotional regulation and pain. Over the course of the last 20 years, multiple researchers have studied sensory and motor connections within the amygdala in trying to understand the ultimate role of this structure in pain perception and descending control of pain. A number of investigators have been using cell-type specific manipulations to probe the underlying circuitry of the amygdala. As data have accumulated in this research space, we recognized a critical need for a single framework to integrate these data and evaluate emergent system-level responses. In this manuscript, we present an agent-based computational model of two distinct inhibitory neuron populations in the amygdala, those that express protein kinase C delta (PKC&lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;) and those that express somatostatin (SOM). We utilized a network of neural links to simulate connectivity and the transmission of inhibitory signals between neurons. Type-specific parameters describing the response of these neurons to noxious stimuli were estimated from published physiological and immunological data as well as our own wet-lab experiments. The model outputs an abstract measure of pain, which is calculated in terms of the cumulative pro-nociceptive and anti-nociceptive activity across neurons in both hemispheres of the amygdala. Results demonstrate the ability of the model to produce changes in pain that are consistent with published studies and highlight the importance of several model parameters. In particular, we found that the relative proportion of PKC&lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt; and SOM neurons within each hemisphere is a key parameter in predicting pain and we explored model predictions for three possible values of this parameter. We compared model predictions of pain to data from our earlier behavioral studies and found areas of similarity as well as distinctions between the data sets. These differences, in particular, suggest a number of wet-lab experiments that could be done in the future.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Gu4XwB9cP4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Collagen forms a characteristic triple helical structure and plays a central role for stabilizing the extra-cellular matrix. After a C-terminal nucleus formation folding proceeds to form long triple-helical fibers. The molecular details of triple helix folding process is of central importance for an understanding of several human diseases associated with misfolded or unstable collagen fibrils. However, the folding propagation is too rapid to be studied by experimental high resolution techniques. We employed multiple Molecular Dynamics simulations starting from unfolded peptides with an already formed nucleus to successfully follow the folding propagation in atomic detail. The triple helix folding was found to propagate involving first two chains forming a short transient template. Secondly, three residues of the third chain fold on this template with an overall mean propagation of ~75 ns per unit. The formation of loops with multiples of the repeating unit was found as a characteristic misfolding event especially when starting from an unstable nucleus. Central Gly→Ala or Gly→Thr substitutions resulted in reduced stability and folding rates due to structural deformations interfering with folding propagation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BEGFFLCXFNk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Cytometry analysis has seen a considerable expansion in recent years in the maximum number of parameters that can be acquired in a single experiment. In response to this technological advance there has been an increased effort to develop new computational methodologies for handling high-dimensional single cell data acquired by flow or mass cytometry. Despite the success of numerous algorithms and published packages to replicate and outperform traditional manual analysis, widespread adoption of these techniques has yet to be realised in the field of immunology. Here we present CytoPy, a Python framework for automated analysis of cytometry data that integrates a document-based database for a data-centric and iterative analytical environment. In addition, our algorithm agnostic design provides a platform for open-source cytometry bioinformatics in the Python ecosystem. We demonstrate the ability of CytoPy to phenotype T cell subsets in whole blood samples even in the presence of significant batch effects due to technical and user variation. The complete analytical pipeline was then used to immunophenotype the local inflammatory infiltrate in individuals with and without acute bacterial infection.

	<description>Tonic activity in the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which holds the upper eyelid open, is interrupted during blinks. Here we demonstrate a monosynpatic pathway from cells distributed along the rostral edge of the principal trigeminal nucleus that targets, and presumably inhibits, levator motoneurons for blinks triggered from the face.






Abstract
For normal viewing, the eyes are held open by the tonic actions of the levator palpebrae superioris (levator) muscle raising the upper eyelid. This activity is interrupted during blinks, when the eyelid sweeps down to spread the tear film or protect the cornea. We examined the circuit connecting the principal trigeminal nucleus to the levator motoneurons by use of both anterograde and retrograde tracers in macaque monkeys. Injections of anterograde tracer were made into the principal trigeminal nucleus using either a stereotaxic approach or localization following physiological characterization of trigeminal second order neurons. Anterogradely labeled axonal arbors were located both within the caudal central subdivision, which contains levator motoneurons, and in the adjacent supraoculomotor area. Labeled boutons made synaptic contacts on retrogradely labeled levator motoneurons indicating a monosynaptic connection. As the eye is also retracted through the actions of the rectus muscles during a blink, we examined whether these trigeminal injections labeled boutons contacting rectus motoneurons within the oculomotor nucleus. These were not found when the injection sites were confined to the principal trigeminal nucleus region. To identify the source of the projection to the levator motoneurons, we injected retrograde tracer into the oculomotor complex. Retrogradely labeled cells were confined to a narrow, dorsoventrally oriented cell population that lined the rostral edge of the principal trigeminal nucleus. Presumably these cells inhibit levator motoneurons, while other parts of the trigeminal sensory complex are activating orbicularis oculi motoneurons, when a blink is initiated by sensory stimuli contacting the face.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A common view on the brain learning processes proposes that the three classic
learning paradigms -- unsupervised, reinforcement, and supervised -- take place
in respectively the cortex, the basal-ganglia, and the cerebellum. However,
dopamine outbursts, usually assumed to encode reward, are not limited to the
basal ganglia but also reach prefrontal, motor, and higher sensory cortices. We
propose that in the cortex the same reward-based trial-and-error processes
might support not only the acquisition of motor representations but also of
sensory representations. In particular, reward signals might guide
trial-and-error processes that mix with associative learning processes to
support the acquisition of representations better serving downstream action
selection. We tested the soundness of this hypothesis with a computational
model that integrates unsupervised learning (Contrastive Divergence) and
reinforcement learning (REINFORCE). The model was tested with a task requiring
different responses to different visual images grouped in categories involving
either colour, shape, or size. Results show that a balanced mix of unsupervised
and reinforcement learning processes leads to the best performance. Indeed,
excessive unsupervised learning tends to under-represent task-relevant features
while excessive reinforcement learning tends to initially learn slowly and then
to incur in local minima. These results stimulate future empirical studies on
category learning directed to investigate similar effects in the extrastriate
visual cortices. Moreover, they prompt further computational investigations
directed to study the possible advantages of integrating unsupervised and
reinforcement learning processes.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the nervous system are submitted to distinct sources of noise,
such as ionic-channel and synaptic noise, which introduces variability in their
responses to repeated presentations of identical stimuli. This motivates the
use of stochastic models to describe neuronal behavior. In this work, we
characterize an intrinsically stochastic neuron model based on a
voltage-dependent spike probability function. We determine the effect of the
intrinsic noise in single neurons by measuring the spike time reliability and
study the stochastic resonance phenomenon. The model was able to show increased
reliability for non-zero intrinsic noise values, according to what is known
from the literature, and the addition of intrinsic stochasticity in it enhanced
the region in which stochastic resonance is present. We proceeded to the study
at the network level where we investigated the behavior of a random network
composed of stochastic neurons. In this case, the addition of an extra
dimension, represented by the intrinsic noise, revealed dynamic states of the
system that could not be found otherwise. Finally, we propose a method to
estimate the spike probability curve from in vitro electrophysiological data.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;One-shot learning can be achieved by algorithms and animals, but how the
latter do it is poorly understood as most of the algorithms are not
biologically plausible. Experiments studying one-shot learning in rodents have
shown that after initial gradual learning of associations between cues and
locations, new associations can be learned with just a single exposure to each
new cue-location pair. Foster, Morris and Dayan (2000) developed a hybrid
temporal difference - symbolic model that exhibited one-shot learning for dead
reckoning to displaced single locations. While the temporal difference rule for
learning the agent's actual coordinates was biologically plausible, the model's
symbolic mechanism for learning target coordinates was not, and one-shot
learning for multiple target locations was not addressed. Here we extend the
model by replacing the symbolic mechanism with a reservoir of recurrently
connected neurons resembling cortical microcircuitry. Biologically plausible
learning of target coordinates was achieved by subjecting the reservoir's
output weights to synaptic plasticity governed by a novel 4-factor variant of
the exploratory Hebbian (EH) rule. As with rodents, the reservoir model
exhibited one-shot learning for multiple paired associations.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Noninvasive medical neuroimaging has yielded many discoveries about the brain
connectivity. Several substantial techniques mapping morphological, structural
and functional brain connectivities were developed to create a comprehensive
road map of neuronal activities in the human brain -namely brain graph. Relying
on its non-Euclidean data type, graph neural network (GNN) provides a clever
way of learning the deep graph structure and it is rapidly becoming the
state-of-the-art leading to enhanced performance in various network
neuroscience tasks. Here we review current GNN-based methods, highlighting the
ways that they have been used in several applications related to brain graphs
such as missing brain graph synthesis and disease classification. We conclude
by charting a path toward a better application of GNN models in network
neuroscience field for neurological disorder diagnosis and population graph
integration. The list of papers cited in our work is available at

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The relationship of network structure and dynamics is one of most extensively
investigated problems in the theory of complex systems of the last years.
Understanding this relationship is of relevance to a range of disciplines --
from Neuroscience to Geomorphology. A major strategy of investigating this
relationship is the quantitative comparison of a representation of network
architecture (structural connectivity) with a (network) representation of the
dynamics (functional connectivity). Analysing such SC/FC relationships has over
the past years contributed substantially to our understanding of the functional
role of network properties, such as modularity, hierarchical organization, hubs
and cycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we show that one can distinguish two classes of functional connectivity
-- one based on simultaneous activity (co-activity) of nodes the other based on
sequential activity of nodes. We delineate these two classes in different
categories of dynamical processes -- excitations, regular and chaotic
oscillators -- and provide examples for SC/FC correlations of both classes in
each of these models. We expand the theoretical view of the SC/FC
relationships, with conceptual instances of the SC and the two classes of FC
for various application scenarios in Geomorphology, Freshwater Ecology, Systems
Biology, Neuroscience and Social-Ecological Systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the organization of a dynamical processes in a network either as
governed by co-activity or by sequential activity allows us to bring some order
in the myriad of observations relating structure and function of complex
networks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual search is a ubiquitous and often challenging daily task, exemplified
by looking for the car keys at home or a friend in a crowd. An intriguing
property of some classical search tasks is an asymmetry such that finding a
target A among distractors B can be easier than finding B among A. To elucidate
the mechanisms responsible for asymmetry in visual search, we propose a
computational model that takes a target and a search image as inputs and
produces a sequence of eye movements until the target is found. The model
integrates eccentricity-dependent visual recognition with target-dependent
top-down cues. We compared the model against human behavior in six paradigmatic
search tasks that show asymmetry in humans. Without prior exposure to the
stimuli or task-specific training, the model provides a plausible mechanism for
search asymmetry. We hypothesized that the polarity of search asymmetry arises
from experience with the natural environment. We tested this hypothesis by
training the model on an augmented version of ImageNet where the biases of
natural images were either removed or reversed. The polarity of search
asymmetry disappeared or was altered depending on the training protocol. This
study highlights how classical perceptual properties can emerge in neural
network models, without the need for task-specific training, but rather as a
consequence of the statistical properties of the developmental diet fed to the
model. All source code and stimuli are publicly available

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-regional interaction among neuronal populations underlies the brain's
processing of rich sensory information in our daily lives. Recent neuroscience
and neuroimaging studies have increasingly used naturalistic stimuli and
experimental design to identify such realistic sensory computation in the
brain. However, existing methods for cross-areal interaction analysis with
dimensionality reduction, such as reduced-rank regression and canonical
correlation analysis, have limited applicability and interpretability in
naturalistic settings because they usually do not appropriately 'demix' neural
interactions into those associated with different types of task parameters or
stimulus features (e.g., visual or audio). In this paper, we develop a new
method for cross-areal interaction analysis that uses the rich task or stimulus
parameters to reveal how and what types of information are shared by different
neural populations. The proposed neural demixed shared component analysis
combines existing dimensionality reduction methods with a practical neural
network implementation of functional analysis of variance with latent
variables, thereby efficiently demixing nonlinear effects of continuous and
multimodal stimuli. We also propose a simplifying alternative under the
assumptions of linear effects and unimodal stimuli. To demonstrate our methods,
we analyzed two human neuroimaging datasets of participants watching
naturalistic videos of movies and dance movements. The results demonstrate that
our methods provide new insights into multi-regional interaction in the brain
during naturalistic sensory inputs, which cannot be captured by conventional
techniques.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: IM-META: Influence Maximization Using Node Metadata in Networks With Unknown Topology. (arXiv:2106.02926v1 [cs.SI])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In real-world applications of influence maximization (IM), the network
structure is often unknown. In this case, we may identify the most influential
seed nodes by exploring only a part of the underlying network given a small
budget for node queries. Motivated by the fact that collecting node metadata is
more cost-effective than investigating the relationship between nodes via
queried nodes, we develop IM-META, an end-to-end solution to IM in networks
with unknown topology by retrieving information from both queries and node
metadata. However, using such metadata to aid the IM process is not without
risk due to the noisy nature of metadata and uncertainties in connectivity
inference. To tackle these challenges, we formulate an IM problem that aims to
find two sets, i.e., seed nodes and queried nodes. We propose an effective
method that iteratively performs three steps: 1) we learn the relationship
between collected metadata and edges via a Siamese neural network model, 2) we
select a number of inferred influential edges to construct a reinforced graph
used for discovering an optimal seed set, and 3) we identify the next node to
query by maximizing the inferred influence spread using a topology-aware
ranking strategy. By querying only 5% of nodes, IM-META reaches 93% of the
upper bound performance.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modern drug discovery is often time-consuming, complex and cost-ineffective
due to the large volume of molecular data and complicated molecular properties.
Recently, machine learning algorithms have shown promising results in virtual
screening of automated drug discovery by predicting molecular properties. While
emerging learning methods such as graph neural networks and recurrent neural
networks exhibit high accuracy, they are also notoriously computation-intensive
and memory-intensive with operations such as feature embeddings or deep
convolutions. In this paper, we propose a viable alternative to neural network
classifiers. We present MoleHD, a method based on brain-inspired
hyperdimensional computing (HDC) for molecular property prediction. We first
transform the SMILES presentation of molecules into feature vectors by SMILE-PE
tokenizers pretrained on the ChEMBL database. Then, we develop HDC encoders to
project such features into high-dimensional vectors that are used for training
and inference. We perform an extensive evaluation using 30 classification tasks
from 3 widely-used molecule datasets and compare MoleHD with 10 baseline
methods including 6 SOTA neural network classifiers. Results show that MoleHD
is able to outperform all the baseline methods on average across 30
classification tasks with significantly reduced computing cost. To the best of
our knowledge, we develop the first HDC-based method for drug discovery. The
promising results presented in this paper can potentially lead to a novel path
in drug discovery research.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The duality of sensory inference and optimal control was known since 1960s
and has recently been recognized as common computations required for posterior
distributions in dynamic Bayesian inference and value functions in optimal
control. Meanwhile, an intriguing question about the brain is why entire
neocortex shares a canonical six-layer architecture, while its posterior and
anterior halves are engaged in sensory processing and motor control,
respectively. Here we consider a hypothesis that the anterior and posterior
cortical circuits evolved for dual computations for sensory inference and
optimal control, or perceptual and value-based decision making, respectively.
We explore how different types of cortical neurons may represent different
variables, such as prior and posterior distributions and value functions, and
what cortical dynamics may realize required computations. We further discuss
experimental and computational approaches are required for scrutinizing this
dual cortical circuit hypothesis.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks excel at image classification, but their performance is
far less robust to input perturbations than human perception. In this work we
explore whether this shortcoming may be partly addressed by incorporating
brain-inspired recurrent dynamics in deep convolutional networks. We take
inspiration from a popular framework in neuroscience: 'predictive coding'. At
each layer of the hierarchical model, generative feedback 'predicts' (i.e.,
reconstructs) the pattern of activity in the previous layer. The reconstruction
errors are used to iteratively update the network's representations across
timesteps, and to optimize the network's feedback weights over the natural
image dataset-a form of unsupervised training. We show that implementing this
strategy into two popular networks, VGG16 and EfficientNetB0, improves their
robustness against various corruptions. We hypothesize that other feedforward
networks could similarly benefit from the proposed framework. To promote
research in this direction, we provide an open-sourced PyTorch-based package
called Predify, which can be used to implement and investigate the impacts of
the predictive coding dynamics in any convolutional neural network.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;People differ in how they attend to, interpret, and respond to their
surroundings. Convergent processing of the world may be one factor that
contributes to social connections between individuals. We used neuroimaging and
network analysis to investigate whether the most central individuals in their
communities (as measured by in-degree centrality, a notion of popularity)
process the world in a particularly normative way. More central individuals had
exceptionally similar neural responses to their peers and especially to each
other in brain regions associated with high-level interpretations and social
cognition (e.g., in the default-mode network), whereas less-central individuals
exhibited more idiosyncratic responses. Self-reported enjoyment of and interest
in stimuli followed a similar pattern, but accounting for these data did not
change our main results. These findings suggest an &quot;Anna Karenina principle&quot; in
social networks: Highly-central individuals process the world in exceptionally
similar ways, whereas less-central individuals process the world in
idiosyncratic ways.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02681</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The adaptive changes in synaptic efficacy that occur between spiking neurons
have been demonstrated to play a critical role in learning for biological
neural networks. Despite this source of inspiration, many learning focused
applications using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) retain static synaptic
connections, preventing additional learning after the initial training period.
Here, we introduce a framework for simultaneously learning the underlying
fixed-weights and the rules governing the dynamics of synaptic plasticity and
neuromodulated synaptic plasticity in SNNs through gradient descent. We further
demonstrate the capabilities of this framework on a series of challenging
benchmarks, learning the parameters of several plasticity rules including BCM,
Oja's, and their respective set of neuromodulatory variants. The experimental
results display that SNNs augmented with differentiable plasticity are
sufficient for solving a set of challenging temporal learning tasks that a
traditional SNN fails to solve, even in the presence of significant noise.
These networks are also shown to be capable of producing locomotion on a
high-dimensional robotic learning task, where near-minimal degradation in
performance is observed in the presence of novel conditions not seen during the
initial training period.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Deep Residual Learning in Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:2102.04159v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) present optimization difficulties for
gradient-based approaches due to discrete binary activation and complex
spatial-temporal dynamics. Considering the huge success of ResNet in deep
learning, it would be natural to train deep SNNs with residual learning.
Previous Spiking ResNet mimics the standard residual block in ANNs and simply
replaces ReLU activation layers with spiking neurons, which suffers the
degradation problem and can hardly implement residual learning. In this paper,
we propose the spike-element-wise (SEW) ResNet to realize residual learning in
deep SNNs. We prove that the SEW ResNet can easily implement identity mapping
and overcome the vanishing/exploding gradient problems of Spiking ResNet. We
evaluate our SEW ResNet on ImageNet and DVS Gesture datasets, and show that SEW
ResNet outperforms the state-of-the-art directly trained SNNs in both accuracy
and time-steps. Moreover, SEW ResNet can achieve higher performance by simply
adding more layers, providing a simple method to train deep SNNs. To our best
knowledge, this is the first time that directly training deep SNNs with more
than 100 layers becomes possible.

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Combination of Electroacupuncture and Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy Enhances Functional Recovery After Ischemic Stroke in Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-021-01863-1</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Both electroacupuncture and constraint-induced movement therapy have been reported to produce therapeutic effects on the recovery of ischemic stroke. The combined use of these two therapies is not rare clinically, although its effectiveness is not yet clear. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of electroacupuncture and constraint-induced movement therapy in ischemic stroke rats, and to explore the potential molecular mechanisms. Ischemic stroke rat models were established by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Then, the rats were assigned to receive one of the following interventions: sole electroacupuncture, sole constraint-induced movement therapy, the combination of both therapies, and no treatment. Functional recovery was assessed with the beam balance test and rotarod test. The infarct volume of the brain and the expression of the molecules Nogo-A, P75&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;, NGF, BDNF, and VEGF in the brain tissue were investigated. The results demonstrated that the combination of the two therapies significantly improved neurological functional recovery in ischemic stroke rats compared to each therapy alone (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). We also observed a significant decrease in infarct volume in rats receiving the combined treatment. Nogo-A and P75&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; were downregulated and NGF, BDNF, and VEGF were upregulated in the combined treatment rats compared to the control rats. In conclusion, the combination of electroacupuncture and constraint-induced movement therapy enhanced functional recovery after ischemic stroke in rats, and it is a promising treatment strategy in the rehabilitation of stroke. The anti-Nogo-A effect of electroacupuncture may explain its good compatibility with CIMT in ischemic stroke rats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Neuroinformatics: Multiple Functional Brain Networks Related to Pain Perception Revealed by fMRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12021-021-09527-6</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The rise of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has led to a deeper understanding of cortical processing of pain. Central to these advances has been the identification and analysis of “functional networks”, often derived from groups of pre-selected pain regions. In this study our main objective was to identify functional brain networks related to pain perception by examining whole-brain activation, avoiding the need for a priori selection of regions. We applied a data-driven technique—Constrained Principal Component Analysis for fMRI (fMRI-CPCA)—that identifies networks without assuming their anatomical or temporal properties. Open-source fMRI data collected during a thermal pain task (33 healthy participants) were subjected to fMRI-CPCA for network extraction, and networks were associated with pain perception by modelling subjective pain ratings as a function of network activation intensities. Three functional networks emerged: a sensorimotor response network, a salience-mediated attention network, and the default-mode network. Together, these networks constituted a brain state that explained variability in pain perception, both within and between individuals, demonstrating the potential of data-driven, whole-brain functional network techniques for the analysis of pain imaging data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Here while we reminisce about how &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;partial directed coherence&lt;/em&gt; was proposed, its motivation and evolution, we take the opportunity to relate it to some of its kin quantities and some of its offspring. Emphasis is placed on our development of asymptotic criteria to place it as a reliable investigation tool, where the connectivity detection problem is completely solved as opposed to what we call the characterization problem. We end by musing over some points now on our wishlist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Aphasia is a recognized presenting symptom of thalamic lesions. Little is known regarding its frequency and phenotype. We examined the frequency of thalamic aphasia following Isolated Acute unilateral ischemic Lesions in the Thalamus (IALT) with respect to lesion location. Furthermore, we characterized thalamic aphasia according to affected language domains and severity.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Fifty-two patients with IALT were analyzed [44% female, median age: 73 years (IQR: 60–79)]. Lesion location was determined using 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging and categorized as anterior, posterior, paramedian or inferolateral. Standardized language assessment was performed using the validated Aphasia checklist (ACL) directly after symptom onset. Aphasia was defined as an ACL sum score of &amp;lt; 135 (range: 0–148).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Of 52 patients, 23 (44%) fulfilled the ACL diagnostic criteria for aphasia, including nearly all lesion locations and both sides. The average ACL sum score was 132 ± 11 (range: 98–147). Aphasia was characterized by deficits within domains of complex understanding of speech and verbal fluency. Patients with left anterior IALT were most severely affected, having significantly lower ACL scores than all other patients (117 ± 13 vs. 135 ± 8; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In particular, aphasia in patients with left anterior IALT was characterized by significantly worse performance in the rating of verbal communication, verbal fluency, and naming (all &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; ≤ 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Aphasia occurs in almost half of patients with focal thalamic lesions. Thalamic aphasia is not confined to one predefined thalamic lesion location, but language deficits are particularly pronounced in patients with left anterior IALT presenting with a distinct pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The etiology of transient global amnesia (TGA) is still a matter of debate. Based, among others, on the observation of a close temporal relation between certain events and subsequent TGA episodes, recent proposals discuss the relevance of stress-associated processes impacting on hippocampal functioning. Circadian, infra- and ultradian rhythmicity has been found to play a relevant role in the multifactorial pathomechanisms of various disorders but has not been thoroughly studied in TGA.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Data of patients with a final diagnosis of TGA were collected in Mannheim, Germany (06/1999–01/2018, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 404), and in the Kansai district, Japan (04/2006–03/2018, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 261). Chronological patterns of TGA occurrence were determined.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Significant circadian rhythmicity of TGA occurrence with bimodal peaks (mid-morning, late afternoon) was found for the entire population (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002) and for either sub-cohort (Mannheim: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003, Kansai: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007). This finding was confirmed for either sex (women: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004, men: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004) and different age groups (&amp;lt; 65 years: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0009, ≥ 65 years: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003). There was no variation according to day of the week, month or season, but the proportion of patients with a weekday episode was significantly higher in the Mannheim cohort (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We identified a robust circadian rhythm in TGA occurrence which remarkably applied to either of the two study sites located on different continents and which was independent of sex and age. In light of abundant evidence of circadian rhythmicity of both, components of the human stress response system and memory, chronobiological analyses may provide an opportunity to further uncover the mechanisms underlying TGA.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Electrophysiological aftereffects of high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (hf-tRNS): an EEG investigation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06142-4</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;There is evidence that high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (hf-tRNS) is effective in improving behavioural performance in several visual tasks. However, so far there has been limited research into the spatial and temporal characteristics of hf-tRNS-induced facilitatory effects. In the present study, electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of cortical activity modulated by &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;offline&lt;/em&gt; hf-tRNS on performance on a motion direction discrimination task. We used EEG to measure the amplitude of motion-related VEPs over the parieto-occipital cortex, as well as oscillatory power spectral density (PSD) at rest. A time–frequency decomposition analysis was also performed to investigate the shift in event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) in response to the motion stimuli between the pre- and post-stimulation period. The results showed that the accuracy of the motion direction discrimination task was not modulated by &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;offline&lt;/em&gt; hf-tRNS. Although the motion task was able to elicit motion-dependent VEP components (P1, N2, and P2), none of them showed any significant change between pre- and post-stimulation. We also found a time-dependent increase of the PSD in alpha and beta bands regardless of the stimulation protocol. Finally, time–frequency analysis showed a modulation of ERSP power in the hf-tRNS condition for gamma activity when compared to pre-stimulation periods and Sham stimulation. Overall, these results show that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;offline&lt;/em&gt; hf-tRNS may induce moderate aftereffects in brain oscillatory activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Nociception induces a differential presynaptic modulation of the synaptic efficacy of nociceptive and proprioceptive joint afferents</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A previous study has indicated that during the state of central sensitization induced by the intradermic injection of capsaicin, there is a gradual facilitation of the dorsal horn neuronal responses produced by stimulation of the high-threshold articular afferents that is counteracted by a concurrent increase of descending inhibitory actions. Since these changes occurred without significantly affecting the responses produced by stimulation of the low-threshold articular afferents, it was suggested that the capsaicin-induced descending inhibition included a preferential presynaptic modulation of the synaptic efficacy of the slow conducting nociceptive joint afferents (Ramírez-Morales et al., Exp Brain Res 237:1629–1641, 2019). The present study was aimed to investigate more directly the contribution of presynaptic mechanisms in this descending control. We found that in the barbiturate anesthetized cat, stimulation of the high-threshold myelinated afferents in the posterior articular nerve (PAN) produces primary afferent hyperpolarization (PAH) in the slow conducting (25–35 m/s) and primary afferent depolarization (PAD) in the fast conducting (40–50 m/s) articular fibers. During the state of central sensitization induced by capsaicin, there is a supraspinally mediated shift of the autogenic PAH to PAD that takes place in the slow conducting fibers, basically without affecting the autogenic PAD generated in the fast conducting afferents. It is suggested that the change of presynaptic facilitation to presynaptic inhibition induced by capsaicin on the slow articular afferents is part of an homeostatic process aimed to keep the nociceptive-induced neuronal activity within manageable limits while preserving the proprioceptive information required for proper control of movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Correcting MEG Artifacts Caused by Overt Speech</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682419</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682419</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recording brain activity during speech production using magnetoencephalography (MEG) can help us to understand the dynamics of speech production. However, these measurements are challenging due to the induced artifacts coming from several sources such as facial muscle activity, lower jaw and head movements. Here, we aimed to characterize speech-related artifacts, focusing on head movements, and subsequently present an approach to remove these artifacts from MEG data. We recorded MEG from 11 healthy participants while they pronounced various syllables in different loudness. Head positions/orientations were extracted during speech production to investigate its role in MEG distortions. Finally, we present an artifact rejection approach using the combination of regression analysis and signal space projection (SSP) in order to correct the induced artifact from MEG data. Our results show that louder speech leads to stronger head movements and stronger MEG distortions. Our proposed artifact rejection approach could successfully remove the speech-related artifact and retrieve the underlying neurophysiological signals. As the presented artifact rejection approach was shown to remove artifacts arising from head movements, induced by overt speech in the MEG, it will facilitate research addressing the neural basis of speech production with MEG.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Development and Validation of a Semi-Automated, Preclinical, MRI-Template Based PET Image Data Analysis Tool for Rodents</title>

	<description>Aim&lt;p&gt;In PET imaging, the different types of radiotracers and accumulations, as well as the diversity of disease patterns, make the analysis of molecular imaging data acquired in vivo challenging. Here, we evaluate and validate a semi-automated MRI template-based data analysis tool that allows preclinical PET images to be aligned to a self-created PET template. Based on the user-defined volume-of-interest (VOI), image data can then be evaluated using three different semi-quantitative parameters: normalized activity, standardized uptake value, and uptake ratio.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;The nuclear medicine Data Processing Analysis tool (NU_DPA) was implemented in Matlab. Testing and validation of the tool was performed using two types of radiotracers in different kinds of stroke-related brain diseases in rat models. The radiotracers used are 2-[&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG), a metabolic tracer with symmetrical distribution in brain, and [&lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga]Ga-Fucoidan, a target-selective radioligand specifically binding to p-selectin. After manual image import, the NU_DPA tool automatically creates an averaged PET template out of the acquired PET images, to which all PET images are then aligned onto. The added MRI template-based information, resized to the lower PET resolution, defines the VOI and also allows a precise subdivision of the VOI into individual sub-regions. The aligned PET images can then be evaluated semi-quantitatively for all regions defined in the MRI atlas. In addition, a statistical analysis and evaluation of the semi-quantitative parameters can then be performed in the NU_DPA tool.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Using ischemic stroke data in Wistar rats as an example, the statistical analysis of the tool should be demonstrated. In this [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG-PET experiment, three different experimental states were compared: healthy control state, ischemic stroke without electrical stimulation, ischemic stroke with electrical stimulation. Thereby, statistical data evaluation using the NU_DPA tool showed that the glucose metabolism in a photothrombotic lesion can be influenced by electrical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our NU_DPA tool allows a very flexible data evaluation of small animal PET data in vivo including statistical data evaluation. Using the radiotracers [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG and [&lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga]Ga-Fucoidan, it was shown that the semi-automatic MRI-template based data analysis of the NU_DPA tool is potentially suitable for both metabolic radiotracers as well as target-selective radiotracers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Localization of the Epileptogenic Zone by Multimodal Neuroimaging and High-Frequency Oscillation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.677840</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.677840</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) is a key factor to obtain good surgical outcome for refractory epilepsy patients. However, no technique, so far, can precisely locate the EZ, and there are barely any reports on the combined application of multiple technologies to improve the localization accuracy of the EZ. In this study, we aimed to explore the use of a multimodal method combining PET-MRI, fluid and white matter suppression (FLAWS)—a novel MRI sequence, and high-frequency oscillation (HFO) automated analysis to delineate EZ. We retrospectively collected 15 patients with refractory epilepsy who underwent surgery and used the above three methods to detect abnormal brain areas of all patients. We compared the PET-MRI, FLAWS, and HFO results with traditional methods to evaluate their diagnostic value. The sensitivities, specificities of locating the EZ, and marking extent removed versus not removed [RatioChann(ev)] of each method were compared with surgical outcome. We also tested the possibility of using different combinations to locate the EZ. The marked areas in every patient established using each method were also compared to determine the correlations among the three methods. The results showed that PET-MRI, FLAWS, and HFOs can provide more information about potential epileptic areas than traditional methods. When detecting the EZs, the sensitivities of PET-MRI, FLAWS, and HFOs were 68.75, 53.85, and 87.50%, and the specificities were 80.00, 33.33, and 100.00%. The RatioChann(ev) of HFO-marked contacts was significantly higher in patients with good outcome than those with poor outcome (p&amp;lt; 0.05). When intracranial electrodes covered all the abnormal areas indicated by neuroimaging with the overlapping EZs being completely removed referred to HFO analysis, patients could reach seizure-free (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The periphery of the lesion marked by neuroimaging may be epileptic, but not every lesion contributes to seizures. Therefore, approaches in multimodality can detect EZ more accurately, and HFO analysis may help in defining real epileptic areas that may be missed in the neuroimaging results. The implantation of intracranial electrodes guided by non-invasive PET-MRI and FLAWS findings as well as HFO analysis would be an optimized multimodal approach for locating EZ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: MR Tractography-Based Targeting and Physiological Identification of the Cuneiform Nucleus for Directional DBS in a Parkinson’s Disease Patient With Levodopa-Resistant Freezing of Gait</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.676755</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.676755</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating motor deficit in a subset of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients that is poorly responsive to levodopa or deep brain stimulation (DBS) of established PD targets. The proposal of a DBS target in the midbrain, known as the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), to address FOG was based on its observed neuropathology in PD and its hypothesized involvement in locomotor control as a part of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). Initial reports of PPN DBS were met with enthusiasm; however, subsequent studies reported mixed results. A closer review of the MLR basic science literature, suggests that the closely related cuneiform nucleus (CnF), dorsal to the PPN, may be a superior site to promote gait. Although suspected to have a conserved role in the control of gait in humans, deliberate stimulation of a homolog to the CnF in humans using directional DBS electrodes has not been attempted.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;As part of an open-label Phase 1 clinical study, one PD patient with predominantly axial symptoms and severe FOG refractory to levodopa therapy was implanted with directional DBS electrodes (Boston Science Vercise Cartesia&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) targeting the CnF bilaterally. Since the CnF is a poorly defined reticular nucleus, targeting was guided both by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography and anatomical landmarks. Intraoperative stimulation and microelectrode recordings were performed near the targets with leg EMG surface recordings in the subject.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Post-operative imaging revealed accurate targeting of both leads to the designated CnF. Intraoperative stimulation near the target at low thresholds in the awake patient evoked involuntary electromyography (EMG) oscillations in the legs with a peak power at the stimulation frequency, similar to observations with CnF DBS in animals. Oscillopsia was the primary side effect evoked at higher currents, especially when directed posterolaterally. Directional DBS could mitigate oscillopsia.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;DTI-based targeting and intraoperative stimulation to evoke limb EMG activity may be useful methods to help target the CnF accurately and safely in patients. Long term follow-up and detailed gait testing of patients undergoing CnF stimulation will be necessary to confirm the effects on FOG.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration&lt;p&gt;Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04218526.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Objectives&lt;p&gt;To investigate the improvement effect of occipital repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with escitalopram oxalate tablets on pre-attentive processing in patients with first-episode, medication-naive depression.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Patients who were hospitalized between January and December 2019 were selected. They were randomly allocated to real occipital rTMS stimulation group with 27 cases receiving intermittent theta-burst (iTBS) and sham stimulation group with 24 cases over 20 days. The rTMS treatment target is located at the Oz point of the occipital region. Both groups took escitalopram oxalate tablets, and the average daily drug dose was 15.294 ± 5.041 mg. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was used to assess the symptoms of depression before and after treatment, and mismatch negativity (MMN) was used to assess the improvement of pre-attentive processing before and after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;After 20 days of treatment, the total score of HAMD (13.495 ± 3.700) in both groups was significantly lower than that before treatment [21.910 ± 3.841, F(1, 49) = 46, 3.690, p &amp;lt; 0.001]. After treatment, the latency of MMN in the real stimulation group (182.204 ± 31.878 ms) was significantly lower than that in the sham stimulation group (219.896 ± 42.634 ms, p &amp;lt; 0.001), and the amplitude of MMN in the real stimulation group (−7.107 ± 3.374 ms) was significantly higher than that in the sham stimulation group (−2.773 ± 3.7 32 ms, p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Occipital rTMS treatment can enhance the early therapeutic effect and effectively improve the pre-attentive processing of patients with depression and provide a scientific basis for the new target of rTMS therapy in clinical patients with depression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Analysis of Fine Motor Skills in Essential Tremor: Combining Neuroimaging and Handwriting Biomarkers for Early Management</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Essential tremor (ET) is a highly prevalent neurological disorder characterized by action-induced tremors involving the hand, voice, head, and/or face. Importantly, hand tremor is present in nearly all forms of ET, resulting in impaired fine motor skills and diminished quality of life. To advance early diagnostic approaches for ET, automated handwriting tasks and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer an opportunity to develop early essential clinical biomarkers. In this study, we present a novel approach for the early clinical diagnosis and monitoring of ET based on integrating handwriting and neuroimaging analysis. We demonstrate how the analysis of fine motor skills, as measured by an automated Archimedes’ spiral task, is correlated with neuroimaging biomarkers for ET. Together, we present a novel modeling approach that can serve as a complementary and promising support tool for the clinical diagnosis of ET and a large range of tremors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sensitivity of the Spatial Distribution of Fixations to Variations in the Type of Task Demand and Its Relation to Visual Entropy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.642535</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ocular activity is known to be sensitive to variations in mental workload, and recent studies have successfully related the distribution of eye fixations to the mental load. This study aimed to verify the effectiveness of the spatial distribution of fixations as a measure of mental workload and its sensitivity to different types of demands imposed by the task: mental, temporal, and physical. To test the research hypothesis, two experimental studies were run: Experiment 1 evaluated the sensitivity of an index of spatial distribution (Nearest Neighbor Index; NNI) to changes in workload. A sample of 30 participants participated in a within-subject design with different types of task demands (mental, temporal, physical) applied to Tetris game; Experiment 2 investigated the accuracy of the index through the analysis of 1-min epochs during the execution of a visual-spatial task (the “spot the differences” puzzle game). Additionally, NNI was compared to a better-known ocular mental workload index, the entropy rate. The data analysis showed a relation between the NNI and the different workload levels imposed by the tasks. In particular: Experiment 1 demonstrated that increased difficulty, due to higher temporal demand, led to a more dispersed pattern with respect to the baseline, whereas the mental demand led to a more grouped pattern of fixations with respect to the baseline; Experiment 2 indicated that the entropy rate and the NNI show a similar pattern over time, indicating high mental workload after the first minute of activity. That suggests that NNI highlights the greater presence of fixation groups and, accordingly, the entropy indicates a more regular and orderly scanpath. Both indices are sensitive to changes in workload and they seem to anticipate the drop in performance. However, the entropy rate is limited by the use of the areas of interest, making it impossible to apply it in dynamic contexts. Conversely, NNI works with the entire scanpath and it shows sensitivity to different types of task demands. These results confirm the NNI as a measure applicable to different contexts and its potential use as a trigger in adaptive systems implemented in high-risk settings, such as control rooms and transportation systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Ictal Occurrence of High-Frequency Oscillations Correlates With Seizure Severity in a Rat Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.624620</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.624620</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;High-frequency oscillations (HFOs, ripples 80–250 Hz, fast ripples 250–500 Hz) are biomarkers of epileptic tissue. They are most commonly observed over areas generating seizures and increase in occurrence during the ictal compared to the interictal period. It has been hypothesized that their rate correlates with the severity of epilepsy and seizure in affected individuals. In the present study, it was aimed to investigate whether the HFO count mirrors the observed behavioral seizure severity using a kainate rat model for temporal lobe epilepsy. Seizures were selected during the chronic epilepsy phase of this model and classified by behavioral severity according to the Racine scale. Seizures with Racine scale 5&amp;amp;6 were considered generalized and severe. HFOs were marked in 24 seizures during a preictal, ictal, and postictal EEG segment. The duration covered by the HFO during these different segments was analyzed and compared between mild and severe seizures. HFOs were significantly increased during ictal periods (p &amp;lt; 0.001) and significantly decreased during postictal periods (p &amp;lt; 0.03) compared to the ictal segment. Ictal ripples (p = 0.04) as well as fast ripples (p = 0.02) were significantly higher in severe seizures compared to mild seizures. The present study demonstrates that ictal HFO occurrence mirrors seizure severity in a chronic focal epilepsy model in rats. This is similar to recent observations in patients with refractory mesio-temporal lobe epilepsy. Moreover, postictal HFO decrease might reflect postictal inhibition of epileptic activity. Overall results provide additional evidence that HFOs can be used as biomarkers for measuring seizure severity in epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Dynamics of the Auditory Continuity Illusion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.676637</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Illusions give intriguing insights into perceptual and neural dynamics. In the auditory continuity illusion, two brief tones separated by a silent gap may be heard as one continuous tone if a noise burst with appropriate characteristics fills the gap. This illusion probes the conditions under which listeners link related sounds across time and maintain perceptual continuity in the face of sudden changes in sound mixtures. Conceptual explanations of this illusion have been proposed, but its neural basis is still being investigated. In this work we provide a dynamical systems framework, grounded in principles of neural dynamics, to explain the continuity illusion. We construct an idealized firing rate model of a neural population and analyze the conditions under which firing rate responses persist during the interruption between the two tones. First, we show that sustained inputs and hysteresis dynamics (a mismatch between tone levels needed to activate and inactivate the population) can produce continuous responses. Second, we show that transient inputs and bistable dynamics (coexistence of two stable firing rate levels) can also produce continuous responses. Finally, we combine these input types together to obtain neural dynamics consistent with two requirements for the continuity illusion as articulated in a well-known theory of auditory scene analysis: responses persist through the noise-filled gap if noise provides sufficient evidence that the tone continues and if there is no evidence of discontinuities between the tones and noise. By grounding these notions in a quantitative model that incorporates elements of neural circuits (recurrent excitation, and mutual inhibition, specifically), we identify plausible mechanisms for the continuity illusion. Our findings can help guide future studies of neural correlates of this illusion and inform development of more biophysically-based models of the auditory continuity illusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: First Encounters: Effects of the Microbiota on Neonatal Brain Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.682505</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The microbiota plays important roles in host metabolism and immunity, and its disruption affects adult brain physiology and behavior. Although such findings have been attributed to altered neurodevelopment, few studies have actually examined microbiota effects on the developing brain. This review focuses on developmental effects of the earliest exposure to microbes. At birth, the mammalian fetus enters a world teeming with microbes which colonize all body sites in contact with the environment. Bacteria reach the gut within a few hours of birth and cause a measurable response in the intestinal epithelium. In adults, the gut microbiota signals to the brain via the vagus nerve, bacterial metabolites, hormones, and immune signaling, and work in perinatal rodents is beginning to elucidate which of these signaling pathways herald the very first encounter with gut microbes in the neonate. Neural effects of the microbiota during the first few days of life include changes in neuronal cell death, microglia, and brain cytokine levels. In addition to these effects of direct exposure of the newborn to microbes, accumulating evidence points to a role for the maternal microbiota in affecting brain development via bacterial molecules and metabolites while the offspring is still in utero. Hence, perturbations to microbial exposure perinatally, such as through C-section delivery or antibiotic treatment, alter microbiota colonization and may have long-term neural consequences. The perinatal period is critical for brain development and a close look at microbiota effects during this time promises to reveal the earliest, most primary effects of the microbiota on neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Gap Junctions Between Striatal D1 Neurons and Cholinergic Interneurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The striatum participates in numerous important behaviors. Its principal projection neurons use GABA and peptides as neurotransmitters and interact extensively with interneurons, including cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) that are tonically active. Dissecting the interactions between projection neurons and ChIs is important for uncovering the role and mechanisms of the striatal microcircuits. Here, by combining several optogenetic tools with cell type-specific electrophysiological recordings, we uncovered direct electrical coupling between D1-type projection neurons and ChIs, in addition to the chemical transmission between these two major cell types. Optogenetic stimulation or inhibition led to bilateral current exchanges between D1 neurons and ChIs, which can be abolished by gap junction blockers. We further confirmed the presence of gap junctions through paired electrophysiological recordings and dye microinjections. Finally, we found that activating D1 neurons promotes basal activity of ChIs via gap junctions. Collectively, these results reveal the coexistence of the chemical synapse and gap junctions between D1 neurons and ChIs, which contributes to maintaining the tonically active firing patterns of ChIs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is one of the most common neurological diseases. However, the impact of ischemic stroke on human cerebral tissue remains largely unknown due to a lack of ischemic human brain samples. In this study, we applied cerebral organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells to evaluate the effect of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Pathway analysis showed the relationships between vitamin digestion and absorption, fat digestion and absorption, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, and complement and coagulation cascades. Combinational verification with transcriptome and gene expression analysis of different cell types revealed fatty acids-related PPAR signaling pathway and pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) as key markers of neuronal cells in response to OGD/R. These findings suggest that, although there remain some limitations to be improved, our ischemic stroke model using human cerebral organoids would be a potentially useful tool when combined with other conventional two-dimensional (2D) mono-culture systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Maternal Deprivation in Rats Decreases the Expression of Interneuron Markers in the Neocortex and Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Early life stress has profound effects on the development of the central nervous system. We exposed 9-day-old rat pups to a 24 h maternal deprivation (MD) and sacrificed them as young adults (60-day-old), with the aim to study the effects of early stress on forebrain circuitry. We estimated numbers of various immunohistochemically defined interneuron subpopulations in several neocortical regions and in the hippocampus. MD rats showed reduced numbers of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex, compared with controls. Numbers of reelin-expressing and calretinin-expressing interneurons were also reduced in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal areas, but unaltered in the neocortex of MD rats. The number of calbinin-expressing interneurons in the neocortex was similar in the MD rats compared with controls. We analyzed cell death in 15-day-old rats after MD and found no difference compared to control rats. Thus, our results more likely reflect the downregulation of markers than the actual loss of interneurons. To investigate synaptic activity in the hippocampus we immunostained for glutamatergic and inhibitory vesicular transporters. The number of inhibitory synapses was decreased in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus in MD rats, with the normal number of excitatory synapses. Our results indicate complex, cell type-specific, and region-specific alterations in the inhibitory circuitry induced by maternal deprivation. Such alterations may underlie symptoms of MD at the behavioral level and possibly contribute to mechanisms by which early life stress causes neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mitophagy in Cerebral Ischemia and Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is a severe cerebrovascular disease with high mortality and morbidity. In recent years, reperfusion treatments based on thrombolytic and thrombectomy are major managements for ischemic stroke patients, and the recanalization time window has been extended to over 24 h. However, with the extension of the time window, the risk of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury following reperfusion therapy becomes a big challenge for patient outcomes. I/R injury leads to neuronal death due to the imbalance in metabolic supply and demand, which is usually related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitophagy is a type of selective autophagy referring to the process of specific autophagic elimination of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria to prevent the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the subsequent cell death. Recent advances have implicated the protective role of mitophagy in cerebral ischemia is mainly associated with its neuroprotective effects in I/R injury. This review discusses the involvement of mitochondria dynamics and mitophagy in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke and I/R injury in particular, focusing on the therapeutic potential of mitophagy regulation and the possibility of using mitophagy-related interventions as an adjunctive approach for neuroprotective time window extension after ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: High-Fat Diet Alleviates Neuroinflammation and Metabolic Disorders of APP/PS1 Mice and the Intervention With Chinese Medicine</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the complex interaction of multiple mechanisms. Recent studies examining the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on the AD phenotype have demonstrated a significant influence on both inflammation and cognition. However, different studies on the effect of high-fat diet on AD pathology have reported conflicting conclusions. To explore the involvement of HFD in AD, we investigated phenotypic and metabolic changes in an AD mouse model in response to HFD. The results indicated there was no significant effect on Aβ levels or contextual memory due to HFD treatment. Of note, HFD did moderate neuroinflammation, despite spurring inflammation and increasing cholesterol levels in the periphery. In addition, diet affected gut microbiota symbiosis, altering the production of bacterial metabolites. HFD created a favorable microenvironment for bile acid alteration and arachidonic acid metabolism in APP/PS1 mice, which may be related to the observed improvement in LXR/PPAR expression. Our previous research demonstrated that Huanglian Jiedu decoction (HLJDD) significantly ameliorated impaired learning and memory. Furthermore, HLJDD may globally suppress inflammation and lipid accumulation to relieve cognitive impairment after HFD intervention. It was difficult to define the effect of HFD on AD progression because the results were influenced by confounding factors and biases. Although there was still obvious damage in AD mice treated with HFD, there was no deterioration and there was even a slight remission of neuroinflammation. Moreover, HLJDD represents a potential AD drug based on its anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;MAP2K5, a member of the MAPK family, is associated with central nervous system disorders. However, neural functional of Map2k5 from animal models were not well examined so far. Here, we established a Map2k5-targeted knockout mouse model to investigate the behavior phenotypes and its underlying molecular mechanism. Our results showed that female Map2k5 mutant mice manifested decreased circadian-dependent ambulatory locomotion, coordination, and fatigue. Male Map2k5 mutant mice displayed impairment in open field exploration and prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle response (ASR) when compared with wild-type controls. Furthermore, Map2k5 mutant mice showed a decreased dopaminergic cell survival and tyrosine hydroxylase levels in nigrostriatal pathway, indicating a crucial role of MAP2K5 in regulating dopamine system in the central nervous system. In conclusion, this is the first study demonstrating that Map2k5 mutant mice displayed phenotypes by disturbing the dopamine system in the central nervous system, implicating Map2k5 mutant mouse as a promising model for many dopamine related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Chromosome 4q deletion is one of the most frequently detected genomic imbalance events in congenital heart disease (CHD) patients. However, a portion of CHD-associated 4q deletions without known CHD genes suggests unknown CHD genes within these intervals. Here, we have shown that knockdown of &lt;i&gt;SORBS2&lt;/i&gt;, a 4q interval gene, disrupted sarcomeric integrity of cardiomyocytes and caused reduced cardiomyocyte number in human embryonic stem cell differentiation model. Molecular analyses revealed decreased expression of second heart field (SHF) marker genes and impaired NOTCH and SHH signaling in &lt;i&gt;SORBS2-&lt;/i&gt;knockdown cells. Exogenous SHH rescued &lt;i&gt;SORBS2&lt;/i&gt; knockdown-induced cardiomyocyte differentiation defects. &lt;i&gt;Sorbs2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse mutants had atrial septal hypoplasia/aplasia or double atrial septum (DAS) derived from impaired posterior SHF with a similar expression alteration. Rare &lt;i&gt;SORBS2&lt;/i&gt; variants were significantly enriched in a cohort of 300 CHD patients. Our findings indicate that &lt;i&gt;SORBS2&lt;/i&gt; is a regulator of SHF development and its variants contribute to CHD pathogenesis. The presence of DAS in &lt;i&gt;Sorbs2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; hearts reveals the first molecular etiology of this rare anomaly linked to paradoxical thromboembolism.</description>

	<title>eLife: High-fidelity, efficient, and reversible labeling of endogenous proteins using CRISPR-based designer exon insertion</title>

	<description>Precise and efficient insertion of large DNA fragments into somatic cells using gene editing technologies to label or modify endogenous proteins remains challenging. Non-specific insertions/deletions (INDELs) resulting from the non-homologous end joining pathway make the process error-prone. Further, the insert is not readily removable. Here, we describe a method called &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;CRISP&lt;/span&gt;R-mediated &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;nsertion of &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;xon (CRISPIE) that can precisely and reversibly label endogenous proteins using CRISPR/Cas9-based editing. CRISPIE inserts a designer donor module, which consists of an exon encoding the protein sequence flanked by intron sequences, into an intronic location in the target gene. INDELs at the insertion junction will be spliced out, leaving mRNAs nearly error-free. We used CRISPIE to fluorescently label endogenous proteins in mammalian neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; with previously unachieved efficiency. We demonstrate that this method is broadly applicable, and that the insert can be readily removed later. CRISPIE permits protein sequence insertion with high fidelity, efficiency, and flexibility.</description>

	<title>eLife: Variations of intracellular density during the cell cycle arise from tip-growth regulation in fission yeast</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.64901</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64901</link>
	<description>Intracellular density impacts the physical nature of the cytoplasm and can globally affect cellular processes, yet density regulation remains poorly understood. Here, using a new quantitative phase imaging method, we determined that dry-mass density in fission yeast is maintained in a narrow distribution and exhibits homeostatic behavior. However, density varied during the cell cycle, decreasing during G2, increasing in mitosis and cytokinesis, and dropping rapidly at cell birth. These density variations were explained by a constant rate of biomass synthesis, coupled to slowdown of volume growth during cell division and rapid expansion post-cytokinesis. Arrest at specific cell-cycle stages exacerbated density changes. Spatially heterogeneous patterns of density suggested links between density regulation, tip growth, and intracellular osmotic pressure. Our results demonstrate that systematic density variations during the cell cycle are predominantly due to modulation of volume expansion, and reveal functional consequences of density gradients and cell-cycle arrests.</description>

	<title>eLife: Live imaging and biophysical modeling support a button-based mechanism of somatic homolog pairing in Drosophila</title>

	<description>3D eukaryotic genome organization provides the structural basis for gene regulation. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, genome folding is characterized by somatic homolog pairing, where homologous chromosomes are intimately paired from end to end; however, how homologs identify one another and pair has remained mysterious. Recently, this process has been proposed to be driven by specifically interacting 'buttons' encoded along chromosomes. Here, we turned this hypothesis into a quantitative biophysical model to demonstrate that a button-based mechanism can lead to chromosome-wide pairing. We tested our model using live-imaging measurements of chromosomal loci tagged with the MS2 and PP7 nascent RNA labeling systems. We show solid agreement between model predictions and experiments in the pairing dynamics of individual homologous loci. Our results strongly support a button-based mechanism of somatic homolog pairing in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and provide a theoretical framework for revealing the molecular identity and regulation of buttons.</description>

	<title>eLife: Spherical arena reveals optokinetic response tuning to stimulus location, size, and frequency across entire visual field of larval zebrafish</title>

	<description>Many animals have large visual fields, and sensory circuits may sample those regions of visual space most relevant to behaviours such as gaze stabilisation and hunting. Despite this, relatively small displays are often used in vision neuroscience. To sample stimulus locations across most of the visual field, we built a spherical stimulus arena with 14,848 independently controllable LEDs. We measured the optokinetic response gain of immobilised zebrafish larvae to stimuli of different steradian size and visual field locations. We find that the two eyes are less yoked than previously thought and that spatial frequency tuning is similar across visual field positions. However, zebrafish react most strongly to lateral, nearly equatorial stimuli, consistent with previously reported spatial densities of red, green and blue photoreceptors. Upside-down experiments suggest further extra-retinal processing. Our results demonstrate that motion vision circuits in zebrafish are anisotropic, and preferentially monitor areas with putative behavioural relevance.</description>

	<title>eLife: miR-125-chinmo pathway regulates dietary restriction dependent enhancement of lifespan in Drosophila</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.62621</guid>

	<description>Dietary restriction (DR) extends healthy lifespan in diverse species. Age and nutrient-related changes in the abundance of microRNAs (miRNAs) and their processing factors have been linked to organismal longevity. However, the mechanisms by which they modulate lifespan and the tissue-specific role of miRNA-mediated networks in DR-dependent enhancement of lifespan remains largely unexplored. We show that two neuronally enriched and highly conserved microRNAs, &lt;i&gt;miR-125&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;let-7&lt;/i&gt; mediate the DR response in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. Functional characterization of &lt;i&gt;miR-125&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates its role in neurons while its target &lt;i&gt;chinmo&lt;/i&gt; acts both in neurons and the fat body to modulate fat metabolism and longevity. Proteomic analysis revealed that Chinmo exerts its DR effects by regulating the expression of &lt;i&gt;FATP, CG2017, CG9577, CG17554, CG5009, CG8778, CG9527&lt;/i&gt;, and&lt;i&gt; FASN1&lt;/i&gt;. Our findings identify &lt;i&gt;miR-125&lt;/i&gt; as a conserved effector of the DR pathway and open the avenue for this small RNA molecule and its downstream effectors to be considered as potential drug candidates for the treatment of late-onset diseases and biomarkers for healthy aging in humans.</description>

	<description>Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in elderly adds substantially to socio-economic burden necessitating early diagnosis. While recent studies in rodent models of AD have suggested diagnostic and therapeutic value for gamma rhythms in brain, the same has not been rigorously tested in humans. In this case-control study, we recruited a large population (N=244; 106 females) of elderly (&amp;gt;49 years) subjects from the community, who viewed large gratings that induced strong gamma oscillations in their electroencephalogram (EEG). These subjects were classified as healthy (N=227), mild-cognitively-impaired (MCI; N=12) or AD (N=5) based on clinical history and Clinical Dementia Rating scores. Surprisingly, stimulus-induced gamma rhythms, but not alpha or steady-state visually evoked responses, were significantly lower in MCI/AD subjects compared to their age and gender matched controls. This reduction was not due to differences in eye-movements or baseline power. Our results suggest that gamma could be used as potential screening tool for MCI/AD in humans.</description>

	<title>eLife: Plexin-B2 controls the timing of differentiation and the motility of cerebellar granule neurons</title>

	<description>Plexin-B2 deletion leads to aberrant lamination of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) and Purkinje cells. Although in the cerebellum Plexin-B2 is only expressed by proliferating CGN precursors in the outer external granule layer (oEGL), its function in CGN development is still elusive. Here, we used 3D imaging, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electroporation and live-imaging techniques to study CGN development in novel cerebellum-specific &lt;i&gt;Plxnb2&lt;/i&gt; conditional knockout mice. We show that proliferating CGNs in &lt;i&gt;Plxnb2&lt;/i&gt; mutants not only escape the oEGL and mix with newborn postmitotic CGNs. Furthermore, motility of mitotic precursors and early postmitotic CGNs is altered. Together, this leads to the formation of ectopic patches of CGNs at the cerebellar surface and an intermingling of normally time-stamped parallel fibers in the molecular layer (ML), and aberrant arborization of Purkinje cell dendrites. There results suggest that Plexin-B2 restricts CGN motility and might have a function in cytokinesis.</description>

	<title>eLife: The push-to-open mechanism of the tethered mechanosensitive ion channel NompC</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58388</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58388</link>
	<description>NompC is a mechanosensitive ion channel responsible for the sensation of touch and balance in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. Based on a resolved cryo-EM structure, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and electrophysiological experiments to study the atomistic details of NompC gating. Our results showed that NompC could be opened by compression of the intracellular ankyrin repeat domain but not by a stretch, and a number of hydrogen bonds along the force convey pathway are important for the mechanosensitivity. Under intracellular compression, the bundled ankyrin repeat region acts like a spring with a spring constant of ~13 pN nm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; by transferring forces at a rate of ~1.8 nm ps&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The linker helix region acts as a bridge between the ankyrin repeats and the transient receptor potential (TRP) domain, which passes on the pushing force to the TRP domain to undergo a clockwise rotation, resulting in the opening of the channel. This could be the universal gating mechanism of similar tethered mechanosensitive TRP channels, which enable cells to feel compression and shrinkage.</description>

	<title>eLife: Start codon disruption with CRISPR/Cas9 prevents murine Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55637</link>
	<description>A missense mutation of collagen type VIII alpha 2 chain (&lt;i&gt;COL8A2&lt;/i&gt;) gene leads to early onset Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), which progressively impairs vision through loss of corneal endothelial cells. We demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9-based postnatal gene editing achieves structural and functional rescue in a mouse model of FECD. A single intraocular injection of an adenovirus encoding both the Cas9 gene and guide RNA (Ad-Cas9-Col8a2gRNA), efficiently knocked down mutant &lt;i&gt;COL8A2&lt;/i&gt; expression in corneal endothelial cells, prevented endothelial cell loss, and rescued corneal endothelium pumping function in adult &lt;i&gt;Col8a2&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice. There were no adverse sequelae on histology or electroretinography. &lt;i&gt;Col8a2&lt;/i&gt; start codon disruption represents a non-surgical strategy to prevent vision loss in early-onset FECD. As this demonstrates the ability of Ad-Cas9-gRNA to restore phenotype in adult post-mitotic cells, this method may be widely applicable to adult-onset diseases, even in tissues affected with disorders of non-reproducing cells.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Potential therapy for progressive vision loss due to PCDH15-associated Usher syndrome developed in an orthologous Usher mouse</title>

	<description>Usher syndrome type I (USH1) is characterized by congenital deafness, vestibular areflexia, and progressive retinal degeneration with age. The protein-truncating p.Arg245* founder variant of PCDH15 has an ~2% carrier frequency among Ashkenazi Jews, accounting for nearly 60% of their USH1 cases. Here, longitudinal ocular phenotyping in thirteen USH1F individuals harboring the p.Arg245* variant revealed progressive retinal degeneration, leading to severe loss of vision with macular atrophy by the sixth decade. Half of the affected individuals met either the visual acuity or visual field loss definition for legal blindness by the middle of their fifth decade of life. Mice homozygous for p.Arg250* (Pcdh15R250X; equivalent to human p.Arg245*) also have early visual deficits evaluated using electroretinography. Light-dependent translocation of phototransduction cascade proteins, arrestin and transducin, was found to be impaired in Pcdh15R250X mice. Retinal pigment epithelium- (RPE) specific visual retinoid cycle proteins, RPE65 which converts all-trans retinoids to 11-cis retinoids and CRALBP that transports retinoids, and key retinoid levels were also reduced in Pcdh15R250X mice, suggesting a dual role for protocadherin-15 in photoreceptors and RPE. Administration of exogenous 9-cis retinal, an analog of the naturally occurring 11-cis retinal, improved ERG amplitudes in these mutant mice, suggesting a basis for a clinical trial of exogenous FDA approved retinoids to preserve vision in USH1F patients.</description>

	<description>Circadian rhythms have natural relative variations among humans known as chronotype. Chronotype or being a morning or evening person, has a specific physiological, behavioural, and also genetic manifestation. Whether and how chronotype modulates human brain physiology and cognition is, however, not well understood. Here we examined how chronotype affects cortical excitability, neuroplasticity, and cognition in early and late chronotype individuals. We monitored motor cortical excitability, brain stimulation-induced neuroplasticity, and examined motor learning and cognitive functions at circadian-preferred and non-preferred times of day in 32 individuals. Motor learning and cognitive performance (working memory, and attention) along with their electrophysiological components were significantly enhanced at the circadian-preferred, compared to the non-preferred time. This outperformance was associated with enhanced cortical excitability (prominent cortical facilitation, diminished cortical inhibition), and long-term potentiation/depression-like plasticity. Our data show convergent findings of the impact of chronotype on human brain functions from basic physiological mechanisms to behaviour and higher cognitive functions.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Bayesian mapping of the striatal microcircuit reveals robust asymmetries in the probabilities and distances of connections</title>

	<description>The striatum's complex microcircuit is made by connections within and between its D1- and D2-receptor expressing projection neurons and at least five species of interneuron. Precise knowledge of this circuit is likely essential to understanding striatum's functional roles and its dysfunction in a wide range of movement and cognitive disorders. We introduce here a Bayesian approach to mapping neuron connectivity using intracellular recording data, which lets us simultaneously evaluate the probability of connection between neuron types, the strength of evidence for it, and its dependence on distance. Using it to synthesise a complete map of the rodent striatum, we find strong evidence for two asymmetries: a selective asymmetry of projection neuron connections, with D2 neurons connecting twice as densely to other projection neurons than do D1 neurons, but neither subtype preferentially connecting to another; and a length-scale asymmetry, with interneuron connection probabilities remaining non-negligible at more than twice the distance of projection neuron connections. We further show our Bayesian approach can evaluate evidence for wiring changes, using data from the developing striatum and a mouse model of Huntington's disease. By quantifying the uncertainty in our knowledge of the microcircuit, our approach reveals a wide range of potential striatal wiring diagrams consistent with current data.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Peer presence and familiarity as key factors to reduce cocaine intake: an effect mediated by the Subthalamic Nucleus</title>

	<description>Stimulant use, including cocaine, often occurs in a social context whose influence is important to understand to decrease intake and reduce associated harms. Given the regulatory role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on cocaine intake and emotions, we investigate its role on such influence of social context on cocaine intake. We explored the influence of peer presence and familiarity on the frequency of self-administered cocaine and its neurobiological basis. We first compared cocaine intake in various conditions (alone or with peers with different characteristics: observing or self-administering, familiar or not, cocaine-naive or not, dominant or subordinate) in rats (n=90). The risk of drug consumption was reduced when a peer was present, observing or self-administering as well, and further diminished when the peer was unfamiliar (vs familiar). The presence of a cocaine-naive peer further decreased cocaine consumption. The presence of a non-familiar and drug-naive peer represents thus key conditions to diminish cocaine intake. We tested the effects of STN lesions in these various conditions and also conducted social experiments to validate the role of STN in social cognition. The STN lesion by itself reduced cocaine intake to the level reached in presence of a stranger naive peer and affected social cognition, positioning the STN as one neurobiological substrate of social influence on drug intake. Finally, with a translational research approach, we compared the drug intake in these conditions in human drug users (n=77). This human study confirmed the beneficial effect of social presence, especially of strangers. Our results indirectly support the use of social interventions and harm reduction strategies, in particular supervised consumption rooms for stimulant users.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Nanoscale organization and calcium influx in dendritic spines guarantee ER store refilling without depletion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.08.447402v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Dendritic spines are critical components of the neuronal synapse as they receive and transform the synaptic input into a succession of biochemical events regulated by calcium signaling. The spine apparatus (SA), an extension of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), regulates slow and fast calcium dynamics in spines. Calcium release events from SA result in a rapid depletion of calcium ion reservoir, yet the next cycle of signaling requires replenishment of SA calcium stores. How dendritic spines achieve this without triggering calcium release remains unclear. Using computational modeling, calcium and STED super-resolution imaging, we showed that the refilling of calcium-deprived SA involves store-operated calcium entry during spontaneous calcium transients in spine heads. We identified two main conditions that guarantee SA replenishment without depletion: (1) a small amplitude and slow timescale for calcium influx, and (2) a close proximity between SA and plasma membranes. Thereby, molecular nano-organization creates the conditions for a clear separation between SA replenishment and depletion. We further conclude that the nanoscale organization of SA receptors underlies the specificity of calcium dynamics patterns during the induction of long-term synaptic changes.</description>

	<description>Mutations linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as intellectual disability (ID), are frequently found in genes that encode for proteins of the excitatory synapse. Transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) are AMPA receptor auxiliary proteins that regulate crucial aspects of receptor function. Here, we investigate an ID-associated mutant form of the TARP family member stargazin. Molecular dynamics analyses showed that the stargazin V143L variant weakens the overall interface of the AMPAR:stargazin complex and hinders the stability of the complex. Knock-in mice for the V143L stargazin mutation manifest cognitive and social deficits and hippocampal synaptic transmission defects. In the hippocampus of stargazin V143L mice, CA1 neurons show impaired spine maturation in basal dendrites, and synaptic ultrastructural alterations. These data demonstrate a causal role for mutated stargazin in the pathogenesis of ID and highlight its role in the development and function of hippocampal synapses.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Rat anterior cingulate cortex continuously signals decision variables in a patchforaging task</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.07.447464v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In patch foraging tasks, animals must decide whether to remain with a depleting resource or to leave it in search of a potentially better source of reward. In such tasks, animals consistently follow the general predictions of optimal foraging theory (the Marginal Value Theorem; MVT): to leave a patch when the reward rate in the current patch depletes to the average reward rate across patches. Prior studies implicate an important role for the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in foraging decisions based on MVT: within single trials, ACC activity increases immediately preceding foraging decisions, and across trials, these dynamics are modulated as the value of staying in the patch depletes to the average reward rate. Here, we test whether these activity patterns reflect dynamic encoding of decision-variables and whether these signals are directly involved in decision-making or serve a more general function such as monitoring task performance or allocating cognitive control. We developed a leaky accumulator model based on the MVT that generates estimates of decision variables within and across trials, and tested model predictions against ACC activity recorded from rats performing a patch foraging task. Model predicted changes in MVT decision variables closely matched rat ACC activity. Next, we pharmacologically inactivated ACC to test the contribution of these signals to decision-making. Despite ACC inactivation, rats still followed the MVT decision rule, suggesting that foraging decision variables represented in the ACC are used for a more general function such as regulating cognitive control or motivation.</description>

	<description>Learning and memory critically rely on long-lasting, synapse-specific modifications. While postsynaptic forms of plasticity typically require local protein synthesis, whether and how local protein synthesis contributes to presynaptic changes remains unclear. Here, we examined the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 synapse which expresses both structural and functional presynaptic plasticity. We report that MF boutons synthesize protein locally and contain ribosomes. Long-term potentiation of MF-CA3 synaptic transmission (MF-LTP) was associated with translation-dependent enlargement of MF boutons. Moreover, increasing in vitro and in vivo MF activity enhanced protein synthesis in MFs. Remarkably, deletion of presynaptic Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein expressed in MF boutons and previously implicated in local postsynaptic protein synthesis-dependent plasticity, blocked structural and functional MF-LTP, suggesting that FMRP is a critical regulator of presynaptic function. Thus, presynaptic FMRP and protein synthesis dynamically control presynaptic structure and function in the mature brain.</description>

	<description>A simple method is derived for estimating the absolute number of axons linking cortical areas from a whole-cortex diffusion-MRI (dMRI) connectome. We estimate the conversion factor from dMRI tractography to axons using the histologically-measured callosal fiber density, then allocate axons between regions in proportion to dMRI connectivity. Median connectivity is estimated as ~2,700 axons between cortical areas within-hemisphere and ~540 axons interhemispherically, with axons connecting functionally-related areas surprisingly sparse.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Activity in the dorsomedial striatum decreases with improvement in motor coordination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.07.447452v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.07.447452v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>It is widely thought that during early stages of motor learning, the dorsomedial striatum facilitates the learning of goal-directed actions, and at later stages, the learned actions are transferred to the dorsolateral striatum, which enables motor actions to become a skill or habit. It is however unknown if these striatal regions are simultaneously active as expertise is acquired during practice. To address this question, we developed a treadmill task to track changes in mouse locomotor coordination during practice running at a range of speeds. We analyzed body position and paw movement to evaluate changes in motor coordination over practice using DeepLabCut and custom-built code. By simultaneous evaluation of motor coordination improvements and fiber photometry recordings of neuronal calcium activity during training, we found that direct pathway dorsomedial striatum neurons exhibited reduced activity as the mouse became proficient at running on the treadmill. In contrast, direct pathway activity in dorsolateral striatum was similar throughout training and did not correlate with increased skill proficiency. These results provide new tools to measure changes in fine motor skills during simultaneous recordings of brain activity, revealing fundamental features of the neural substrates of motor learning.</description>

	<description>Reading creates accessibility to the outer world information and is an integral skill for academic achievement. It involves visual perception, reasoning at symbolic level (text reading) and phonological processing. But does perception, visuospatial processing at pre-symbolic level affect reading skill? To understand and untangle the mechanism fifty children with reading problem (developmental dyslexia, DDC) and twentyfive age-matched typical readers (healthy controls, HC) participated. In DDC, the variable-performance of non-symbolic visual search (pictorial-level) was associated with bilateral brain activity (functional MRI) of ventral stream (inferior occipital and fusiform) and greater involvement of frontal-prefrontal regions, suggesting the modified dorsal route-gating for figure-ground filtering. Performance variability in picture-concept reasoning (71.9% and significant group mean difference) and visuospatial-organization (51.3%) of DDC children indicate attentional or executive differences at nonsymbolic level. In symbolic discrimination performance, no significant difference observed for single alphabet or number (digit) reading but significant differences at word level for visual and phonological performance (considering orthographic differences), attributes to distractor-inhibition problems. Nonsymbolic to symbolic coding/decoding speed and writing error (copying) differences are suggestive of execution variability rather than motor coordination in DDC. In HC, the top-down dorsal route gating and hypoactivity induced in right frontal-anterior cingulate cortices, play a major role in reading by allocating spatial attention and inhibiting distractors. It has been elaborated in the &amp;amp;neurobiological model&amp;amp;</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Estimated connectivity networks outperform observed connectivity networks when classifying people with multiple sclerosis into disability groups</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.07.447376v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.07.447376v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disease, causing lesions that disrupt the brain's anatomical and physiological connectivity networks, resulting in cognitive, visual and/or motor disabilities. Advanced imaging techniques like diffusion and functional MRI allow measurement of the brain's structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) networks, and can enable a better understanding of how their disruptions cause disability in people with MS (pwMS). However, advanced MRI techniques are used mainly for research purposes as they are expensive, time-consuming, and require high-level expertise to acquire and process. As an alternative, the Network Modification (NeMo) Tool can be used to estimate SC and FC using lesion masks derived from pwMS and a reference set of controls' connectivity networks. Objective: Here, we test the hypothesis that estimated SC and FC (eSC and eFC)from the NeMo Tool, based only on an individual's lesion masks, can be used to classify pwMS into disability categories just as well as SC and FC extracted from advanced MRI directly in pwMS. We also aim to find the connections most important for differentiating between no disability vs evidence of disability groups. Materials and Methods: One hundred pwMS (age:45.51 {+/-} 1.4 years, 66% female, disease duration: 12.97 {+/-} 8.07 years) were included in this study. Expanded DisabilityStatus Scale (EDSS) was used to assess disability, 67 pwMS had no disability (EDSS&amp;lt;2). Observed SC and FC were extracted from diffusion and functional MRI directly in pwMS, respectively. The NeMo Tool was used to estimate the remaining structural connectome (eSC), by removing streamlines in a reference set of tractograms that intersected the lesion mask. The NeMo Tool's eSC was used then as input to a deep neural network to estimate the corresponding FC (eFC). Logistic regression with ridge regularization was used to classify pwMS into disability categories (no disability vs evidence of disability), based on demographics/clinical information (sex, age, race, disease duration, clinical phenotype, and spinal lesion burden) and either pairwise entries or regional summaries from one of the following matrices: SC, FC, eSC, and eFC. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to assess the classification performance. Both univariate statistics and parameter coefficients from the classification models were used to identify features important to differentiating between the groups. Results: The regional eSC and eFC models outperformed their observed FC andSC counterparts (p-value&amp;lt;0.05), while the pairwise eSC and SC performed similarly (p=0.10). Regional eSC and eFC models had higher AUC (0.66-0.68) than the pair-wise models (0.60-0.65), with regional eFC having highest classification accuracy across all models. Ridge regression coefficients for the regional eFC and regional observed FC models were significantly correlated (Pearson's r= 0.52, p-value&amp;lt;10e-7). Decreased estimated SC node strength in default mode and ventral attention networks and increased eFC node strength in visual networks were associated with evidence of disability. Discussion: Here, for the first time, we use clinically-acquired lesion masks to estimate both structural and functional connectomes in patient populations to better understand brain lesion-dysfunction mapping in pwMS. Models based on the NeMo Tool's estimates of SC and FC better classified pwMS by disability level than SC and FC observed directly in the individual using advanced MRI. This work provides a viable alternative to performing high-cost, advanced MRI in patient populations, bringing the connectome one step closer to the clinic.</description>

	<description>The transcription factor activating protein two gamma (AP2gamma) is an important regulator of neurogenesis both during embryonic development as well as in the postnatal brain, but its role for neurophysiology and behavior at distinct postnatal periods is still unclear. In this work, we explored the neurogenic, behavioral, and functional impact of a constitutive AP2gamma heterozygous deletion in mice from early postnatal development until adulthood. Constitutive AP2gamma heterozygous deletion in mice caused a reduction of hippocampal transient amplifying progenitors (TAPs) in the postnatal brain, inducing significant impairments on hippocampal-dependent emotional- and cognitive-behavioral tasks including anxiety-like behavior and cognitive deficits, typically associated with an intact neurogenic activity. Moreover, AP2gamma deficiency impairs dorsal hippocampus-to-prefrontal cortex functional connectivity. We observed a progressive and cumulative impact of constitutive AP2gamma deficiency on the hippocampal glutamatergic neurogenic process, as well as alterations on limbic-cortical connectivity, together with impairments on emotional and cognitive behaviors from juvenile to adult periods. Collectively, the results herein presented demonstrate the importance of AP2gamma in the generation of glutamatergic neurons in the postnatal brain and its impact on behavioral performance.</description>

	<description>Identifying the common structure of neural dynamics across subjects is key for extracting unifying principles of brain computation and for many brain machine interface applications. Here, we propose a novel probabilistic approach for aligning stimulus-evoked responses from multiple animals in a common low dimensional manifold and use hierarchical inference to identify which stimulus drives neural activity in any given trial. Our probabilistic decoder is robust to a range of features of the neural responses and significantly outperforms existing neural alignment procedures. When applied to recordings from the mouse olfactory bulb, our approach reveals low-dimensional population dynamics that are odor specific and have consistent structure across animals. Thus, our decoder can be used for increasing the robustness and scalability of neural-based chemical detection.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Effect of cellular rearrangement time delays on the rheology of vertex models for confluent tissues</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Gonca Erdemci-Tandogan, M. Lisa Manning&lt;/p&gt;

Large-scale tissue deformation during biological processes such as morphogenesis requires cellular rearrangements. The simplest rearrangement in confluent cellular monolayers involves neighbor exchanges among four cells, called a T1 transition, in analogy to foams. But unlike foams, cells must execute a sequence of molecular processes, such as endocytosis of adhesion molecules, to complete a T1 transition. Such processes could take a long time compared to other timescales in the tissue. In this work, we incorporate this idea by augmenting vertex models to require a fixed, finite time for T1 transitions, which we call the “T1 delay time”. We study how variations in T1 delay time affect tissue mechanics, by quantifying the relaxation time of tissues in the presence of T1 delays and comparing that to the cell-shape based timescale that characterizes fluidity in the absence of any T1 delays. We show that the molecular-scale T1 delay timescale dominates over the cell shape-scale collective response timescale when the T1 delay time is the larger of the two. We extend this analysis to tissues that become anisotropic under convergent extension, finding similar results. Moreover, we find that increasing the T1 delay time increases the percentage of higher-fold coordinated vertices and rosettes, and decreases the overall number of successful T1s, contributing to a more elastic-like—and less fluid-like—tissue response. Our work suggests that molecular mechanisms that act as a brake on T1 transitions could stiffen global tissue mechanics and enhance rosette formation during morphogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6fEXLvSFyso&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Divisive normalization (DN) is a prominent computational building block in the brain that has been proposed as a canonical cortical operation. Numerous experimental studies have verified its importance for capturing nonlinear neural response properties to simple, artificial stimuli, and computational studies suggest that DN is also an important component for processing natural stimuli. However, we lack quantitative models of DN that are directly informed by measurements of spiking responses in the brain and applicable to arbitrary stimuli. Here, we propose a DN model that is applicable to arbitrary input images. We test its ability to predict how neurons in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) respond to natural images, with a focus on nonlinear response properties within the classical receptive field. Our model consists of one layer of subunits followed by learned orientation-specific DN. It outperforms linear-nonlinear and wavelet-based feature representations and makes a significant step towards the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Unlike deep CNNs, our compact DN model offers a direct interpretation of the nature of normalization. By inspecting the learned normalization pool of our model, we gained insights into a long-standing question about the tuning properties of DN that update the current textbook description: we found that within the receptive field oriented features were normalized preferentially by features with similar orientation rather than non-specifically as currently assumed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YVhoXxf95tQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Adaptive cognitive-control involves a hierarchical cortico-striatal gating system that supports selective updating, maintenance, and retrieval of useful cognitive and motor information. Here, we developed a task that independently manipulates selective gating operations into working-memory (input gating), from working-memory (output gating), and of responses (motor gating) and tested the neural dynamics and computational principles that support them. Increases in gating demands, captured by gate switches, were expressed by distinct EEG correlates at each gating level that evolved dynamically in partially overlapping time windows. Further, categorical representations of specific maintained items and of motor responses could be decoded from EEG when the corresponding gate was switching, thereby linking gating operations to prioritization. Finally, gate switching at all levels was related to increases in the motor decision threshold as quantified by the drift diffusion model. Together these results support the notion that cognitive gating operations scaffold on top of mechanisms involved in motor gating.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v7U_RTY-wRA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Modularity of neural networks -- both biological and artificial -- can be
thought of either structurally or functionally, and the relationship between
these is an open question. We show that enforcing structural modularity via
sparse connectivity between two dense sub-networks which need to communicate to
solve the task leads to functional specialization of the sub-networks, but only
at extreme levels of sparsity. With even a moderate number of interconnections,
the sub-networks become functionally entangled. Defining functional
specialization is in itself a challenging problem without a universally agreed
solution. To address this, we designed three different measures of
specialization (based on weight masks, retraining and correlation) and found
them to qualitatively agree. Our results have implications in both neuroscience
and machine learning. For neuroscience, it shows that we cannot conclude that
there is functional modularity simply by observing moderate levels of
structural modularity: knowing the brain's connectome is not sufficient for
understanding how it breaks down into functional modules. For machine learning,
using structure to promote functional modularity -- which may be important for
robustness and generalization -- may require extremely narrow bottlenecks
between modules.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are among the most successful models
for learning high-complexity, real-world distributions. However, in theory, due
to the highly non-convex, non-concave landscape of the minmax training
objective, GAN remains one of the least understood deep learning models. In
this work, we formally study how GANs can efficiently learn certain
hierarchically generated distributions that are close to the distribution of
images in practice. We prove that when a distribution has a structure that we
refer to as Forward Super-Resolution, then simply training generative
adversarial networks using gradient descent ascent (GDA) can indeed learn this
distribution efficiently, both in terms of sample and time complexities. We
also provide concrete empirical evidence that not only our assumption &quot;forward
super-resolution&quot; is very natural in practice, but also the underlying learning
mechanisms that we study in this paper (to allow us efficiently train GAN via
GDA in theory) simulates the actual learning process of GANs in practice on
real-world problems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 07 June 2021; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23661-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-021-23661-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Endocrinopathies, such as thyroid autoimmunity, are common among patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Here, by using a polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from a hypothyroidism GWAS, the authors show that cancer patients with high PRS are at increased risk of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1)-induced thyroid dysfunction, a condition associated with systemic response to PD-1 checkpoint blockade and longer overall survival.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/-HbpLnyc4PY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Heavy-tailed distributions in haptic perception of wielded rods</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Humans identify properties (e.g., the length or weight) of objects through touch using somatosensory perceptions in the limbs. Humans identify these properties by manipulating an object to access its inertial qualities. However, there is little work evidencing a unifying pattern of movements humans use to access these inertial properties. The current study examined if participants’ wielding movements followed a systematic distribution—specifically, a Lévy-like distribution that is characterized by heavy-tails and is often seen in efficient foraging behavior. Participants wielded rods they could not see and were tasked to identify whether the rod they were wielding was the longer or shorter of two rods. While participants wielded the rod, the rod’s motion was captured. Results demonstrate that the sampling of angular accelerations produced heavy-tailed distributions. Since angular acceleration has a distinct physical–mathematical relationship with inertia, this finding is consistent with the interpretation that the haptic subsystems are sensitive to the inertial properties of an object. Angular acceleration from wielding motions appear to follow a similar distribution as optimal foraging strategies—perhaps it is the case that humans are foraging for information about the inertia of an object through changes in angular acceleration and wielding movements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Behavioural tagging: Effect of novelty exploration on plasticity related molecular signatures</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Learning and memory are one of those frontier areas of neurobiology which attract us to investigate the intricacy of this process. Here, we aimed to investigate the general mechanism of “Behavioural Tagging and Capture” in long term memory (LTM) formation and to find the key factors playing role in consolidation of LTM. In this study, we’ve shown that not only plasticity related proteins (PRPs) but neurotransmitters and immediate early genes (IEGs) also play an important role in memory formation process. It’s very well evident that memory traces can last longer if close in time novelty is introduced around memory encoding. Here our results point out that this novelty exploration acts as a modulator in memory consolidation by providing PRPs such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), enhancing neurotransmitters (Dopamine), IEGs (cFos) and some enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), monoamine oxidase (MAO), sodium–potassium ATPase (Na&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase). Therefore, by using a Novel Object Recognition task (NOR) in combination with novel task exposure, we evaluated the role of molecular markers in memory consolidation employing a behavioural tagging model. The purpose of the current study was first to evaluate the effect of novelty exposure around a single trail of NOR task in a critical time window on memory consolidation in rats after 24 h and second to determine the expression of BDNF, CREB, c-fos, AChE, MAO, Na&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase as potential markers in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during memory formation. In the present study, to identify and validate the role of these molecular signatures in memory consolidation, infusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor Anisomycin (Ani) was done around the training session that causes a deficit in the formation of LTM when tested 24 h after weak encoding. Altogether, here we are providing the first comprehensive set of evidences indicating that BDNF, CREB, dopamine, some enzymes and c-fos role in modulating LTM by employing behavioural tagging model.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The P2X7 Receptor Is Involved in Diabetic Neuropathic Pain Hypersensitivity Mediated by TRPV1 in the Rat Dorsal Root Ganglion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The purinergic 2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor expressed in satellite glial cells (SGCs) is involved in the inflammatory response, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) participates in the process of neurogenic inflammation, such as that in diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) and peripheral neuralgia. The main purpose of this study was to explore the role of the P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor in DNP hypersensitivity mediated by TRPV1 in the rat and its possible mechanism. A rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus-related neuropathic pain (NPP) named the DNP rat model was established in this study. The mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) of DNP rats were increased after intrathecal injection of the P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist A438079, and the mRNA and protein levels of TRPV1 in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) were decreased in DNP rats treated with A438079 compared to untreated DNP rats; in addition, A438079 also decreased the phosphorylation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the DNP group. Based on these results, the P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor might be involved in DNP mediated by TRPV1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With the arrival of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the challenges arising from Big Data, neuromorphic chip concepts are seen as key solutions for coping with the massive amount of unstructured data streams by moving the computation closer to the sensors, the so-called “edge computing.” Augmenting these chips with emerging memory technologies enables these edge devices with non-volatile and adaptive properties which are desirable for low power and online learning operations. However, an energy- and area-efficient realization of these systems requires disruptive hardware changes. Memristor-based solutions for these concepts are in the focus of research and industry due to their low-power and high-density online learning potential. Specifically, the filamentary-type valence change mechanism (VCM memories) have shown to be a promising candidate In consequence, physical models capturing a broad spectrum of experimentally observed features such as the pronounced cycle-to-cycle (c2c) and device-to-device (d2d) variability are required for accurate evaluation of the proposed concepts. In this study, we present an in-depth experimental analysis of d2d and c2c variability of filamentary-type bipolar switching HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nano-sized crossbar devices and match the experimentally observed variabilities to our physically motivated JART VCM compact model. Based on this approach, we evaluate the concept of parallel operation of devices as a synapse both experimentally and theoretically. These parallel synapses form a synaptic array which is at the core of neuromorphic chips. We exploit the c2c variability of these devices for stochastic online learning which has shown to increase the effective bit precision of the devices. Finally, we demonstrate that stochastic switching features for a pattern classification task that can be employed in an online learning neural network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Orientation of Temporal Interference for Non-invasive Deep Brain Stimulation in Epilepsy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy, electrical stimulation from intracranial electrodes is frequently used for the localization of seizure onset zones and related pathological networks. The ability of electrically stimulated tissue to generate beta and gamma range oscillations, called rapid-discharges, is a frequent indication of an epileptogenic zone. However, a limit of intracranial stimulation is the fixed physical location and number of implanted electrodes, leaving numerous clinically and functionally relevant brain regions unexplored. Here, we demonstrate an alternative technique relying exclusively on non-penetrating surface electrodes, namely an orientation-tunable form of temporally interfering (TI) electric fields to target the CA3 of the mouse hippocampus which focally evokes seizure-like events (SLEs) having the characteristic frequencies of rapid-discharges, but without the necessity of the implanted electrodes. The orientation of the topical electrodes with respect to the orientation of the hippocampus is demonstrated to strongly control the threshold for evoking SLEs. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of Pulse-width-modulation of square waves as an alternative to sine waves for TI stimulation. An orientation-dependent analysis of classic implanted electrodes to evoke SLEs in the hippocampus is subsequently utilized to support the results of the minimally invasive temporally interfering fields. The principles of orientation-tunable TI stimulation seen here can be generally applicable in a wide range of other excitable tissues and brain regions, overcoming several limitations of fixed electrodes which penetrate tissue and overcoming several limitations of other non-invasive stimulation methods in epilepsy, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain-Computer Interface Coupled to a Robotic Hand Orthosis for Stroke Patients’ Neurorehabilitation: A Crossover Feasibility Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.656975</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) coupled to robotic assistive devices have shown promise for the rehabilitation of stroke patients. However, little has been reported that compares the clinical and physiological effects of a BCI intervention for upper limb stroke rehabilitation with those of conventional therapy. This study assesses the feasibility of an intervention with a BCI based on electroencephalography (EEG) coupled to a robotic hand orthosis for upper limb stroke rehabilitation and compares its outcomes to conventional therapy. Seven subacute and three chronic stroke patients (M = 59.9 ± 12.8) with severe upper limb impairment were recruited in a crossover feasibility study to receive 1 month of BCI therapy and 1 month of conventional therapy in random order. The outcome measures were comprised of: Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), motor evoked potentials elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), hand dynamometry, and EEG. Additionally, BCI performance and user experience were measured. All measurements were acquired before and after each intervention. FMA-UE and ARAT after BCI (23.1 ± 16; 8.4 ± 10) and after conventional therapy (21.9 ± 15; 8.7 ± 11) were significantly higher (p &amp;lt; 0.017) compared to baseline (17.5 ± 15; 4.3 ± 6) but were similar between therapies (p &amp;gt; 0.017). Via TMS, corticospinal tract integrity could be assessed in the affected hemisphere of three patients at baseline, in five after BCI, and four after conventional therapy. While no significant difference (p &amp;gt; 0.05) was found in patients’ affected hand strength, it was higher after the BCI therapy. EEG cortical activations were significantly higher over motor and non-motor regions after both therapies (p &amp;lt; 0.017). System performance increased across BCI sessions, from 54 (50, 70%) to 72% (56, 83%). Patients reported moderate mental workloads and excellent usability with the BCI. Outcome measurements implied that a BCI intervention using a robotic hand orthosis as feedback has the potential to elicit neuroplasticity-related mechanisms, similar to those observed during conventional therapy, even in a group of severely impaired stroke patients. Therefore, the proposed BCI system could be a suitable therapy option and will be further assessed in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Characterization of Brain Iron Deposition Pattern and Its Association With Genetic Risk Factor in Alzheimer’s Disease Using Susceptibility-Weighted Imaging</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The presence of iron is an important factor for normal brain functions, whereas excessive deposition of iron may impair normal cognitive function in the brain and lead to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). MRI has been widely applied to characterize brain structural and functional changes caused by AD. However, the effectiveness of using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) for the analysis of brain iron deposition is still unclear, especially within the context of early AD diagnosis. Thus, in this study, we aim to explore the relationship between brain iron deposition measured by SWI with the progression of AD using various feature selection and classification methods. The proposed model was evaluated on a 69-subject SWI imaging dataset consisting of 24 AD patients, 21 mild cognitive impairment patients, and 24 normal controls. The identified AD progression-related regions were then compared with the regions reported from previous genetic association studies, and we observed considerable overlap between these two. Further, we have identified a new potential AD-related gene (MEF2C) closely related to the interaction between iron deposition and AD progression in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Improving the Effect of Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS): A Systematic Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.652393</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With the development of electrical stimulation technology, traditional transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) technology has been found to have the drawback of not targeting a specific area accurately. Studies have shown that optimizing the number and position of electrodes during electrical stimulation has a very good effect on enhancing brain stimulation accuracy. At present, an increasing number of laboratories have begun to optimize tACS. However, there has been no study summarizing the optimization methods of tACS. Determining whether different optimization methods are effective and the optimization approach could provide information that could guide future tACS research. We describe the results of recent research on tACS optimization and integrate the optimization approaches of tACS in recent research. Optimization approaches can be classified into two groups: high-definition electrical stimulation and interference modulation electrical stimulation. The optimization methods can be divided into five categories: high-definition tACS, phase-shifted tACS, amplitude-modulated tACS, the temporally interfering (TI) method, and the intersectional short pulse (ISP) method. Finally, we summarize the latest research on hardware useful for tACS improvement and outline future directions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Modal-Polar Representation of Evoked Response Potentials in Multiple Arousal States</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An expansion of the corticothalamic transfer function into eigenmodes and resonant poles is used to derive a simple formula for evoked response potentials (ERPs) in various states of arousal. The transfer function corresponds to the cortical response to an external stimulus, which encodes all the information and properties of the linear system. This approach links experimental observations of resonances and characteristic timescales in brain activity with physically based neural field theory (NFT). The present work greatly simplifies the formula of the analytical ERP, and separates its spatial part (eigenmodes) from the temporal part (poles). Within this framework, calculations involve contour integrations that yield an explicit expression for ERPs. The dominant global mode is considered explicitly in more detail to study how the ERP varies with time in this mode and to illustrate the method. For each arousal state in sleep and wake, the resonances of the system are determined and it is found that five poles are sufficient to study the main dynamics of the system in waking eyes-open and eyes-closed states. Similarly, it is shown that six poles suffice to reproduce ERPs in rapid-eye movement sleep, sleep state 1, and sleep state 2 states, whereas just four poles suffice to reproduce the dynamics in slow wave sleep. Thus, six poles are sufficient to preserve the main global ERP dynamics of the system for all states of arousal. These six poles correspond to the dominant resonances of the system at slow-wave, alpha, and beta frequencies. These results provide the basis for simplified analytic treatment of brain dynamics and link observations more closely to theory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Contrast and Conflict in Dutch Vowels</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The nature of phonological representations has been extensively studied in phonology and psycholinguistics. While full specification is still the norm in psycholinguistic research, underspecified representations may better account for perceptual asymmetries. In this paper, we report on a mismatch negativity (MMN) study with Dutch listeners who took part in a passive oddball paradigm to investigate when the brain notices the difference between expected and observed vowels. In particular, we tested neural discrimination (indicating perceptual discrimination) of the tense mid vowel pairs /o/-/ø/ (place contrast), /e/-/ø/ (labiality or rounding contrast), and /e/-/o/ (place and labiality contrast). Our results show (a) a perceptual asymmetry for place in the /o/-/ø/ contrast, supporting underspecification of [CORONAL] and replicating earlier results for German, and (b) a perceptual asymmetry for labiality for the /e/-/ø/ contrast, which was not reported in the German study. A labial deviant [ø] (standard /e/) yielded a larger MMN than a deviant [e] (standard /ø/). No asymmetry was found for the two-feature contrast. This study partly replicates a similar MMN study on German vowels, and partly presents new findings indicating cross-linguistic differences. Although the vowel inventory of Dutch and German is to a large extent comparable, their (morpho)phonological systems are different, which is reflected in processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: An Online Data Visualization Feedback Protocol for Motor Imagery-Based BCI Training</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.625983</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain–computer interface (BCI) has developed rapidly over the past two decades, mainly due to advancements in machine learning. Subjects must learn to modulate their brain activities to ensure a successful BCI. Feedback training is a practical approach to this learning process; however, the commonly used classifier-dependent approaches have inherent limitations such as the need for calibration and a lack of continuous feedback over long periods of time. This paper proposes an online data visualization feedback protocol that intuitively reflects the EEG distribution in Riemannian geometry in real time. Rather than learning a hyperplane, the Riemannian geometry formulation allows iterative learning of prototypical covariance matrices that are translated into visualized feedback through diffusion map process. Ten subjects were recruited for MI-BCI (motor imagery-BCI) training experiments. The subjects learned to modulate their sensorimotor rhythm to centralize the points within one category and to separate points belonging to different categories. The results show favorable overall training effects in terms of the class distinctiveness and EEG feature discriminancy over a 3-day training with 30% learners. A steadily increased class distinctiveness in the last three sessions suggests that the advanced training protocol is effective. The optimal frequency band was consistent during the 3-day training, and the difference between subjects with good or low MI-BCI performance could be clearly observed. We believe that the proposed feedback protocol has promising application prospect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Selective Attention Measurement of Experienced Simultaneous Interpreters Using EEG Phase-Locked Response</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We quantified the electroencephalogram signals associated with the selective attention processing of experienced simultaneous interpreters and calculated the phase-locked responses evoked by a 40-Hz auditory steady-state response (40-Hz ASSR) and the values of robust inter-trial coherence (ITC) for environmental changes. Since we assumed that an interpreter's attention ability improves with an increase in the number of years of experience of simultaneous interpretation, we divided the participants into two groups based on their simultaneous interpretation experience: experts with more than 15 years of experience (E group; n = 7) and beginners with &amp;lt;1 year (B group; n = 15). We also compared two conditions: simultaneous interpretation (SI) and shadowing (SH). We found a significant interaction in the ITC between years of SI experience (E and B groups) and tasks (SI and SH). This result demonstrates that the number of years of SI experience influences selective attention during interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Altered Sleep-Related Consolidation and Neurocognitive Comorbidity in CECTS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.563807</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.563807</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Our aim is to use neurophysiological sleep-related consolidation (SRC) phenomena to identify putative pathophysiological mechanisms in CECTS linked to diffuse neurocognitive deficits. We argue that there are numerous studies on the association between seizure aspects and neurocognitive functioning but not as many on interictal variables and neurocognitive deficits. We suggest two additional foci. First, the interictal presentation in CECTS and second, neuronal oscillations involved in SRC processes. Existing data on mechanisms through which interictal epileptiform spikes (IES) impact upon SRC indicate that they have the potential to: (a) perturb cross-regional coupling of neuronal oscillations, (b) mimic consolidation processes, (c) alter the precision of the spatiotemporal coupling of oscillations, and (d) variably impact upon SRC performance. Sleep spindles merit systematic study in CECTS in order to clarify: (a) the state of the slow oscillations (SOs) with which they coordinate, (b) the precision of slow oscillation-spindle coupling, and (c) whether their developmental trajectories differ from those of healthy children. We subsequently review studies on the associations between IES load during NREM sleep and SRC performance in childhood epilepsy. We then use sleep consolidation neurophysiological processes and their interplay with IES to help clarify the diffuse neurocognitive deficits that have been empirically documented in CECTS. We claim that studying SRC in CECTS will help to clarify pathophysiological mechanisms toward diverse neurocognitive deficits. Future developments could include close links between the fields of epilepsy and sleep, as well as new therapeutic neurostimulation targets. At the clinical level, children diagnosed with CECTS could benefit from close monitoring with respect to epilepsy, sleep and neurocognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Variability and Randomness of the Instantaneous Firing Rate</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The apparent stochastic nature of neuronal activity significantly affects the reliability of neuronal coding. To quantify the encountered fluctuations, both in neural data and simulations, the notions of variability and randomness of inter-spike intervals have been proposed and studied. In this article we focus on the concept of the instantaneous firing rate, which is also based on the spike timing. We use several classical statistical models of neuronal activity and we study the corresponding probability distributions of the instantaneous firing rate. To characterize the firing rate variability and randomness under different spiking regimes, we use different indices of statistical dispersion. We find that the relationship between the variability of interspike intervals and the instantaneous firing rate is not straightforward in general. Counter-intuitively, an increase in the randomness (based on entropy) of spike times may either decrease or increase the randomness of instantaneous firing rate, in dependence on the neuronal firing model. Finally, we apply our methods to experimental data, establishing that instantaneous rate analysis can indeed provide additional information about the spiking activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Understanding the Impact of Neural Variations and Random Connections on Inference</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent research suggests that in vitro neural networks created from dissociated neurons may be used for computing and performing machine learning tasks. To develop a better artificial intelligent system, a hybrid bio-silicon computer is worth exploring, but its performance is still inferior to that of a silicon-based computer. One reason may be that a living neural network has many intrinsic properties, such as random network connectivity, high network sparsity, and large neural and synaptic variability. These properties may lead to new design considerations, and existing algorithms need to be adjusted for living neural network implementation. This work investigates the impact of neural variations and random connections on inference with learning algorithms. A two-layer hybrid bio-silicon platform is constructed and a five-step design method is proposed for the fast development of living neural network algorithms. Neural variations and dynamics are verified by fitting model parameters with biological experimental results. Random connections are generated under different connection probabilities to vary network sparsity. A multi-layer perceptron algorithm is tested with biological constraints on the MNIST dataset. The results show that a reasonable inference accuracy can be achieved despite the presence of neural variations and random network connections. A new adaptive pre-processing technique is proposed to ensure good learning accuracy with different living neural network sparsity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Visuomotor Adaptation Brain Changes During a Spaceflight Analog With Elevated Carbon Dioxide (CO2): A Pilot Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.659557</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.659557</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astronauts on board the International Space Station (ISS) must adapt to several environmental challenges including microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and isolation while performing highly controlled movements with complex equipment. Head down tilt bed rest (HDBR) is an analog used to study spaceflight factors including body unloading and headward fluid shifts. We recently reported how HDBR with elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) affects visuomotor adaptation. Here we expand upon this work and examine the effects of HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on brain activity during visuomotor adaptation. Eleven participants (34 ± 8 years) completed six functional MRI (fMRI) sessions pre-, during, and post-HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. During fMRI, participants completed a visuomotor adaptation task, divided into baseline, early, late and de-adaptation. Additionally, we compare brain activity between this NASA campaign (30-day HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and a different campaign with a separate set of participants (60-day HDBR with normal atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, n = 8; 34.25 ± 7.9 years) to characterize the specific effects of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Participants were included by convenience. During early adaptation across the HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intervention, participants showed decreasing activation in temporal and subcortical brain regions, followed by post- HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; recovery. During late adaptation, participants showed increasing activation in the right fusiform gyrus and right caudate nucleus during HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; this activation normalized to baseline levels after bed rest. There were no correlations between brain changes and adaptation performance changes from pre- to post HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Also, there were no statistically significant differences between the HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group and the HDBR controls, suggesting that changes in brain activity were due primarily to bed rest rather than elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Five HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; participants presented with optic disc edema, a sign of Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS). An exploratory analysis of HDBR+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; participants with and without signs of SANS revealed no group differences in brain activity during any phase of the adaptation task. Overall, these findings have implications for spaceflight missions and training, as ISS missions require individuals to adapt to altered sensory inputs over long periods in space. Further, this is the first study to verify the HDBR and elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; effects on the neural correlates of visuomotor adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Locus Coeruleus Norepinephrine in Learned Behavior: Anatomical Modularity and Spatiotemporal Integration in Targets</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.638007</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.638007</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The locus coeruleus (LC), a small brainstem nucleus, is the primary source of the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) in the brain. The LC receives input from widespread brain regions, and projects throughout the forebrain, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. LC neurons release NE to control arousal, but also in the context of a variety of sensory-motor and behavioral functions. Despite its brain-wide effects, much about the role of LC-NE in behavior and the circuits controlling LC activity is unknown. New evidence suggests that the modular input-output organization of the LC could enable transient, task-specific modulation of distinct brain regions. Future work must further assess whether this spatial modularity coincides with functional differences in LC-NE subpopulations acting at specific times, and how such spatiotemporal specificity might influence learned behaviors. Here, we summarize the state of the field and present new ideas on the role of LC-NE in learned behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Potential and Realized Impact of Astroglia Ca2 + Dynamics on Circuit Function and Behavior</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.682888</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.682888</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astroglia display a wide range of spontaneous and behavioral state-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics. During heightened vigilance, noradrenergic signaling leads to quasi-synchronous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations encompassing soma and processes across the brain-wide astroglia network. Distinct from this vigilance-associated global Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; rise are apparently spontaneous fluctuations within spatially restricted microdomains. Over the years, several strategies have been pursued to shed light on the physiological impact of these signals including deletion of endogenous ion channels or receptors and reduction of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; through buffering, extrusion or inhibition of release. Some experiments that revealed the most compelling behavioral alterations employed chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations to modify astroglia Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling. However, there is considerable contrast between these findings and the comparatively modest effects of inhibiting endogenous sources of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In this review, we describe the underlying mechanisms of various forms of astroglia Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling as well as the functional consequences of their inhibition. We then discuss how the effects of exogenous astroglia Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; modification combined with our knowledge of physiological mechanisms of astroglia Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activation could guide further refinement of behavioral paradigms that will help elucidate the natural Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent function of astroglia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Calcium Signals in Astrocyte Microdomains, a Decade of Great Advances</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.673433</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The glial cells astrocytes have long been recognized as important neuron-supporting elements in brain development, homeostasis, and metabolism. After the discovery that the reciprocal communication between astrocytes and neurons is a fundamental mechanism in the modulation of neuronal synaptic communication, over the last two decades astrocytes became a hot topic in neuroscience research. Crucial to their functional interactions with neurons are the cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations that mediate gliotransmission. Large attention has been posed to the so-called Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;microdomains, dynamic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; changes spatially restricted to fine astrocytic processes including perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs). With presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic neuronal membranes, PAPs compose the tripartite synapse. The distinct spatial-temporal features and functional roles of astrocyte microdomain Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity remain poorly defined. However, thanks to the development of genetically encoded Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; indicators (GECIs), advanced microscopy techniques, and innovative analytical approaches, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in astrocyte microdomains were recently studied in unprecedented detail. These events have been observed to occur much more frequently (∼50–100-fold) and dynamically than somatic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevations with mechanisms that likely involve both IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent and -independent pathways. Further progress aimed to clarify the complex, dynamic machinery responsible for astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity at microdomains is a crucial step in our understanding of the astrocyte role in brain function and may also reveal astrocytes as novel therapeutic targets for different brain diseases. Here, we review the most recent studies that improve our mechanistic understanding of the essential features of astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; microdomains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: The Ependymal Region Prevents Glioblastoma From Penetrating Into the Ventricle via a Nonmechanical Force</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.679405</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.679405</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Intraventricular penetration is rare in glioblastoma (GBM). Whether the ependymal region including the ependyma and subventricular zone (SVZ) can prevent GBM invasion remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and haematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining were performed to evaluate the size and anatomical locations of GBM. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess the correlation between tumor-ependyma contact, ventricle penetration and clinical characteristics. Cell migration and invasion were assessed via Transwell assays and an orthotopic transplantation model.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Among 357 patients with GBM, the majority (66%) showed ependymal region contact, and 34 patients (10%) showed ventricle penetration of GBM. GBM cells were spread along the ependyma in the orthotopic transplantation model. The longest tumor diameter was an independent risk factor for GBM-ependymal region contact, as demonstrated by univariate (OR = 1.706, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and multivariate logistic regression analyses (OR = 1.767, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), but was not associated with ventricle penetration. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could significantly induce tumor cell migration (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), and GBM could grow in CSF. Compared with those from the cortex, cells from the ependymal region attenuated the invasion of C6 whether cocultured with C6 or mixed with Matrigel (p = 0.0054 and p = 0.0488). Immunofluorescence analysis shows a thin gap with GFAP expression delimiting the tumor and ependymal region.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The ependymal region might restrict GBM cells from entering the ventricle via a non-mechanical force. Further studies in this area may reveal mechanisms that occur in GBM patients and may enable the design of new therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Effects of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure on the Volumes of the Lateral and Medial Walls of the Intraparietal Sulcus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.639800</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.639800</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) continue to be the leading preventable cause of intellectual disability in the U.S., Europe, and in endemic areas, such as the Western Cape region of South Africa. Arithmetic is highly sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is known to play a critical role in number processing. In this study, we investigate whether smaller IPS volumes play a role in the number-processing deficits observed in children with PAE. Participants were 52 9- to 14-year-old children from a historically disadvantaged community in Cape Town, who are participating in our ongoing studies on the effects of PAE on the brain. The IPS was manually parcellated into its medial (MIPS) and lateral (LIPS) walls on magnetic resonance images. The study aimed to examine: (1) the effects of PAE on IPS regional volumes and asymmetry, (2) whether IPS regional volumes are related to number processing performance and, if so, whether these relations are moderated by PAE and (3) potential mediation by regional IPS volumes of the relation between PAE and number processing performance. Total intracranial volume (TIV) was associated with volumes in all regions except the right LIPS. Both left MIPS and left LIPS volumes were significantly smaller in children in the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)/partial FAS (PFAS) group compared to controls. The finding in the left LIPS remained significant after controlling for potential confounders and after adjustment for the smaller overall brain size of the children in the FAS/PFAS group. Smaller left LIPS volumes in the FAS/PFAS group may account for the absence of left-right asymmetry in the LIPS in children with FAS/PFAS compared to controls and nonsyndromal heavily exposed (HE) children. Bilaterally, larger MIPS volumes were associated with better WISC IQ Arithmetic scores. These effects, however, were not moderated by the degree of PAE, and regional IPS volumes did not mediate the effect of PAE on WISC Arithmetic scores. Although we found that certain regions of the IPS were smaller in children with FAS and PFAS, these PAE-induced changes in IPS volume did not mediate the alcohol-related deficits in arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Acute medical illnesses, surgical interventions, or admissions to hospital in older individuals are frequently associated with a delirium. In this cohort study, we investigated the impact of specific cognitive domains and depression before the occurrence of delirium symptoms in an 8-year observation of older non-hospitalized individuals.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In total, we included 807 participants (48–83 years). Deficits in specific cognitive domains were measured using the CERAD test battery, and depressive symptoms were measured using Beck Depression Inventory and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) before the onset of a delirium. Delirium symptoms were retrospectively assessed by a questionnaire based on the established Nursing Delirium Screening Scale.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Fifty-eight of eight hundred seven participants (7.2%) reported delirium symptoms over the 8-year course of the study. Sixty-nine percent (n = 40) of reported delirium symptoms were related to surgeries. In multivariate regression analysis, impaired executive function was an independent risk factor (p = 0.034) for the occurrence of delirium symptoms. Furthermore, age (p = 0.014), comorbidities [captured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)] (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and depression (p = 0.012) were significantly associated with reported delirium symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Especially prior to elective surgery or medical interventions, screening for impaired executive function and depression could be helpful to identify patients who are at risk to develop delirium symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Dysfunction of the Glymphatic System as a Potential Mechanism of Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) frequently occurs in the elderly as a severe postoperative complication and is characterized by a decline in cognitive function that impairs memory, attention, and other cognitive domains. Currently, the exact pathogenic mechanism of PND is multifaceted and remains unclear. The glymphatic system is a newly discovered glial-dependent perivascular network that subserves a pseudo-lymphatic function in the brain. Recent studies have highlighted the significant role of the glymphatic system in the removal of harmful metabolites in the brain. Dysfunction of the glymphatic system can reduce metabolic waste removal, leading to neuroinflammation and neurological disorders. We speculate that there is a causal relationship between the glymphatic system and symptomatic progression in PND. This paper reviews the current literature on the glymphatic system and some perioperative factors to discuss the role of the glymphatic system in PND.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Significance of EEG Alpha Oscillation Spectral Power and Beta Oscillation Phase Synchronization for Diagnosing Probable Alzheimer Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in geriatric population. At present, no effective treatments exist to reverse the progress of AD, however, early diagnosis and intervention might delay its progression. The search for biomarkers with good safety, repeatable detection, reliable sensitivity and community application is necessary for AD screening and early diagnosis and timely intervention. Electroencephalogram (EEG) examination is a non-invasive, quantitative, reproducible, and cost-effective technique which is suitable for screening large population for possible AD. The power spectrum, complexity and synchronization characteristics of EEG waveforms in AD patients have distinct deviation from normal elderly, indicating these EEG features can be a promising candidate biomarker of AD. However, current reported deviation results are inconsistent, possibly due to multiple factors such as diagnostic criteria, sample sizes and the use of different computational measures. In this study, we collected two neurological tests scores (MMSE and MoCA) and the resting-state EEG of 30 normal control elderly subjects (NC group) and 30 probable AD patients confirmed by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) inspection (AD group). We calculated the power spectrum, spectral entropy and phase synchronization index features of these two groups’ EEG at left/right frontal, temporal, central and occipital brain regions in 4 frequency bands: δ oscillation (1–4 Hz), θ oscillation (4–8 Hz), α oscillation (8–13 Hz), and β oscillation (13–30 Hz). In most brain areas, we found that the AD group had significant differences compared to NC group: (1) decreased α oscillation power and increased θ oscillation power; (2) decreased spectral entropy in α oscillation and elevated spectral entropy in β oscillation; and (3) decrease phase synchronization index in δ, θ, and β oscillation. We also found that α oscillation spectral power and β oscillation phase synchronization index correlated well with the MMSE/MoCA test scores in AD groups. Our study suggests that these two EEG features might be useful metrics for population screening of probable AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the direction-selective circuit of the mammalian retina, the role of strong null-direction inhibition of On-Off direction-selective ganglion cells (On-Off DSGCs) on their direction selectivity is well-studied. However, how excitatory inputs influence the On-Off DSGC's visual response is underexplored. Here, we report that On-Off DSGCs have a spatially displaced glutamatergic receptive field along their horizontal preferred-null motion axes. This displaced receptive field contributes to DSGC null-direction spiking during interrupted motion trajectories. Theoretical analyses indicate that population responses during interrupted motion may help populations of On-Off DSGCs signal the spatial location of moving objects in complex, naturalistic visual environments. Our study highlights that the direction-selective circuit exploits separate sets of mechanisms under different stimulus conditions, and these mechanisms may help encode multiple visual features.</description>

	<description>The immeasurable complexity at every level of biological organization creates a daunting task for understanding biological function. Here, we highlight the risks of stripping it away at the outset and discuss a possible path toward arriving at emergent simplicity of understanding while still embracing the ever-changing complexity of biotic interactions that we see in nature.</description>

	<title>eLife: Temporally delayed linear modelling (TDLM) measures replay in both animals and humans</title>

	<description>There are rich structures in off-task neural activity which are hypothesised to reflect fundamental computations across a broad spectrum of cognitive functions. Here, we develop an analysis toolkit – Temporal Delayed Linear Modelling (TDLM) for analysing such activity. TDLM is a domain-general method for finding neural sequences that respect a pre-specified transition graph. It combines nonlinear classification and linear temporal modelling to test for statistical regularities in sequences of task-related reactivations. TDLM is developed on the non-invasive neuroimaging data and is designed to take care of confounds and maximize sequence detection ability. Notably, as a linear framework, TDLM can be easily extended, without loss of generality, to capture rodent replay in electrophysiology, including in continuous spaces, as well as addressing second-order inference questions, e.g., its temporal and spatial varying pattern. We hope TDLM will advance a deeper understanding of neural computation and promote a richer convergence between animal and human neuroscience.</description>

	<title>eLife: Uncovering a 'sensitive window' of multisensory and motor neuroplasticity in the cerebrum and cerebellum of male and female starling</title>

	<description>Traditionally, research unraveling seasonal neuroplasticity in songbirds has focused on the male song control system and testosterone. We longitudinally monitored the song behavior and neuroplasticity in male and female starlings during multiple photoperiods using Diffusion Tensor and Fixel-Based techniques. These exploratory data-driven whole-brain methods resulted in a population-based tractogram confirming microstructural sexual dimorphisms in the song control system. Furthermore, male brains showed hemispheric asymmetries in the pallium, whereas females had higher interhemispheric connectivity, which could not be attributed to brain size differences. Only females with large brains sing but differ from males in their song behavior by showing involvement of the hippocampus. Both sexes experienced multisensory neuroplasticity in the song control, auditory and visual system, and cerebellum, mainly during the photosensitive period. This period with low gonadal hormone levels might represent a 'sensitive window' during which different sensory and motor systems in the cerebrum and cerebellum can be seasonally re-shaped in both sexes.</description>

	<description>Recent pertussis resurgence in numerous countries may be driven by asymptomatic infections. Most pertussis surveillance studies are cross-sectional and cannot distinguish asymptomatic from pre-symptomatic infections. Longitudinal surveillance could overcome this barrier, providing more information about the true burden of pertussis at the population level. Here we analyze 17,442 nasopharyngeal samples from a longitudinal cohort of 1320 Zambian mother/infant pairs. Our analysis has two elements. First, we demonstrate that the full range of IS481 qPCR CT values provides insight into pertussis epidemiology, showing concordance of low and high CT results over time, within mother/infant pairs, and in relation to symptomatology. Second, we exploit these full-range qPCR data to demonstrate a high incidence of asymptomatic pertussis, including among infants. Our results demonstrate a wider burden of pertussis infection than we anticipated in this population, and expose key limitations of threshold-based interpretation of qPCR results in infectious disease surveillance.</description>

	<title>eLife: RAL GTPases mediate EGFR-driven intestinal stem cell proliferation and tumourigenesis</title>

	<description>RAS-like (RAL) GTPases function in Wnt signalling-dependent intestinal stem cell proliferation and regeneration. Whether RAL proteins work as canonical RAS effectors in the intestine, and the mechanisms of how they contribute to tumourigenesis remain unclear. Here, we show that RAL GTPases are necessary and sufficient to activate EGFR/MAPK signalling in the intestine, via induction of EGFR internalisation. Knocking down &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;RalA&lt;/i&gt; from intestinal stem and progenitor cells leads to increased levels of plasma membrane-associated EGFR and decreased MAPK pathway activation. Importantly, in addition to impacting stem cell proliferation during damage-induced intestinal regeneration, this role of RAL GTPases impacts on EGFR-dependent tumorigenic growth in the intestine and in human mammary epithelium. However, the effect of oncogenic RAS in the intestine is independent from RAL function. Altogether, our results reveal previously unrecognised cellular and molecular contexts where RAL GTPases become essential mediators of adult tissue homeostasis and malignant transformation.</description>

	<description>Closed-loop neurostimulation is a promising therapy being tested and clinically implemented in a growing number of neurological and psychiatric indications. This therapy is enabled by chronically implanted, bidirectional devices including the Medtronic Summit RC+S system. In order to successfully optimize therapy for patients implanted with these devices, analyses must be conducted offline on the recorded neural data, in order to inform optimal sense and stimulation parameters. The file format, volume, and complexity of raw data from these device necessitate conversion, parsing, and time reconstruction ahead of time-frequency analyses and modeling common to standard neuroscientific analyses. Here, we provide an open-source toolbox written in Matlab which takes raw files from the Summit RC+S and transforms these data into a standardized format amenable to conventional analyses. Furthermore, we provide a plotting tool which can aid in the visualization of multiple data streams and sense, stimulation, and therapy settings. Finally, we describe an analysis module which replicates RC+S on-board power computations, functionality which can accelerate biomarker discovery. This toolbox aims to accelerate the research and clinical advances made possible by longitudinal neural recordings and adaptive neurostimulation in people with neurological and psychiatric illnesses.</description>

	<description>High-frequency oscillatory events, termed ripples, represent synchrony of neural activity in the brain1. Experiments in animal models have characterized ripples during quiescent and sleep states1 and to a lesser degree during active behavior2-4. Converging evidence from these animal studies5,computational modeling6, and recent examinations in human participants support a link between hippocampal7-9 or medial temporal lobe (MTL)10,11 ripples and memory retrieval. Analyzing direct MTL recordings from 219 neurosurgical participants performing episodic recall tasks, we ask whether ripples specifically reflect the reinstatement of contextual information12-14, a defining property of episodic memory12,15, and are not just a recapitulation of recently-experienced stimuli7,10. Here we find that the rate of hippocampal ripples rises just prior to the free recall of recently-formed memories. This pre-recall ripple effect appears most strongly in the CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) subfields of hippocampus--regions critical for episodic memory16-18. Neighboring entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices exhibit a significantly weaker effect. The pre-recall ripple effect is strongest prior to the retrieval of semantically- and/or temporally-related recalls, indicating the involvement of ripples in contextual reinstatement, thereby specifically linking ripples with retrieval of episodic memories.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Reducing susceptibility distortion related image blurring in diffusion MRI EPI data</title>

	<description>Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an increasingly popular technique in basic and clinical neuroscience. One promising application is to combine diffusion MRI with myelin maps from complementary MRI techniques such as multi-parameter mapping (MPM) to produce g-ratio maps that represent the relative myelination of axons and predict their conduction velocity. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) can process both diffusion data and MPMs, making SPM the only widely accessible software that contains all the processing steps required to perform group analyses of g-ratio data in a common space. However, limitations have been identified in its method for reducing susceptibility-related distortion in diffusion data. More generally, susceptibility-related image distortion is often corrected by combining oppositely phase-encoded images (blip-up and blip-down) using the arithmetic mean (AM), however, this can lead to blurred images. In this study we sought to (1) improve the susceptibility-related distortion correction for diffusion MRI data in SPM; (2) deploy an alternative approach to the AM to reduce image blurring in diffusion MRI data when combining blip-up and blip-down EPI data after susceptibility-related distortion correction; and (3) assess the benefits of these changes for g-ratio mapping. We found that the new processing pipeline, called consecutive HySCO, improved distortion correction when compared to the standard approach in the ACID toolbox for SPM. Moreover, using a weighted average (WA) method to combine the distortion corrected data from each phase-encoding polarity achieved greater overlap of diffusion and more anatomically faithful structural white matter probability maps derived from minimally distorted multi-parameter maps as compared to the AM. Third, we showed that the consecutive HySCO WA performed better than the AM method when combined with multi-parameter maps to perform g-ratio mapping. These improvements mean that researchers can conveniently access a wide range of diffusion-related analysis methods within one framework because they are now available within the open-source ACID toolbox as part of SPM, which can be easily combined with other SPM toolboxes, such as the hMRI toolbox, to facilitate computation of myelin biomarkers that are necessary for g-ratio mapping.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Treadmill exercise promotes retinal astrocyte plasticity and protects against retinal degeneration</title>

	<description>Exercise has been shown to be an effective neuroprotective intervention that preserves retinal function and structure in several animal models of retinal degeneration. However, retinal cell morphology and cell types governing exercise-induced retinal neuroprotection remain elusive. Previously, we found that the protective effects of exercise in animal models of retinal disease were accompanied by increased levels of circulating and retinal brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and required intact signal transduction with its high-affinity receptor, tropomyosin kinase B (TrkB). Studies of neurodegenerative diseases in the brain demonstrate that neurons and astrocytes express BDNF and TrkB. Additionally, astrocytes have been shown to alter their morphology in response to exercise. Here, we have investigated the role of retinal astrocytes as mediators of exercise-induced retinal neuroprotection in a light-induced retinal degeneration mouse model (LIRD). We found that treadmill exercise in both our dim (control maintenance light levels) and LIRD groups promote increased retinal astrocytic population, GFAP expression, branching and endpoints, dendritic complexity, and promotes BDNF-astrocyte interaction. In contrast, LIRD animals that were inactive had significant reductions in all measured parameters. Our findings indicate that exercise is sufficient to rescue retinal astrocyte morphology in a LIRD model maintaining branching and dendritic arborization similar to retinal astrocytes that are not undergoing degeneration. These studies provide essential information to current knowledge gaps in regards to exercise-induced neuroprotection and will additionally provide knowledge in exercise intervention optimization as a rehabilitative method.</description>

	<description>Hearing spoken words can enhance visual object recognition, detection and discrimination. Yet, the mechanism underlying this facilitation is incompletely understood. On one account, words would not bias visual processes at early levels, but rather interact at later decision-making stages. More recent proposals posit that words can alter visual processes at early stages by activating category-specific priors in sensory regions. A prediction of this account is that top-down priors evoke changes in occipital areas before the presentation of visual stimuli. Here, we tested the hypothesis that neural oscillations can serve as a mechanism to activate language-mediated visual priors. Participants performed a cue-picture matching task where cues were either spoken words, in their native or second language, or natural sounds, while EEG and reaction times were recorded. Behaviorally, we replicated the previously reported label-advantage effect, with images cued by words being recognized faster than those cued by natural sounds. A time-frequency analysis of cue-target intervals revealed that this label-advantage was associated with enhanced power in posterior alpha (9-11 Hz) and beta oscillations (17-19 Hz), both of which were larger when the image was preceded by a word compared to a natural sound. Prestimulus alpha and beta rhythms were correlated with reaction time performance, yet they appeared to operate in different ways. Reaction times were faster when alpha power increased, but slowed down with enhancement of beta oscillations. These results suggest that alpha and beta rhythms work in tandem to support language-mediated visual object recognition, while showing an inverse relationship to behavioral performance.</description>

	<description>Early-life adversity (ELA) causes long-lasting structural and functional changes to the brain, rendering affected individuals vulnerable to the development of psychopathologies later in life. Immediate-early genes (IEGs) provide a potential marker for the observed alterations, bridging the gap between activity-regulated transcription and long-lasting effects on brain structure and function. Several heterogeneous studies have used IEGs to identify differences in cellular activity after ELA; systematically investigating the literature is therefore crucial for comprehensive conclusions. Here, we performed a systematic review on 39 pre-clinical studies in rodents to study the effects of ELA on IEG expression. Females and IEGs other than cFos were investigated in only a handful of publications. We meta-analyzed publications investigating specifically cFos expression. ELA increased cFos expression after an acute stressor only if the animals (control and ELA) had experienced multiple negative life events. At rest, ELA increased cFos expression irrespective of other life events, suggesting that ELA creates a phenotype similar to naive, acutely stressed animals. We present a conceptual theoretical framework to interpret the unexpected results. Overall, ELA likely alters IEG expression across the brain, especially in interaction with other negative life events. The present review highlights current knowledge gaps and provides guidance to aid the design of future studies.</description>

	<description>The interruption of spinal circuitry following spinal cord injury disrupts neural activity and is followed by a failure to mount an effective regenerative gene expression response resulting in permanent neurological disability. Functional recovery requires the enhancement of axonal and synaptic plasticity of spared as well as injured fibres, which need to sprout and/or regenerate to form new connections. Here we will investigate whether the combined epigenetic stimulation of the regenerative gene expression program with neuronal activity-dependent enhancement of neuroplasticity and guidance can overcome the current inability to promote neurological recovery in severe and chronic spinal cord injury. This will be carried out by delivering the small molecule CBP/p300 activator CSP-TTK21 in combination with environmental enrichment. We will deliver the CBP/p300 activator CSP-TTK21 weekly between week twelve and twenty following a severe transection model of spinal cord injury in the mouse. Data analysis will assess modifications in regenerative signalling, in motor and sensory axon sprouting and regeneration, in synaptic plasticity as well as in neurological sensorimotor recovery. This approach will advance our mechanistic understanding of regenerative failure and provide insight of whether combining growth promoting strategies with enhancement of neural activity is an effective therapeutic strategy in chronic spinal cord injury.</description>

	<description>Mitochondrial metabolism is critical for brain function. However, the mechanisms linking mitochondrial energy production to neuronal activity are elusive. Using whole-cell electrical recordings from Layer 5 pyramidal neurons in cortical slices and fluorescence imaging of cytosolic, mitochondrial Ca2+ indicators and endogenous NAD(P)H, we revealed ultra-fast, spike-evoked mitochondrial Ca2+ transients temporally similar to cytosolic Ca2+ elevations. We demonstrate that, whereas single or few spikes elicit the mitochondrial Ca2+ transients throughout the cell, their amplitude is differentially regulated in distinct neuronal compartments. Thus, these signals were prominent in the soma and apical dendrites and ~3 times smaller in basal dendrites and axons. The spike firing frequency had a subtle effect on the amplitude of the cytosolic Ca2+ elevations but dramatically affected mitochondrial Ca2+ transients and NAD(P)H oxidation and recovery rates. Moreover, while subthreshold EPSPs alone caused no detectable Ca2+ elevation in dendritic mitochondria, the Hebbian coincidence of unitary EPSP and postsynaptic spike produced a localized, single mitochondrial Ca2+ elevation. These findings suggest that neuronal mitochondria are uniquely capable of decoding firing frequency and EPSP-to-spike time intervals for tuning the metabolic rate and triggering changes in synaptic efficacy.</description>

	<description>Generating astrocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells has been hampered by either prolonged differentiation -spanning over two months -or by shorter protocols that generate immature astrocytes, devoid of salient inflammation-associated astrocytic traits pivotal for CNS neuropathological modeling. We directed human neural stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells to astrocytic commitment and maturity by orchestrating an astrocytic-tuned culturing environment. In under 28 days, the generated cells express canonical and mature astrocytic markers, denoted by the expression of AQP4 and, remarkably, the expression and functionality of glutamate transporter EAAT2. We also show that this protocol generates astrocytes that encompass traits critical in CNS disease modeling, such as glutathione synthesis and secretion, upregulation of ICAM-1 and a cytokine secretion profile which is on par with primary astrocytes. This protocol generates a multifaceted astrocytic model suitable for CNS in vitro disease modeling and personalized medicine through brain-on-chip technologies.</description>

	<description>Translational research often requires the testing of experimental therapies in primates, but research in non-human primates is now stringently controlled by law around the world. Tissues fixed in formaldehyde without glutaraldehyde have been thought to be inappropriate for use in electron microscopic analysis, particularly those of the brain. Here we report the immunoelectron microscopic characterization of arginine vasopressin (AVP)-producing neurons in macaque hypothalamo-pituitary axis tissues fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stored at -25{degrees}C for several years. The size difference of dense-cored vesicles between magnocellular and parvocellular AVP neurons was detectable in their cell bodies and perivascular nerve endings located, respectively, in the posterior pituitary and median eminence. Furthermore, glutamate and the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 were colocalized with AVP in perivascular nerve endings of both the posterior pituitary and the external layer of the median eminence, suggesting that both magnocellular and parvocellular AVP neurons are glutamatergic in primates. Both ultrastructure and immunoreactivity can therefore be sufficiently preserved in macaque brain tissues stored long-term for light microscopy. Taken together, these results suggest that this methodology could be applied to the human post-mortem brain and be very useful in translational research.</description>

	<description>The static magnetic field of MRI scanners can induce a magneto-hydrodynamic stimulation of the vestibular organ (MVS). In common fMRI settings, this MVS effect leads to a vestibular ocular reflex (VOR). We asked whether - beyond inducing a VOR - putting a healthy subject in a 3T MRI scanner would also alter goal-directed spatial behavior, as is known from other types of vestibular stimulation. We investigated 17 healthy volunteers, all of which exhibited a rightward VOR inside the MRI-scanner as compared to outside-MRI conditions. More importantly, when probing the distribution of overt spatial attention inside the MRI using a visual search task, subjects scanned a region of space that was significantly shifted towards the right. An additional estimate of subjective straight-ahead orientation likewise exhibited an MVC-induced rightward shift. Hence, putting a subject in a 3T MRI-scanner induces a bias of spatial attention, which closely mimics that of stroke patients with spatial neglect.</description>

	<description>Maternal separation (MS), a type of early life stress, has been associated with adverse socioemotional and behavioral outcomes throughout the lifespan across multiple species. Comprehensive longitudinal biobehavioral characterization of MS in rats is sparse and conflicting, warranting more studies. We conducted an MS paradigm involving 6-hour daily separation at unpredictable start times from P2 to P21. We hypothesized this severe form of MS would lead to developmentally emerging maladaptive biobehavioral consequences from juvenile through adult periods compared to Controls (C), especially in social behaviors. We tested: (1) own dam odor preference shortly after weaning; (2) juvenile and adult anxiety-like, sociability, and play behaviors using the light-dark test, three-chambered social interaction test, and video-coded juvenile play behavior; and (3) adult coping behaviors and neuroendocrine response using the forced swim test and blood corticosterone responses. Our results show minimal effects on biobehavioral outcomes across the lifespan. Recently weaned MS male rats had a stronger preference for their dam's odor. Juvenile MS females spent more time in rough-and-tumble play than C female rats. No differences in sociability were found in the juvenile or adult periods. MS promoted a decrease in anxiety-like behavior that persisted from juvenile to adult periods. Finally, MS led to deficits in coping behavior in male adults, but basal and reactive corticosterone levels were unaltered by MS. More studies are needed to validate our surprising findings and probe the neural mechanisms underlying some of the observed protective effects.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: PALB2 maintains redox and mitochondrial homeostasis in the brain and cooperates with ATG7 to suppress p53 dependent neurodegeneration</title>

	<description>The PALB2 tumor suppressor plays key roles in DNA repair and has been implicated in redox homeostasis. Autophagy maintains mitochondrial quality, mitigates oxidative stress and suppresses neurodegeneration. Here we show that Palb2 deletion in the mouse brain leads to motor deficits and that co-deletion of Palb2 with the essential autophagy gene Atg7 accelerates and exacerbates neurodegeneration induced by ATG7 loss. Palb2 deletion leads to elevated DNA damage, oxidative stress and mitochondrial markers, especially in Purkinje cells, and co-deletion of Palb2 and Atg7 results in accelerated Purkinje cell loss. Further analyses suggest that the accelerated Purkinje cell loss and severe neurodegeneration in the double deletion mice are due to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, rather than DNA damage, and partially dependent on p53 activity. Our studies uncover a role of PALB2 in mitochondrial regulation and a cooperation between PALB2 and ATG7/autophagy in maintaining redox and mitochondrial homeostasis essential for neuronal survival.</description>

	<description>Nociceptors are primary afferent neurons serving the reception of acute pain but also the transit into maladaptive pain disorders. Since native human nociceptors are hardly available for mechanistic functional research, and rodent models do not necessarily mirror human pathologies in all aspects, human iPSC-derived nociceptors (iDN) offer superior advantages as a human model system. Unbiased mRNA::microRNA co-sequencing, immunofluorescence staining and qPCR validations, revealed expression trajectories as well as miRNA target spaces throughout the transition of pluripotent cells into iDNs. mRNA and miRNA candidates emerged as regulatory hubs for neurite outgrowth, synapse development and ion channel expression. The exploratory data analysis tool NOCICEPTRA is provided as a containerized platform to retrieve experimentally determined expression trajectories, and to query custom gene sets for pathway and disease enrichments. Querying NOCICEPTRA for marker genes of cortical neurogenesis revealed distinct similarities and differences for cortical and peripheral neurons. The platform provides a public domain neuroresource to exploit the entire data sets and explore miRNA and mRNA as hubs regulating human nociceptor differentiation and function.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Microglial CX3CR1I249/M280 variant limits neurogenesis and remyelination in cuprizone-induced multiple sclerosis model</title>

	<description>Microglia have been implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. The fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 regulates the activation of pathogenic microglia in models of MS and the human polymorphic CX3CR1I249/M280 (hCX3CR1I249/M280) variant increases MS disease progression. However, the role of hCX3CR1I249/M280 on microglial activation and central nervous system repair and regenerative mechanisms remain unknown. Therefore, using transgenic mice expressing the hCX3CR1I249/M280 variant, we aimed to determine the contribution of defective CX3CR1 signaling to remyelination and neurogenesis in the cuprizone model of focal demyelination. Here, we report that mice expressing hCX3CR1I249/M280 exhibit marked demyelination and microgliosis follow acute cuprizone treatment. Cuprizone-treated CX3CR1-deficient and fractalkine-deficient mice displayed a comparable phenotype. Nanostring gene expression analysis in demyelinated lesions showed that hCX3CR1I249/M280 upregulates genes associated with inflammation, oxidative stress and disease-associated microglia. In addition, gene expression analysis in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus in hCX3CR1I249/M280 mice was associated with a significant downregulation of gene networks linked to neurogenesis following acute demyelination. Confocal microscopy showed that hCX3CR1I249/M280 or loss of CX3CR1 signaling inhibits the generation of progeny from the neurogenic niche, including cells involved in myelin repair. These results provide evidence for the pathogenic capacity of hCX3CR1I249/M280 on microglia dysfunction and therapeutic targeting of CX3CR1 to promote CNS repair in MS.</description>

	<description>We exploited genetic information to assess non-genetic influences in autoimmunity. We isolated gene modules whose products physically interact with environmental exposures related to autoimmunity, and analyzed their nominal statistical evidence of association with autoimmune and non-autoimmune diseases in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data. Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and other Herpesviruses interactomes emerged as specifically associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), possibly under common regulatory mechanisms. Analyses of MS blood and brain transcriptomes, cytofluorimetric studies of endogenous EBV-infected lymphoblastoid lines, and lesion immunohistochemistry, confirmed a dysregulation of MS-associated EBV interactors, suggesting their contribution to CD40 signaling alterations in MS. These interactors resulted enriched in modules from inherited axonopathies-causing genes, supporting a link between EBV and neurodegeneration in MS, in accord with the observed transcriptomic dysregulations in MS brains. They were also enriched with top-ranked pharmaceutical targets prioritized on a genetic basis. This study delineates a disease-specific influence of herpesviruses on MS biology.</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The early detection of patients at risk of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) may help planning subacute and long-term care. We aimed to determine the predictivity of two screening cognitive tests on the occurrence of mild cognitive impairment or dementia in acute stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A cognitive assessment within a few days of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke was performed in patients consecutively admitted to a stroke unit over 14 months by means of the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-B).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Out of 191 stroke survivors who were non-demented at baseline, 168 attended at least one follow-up visit. At follow-up (mean duration ± SD 12.8 ± 8.7 months), 28 (18.9%) incident cases of MCI and 27 (18%) cases of dementia were recorded. In comparison with patients who remained cognitively stable at follow-up, these patients were older, less educated, had more comorbidities, a higher score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at admission, more severe cerebral atrophy, and lower MoCA-B and CDT scores at baseline. In multi-adjusted (for age, education, comorbidities score, NIHSS at admission and atrophy score) model, a pathological score on baseline CDT (&amp;lt; 6.55) was associated with a higher risk of PSCI at follow-up (HR 2.022; 95% CI 1.025–3.989, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) with respect to non-pathological scores. A pathological baseline score on MoCA-B (&amp;lt; 24) did not predict increased risk of cognitive decline at follow-up nor increased predictivity of stand-alone CDT.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A bedside cognitive screening with the CDT helps identifying patients at higher risk of PSCI.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Blood–Brain Barrier Breakdown in Relationship to Alzheimer and Vascular Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26134</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26134?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been suggested to be an early biomarker in human cognitive impairment. However, the relationship between BBB breakdown and brain pathology, most commonly Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular disease, is still poorly understood. The present study measured human BBB function in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients on 2 molecular scales, specifically BBB's permeability to water and albumin molecules.


Methods
Fifty‐five elderly participants were enrolled, including 33 MCI patients and 22 controls. BBB permeability to water was measured with a new magnetic resonance imaging technique, water extraction with phase contrast arterial spin tagging. BBB permeability to albumin was determined using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum albumin ratio. Cognitive performance was assessed by domain‐specific composite scores. AD pathology (including CSF Aβ and ptau) and vascular risk factors were examined.


Results
Compared to cognitively normal subjects, BBB in MCI patients manifested an increased permeability to small molecules such as water but was no more permeable to large molecules such as albumin. BBB permeability to water was found to be related to AD markers of CSF Aβ and ptau. On the other hand, BBB permeability to albumin was found to be related to vascular risk factors, especially hypercholesterolemia, but was not related to AD pathology. BBB permeability to small molecules, but not to large molecules, was found to be predictive of cognitive function.


Interpretation
These findings provide early evidence that BBB breakdown is related to both AD and vascular risks, but their effects can be differentiated by spatial scales. BBB permeability to small molecules has a greater impact on cognitive performance. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mutations in HID1 Cause Syndromic Infantile Encephalopathy and Hypopituitarism</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26127</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26127?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Precursors of peptide hormones undergo posttranslational modifications within the trans‐Golgi network (TGN). Dysfunction of proteins involved at different steps of this process cause several complex syndromes affecting the central nervous system (CNS). We aimed to clarify the genetic cause in a group of patients characterized by hypopituitarism in combination with brain atrophy, thin corpus callosum, severe developmental delay, visual impairment, and epilepsy.


Methods
Whole exome sequencing was performed in seven individuals of six unrelated families with these features. Postmortem histopathological and HID1 expression analysis of brain tissue and pituitary gland were conducted in one patient. Functional consequences of the homozygous HID1 variant p.R433W were investigated by Seahorse XF Assay in fibroblasts of two patients.


Results
Bi‐allelic variants in the gene HID1 domain‐containing protein 1 (HID1) were identified in all patients. Postmortem examination confirmed cerebral atrophy with enlarged lateral ventricles. Markedly reduced expression of pituitary hormones was found in pituitary gland tissue. Colocalization of HID1 protein with the TGN was not altered in fibroblasts of patients compared to controls, while the extracellular acidification rate upon stimulation with potassium chloride was significantly reduced in patient fibroblasts compared to controls.


Interpretation
Our findings indicate that mutations in HID1 cause an early infantile encephalopathy with hypopituitarism as the leading presentation, and expand the list of syndromic CNS diseases caused by interference of TGN function. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: PIGQ-Related Glycophosphatidylinositol Deficiency Associated with Nonprogressive Congenital Ataxia</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor pathway plays an essential role in posttranslational modification of proteins to facilitate proper membrane anchoring and trafficking to lipid rafts, which is critical for many cell functions, including embryogenesis and neurogenesis. GPI biosynthesis is a multi-step process requiring the activity of over 25 distinct genes, most of them belonging to the phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG) family and associated with rare neurodevelopmental disorders. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PIGQ&lt;/em&gt; encodes the phosphatidylinositol glycan class Q protein and is part of the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase complex that initiates GPI biosynthesis from phosphatidylinositol (PI) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Pathogenic variants in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PIGQ&lt;/em&gt; gene have been previously reported in 10 patients with congenital hypotonia, early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy, and premature death occurring in more than half cases. We detected a novel homozygous variant in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PIGQ&lt;/em&gt; (NM_004204.5: c.1631dupA; p.Tyr544fs*79) by WES trio-analysis of a male patient with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by nonprogressive congenital ataxia, intellectual disability, generalized epilepsy, and cerebellar atrophy. Flow cytometry confirmed deficiency of several GPI-anchored proteins on leukocytes (CD14, FLAER). Clinical features of this case broaden the phenotypic spectrum of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PIGQ&lt;/em&gt;-related GPI deficiency, outlining the importance of glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor pathway in the pathogenesis of cerebellar ataxia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Biological Cybernetics: Two dimensionless parameters and a mechanical analogue for the HKB model of motor coordination</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The widely cited Haken–Kelso–Bunz (HKB) model of motor coordination is used in an enormous range of applications. In this paper, we show analytically that the weakly damped, weakly coupled HKB model of two oscillators depends on only two dimensionless parameters; the ratio of the linear damping coefficient and the linear coupling coefficient and the ratio of the combined nonlinear damping coefficients and the combined nonlinear coupling coefficients. We illustrate our results with a mechanical analogue. We use our analytic results to predict behaviours in arbitrary parameter regimes and show how this led us to explain and extend recent numerical continuation results of the full HKB model. The key finding is that the HKB model contains a significant amount of behaviour in biologically relevant parameter regimes not yet observed in experiments or numerical simulations. This observation has implications for the development of virtual partner interaction and the human dynamic clamp, and potentially for the HKB model itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Gaze behavior during pedestrian interactions in a community environment: a real-world perspective</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Locomotor adaptations, as required for community walking, rely heavily on the sense of vision. Little is known, however, about gaze behavior during pedestrian interactions while ambulating in the community. Our objective was to characterize gaze behavior while walking in a community environment and interacting with pedestrians of different locations and directions. Twelve healthy young individuals were assessed as they walked in a shopping mall from a pre-set location to a goal located 20 m ahead. Eye movements were recorded with a binocular eye-tracker and temporal distance factors were assessed using wearable sensors from a full-body motion capture system. Participants exhibited more numerous and longer gaze episodes on pedestrians (GEP) that were walking in the same direction as themselves vs. those that were in the opposite direction. The relative durations of GEPs, however, showed no significant differences between pedestrians walking in the same vs. opposite direction. Longer durations of GEPs were also observed for centrally located pedestrians compared to those located on either side, but this was the case only for pedestrians that were walking in the same direction as participants. In addition, pedestrians in the centre, and even more so those on the right, were fixated at farther distances compared to those on the left. Results indicate that healthy young individuals modulate their gaze behavior as a function of the location and direction of pedestrians when ambulating in a community environment. The observed modulation is interpreted as being caused by an interplay between collision risk, pedestrian visibility, presence of leaders and social conventions (right-sided circulation). Present results also establish baseline measures for the quantification of defective visuomotor strategies in individuals with mobility disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Explicit motor sequence learning after stroke: a neuropsychological study</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Motor learning interacts with and shapes experience-dependent cerebral plasticity. In stroke patients with paresis of the upper limb, motor recovery was proposed to reflect a process of re-learning the lost/impaired skill, which interacts with rehabilitation. However, to what extent stroke patients with hemiparesis may retain the ability of learning with their affected limb remains an unsolved issue, that was addressed by this study. Nineteen patients, with a cerebrovascular lesion affecting the right or the left hemisphere, underwent an explicit motor learning task (finger tapping task, FTT), which was performed with the paretic hand. Eighteen age-matched healthy participants served as controls. Motor performance was assessed during the learning phase (i.e., online learning), as well as immediately at the end of practice, and after 90 min and 24 h (i.e., retention). Results show that overall, as compared to the control group, stroke patients, regardless of the side (left/right) of the hemispheric lesion, do not show a reliable practice-dependent improvement; consequently, no retention could be detected in the long-term (after 90 min and 24 h). The motor learning impairment was associated with subcortical damage, predominantly affecting the basal ganglia; conversely, it was not associated with age, time elapsed from stroke, severity of upper-limb motor and sensory deficits, and the general neurological condition. This evidence expands our understanding regarding the potential of post-stroke motor recovery through motor practice, suggesting a potential key role of basal ganglia, not only in implicit motor learning as previously pointed out, but also in explicit finger tapping motor tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
The wide variety of cell types and their biophysical complexities pose a challenge in our ability to understand oscillatory activities produced by cellular‐based computational network models. This challenge stems from their high‐dimensional and multiparametric natures. To overcome this, we implement a solution by linking minimal and detailed models of CA1 microcircuits that generate intrahippocampal (3–12 Hz) theta rhythms. We leverage insights from minimal models to guide explorations of more detailed models and obtain a cellular perspective of theta generation. Our findings distinguish the pyramidal cells as the theta rhythm initiators and reveal that their activity is regularized by the inhibitory cell populations, supporting a proposed hypothesis of an “inhibition‐based tuning” mechanism. We find a strong correlation between input current to the pyramidal cells and the resulting local field potential theta frequency, indicating that intrinsic pyramidal cell properties underpin network frequency characteristics. This work provides a cellular‐based foundation from which in vivo theta activities can be explored.</description>

G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are critical regulators of cellular function acting via heterotrimeric G proteins as their primary transducers with individual GPCRs capable of pleiotropic coupling to multiple G proteins. Structural features governing G protein selectivity and promiscuity are currently unclear. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures of the cholecystokinin (CCK) type 1 receptor (CCK1R) bound to the CCK peptide agonist, CCK-8 and 2 distinct transducer proteins, its primary transducer Gq, and the more weakly coupled Gs. As seen with other Gq/11–GPCR complexes, the Gq–α5 helix (αH5) bound to a relatively narrow pocket in the CCK1R core. Surprisingly, the backbone of the CCK1R and volume of the G protein binding pocket were essentially equivalent when Gs was bound, with the Gs αH5 displaying a conformation that arises from “unwinding” of the far carboxyl-terminal residues, compared to canonically Gs coupled receptors. Thus, integrated changes in the conformations of both the receptor and G protein are likely to play critical roles in the promiscuous coupling of individual GPCRs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/pYiyanK0KHY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Thalamic reticular nucleus in Alligator mississippiensis: Soma and dendritic morphology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25194</guid>

	<description>Neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) complex are heterogeneous and vary in dendritic morphology, cell shape, spine and axon presence, soma size, and orientation to surrounding fibers. An example of 7, Golgi‐stained neurons with five primary dendrites and their location (inset) in this composite sagittal section illustrates a spectrum of dendritic arbors and these other features. Arrows point to the direction of fibers in the TRN. Greatest soma length (L) is indicated. Neurons in the inset, enlarged views of neurons, and enclosed boxes are coded with similar colors.







Abstract
The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a critical structure influencing information transfer to the forebrain. In crocodilians, the TRN shares many features with its mammalian counterpart. One area that has not been explored is how individual neurons in the crocodilian TRN compare with those found in mammals. In mammals, TRN neurons are aligned parallel to the external border of the dorsal thalamus, have their dendrites oriented perpendicular to the fibers in the internal capsule, have fine, filamentous dendritic appendages, are either bipolar or multipolar, and are commonly considered to be a homogeneous morphological population of cells. To investigate the cellular morphology of the TRN complex, a Golgi analysis was undertaken in Alligator mississippiensis. This study examined features that have been used in mammals. In Alligator, the four TRN divisions are the dorsal peduncular nucleus, the perireticular nucleus, the interstitial nucleus, and the neurons in the medial forebrain bundle associated with the interstitial nucleus. In crocodilians, the dorsal peduncular nucleus is homologous to the TRN of mammals. From the 1787 drawn neuron profiles in the traditional three planes of section, the following were concluded. First, neurons in each part of the TRN complex in Alligator were similar in morphology. Second, each part of the TRN complex of Alligator contained a heterogenous population of cells. These variations between the cellular morphology of the dorsal peduncular nucleus of crocodilians and the TRN of mammals are speculated to partly result from differences in forebrain organization.</description>

	<description>Abstract
Research innovation that leads to discovery in the battle against neurological disease and disorders requires diverse ideas. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, one of the National Institutes of Health's 27 institutes and centers, strives to reduce the burden of neurological disease and disorders. The National Institutes of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke is very interested in increasing the diversity of researchers by addressing the existing barriers responsible for the low numbers of underrepresented populations from traditionally minority‐serving institutions (MSIs) and non‐minority serving institutions (non‐MSIs). This commentary provides insight on the persistent underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minorities entering neuroscience research careers paths, focusing on multiples levels within the scientific academy and the supportive role that both MSIs and non‐MSIs play in increasing diversity in the biomedical research workforce.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Efficient extra‐mitochondrial aerobic ATP synthesis in neuronal membrane systems</title>

	<description>Comparison of mitochondrial and extramitochondrial activity in neuronal membrane systems. In the last years, literature reports that the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) machinery is expressed not only on the inner mitochondrial membrane but also on other membranous structures. In order to highlight the similarities and differences between these two entities, in this work, we compared the activity of mitochondrial OxPhos with that expressed in isolated myelin and rod outer segments.

Abstract
The nervous system displays high energy consumption, apparently not fulfilled by mitochondria, which are underrepresented therein. The oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) activity, a mitochondrial process that aerobically provides ATP, has also been reported also in the myelin sheath and the rod outer segment (OS) disks. Thus, commonalities and differences between the extra‐mitochondrial and mitochondrial aerobic metabolism were evaluated in bovine isolated myelin (IM), rod OS, and mitochondria‐enriched fractions (MIT). The subcellular fraction quality and the absence of contamination fractions have been estimated by western blot analysis. Oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis were stimulated by conventional (pyruvate + malate or succinate) and unconventional (NADH) substrates, observing that oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis by IM and rod OS are more efficient than by MIT, in the presence of both kinds of respiratory substrates. Mitochondria did not utilize NADH as a respiring substrate. When ATP synthesis by either sample was assayed in the presence of 10–100 µM ATP in the assay medium, only in IM and OS it was not inhibited, suggesting that the ATP exportation by the mitochondria is limited by extravesicular ATP concentration. Interestingly, IM and OS but not mitochondria appear able to synthesize ATP at a later time with respect to exposure to respiratory substrates, supporting the hypothesis that the proton gradient produced by the electron transport chain is buffered by membrane phospholipids. The putative transfer mode of the OxPhos molecular machinery from mitochondria to the extra‐mitochondrial structures is also discussed, opening new perspectives in the field of neurophysiology.</description>

	<title>Neuroinformatics: DTI Atlases Evaluations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12021-021-09521-y</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The cerebral atlas of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance image (DT-MRI, shorted as DTI) is one of the key issues in neuroimaging research. It is crucial for comparisons of neuronal structural integrity and connectivity across populations. Usually, the atlas is constructed by iteratively averaging the registered individual image. In tradition, the fuzzy group average image is easily generated in the initial stage, which is harmful to providing clear guidance for subsequent registration, to the performance of the final atlas. To solve this problem, an improved unbiased DTI atlas construction algorithm based on adaptive weights is proposed in this paper. The adaptive weighted strategy based on diffeomorphic deformable tensor registration is introduced. At the same time, the distance measure for tensors is used as a constraint condition, which ensures the unbiasedness of the atlas. Then, using 77 DTIs from the dataset in &lt;a class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot; href=&quot;http://www.brain-development.org&quot;&gt;http://www.brain-development.org&lt;/a&gt;, three study-specific atlases, i.e. the constructed atlases of the proposed algorithm and two open-sourced algorithms (DTIAtlasBuilder and DTI-TK), are compared with two standardized atlases (IIT v. 4.1 and NTU-DSI-122-DTI). The performances of the atlases were evaluated in spatial normalization way with six region-based criteria (including Euclidean distances between diffusion tensors, Euclidean distances of the deviatoric tensors, standard deviation, overlaps of eigenvalue-eigenvector, cross-correlations and three sets angles of eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs between diffusion tensors) and three fiber-based criteria (including distances between fiber bundles, angles between fiber bundles and fiber property profile-based criteria). The experimental results showed that the overall performances of the study-specific atlases are better than those of the standardized atlases for specific datasets, and the comprehensive performance of the improved algorithm proposed in this paper is the best.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To compare the retinal vascular network and structure of optic neuritis associated with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies (MOG-ON) or aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4-ON).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Nineteen patients with MOG-ON (29 eyes), 24 patients with AQP4-ON (43 eyes), and 25 healthy participants (50 eyes) were enrolled. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), mean deviation (MD), retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, parafoveal ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness, and vessel densities in the peripapillary and parafoveal areas were measured.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The BCVA, RNFL thickness, GCIPL thickness, and vessel densities in the peripapillary and parafoveal areas were significantly decreased in the AQP4-ON and MOG-ON eyes compared with healthy controls (all &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in the MD, RNFL thickness, GCIPL thickness, or vessel densities between the AQP4-ON and MOG-ON eyes (all &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). However, the BCVA was significantly worse in AQP4-ON eyes than in MOG-ON eyes (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001). The peripapillary vessel density was significantly correlated with the BCVA and MD in AQP4-ON eyes and with MD in MOG-ON eyes (all &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MOG-ON and AQP4-ON are associated with severe visual dysfunction, as well as retinal structural and vascular damage. The extent of visual dysfunction was strongly correlated with the peripapillary vessel density. Although we found no significant difference in the MD between MOG-ON and AQP4-ON, which are characterized by comparable vascular and structural damage within the peripapillary and parafoveal areas, the BCVA was worse in AQP4-ON eyes than in MOG-ON eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: The vestibular system modulates the contributions of head and torso to egocentric spatial judgements</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Egocentric representations allow us to describe the external world as experienced from an individual’s bodily location. We recently developed a novel method of quantifying the weight given to different body parts in egocentric judgments (the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Misalignment Paradigm&lt;/em&gt;). We found that both head and torso contribute to simple alter-egocentric spatial judgments. We hypothesised that artificial stimulation of the vestibular system would provide a head-related signal, which might affect the weighting given to the head in egocentric spatial judgments. Bipolar Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) was applied during the Misalignment Paradigm. A Sham stimulation condition was also included to control for non-specific effects. Our data show that the weight given to the head was increased during left anodal and right cathodal GVS, compared to the opposite GVS polarity (right anodal and left cathodal GVS) and Sham stimulation. That is, the polarity of GVS, which preferentially activates vestibular areas in the right cerebral hemisphere, influenced the relative weightings of head and torso in egocentric spatial judgments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Dynamically Optimizing Network Structure Based on Synaptic Pruning in the Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.620558</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.620558</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most neural networks need to predefine the network architecture empirically, which may cause over-fitting or under-fitting. Besides, a large number of parameters in a fully connected network leads to the prohibitively expensive computational cost and storage overhead, which makes the model hard to be deployed on mobile devices. Dynamically optimizing the network architecture by pruning unused synapses is a promising technique for solving this problem. Most existing pruning methods focus on reducing the redundancy of deep convolutional neural networks by pruning unimportant filters or weights, at the cost of accuracy drop. In this paper, we propose an effective brain-inspired synaptic pruning method to dynamically modulate the network architecture and simultaneously improve network performance. The proposed model is biologically inspired as it dynamically eliminates redundant connections based on the synaptic pruning rules used during the brain's development. Connections are pruned if they are not activated or less activated multiple times consecutively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on classification tasks of different complexity with the MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. Experimental results reveal that even for a compact network, the proposed method can also remove up to 59–90% of the connections, with relative improvement in learning speed and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Oxaliplatin Depolarizes the IB4– Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons to Drive the Development of Neuropathic Pain Through TRPM8 in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.690858</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Use of chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin is associated with painful peripheral neuropathy that is exacerbated by cold. Remodeling of ion channels including TRP channels in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons contribute to the sensory hypersensitivity following oxaliplatin treatment in animal models. However, it has not been studied if TRP channels and membrane depolarization of DRG neurons serve as the initial ionic/membrane drives (such as within an hour) that contribute to the development of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain. In the current study, we studied in mice (1) in vitro acute effects of oxaliplatin on the membrane excitability of IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulations of DRG neurons using a perforated patch clamping, (2) the preventative effects of a membrane-hyperpolarizing drug retigabine on oxaliplatin-induced sensory hypersensitivity, and (3) the preventative effects of TRP channel antagonists on the oxaliplatin-induced membrane hyperexcitability and sensory hypersensitivity. We found (1) IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulations of small DRG neurons displayed previously undiscovered, substantially different membrane excitability, (2) oxaliplatin selectively depolarized IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; DRG neurons, (3) pretreatment of retigabine largely prevented oxaliplatin-induced sensory hypersensitivity, (4) antagonists of TRPA1 and TRPM8 channels prevented oxaliplatin-induced membrane depolarization, and (5) the antagonist of TRPM8 largely prevented oxaliplatin-induced sensory hypersensitivity. These results suggest that oxaliplatin depolarizes IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; neurons through TRPM8 channels to drive the development of neuropathic pain and targeting the initial drives of TRPM8 and/or membrane depolarization may prevent oxaliplatin-induce neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Indications for Inpatient Magnetoencephalography in Children – An Institution’s Experience</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.667777</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is recognized as a valuable non-invasive clinical method for localization of the epileptogenic zone and critical functional areas, as part of a pre-surgical evaluation for patients with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. MEG is also useful in localizing functional areas as part of pre-surgical planning for tumor resection. MEG is usually performed in an outpatient setting, as one part of an evaluation that can include a variety of other testing modalities including 3-Tesla MRI and inpatient video-electroencephalography monitoring. In some clinical circumstances, however, completion of the MEG as an inpatient can provide crucial ictal or interictal localization data during an ongoing inpatient evaluation, in order to expedite medical or surgical planning. Despite well-established clinical indications for performing MEG in general, there are no current reports that discuss indications or considerations for completion of MEG on an inpatient basis. We conducted a retrospective institutional review of all pediatric MEGs performed between January 2012 and December 2020, and identified 34 cases where MEG was completed as an inpatient. We then reviewed all relevant medical records to determine clinical history, all associated diagnostic procedures, and subsequent treatment plans including epilepsy surgery and post-surgical outcomes. In doing so, we were able to identify five indications for completing the MEG on an inpatient basis: (1) super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), (2) intractable epilepsy with frequent electroclinical seizures, and/or frequent or repeated episodes of status epilepticus, (3) intractable epilepsy with infrequent epileptiform discharges on EEG or outpatient MEG, or other special circumstances necessitating inpatient monitoring for successful and safe MEG data acquisition, (4) MEG mapping of eloquent cortex or interictal spike localization in the setting of tumor resection or other urgent neurosurgical intervention, and (5) international or long-distance patients, where outpatient MEG is not possible or practical. MEG contributed to surgical decision-making in the majority of our cases (32 of 34). Our clinical experience suggests that MEG should be considered on an inpatient basis in certain clinical circumstances, where MEG data can provide essential information regarding the localization of epileptogenic activity or eloquent cortex, and be used to develop a treatment plan for surgical management of children with complicated or intractable epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In most mammals, retinal ganglion cell axons from each retina project to both sides of the brain. The segregation of ipsi and contralateral projections into eye-specific territories in their main brain targets—the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus and the superior colliculus—is critical for the processing of visual information. The investigation of the developmental mechanisms contributing to the wiring of this binocular map in mammals identified competitive mechanisms between axons from each retina while interactions between axons from the same eye were challenging to explore. Studies in vertebrates lacking ipsilateral retinal projections demonstrated that competitive mechanisms also exist between axons from the same eye. The development of a genetic approach enabling the differential manipulation and labeling of neighboring retinal ganglion cells in a single mouse retina revealed that binocular map development does not only rely on axon competition but also involves a cooperative interplay between axons to stabilize their terminal branches. These recent insights into the developmental mechanisms shaping retinal axon connectivity in the brain will be discussed here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Modulation of Septo-Hippocampal Neural Responses in Anesthetized and Behaving Rats by Septal AMPA Receptor Mechanisms</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.663633</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.663633</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study explored the effects of septal glutamatergic transmission on septal-hippocampal theta activity via intraseptal microinjection of antagonist at AMPA receptors (AMPAR). The current results showed that microinjection of AMPAR antagonist, NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione, 20 μg/μl, 0.5 μl), evoked a decrease in the frequency of theta activity evoked by various means in anesthetized and behaving rat. Theta wave activity was induced on: (a) intraseptal microinjection of carbachol, an agonist at cholinergic receptors, (b) reticular stimulation, (c) exploration in novel open field (OF), and (d) hind paw (HP) injection of the algogen, formalin. The effect on frequency in the formalin test was observed in an early period on injection of formalin, which was novel to the animal, but not in the later more sustained phase of the formalin test. The effect of NBQX, being seen in both anesthetized and behaving animals, suggests that the modulation of theta wave frequency, including in novelty, is a function of AMPAR in MS. The effect of the antagonist on theta power was less apparent, being observed only in anesthetized animals. In addition to theta power and frequency, intraseptal NBQX also attenuated suppression of CA1 population spike (PS) induced by intraseptal carbachol, thus suggesting that septal glutamate neurotransmission is involved in the spectrum of MS-mediated network responses. Indeed, in the context of behavior, formalin injection induced an increase in the level of septal glutamate, while NBQX attenuated nociceptive behaviors. Notably, MS is involved in the modulation of formalin nociception. These findings suggest that AMPA receptors are a key modulator of septal physiological function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Heterogeneity and Development of Fine Astrocyte Morphology Captured by Diffraction-Limited Microscopy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.669280</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.669280</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The fine processes of single astrocytes can contact many thousands of synapses whose function they can modulate through bi-directional signaling. The spatial arrangement of astrocytic processes and neuronal structures is relevant for such interactions and for the support of neuronal signaling by astrocytes. At the same time, the geometry of perisynaptic astrocyte processes is variable and dynamically regulated. Studying these fine astrocyte processes represents a technical challenge, because many of them cannot be fully resolved by diffraction-limited microscopy. Therefore, we have established two indirect parameters of astrocyte morphology, which, while not fully resolving local geometry by design, provide statistical measures of astrocyte morphology: the fraction of tissue volume that astrocytes occupy and the density of resolvable astrocytic processes. Both are straightforward to obtain using widely available microscopy techniques. We here present the approach and demonstrate its robustness across various experimental conditions using mainly two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy in acute slices and in vivo as well as modeling. Using these indirect measures allowed us to analyze the morphology of relatively large populations of astrocytes. Doing so we captured the heterogeneity of astrocytes within and between the layers of the hippocampal CA1 region and the developmental profile of astrocyte morphology. This demonstrates that volume fraction (VF) and segment density are useful parameters for describing the structure of astrocytes. They are also suitable for online monitoring of astrocyte morphology with widely available microscopy techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Supplementary Effect of Choline Alfoscerate on Speech Recognition in Patients With Age-Related Hearing Loss: A Prospective Study in 34 Patients (57 Ears)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.684519</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.684519</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To investigate the effect of choline alfoscerate (CA) on hearing amplification in patients with age related hearing loss, we performed a prospective case-control observational study from March 2016 to September 2020. We assessed patients with bilateral word recognition score (WRS) &amp;lt;50% using monosyllabic words. The patients were 65–85 years old, without any history of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, parkinsonism, or depression. After enrollment, all patients started using hearing aids (HA). The CA group received a daily dose of 800 mg CA for 11 months. We performed between-group comparisons of audiological data, including pure tone audiometry, WRS, HA fitting data obtained using real-ear measurement (REM), and the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid benefit scores after treatment. After CA administration, the WRS improved significantly in the CA group (4.2 ± 8.3%), but deteriorated in the control group (−0.6 ± 8.1%, p = 0.035). However, there was no significant between-group difference in the change in pure tone thresholds and aided speech intelligibility index calculated from REM. These findings suggest that the difference in WRS was relevant to central speech understanding rather than peripheral audibility. Therefore, administering oral CA could effectively enrich listening comprehension in older HA users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Changes in Metabolic Activity and Gait Function by Dual-Task Cognitive Game-Based Treadmill System in Parkinson’s Disease: Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.680270</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.680270</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Balance and gait impairments, and consequently, mobility restrictions and falls are common in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Various cognitive deficits are also common in PD and are associated with increased fall risk. These mobility and cognitive deficits are limiting factors in a person’s health, ability to perform activities of daily living, and overall quality of life. Community ambulation involves many dual-task (DT) conditions that require processing of several cognitive tasks while managing or reacting to sudden or unexpected balance challenges. DT training programs that can simultaneously target balance, gait, visuomotor, and cognitive functions are important to consider in rehabilitation and promotion of healthy active lives. In the proposed multi-center, randomized controlled trial (RCT), novel behavioral positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging methods are used to evaluate the molecular basis and neural underpinnings of: (a) the decline of mobility function in PD, specifically, balance, gait, visuomotor, and cognitive function, and (b) the effects of an engaging, game-based DT treadmill walking program on mobility and cognitive functions. Both the interactive cognitive game tasks and treadmill walking require continuous visual attention, and share spatial processing functions, notably to minimize any balance disturbance or gait deviation/stumble. The ability to “walk and talk” normally includes activation of specific regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the basal ganglia (site of degeneration in PD). The PET imaging analysis and comparison with healthy age-matched controls will allow us to identify areas of abnormal, reduced activity levels, as well as areas of excessive activity (increased attentional resources) during DT-walking. We will then be able to identify areas of brain plasticity associated with improvements in mobility functions (balance, gait, and cognition) after intervention. We expect the gait-cognitive training effect to involve re-organization of PFC activity among other, yet to be identified brain regions. The DT mobility-training platform and behavioral PET brain imaging methods are directly applicable to other diseases that affect gait and cognition, e.g., cognitive vascular impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, as well as in aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Blood Pressure Level Is Associated With Changes in Plasma Aβ1 –40 and Aβ1–42 Levels: A Cross-sectional Study Conducted in the Suburbs of Xi’an, China</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the brain is the hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Hypertension is a risk factor for AD, but the effects of hypertension on Aβ deposition are not fully determined. Considering peripheral Aβ closely relates to Aβ deposition in the brain, we investigated the relationships between blood pressure (BP) level and plasma Aβ concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One-thousand and sixty-nine participants (age above 45) from a village in the suburbs of Xi’an, China were enrolled. Questionnaires and validated Chinese versions of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were used to collect information about vascular risk factors and assess cognition function. The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype was detected using PCR and sequencing. Plasma Aβ levels were measured using ELISA. The associations between BP and plasma Aβ levels were analyzed by using multivariate linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; level was higher in high BP group than that in normal BP group (53.34 ± 8.50 pg/ml vs. 51.98 ± 8.96 pg/ml, P = 0.013), in high SBP group than that in normal SBP group (53.68 ± 8.69 pg/ml vs. 51.88 ± 8.80 pg/ml, P = 0.001) and in high MABP group than that in normal MABP group (54.05 ± 8.78 pg/ml vs. 52.04 ± 8.75 pg/ml, P = 0.001). After controlling for the confounding factors, SBP (b = 0.078, P &amp;lt; 0.001), DBP (b = 0.090, P = 0.008) and MABP (b = 0.104, P &amp;lt; 0.001) correlated with plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; level positively in ApoE ε4 non-carriers, but not ApoE ε4 carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Elevated BP levels were associated with increased plasma Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; levels in middle-aged and elderly ApoE ε4 non-carriers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Punishment insensitivity in humans is due to failures in instrumental contingency learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.69594</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69594</link>
	<description>Punishment maximises the probability of our individual survival by reducing behaviours that cause us harm, and also sustains trust and fairness in groups essential for social cohesion. However, some individuals are more sensitive to punishment than others and these differences in punishment sensitivity have been linked to a variety of decision-making deficits and psychopathologies. The mechanisms for why individuals differ in punishment sensitivity are poorly understood, although recent studies of conditioned punishment in rodents highlight a key role for punishment contingency detection (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2019). Here, we applied a novel ‘Planets and Pirates’ conditioned punishment task in humans, allowing us to identify the mechanisms for why individuals differ in their sensitivity to punishment. We show that punishment sensitivity is bimodally distributed in a large sample of normal participants. Sensitive and insensitive individuals equally liked reward and showed similar rates of reward-seeking. They also equally disliked punishment and did not differ in their valuation of cues that signalled punishment. However, sensitive and insensitive individuals differed profoundly in their capacity to detect and learn volitional control over aversive outcomes. Punishment insensitive individuals did not learn the instrumental contingencies, so they could not withhold behaviour that caused punishment and could not generate appropriately selective behaviours to prevent impending punishment. These differences in punishment sensitivity could not be explained by individual differences in behavioural inhibition, impulsivity, or anxiety. This bimodal punishment sensitivity and these deficits in instrumental contingency learning are identical to those dictating punishment sensitivity in non-human animals, suggesting that they are general properties of aversive learning and decision-making.</description>

	<title>eLife: Canonical NF-κB signaling maintains corneal epithelial integrity and prevents corneal aging via retinoic acid</title>

	<description>Disorders of the transparent cornea affect millions of people worldwide. However, how to maintain and/or regenerate this organ remains unclear. Here, we show that &lt;i&gt;Rela &lt;/i&gt;(encoding a canonical NF-kB subunit) ablation in K14&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; corneal epithelial stem cells not only disrupts corneal regeneration but also results in age-dependent epithelial deterioration, which triggers aberrant wound healing processes including stromal remodeling, neovascularization, epithelial metaplasia, and plaque formation at the central cornea. These anomalies are largely recapitulated in normal mice that age naturally. Mechanistically, &lt;i&gt;Rela &lt;/i&gt;deletion suppresses expression of Aldh1a1, an enzyme required for retinoic acid synthesis from vitamin A. Retinoic acid administration blocks development of ocular anomalies in &lt;i&gt;Krt14-Cre; Rela&lt;sup&gt;f/f&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice and naturally aged mice. Moreover, epithelial metaplasia and plaque formation are preventable by inhibition of angiogenesis. This study thus uncovers major mechanisms governing corneal maintenance, regeneration and aging and identifies the NF-kB-retinoic acid pathway as a therapeutic target for corneal disorders.</description>

	<description>Pathological oscillations including elevated beta activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and between STN and cortical areas are a hallmark of neural activity in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Oscillations also play an important role in normal physiological processes and serve distinct functional roles at different points in time. We characterised the effect of dopaminergic medication on oscillatory whole-brain networks in PD in a time-resolved manner by employing a hidden Markov model on combined STN local field potentials and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from 17 PD patients. Dopaminergic medication led to coherence within the medial and orbitofrontal cortex in the delta/theta frequency range. This is in line with known side effects of dopamine treatment such as deteriorated executive functions in PD. In addition, dopamine caused the beta band activity to switch from an STN-mediated motor network to a frontoparietal-mediated one. In contrast, dopamine did not modify local STN–STN coherence in PD. STN–STN synchrony emerged both on and off medication. By providing electrophysiological evidence for the differential effects of dopaminergic medication on the discovered networks, our findings open further avenues for electrical and pharmacological interventions in PD.</description>

	<description>Neuroendocrine systems in animals maintain organismal homeostasis and regulate stress response. Although a great deal of work has been done on the neuropeptides and hormones that are released and act on target organs in the periphery, the synaptic inputs onto these neuroendocrine outputs in the brain are less well understood. Here, we use the transmission electron microscopy reconstruction of a whole central nervous system in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larva to elucidate the sensory pathways and the interneurons that provide synaptic input to the neurosecretory cells projecting to the endocrine organs. Predicted by network modeling, we also identify a new carbon dioxide-responsive network that acts on a specific set of neurosecretory cells and that includes those expressing corazonin (Crz) and diuretic hormone 44 (Dh44) neuropeptides. Our analysis reveals a neuronal network architecture for combinatorial action based on sensory and interneuronal pathways that converge onto distinct combinations of neuroendocrine outputs.</description>

	<description>Temporal regularity is ubiquitous and essential to guiding attention and coordinating behavior within a dynamic environment. Previous researchers have modeled attention as an internal rhythm that may entrain to first-order regularity from rhythmic events to prioritize information selection at specific time points. Using the attentional blink paradigm, here we show that higher-order regularity based on rhythmic organization of contextual features (pitch, color, or motion) may serve as a temporal frame to recompose the dynamic profile of visual temporal attention. Critically, such attentional reframing effect is well predicted by cortical entrainment to the higher-order contextual structure at the delta band as well as its coupling with the stimulus-driven alpha power. These results suggest that the human brain involuntarily exploits multiscale regularities in rhythmic contexts to recompose dynamic attending in visual perception, and highlight neural entrainment as a central mechanism for optimizing our conscious experience of the world in the time dimension.</description>

	<description>Sleep is a conserved and essential behavior, but its mechanistic and functional underpinnings remain poorly defined. Through unbiased genetic screening in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, we discovered a novel short-sleep mutant we named &lt;i&gt;argus&lt;/i&gt;. Positional cloning and subsequent complementation, CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out, and RNAi studies identified Argus as a transmembrane protein that acts in adult peptidergic neurons to regulate sleep. &lt;i&gt;argus&lt;/i&gt; mutants accumulate undigested Atg8a(+) autophagosomes, and genetic manipulations impeding autophagosome formation suppress &lt;i&gt;argus&lt;/i&gt; sleep phenotypes, indicating that autophagosome accumulation drives &lt;i&gt;argus&lt;/i&gt; short-sleep. Conversely, a &lt;i&gt;blue cheese&lt;/i&gt; neurodegenerative mutant that impairs autophagosome formation was identified independently as a gain-of-sleep mutant, and targeted RNAi screens identified additional genes involved in autophagosome formation whose knockdown increases sleep. Finally, autophagosomes normally accumulate during the daytime and nighttime sleep deprivation extends this accumulation into the following morning, while daytime gaboxadol feeding promotes sleep and reduces autophagosome accumulation at nightfall. In sum, our results paradoxically demonstrate that wakefulness increases and sleep decreases autophagosome levels under unperturbed conditions, yet strong and sustained upregulation of autophagosomes decreases sleep, whereas strong and sustained downregulation of autophagosomes increases sleep. The complex relationship between sleep and autophagy suggested by our findings may have implications for pathological states including chronic sleep disorders and neurodegeneration, as well as for integration of sleep need with other homeostats, such as under conditions of starvation.</description>

	<description>Meniscal tears are associated with a high risk of osteoarthritis but currently have no disease-modifying therapies. Using a Gli1 reporter line, we found that Gli1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells contribute to the development of meniscus horns from 2 weeks of age. In adult mice, Gli1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells resided at the superficial layer of meniscus and expressed known mesenchymal progenitor markers. In culture, meniscal Gli1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells possessed high progenitor activities under the control of Hh signal. Meniscus injury at the anterior horn induced a quick expansion of &lt;i&gt;Gli1-lineage&lt;/i&gt; cells. Normally, meniscal tissue healed slowly, leading to cartilage degeneration. Ablation of Gli1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells further hindered this repair process. Strikingly, intra-articular injection of Gli1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; meniscal cells or an Hh agonist right after injury accelerated the bridging of the interrupted ends and attenuated signs of osteoarthritis. Taken together, our work identified a novel progenitor population in meniscus and proposes a new treatment for repairing injured meniscus and preventing osteoarthritis.</description>

	<description>Defective autophagy is strongly associated with chronic inflammation. Loss-of-function of the core autophagy gene &lt;i&gt;Atg16l1&lt;/i&gt; increases risk for Crohn’s disease in part by enhancing innate immunity through myeloid cells such as macrophages. However, autophagy is also recognized as a mechanism for clearance of certain intracellular pathogens. These divergent observations prompted a re-evaluation of ATG16L1 in innate antimicrobial immunity. In this study, we found that loss of &lt;i&gt;Atg16l1&lt;/i&gt; in myeloid cells enhanced the killing of virulent &lt;i&gt;Shigella flexneri (S.flexneri)&lt;/i&gt;, a clinically relevant enteric bacterium that resides within the cytosol by escaping from membrane-bound compartments. Quantitative multiplexed proteomics of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages revealed that ATG16L1 deficiency significantly upregulated proteins involved in the glutathione-mediated antioxidant response to compensate for elevated oxidative stress, which simultaneously promoted &lt;i&gt;S.flexneri&lt;/i&gt; killing. Consistent with this, myeloid-specific deletion of &lt;i&gt;Atg16l1&lt;/i&gt; in mice accelerated bacterial clearance in &lt;i&gt;vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Pharmacological induction of oxidative stress through suppression of cysteine import enhanced microbial clearance by macrophages. Conversely, antioxidant treatment of macrophages permitted &lt;i&gt;S.flexneri&lt;/i&gt; proliferation. These findings demonstrate that control of oxidative stress by ATG16L1 and autophagy regulates antimicrobial immunity against intracellular pathogens.</description>

	<description>The composition of gut-associated microbial communities changes during intestinal inflammation, including an expansion of Enterobacteriaceae populations. The mechanisms underlying microbiota changes during inflammation are incompletely understood. Here, we analyzed previously published metagenomic datasets with a focus on microbial hydrogen metabolism. The bacterial genomes in the inflamed murine gut and in patients with inflammatory bowel disease contained more genes encoding predicted hydrogen-utilizing hydrogenases compared to communities found under non-inflamed conditions. To validate these findings, we investigated hydrogen metabolism of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli,&lt;/i&gt; a representative Enterobacteriaceae, in mouse models of colitis. &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; mutants lacking hydrogenase-1 and hydrogenase-2 displayed decreased fitness during colonization of the inflamed cecum and colon. Utilization of molecular hydrogen was in part dependent on respiration of inflammation-derived electron acceptors. This work highlights the contribution of hydrogenases to alterations of the gut microbiota in the context of non-infectious colitis.</description>

	<title>eLife: Cytoplasmic mRNA decay represses RNA polymerase II transcription during early apoptosis</title>

	<description>RNA abundance is generally sensitive to perturbations in decay and synthesis rates, but crosstalk between RNA polymerase II transcription and cytoplasmic mRNA degradation often leads to compensatory changes in gene expression. Here, we reveal that widespread mRNA decay during early apoptosis represses RNAPII transcription, indicative of positive (rather than compensatory) feedback. This repression requires active cytoplasmic mRNA degradation, which leads to impaired recruitment of components of the transcription preinitiation complex to promoter DNA. Importin a/b-mediated nuclear import is critical for this feedback signaling, suggesting that proteins translocating between the cytoplasm and nucleus connect mRNA decay to transcription. We also show that an analogous pathway activated by viral nucleases similarly depends on nuclear protein import. Collectively, these data demonstrate that accelerated mRNA decay leads to the repression of mRNA transcription, thereby amplifying the shutdown of gene expression. This highlights a conserved gene regulatory mechanism by which cells respond to threats.</description>

Classic reinforcement learning (RL) theories cannot explain human behavior in the absence of external reward or when the environment changes. Here, we employ a deep sequential decision-making paradigm with sparse reward and abrupt environmental changes. To explain the behavior of human participants in these environments, we show that RL theories need to include surprise and novelty, each with a distinct role. While novelty drives exploration before the first encounter of a reward, surprise increases the rate of learning of a world-model as well as of model-free action-values. Even though the world-model is available for model-based RL, we find that human decisions are dominated by model-free action choices. The world-model is only marginally used for planning, but it is important to detect surprising events. Our theory predicts human action choices with high probability and allows us to dissociate surprise, novelty, and reward in EEG signals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XynWQ8GORzc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Recently, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that miRNAs are involved in human diseases, indicating that miRNAs might be a potential pathogenic factor for various diseases. Therefore, figuring out the relationship between miRNAs and diseases plays a critical role in not only the development of new drugs, but also the formulation of individualized diagnosis and treatment. As the prediction of miRNA-disease association via biological experiments is expensive and time-consuming, computational methods have a positive effect on revealing the association. In this study, a novel prediction model integrating GCN, CNN and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (GCSENet) was constructed for the identification of miRNA-disease association. The model first captured features by GCN based on a heterogeneous graph including diseases, genes and miRNAs. Then, considering the different effects of genes on each type of miRNA and disease, as well as the different effects of the miRNA-gene and disease-gene relationships on miRNA-disease association, a feature weight was set and a combination of miRNA-gene and disease-gene associations was added as feature input for the convolution operation in CNN. Furthermore, the squeeze and excitation blocks of SENet were applied to determine the importance of each feature channel and enhance useful features by means of the attention mechanism, thus achieving a satisfactory prediction of miRNA-disease association. The proposed method was compared against other state-of-the-art methods. It achieved an AUROC score of 95.02% and an AUPR score of 95.55% in a 10-fold cross-validation, which led to the finding that the proposed method is superior to these popular methods on most of the performance evaluation indexes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bSi9U-j4N0Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Genomic DNA is packaged in chromatin, a dynamic fiber variable in size and compaction. In chromatin, repeating nucleosome units wrap 145–147 DNA basepairs around histone proteins. Genetic and epigenetic regulation of genes relies on structural transitions in chromatin which are driven by intra- and inter-nucleosome dynamics and modulated by chemical modifications of the unstructured terminal tails of histones. Here we demonstrate how the interplay between histone H3 and H2A tails control ample nucleosome breathing motions. We monitored large openings of two genomic nucleosomes, and only moderate breathing of an engineered nucleosome in atomistic molecular simulations amounting to 24 μs. Transitions between open and closed nucleosome conformations were mediated by the displacement and changes in compaction of the two histone tails. These motions involved changes in the DNA interaction profiles of clusters of epigenetic regulatory aminoacids in the tails. Removing the histone tails resulted in a large increase of the amplitude of nucleosome breathing but did not change the sequence dependent pattern of the motions. Histone tail modulated nucleosome breathing is a key mechanism of chromatin dynamics with important implications for epigenetic regulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rBnNLN6ARqA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Beef is the most resource intensive of all commonly used food items. Disproportionate synthetic fertilizer use during beef production propels a vigorous one-way factory-to-ocean nutrient flux, which alternative agriculture models strive to rectify by enhancing in-farm biogeochemical cycling. Livestock, especially cattle, are central to these models, which advocates describe as the context most likely to overcome beef’s environmental liabilities. Yet the dietary potential of such models is currently poorly known. Here, I thus ask whether nitrogen-sparing agriculture (NSA) can offer a viable alternative to the current US food system. Focusing on the most common eutrophication-causing element, N, I devise a specific model of mixed-use NSA comprising numerous small farms producing human plant-based food and forage, the latter feeding a core intensive beef operation that forgoes synthetic fertilizer and relies only on locally produced manure and N fixers. Assuming the model is deployed throughout the high-quality, precipitation-rich US cropland (delimiting approximately 100 million ha, less than half of today’s agricultural land use) and neglecting potential macroeconomic obstacles to wide deployment, I find that NSA could produce a diverse, high-quality nationwide diet distinctly better than today’s mean US diet. The model also permits 70%–80% of today’s beef consumption, raises today’s protein delivery by 5%–40%, and averts approximately 60% of today’s fertilizer use and approximately 10% of today’s total greenhouse gas emissions. As defined here, NSA is thus potentially a viable, scalable environmentally superior alternative to the current US food system, but only when combined with the commitment to substantially enhance our reliance on plant food.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YBfN0hYrX1E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mechanisms of Ischemic Stroke in Patients with Cancer: A Prospective Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26129</guid>

	<description>Objective
The objective of this study was to examine the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke with cancer.


Methods
We conducted a prospective cross‐sectional study from 2016 to 2020 at 2 hospitals. We enrolled 3 groups of 50 adult participants each. The main group included patients with active solid tumor cancer and acute ischemic stroke. The control groups included patients with acute ischemic stroke only or active cancer only. The patients with stroke‐only and patients with cancer‐only were matched to the patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke by age, sex, and cancer type, if applicable. The outcomes were prespecified hematological biomarkers and transcranial Doppler microemboli detection. Hematological biomarkers included markers of coagulation (D‐dimer and thrombin‐antithrombin), platelet function (P‐selectin), and endothelial integrity (thrombomodulin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 [sICAM‐1], and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule‐1 [sVCAM‐1]). Hematological biomarkers were compared between groups using the Kruskal‐Wallis and Wilcoxon Rank‐Sum tests. In multivariable linear regression models, we adjusted for race, number of stroke risk factors, smoking, stroke severity, and antithrombotic use. Transcranial Doppler microemboli presence was compared between groups using chi‐square tests.


Results
Levels of all study biomarkers were different between groups. In univariate between‐group comparisons, patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke had higher levels of D‐dimer, sICAM‐1, sVCAM‐1, and thrombomodulin than both control groups; higher levels of thrombin‐antithrombin than patients with cancer‐only; and higher levels of P‐selectin than patients with stroke‐only. Findings were similar in multivariable analyses. Transcranial Doppler microemboli were detected in 32% of patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke, 16% of patients with stroke‐only, and 6% of patients with cancer‐only (p = 0.005).


Interpretation
Patients with cancer‐related stroke have higher markers of coagulation, platelet, and endothelial dysfunction, and more circulating microemboli, than matched controls. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>Nature Communications: Nuclear compartmentalization of TERT mRNA and TUG1 lncRNA is driven by intron retention</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 03 June 2021; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23221-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-021-23221-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;RNA localization plays an important role in transcriptome regulation. The majority of TERT transcripts are detected in the nucleus and TUG1 lncRNAs in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Here, the authors combine single-cell RNA imaging, antisense oligonucleotides and splicing analyses to show that retention of specific introns drives stable compartmentalization of TERT and TUG1 transcripts in the nucleus, and that splicing of TERT retained introns is mitotically regulated.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/_X7AFwuBMv0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the adherence of stroke patients to direct oral anticoagulants: a secondary analysis from the MAAESTRO study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10631-5</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The negative impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on stroke care has been reported, but no data exist on the influence of the lockdown on medication adherence to antithrombotic treatment for stroke prevention. We present a comparison of electronic adherence data of stroke patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) prior to and during the COVID-19 lockdown in spring 2020 in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This is a secondary analysis using data from the ongoing MAAESTRO study, in which stroke patients with atrial fibrillation electronically monitor their adherence to DOAC treatment. Eligible patients for this analysis had at least four weeks of adherence data prior to and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Three adherence metrics (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;taking adherence, timing adherence, drug holidays&lt;/em&gt;) were calculated and compared descriptively.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The analysis included eight patients (median age 81.5 years, IQR 74.8–84.5). Five patients had a pre-lockdown &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;taking adherence&lt;/em&gt; over 90% (mean 96.8% ± 2.9), with no change during lockdown, high &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;timing adherence&lt;/em&gt; in both periods and no &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;drug holidays&lt;/em&gt;. The remaining three patients had pre-lockdown &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;taking&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;timing adherence &lt;/em&gt;below 90%. Of those, two patients showed a moderate decline either in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;taking&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;timing adherence&lt;/em&gt; compared to pre-lockdown. One showed a substantial increase in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;taking&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;timing adherence&lt;/em&gt; during lockdown (both + 25.8%).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Our data suggest that a major disruption of social life (i.e., the imposed COVID-19 lockdown) is unlikely to relevantly affect the medication intake behaviour of patients with high pre-established adherence, but might have an impact in patients with previously suboptimal adherence.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Altered mental status (AMS) is a common neurological manifestation of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized patients. The principal causes of AMS have yet to be determined. We aimed to identify the common causes of AMS in patients with COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department with AMS on arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients presenting with AMS to three New York hospitals, from March 1 to April 16, 2020. Underlying causes of AMS on arrival to the emergency department (ED) were categorized as (1) neurological causes (stroke, seizure, encephalitis); (2) metabolic encephalopathy; (3) indeterminant. Multivariable analysis was used to assess independent predictors.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Overall, 166 patients presented to the ED with AMS. Metabolic encephalopathy was diagnosed as the cause in 154 (92.8%), with 118 (71.1%) categorized as multifactorial ME and 36 (21.7%) with single-cause ME. Hypoxia 103 (62.0%) and renal failure 75 (45.2%) were the most common underlying mechanisms. Neurological causes of AMS occurred in a total 20 patients (12%) and as the sole factor in 5 (3.0%); 10 (6.0%) cases were seizure related and 10 (6.0%) were cerebrovascular events. Of the 7 patients with indeterminant causes, only 1 was suspicious for encephalitis (0.6%). Age, pre-existing dementia and cerebrovascular disease, and impaired renal function were independent predictors of AMS.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;When reaching to targets within arm’s reach, intentional trunk motion must be neutralized by compensatory motion of the upper limb (UL). Advanced age has been associated with deterioration in the coordination of multi-joint UL movements. In the current study, we looked to determine if older adults also have difficulties modifying their UL movements (i.e., coordination between the shoulder and elbow joints), during a complex reaching task when trunk motion is manipulated. Two groups of healthy participants were recruited: 18 young (mean age = 24.28 ± 2.89 years old) and 18 older (mean age = 72.11 ± 2.39 years old) adults. Participants reached to a target with their eyes closed, while simultaneously moving the trunk forward. In 40% of trials, the trunk motion was unexpectedly blocked. Participants performed the task with both their dominant and non-dominant arms, and at a preferred and fast speed. All participants were able to coordinate motion at the elbow and shoulder joints in a similar manner and modify this coordination in accordance with motion at the trunk, regardless of the hand used or speed of movement. Specifically, in reaches that involved forward trunk motion (free-trunk trials), all participants demonstrated increased elbow flexion (i.e., less elbow extension) compared to blocked-trunk trials. In contrast, when trunk motion was blocked (blocked-trunk trials), all reaching movements were accompanied by increased shoulder horizontal adduction. While coordination of UL joints was similar across older and young adults, the extent of changes at the elbow and shoulder was smaller and less consistent in older adults compared to young participants, especially when trunk motion was involved. These results suggest that older adults can coordinate their UL movements based on task requirements, but that their performance is not as consistent as young adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Relationship between the level of mental fatigue induced by a prolonged cognitive task and the degree of balance disturbance</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study investigated the effects of mental fatigue (MF) induced by a 90-min AX-continuous performance test (AX-CPT) on balance control by addressing the issue of the heterogeneity of individuals’ responses. Twenty healthy young active participants were recruited. They had to carry out two balance tasks (sway as little as possible on a stable support with the eyes open and closed) when standing on a force platform before and after performing a 90-min AX-CPT. The NASA-TLX test was used to assess the subjective manifestations of MF. Objective cognitive performance was measured using results from the AX-CPT. Inter-individual differences in behavioral deterioration due to MF were analyzed with a hierarchical cluster analysis, which categorizes participants’ behaviors into subgroups with similar characteristics. The cluster analysis revealed that the achievement of the AX-CPT induced various levels of MF and balance impairments within the whole sample. A significant relationship between the level of MF and the degree of balance disturbance was observed only when participants stood with the eyes open, thus suggesting that inter-individual differences in vulnerability to MF could stem from differences between subjects in the level of engagement of visual attention and/or from differences in field dependency for balance control. These findings show that the completion of the same prolonged demanding cognitive task induces a strong heterogeneity in subjects’ responses, with marked individual differences in MF vulnerability that affect balance control differently according to the sensory context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Effects of visual-motor illusion on functional connectivity during motor imagery</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study aimed to verify whether visual-motor illusion changes the functional connectivity during kinesthetic motor imagery and the vividness of kinesthetic motor imagery. Twelve right-handed healthy adults participated in this study. All participants randomly performed both the illusion and observation conditions in 20 min, respectively. Illusion condition was induced kinesthetic illusion by viewing own finger movement video. Observation condition was observed own finger movement video. Before and after each condition, the brain activity of kinesthetic motor imagery was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The measure of brain activity under kinesthetic motor imagery was executed in five sets using block design. Under the kinesthetic motor imagery, participants were asked to imagine the movement of their right finger. Functional connectivity was analyzed during the kinesthetic motor imagery. In addition, after performing the task under kinesthetic motor imagery, the vividness of the kinesthetic motor imagery was measured using a visual analog scale. Furthermore, after each condition, the degree of kinesthetic illusion and sense of body ownership measured based on a seven-point Likert scale. Our results indicated that the functional connectivity during kinesthetic motor imagery was changed in the frontal-parietal network of the right hemisphere. The vividness of the kinesthetic motor imagery was significantly higher with the illusion condition compared with the observation condition. The degree of kinesthetic illusion and sense of body ownership were significantly higher with the illusion condition compared with the observation condition. In conclusion, the visual-motor illusion changes the functional connectivity during kinesthetic motor imagery and influences the vividness of kinesthetic motor imagery. The visual-motor illusion provides evidence that it improves motor imagery ability. VMI may be used in patients with impaired motor imagery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Pelvic Pain Alters Functional Connectivity Between Anterior Cingulate Cortex and Hippocampus in Both Humans and a Rat Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hippocampus (HIPP) are two key brain regions associated with pain and pain-related affective processing. However, whether and how pelvic pain alters the neural activity and connectivity of the ACC and HIPP under baseline and during social pain, and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, remain unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combined with electrophysiology and biochemistry, we show that pelvic pain, particularly, primary dysmenorrhea (PDM), causes an increase in the functional connectivity between ACC and HIPP in resting-state fMRI, and a smaller reduction in connectivity during social exclusion in PDM females with periovulatory phase. Similarly, model rats demonstrate significantly increased ACC-HIPP synchronization in the gamma band, associating with reduced modulation by ACC-theta on HIPP-gamma and increased levels of receptor proteins and excitation. This study brings together human fMRI and animal research and enables improved therapeutic strategies for ameliorating pain and pain-related affective processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Striatal Synapse Degeneration and Dysfunction Are Reversed by Reactivation of Wnt Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.670467</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synapse degeneration in the striatum has been associated with the early stages of Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases (PD and HD). However, the molecular mechanisms that trigger synaptic dysfunction and loss are not fully understood. Increasing evidence suggests that deficiency in Wnt signaling triggers synapse degeneration in the adult brain and that this pathway is affected in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we demonstrate that endogenous Wnt signaling is essential for the integrity of a subset of inhibitory synapses on striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). We found that inducible expression of the specific Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) in the adult striatum leads to the loss of inhibitory synapses on MSNs and affects the synaptic transmission of D2-MSNs. We also discovered that re-activation of the Wnt pathway by turning off Dkk1 expression after substantial loss of synapses resulted in the complete recovery of GABAergic and dopamine synapse number. Our results also show that re-activation of the Wnt pathway leads to a recovery of amphetamine response and motor function. Our studies identify the Wnt signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target for restoring neuronal circuits after synapse degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Nitric Oxide Regulates GluA2-Lacking AMPAR Contribution to Synaptic Transmission of CA1 Apical but Not Basal Dendrites</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.656377</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms of synaptic plasticity differ in distinct local circuits. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, the mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) at apical dendrites in stratum radiatum and basal dendrites in stratum oriens involve different molecular cascades. For instance, participation of nitric oxide in LTP induction was shown to be necessary only for apical dendrites. This phenomenon may play a key role in information processing in CA1, and one of the reasons for this difference may be differing synaptic characteristics in these regions. Here, we compared the synaptic responses to stimulation of apical and basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons and found a difference in the current–voltage characteristics of these inputs, which is presumably due to a distinct contribution of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors to synaptic transmission. In addition, we obtained data that indicate the presence of these receptors in pyramidal dendrites in both stratum radiatum and stratum oriens. We also demonstrated that inhibition of NO synthase reduced the contribution of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors at apical but not basal dendrites, and inhibition of soluble guanylate cyclase did not affect this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Epigenetic Impacts of Early Life Stress in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Shape the Neurodevelopmental Continuum</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodevelopment in humans is a long, elaborate, and highly coordinated process involving three trimesters of prenatal development followed by decades of postnatal development and maturation. Throughout this period, the brain is highly sensitive and responsive to the external environment, which may provide a range of inputs leading to positive or negative outcomes. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) result from prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Although the molecular mechanisms of FASD are not fully characterized, they involve alterations to the regulation of gene expression via epigenetic marks. As in the prenatal stages, the postnatal period of neurodevelopment is also sensitive to environmental inputs. Often this sensitivity is reflected in children facing adverse conditions, such as maternal separation. This exposure to early life stress (ELS) is implicated in the manifestation of various behavioral abnormalities. Most FASD research has focused exclusively on the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure in isolation. Here, we review the research into the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure and ELS, with a focus on the continuum of epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations. Interestingly, a select few experiments have assessed the cumulative effect of prenatal alcohol and postnatal maternal separation stress. Regulatory regions of different sets of genes are affected by both treatments independently, and a unique set of genes are affected by the combination of treatments. Notably, epigenetic and gene expression changes converge at the clustered protocadherin locus and oxidative stress pathway. Functional studies using epigenetic editing may elucidate individual contributions of regulatory regions for hub genes and further profiling efforts may lead to the development of non-invasive methods to identify children at risk. Taken together, the results favor the potential to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes by epigenetic management of children born with FASD using favorable postnatal conditions with or without therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Axotomy Induces Drp1-Dependent Fragmentation of Axonal Mitochondria</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.668670</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is well established that CNS axons fail to regenerate, undergo retrograde dieback, and form dystrophic growth cones due to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We sought to investigate the role of axonal mitochondria in the axonal response to injury. A viral vector (AAV) containing a mitochondrially targeted fluorescent protein (mitoDsRed) as well as fluorescently tagged LC3 (GFP-LC3), an autophagosomal marker, was injected into the primary motor cortex, to label the corticospinal tract (CST), of adult rats. The axons of the CST were then injured by dorsal column lesion at C4-C5. We found that mitochondria in injured CST axons near the injury site are fragmented and fragmentation of mitochondria persists for 2 weeks before returning to pre-injury lengths. Fragmented mitochondria have consistently been shown to be dysfunctional and detrimental to cellular health. Inhibition of Drp1, the GTPase responsible for mitochondrial fission, using a specific pharmacological inhibitor (mDivi-1) blocked fragmentation. Additionally, it was determined that there is increased mitophagy in CST axons following Spinal cord injury (SCI) based on increased colocalization of mitochondria and LC3. In vitro models revealed that mitochondrial divalent ion uptake is necessary for injury-induced mitochondrial fission, as inhibiting the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) using RU360 prevented injury-induced fission. This phenomenon was also observed in vivo. These studies indicate that following the injury, both in vivo and in vitro, axonal mitochondria undergo increased fission, which may contribute to the lack of regeneration seen in CNS neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Amyloid-β Impairs Dendritic Trafficking of Golgi-Like Organelles in the Early Phase Preceding Neurite Atrophy: Rescue by Mirtazapine</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurite atrophy with loss of neuronal polarity is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurological disorders. While there is substantial agreement that disruption of intracellular vesicle trafficking is associated with axonal pathology in AD, comparatively less is known regarding its role in dendritic atrophy. This is a significant gap of knowledge because, unlike axons, dendrites are endowed with the complete endomembrane system comprising endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), Golgi apparatus, post-Golgi vesicles, and a recycling-degradative route. In this study, using live-imaging of pGOLT-expressing vesicles, indicative of Golgi outposts and satellites, we investigate how amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers affect the trafficking of Golgi-like organelles in the different dendritic compartments of cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We found that short-term (4 h) treatment with Aβ led to a decrease in anterograde trafficking of Golgi vesicles in dendrites of both resting and stimulated (with 50 mM KCl) neurons. We also characterized the ability of mirtazapine, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic tetracyclic antidepressant (NaSSA), to rescue Golgi dynamics in dendrites. Mirtazapine treatment (10 μM) increased the number and both anterograde and retrograde motility, reducing the percentage of static Golgi vesicles. Finally, mirtazapine reverted the neurite atrophy induced by 24 h treatment with Aβ oligomers, suggesting that this drug is able to counteract the effects of Aβ by improving the dendritic trafficking of Golgi-related vesicles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Physiology and Therapeutic Potential of SK, H, and M Medium AfterHyperPolarization Ion Channels</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;SK, HCN, and M channels are medium afterhyperpolarization (mAHP)-mediating ion channels. The three channels co-express in various brain regions, and their collective action strongly influences cellular excitability. However, significant diversity exists in the expression of channel isoforms in distinct brain regions and various subcellular compartments, which contributes to an equally diverse set of specific neuronal functions. The current review emphasizes the collective behavior of the three classes of mAHP channels and discusses how these channels function together although they play specialized roles. We discuss the biophysical properties of these channels, signaling pathways that influence the activity of the three mAHP channels, various chemical modulators that alter channel activity and their therapeutic potential in treating various neurological anomalies. Additionally, we discuss the role of mAHP channels in the pathophysiology of various neurological diseases and how their modulation can alleviate some of the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Innate Signaling in the CNS Prevents Demyelination in a Focal EAE Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The pathological hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the formation of multifocal demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system (CNS). Stimulation of innate receptors has been shown to suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an MS-like disease in mice. Specifically, targeting Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and NOD-like receptor 2 (NOD2) significantly reduced disease severity. In the present work we have developed a novel focal EAE model to further study the effect of innate signaling on demyelinating pathology. Focal lesions were induced by stereotactic needle insertion into the corpus callosum (CC) of mice previously immunized for EAE. This resulted in focal pathology characterized by infiltration and demyelination in the CC. We find that intrathecal delivery of MIS416, a TLR9 and NOD2 bispecific innate ligand, into the cerebrospinal fluid reduced focal lesions in the CC. This was associated with upregulation of type I and II interferons, interleukin-10, arginase-1, CCL-2 and CXCL-10. Analysis of draining cervical lymph nodes showed upregulation of type II interferons and interleukin 10. Moreover, intrathecal MIS416 altered the composition of early CNS infiltrates, increasing proportions of myeloid and NK cells and reducing T cells at the lesion site. This study contributes to an increased understanding of how innate immune responses can play a protective role, which in turn may lead to additional therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of demyelinating pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Classification of Schizophrenia by Combination of Brain Effective and Functional Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.651439</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.651439</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;At present, lots of studies have tried to apply machine learning to different electroencephalography (EEG) measures for diagnosing schizophrenia (SZ) patients. However, most EEG measures previously used are either a univariate measure or a single type of brain connectivity, which may not fully capture the abnormal brain changes of SZ patients. In this paper, event-related potentials were collected from 45 SZ patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs) during a learning task, and then a combination of partial directed coherence (PDC) effective and phase lag index (PLI) functional connectivity were used as features to train a support vector machine classifier with leave-one-out cross-validation for classification of SZ from HCs. Our results indicated that an excellent classification performance (accuracy = 95.16%, specificity = 94.44%, and sensitivity = 96.15%) was obtained when the combination of functional and effective connectivity features was used, and the corresponding optimal feature number was 15, which included 12 PDC and three PLI connectivity features. The selected effective connectivity features were mainly located between the frontal/temporal/central and visual/parietal lobes, and the selected functional connectivity features were mainly located between the frontal/temporal and visual cortexes of the right hemisphere. In addition, most of the selected effective connectivity abnormally enhanced in SZ patients compared with HCs, whereas all the selected functional connectivity features decreased in SZ patients. The above results showed that our proposed method has great potential to become a tool for the auxiliary diagnosis of SZ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Purpose&lt;p&gt;To extract texture features from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of patients with brain tumors and use them to train a classification model for supporting an early diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Two groups of regions (control and tumor) were selected from MRI scans of 40 patients with meningioma or glioma. These regions were analyzed to obtain texture features. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS (version 20.0), including the Shapiro–Wilk test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, which were used to test significant differences in each feature between the tumor and healthy regions. T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) was used to visualize the data distribution so as to avoid tumor selection bias. The Gini impurity index in random forests (RFs) was used to select the top five out of all features. Based on the five features, three classification models were built respectively with three machine learning classifiers: RF, support vector machine (SVM), and back propagation (BP) neural network.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Sixteen of the 25 features were significantly different between the tumor and healthy areas. Through the Gini impurity index in RFs, standard deviation, first-order moment, variance, third-order absolute moment, and third-order central moment were selected to build the classification model. The classification model trained using the SVM classifier achieved the best performance, with sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of 94.04%, 92.3%, and 0.932, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Texture analysis with an SVM classifier can help differentiate between brain tumor and healthy areas with high speed and accuracy, which would facilitate its clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Prediction of Neural Diameter From Morphology to Enable Accurate Simulation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accurate neuron morphologies are paramount for computational model simulations of realistic neural responses. Over the last decade, the online repository NeuroMorpho.Org has collected over 140,000 available neuron morphologies to understand brain function and promote interaction between experimental and computational research. Neuron morphologies describe spatial aspects of neural structure; however, many of the available morphologies do not contain accurate diameters that are essential for computational simulations of electrical activity. To best utilize available neuron morphologies, we present a set of equations that predict dendritic diameter from other morphological features. To derive the equations, we used a set of NeuroMorpho.org archives with realistic neuron diameters, representing hippocampal pyramidal, cerebellar Purkinje, and striatal spiny projection neurons. Each morphology is separated into initial, branching children, and continuing nodes. Our analysis reveals that the diameter of preceding nodes, Parent Diameter, is correlated to diameter of subsequent nodes for all cell types. Branching children and initial nodes each required additional morphological features to predict diameter, such as path length to soma, total dendritic length, and longest path to terminal end. Model simulations reveal that membrane potential response with predicted diameters is similar to the original response for several tested morphologies. We provide our open source software to extend the utility of available NeuroMorpho.org morphologies, and suggest predictive equations may supplement morphologies that lack dendritic diameter and improve model simulations with realistic dendritic diameter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: On the Use of a Multimodal Optimizer for Fitting Neuron Models. Application to the Cerebellar Granule Cell</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This article extends a recent methodological workflow for creating realistic and computationally efficient neuron models whilst capturing essential aspects of single-neuron dynamics. We overcome the intrinsic limitations of the extant optimization methods by proposing an alternative optimization component based on multimodal algorithms. This approach can natively explore a diverse population of neuron model configurations. In contrast to methods that focus on a single global optimum, the multimodal method allows directly obtaining a set of promising solutions for a single but complex multi-feature objective function. The final sparse population of candidate solutions has to be analyzed and evaluated according to the biological plausibility and their objective to the target features by the expert. In order to illustrate the value of this approach, we base our proposal on the optimization of cerebellar granule cell (GrC) models that replicate the essential properties of the biological cell. Our results show the emerging variability of plausible sets of values that this type of neuron can adopt underlying complex spiking characteristics. Also, the set of selected cerebellar GrC models captured spiking dynamics closer to the reference model than the single model obtained with off-the-shelf parameter optimization algorithms used in our previous article. The method hereby proposed represents a valuable strategy for adjusting a varied population of realistic and simplified neuron models. It can be applied to other kinds of neuron models and biological contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: White Matter Changes With Rehabilitation in Children With Developmental Coordination Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.673003</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.673003</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background and Objectives: Children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) have difficulty learning motor skills, which can affect their participation in activities of daily living and psychosocial well-being. Over 50% of children with DCD also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which further exacerbates their motor problems and impact on quality of life. A rehabilitation approach known as Cognitive Orientation to Occupational Performance uses problem-solving strategies to help children learn motor skills they wish to achieve. While this cognitive approach has been effective for children with DCD, few studies have examined the effectiveness of this approach for children with co-occurring ADHD. Further, the underlying mechanism and neural basis of this intervention are largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In this randomized waitlist-controlled trial, we used MRI to examine white matter microstructure after intervention in 8–12-year-old children with DCD (n = 28) and with DCD and co-occurring ADHD (n = 25). Children in both groups were randomized to either a treatment group or waitlist group at their first MRI. The treatment group began the intervention after their MRI scan and returned for a post-treatment scan at 3 months, and follow-up scan at 6 months; the waitlist group waited 3 months before their second MRI, received the intervention, and then had a post-treatment scan. Each child received intervention once weekly for 10 weeks. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to acquire white matter diffusion parameters and was analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results and Conclusion: Children with DCD showed significant improvement in white matter microstructure in the bilateral anterior thalamic radiation, bilateral sensorimotor tract, bilateral cingulum, fornix, splenium and body of corpus callosum, right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and white matter pathways to bilateral inferior gyri, right middle frontal gyrus, frontal medial cortex, and left cuneus. We suggest that these rehabilitation-induced neural changes in children with DCD occurred in regions associated with attention, self-regulation, motor planning, and inter-hemispheric communication, which positively affected brain connectivity and motor function. In contrast, children with DCD and co-occurring ADHD did not show any brain changes following the intervention. Modifications to the treatment protocol might help address the attentional and self-regulatory needs of children with a dual diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02597751.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Acoustic Analysis of Phonation in Children With Smith–Magenis Syndrome</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Complex simultaneous neuropsychophysiological mechanisms are responsible for the processing of the information to be transmitted and for the neuromotor planning of the articulatory organs involved in speech. The nature of this set of mechanisms is closely linked to the clinical state of the subject. Thus, for example, in populations with neurodevelopmental deficits, these underlying neuropsychophysiological procedures are deficient and determine their phonation. Most of these cases with neurodevelopmental deficits are due to a genetic abnormality, as is the case in the population with Smith–Magenis syndrome (SMS). SMS is associated with neurodevelopmental deficits, intellectual disability, and a cohort of characteristic phenotypic features, including voice quality, which does not seem to be in line with the gender, age, and complexion of the diagnosed subject. The phonatory profile and speech features in this syndrome are dysphonia, high f0, excess vocal muscle stiffness, fluency alterations, numerous syllabic simplifications, phoneme omissions, and unintelligibility of speech. This exploratory study investigates whether the neuromotor deficits in children with SMS adversely affect phonation as compared to typically developing children without neuromotor deficits, which has not been previously determined. The authors compare the phonatory performance of a group of children with SMS (N = 12) with a healthy control group of children (N = 12) matched in age, gender, and grouped into two age ranges. The first group ranges from 5 to 7 years old, and the second group goes from 8 to 12 years old. Group differences were determined for two forms of acoustic analysis performed on repeated recordings of the sustained vowel /a/ F1 and F2 extraction and cepstral peak prominence (CPP). It is expected that the results will enlighten the question of the underlying neuromotor aspects of phonation in SMS population. These findings could provide evidence of the susceptibility of phonation of speech to neuromotor disturbances, regardless of their origin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Novel Technique to Reject Artifact Components for Surface EMG Signals Recorded During Walking With Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation: A Pilot Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.660583</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation (tSCS) is an emerging technology that targets to restore functionally integrated neuromuscular control of gait. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate a novel filtering method, Artifact Component Specific Rejection (ACSR), for removing artifacts induced by tSCS from surface electromyogram (sEMG) data for investigation of muscle response during walking when applying spinal stimulation. Both simulated and real tSCS contaminated sEMG data from six stroke survivors were processed using ACSR and notch filtering, respectively. The performance of the filters was evaluated with data collected in various conditions (e.g., simulated artifacts contaminating sEMG in multiple degrees, various tSCS intensities in five lower-limb muscles of six participants). In the simulation test, after applying the ACSR filter, the contaminated-signal was well matched with the original signal, showing a high correlation (r = 0.959) and low amplitude difference (normalized root means square error = 0.266) between them. In the real tSCS contaminated data, the ACSR filter showed superior performance on reducing the artifacts (96% decrease) over the notch filter (25% decrease). These results indicate that ACSR filtering is capable of eliminating artifacts from sEMG collected during tSCS application, improving the precision of quantitative analysis of muscle activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Early Development of Locomotor Patterns and Motor Control in Very Young Children at High Risk of Cerebral Palsy, a Longitudinal Case Series</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The first years of life might be critical for encouraging independent walking in children with cerebral palsy (CP). We sought to identify mechanisms that may underlie the impaired development of walking in three young children with early brain lesions, at high risk of CP, via comprehensive instrumented longitudinal assessments of locomotor patterns and muscle activation during walking. We followed three children (P1–P3) with early brain lesions, at high risk of CP, during five consecutive gait analysis sessions covering a period of 1 to 2 years, starting before the onset of independent walking, and including the session during the first independent steps. In the course of the study, P1 did not develop CP, P2 was diagnosed with unilateral and P3 with bilateral CP. We monitored the early development of locomotor patterns over time via spatiotemporal gait parameters, intersegmental coordination (estimated via principal component analysis), electromyography activity, and muscle synergies (determined from 11 bilateral muscles via nonnegative matrix factorization). P1 and P2 started to walk independently at the corrected age of 14 and 22 months, respectively. In both of them, spatiotemporal gait parameters, intersegmental coordination, muscle activation patterns, and muscle synergy structure changed from supported to independent walking, although to a lesser extent when unilateral CP was diagnosed (P2), especially for the most affected leg. The child with bilateral CP (P3) did not develop independent walking, and all the parameters did not change over time. Our exploratory longitudinal study revealed differences in maturation of locomotor patterns between children with divergent developmental trajectories. We succeeded in identifying mechanisms that may underlie impaired walking development in very young children at high risk of CP. When verified in larger sample sizes, our approach may be considered a means to improve prognosis and to pinpoint possible targets for early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Migraine Is More Than Just Headache: Is the Link to Chronic Fatigue and Mood Disorders Simply Due to Shared Biological Systems?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.646692</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.646692</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Migraine is a symptomatically heterogeneous condition, of which headache is just one manifestation. Migraine is a disorder of altered sensory thresholding, with hypersensitivity among sufferers to sensory input. Advances in functional neuroimaging have highlighted that several brain areas are involved even prior to pain onset. Clinically, patients can experience symptoms hours to days prior to migraine pain, which can warn of impending headache. These symptoms can include mood and cognitive change, fatigue, and neck discomfort. Some epidemiological studies have suggested that migraine is associated in a bidirectional fashion with other disorders, such as mood disorders and chronic fatigue, as well as with other pain conditions such as fibromyalgia. This review will focus on the literature surrounding alterations in fatigue, mood, and cognition in particular, in association with migraine, and the suggested links to disorders such as chronic fatigue syndrome and depression. We hypothesize that migraine should be considered a neural disorder of brain function, in which alterations in aminergic networks integrating the limbic system with the sensory and homeostatic systems occur early and persist after headache resolution and perhaps interictally. The associations with some of these other disorders may allude to the inherent sensory sensitivity of the migraine brain and shared neurobiology and neurotransmitter systems rather than true co-morbidity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neurophysiological Correlates of Asymmetries in Vowel Perception: An English-French Cross-Linguistic Event-Related Potential Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.607148</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Behavioral studies examining vowel perception in infancy indicate that, for many vowel contrasts, the ease of discrimination changes depending on the order of stimulus presentation, regardless of the language from which the contrast is drawn and the ambient language that infants have experienced. By adulthood, linguistic experience has altered vowel perception; analogous asymmetries are observed for non−native contrasts but are mitigated for native contrasts. Although these directional effects are well documented behaviorally, the brain mechanisms underlying them are poorly understood. In the present study we begin to address this gap. We first review recent behavioral work which shows that vowel perception asymmetries derive from phonetic encoding strategies, rather than general auditory processes. Two existing theoretical models–the Natural Referent Vowel framework and the Native Language Magnet model–are invoked as a means of interpreting these findings. Then we present the results of a neurophysiological study which builds on this prior work. Using event-related brain potentials, we first measured and assessed the mismatch negativity response (MMN, a passive neurophysiological index of auditory change detection) in English and French native-speaking adults to synthetic vowels that either spanned two different phonetic categories (/y/vs./u/) or fell within the same category (/u/). Stimulus presentation was organized such that each vowel was presented as standard and as deviant in different blocks. The vowels were presented with a long (1,600-ms) inter-stimulus interval to restrict access to short-term memory traces and tap into a “phonetic mode” of processing. MMN analyses revealed weak asymmetry effects regardless of the (i) vowel contrast, (ii) language group, and (iii) MMN time window. Then, we conducted time-frequency analyses of the standard epochs for each vowel. In contrast to the MMN analysis, time-frequency analysis revealed significant differences in brain oscillations in the theta band (4–8 Hz), which have been linked to attention and processing efficiency. Collectively, these findings suggest that early-latency (pre-attentive) mismatch responses may not be a strong neurophysiological correlate of asymmetric behavioral vowel discrimination. Rather, asymmetries may reflect differences in neural processing efficiency for vowels with certain inherent acoustic-phonetic properties, as revealed by theta oscillatory activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Temporal Fluctuation of Mood in Gaming Task Modulates Feedback Negativity: EEG Study With Virtual Reality</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.536288</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Feedback outcomes are generally classified into positive and negative feedback. People often predict a feedback outcome with information that is based on both objective facts and uncertain subjective information, such as a mood. For example, if an action leads to good results consecutively, people performing the action overestimate the behavioral result of the next action. In electroencephalogram measurements, negative feedback evokes negative potential, called feedback negativity, and positive feedback evokes positive potential, called reward positivity. The present study investigated the relationship between the degree of the mood caused by the feedback outcome and the error-related brain potentials. We measured the electroencephalogram activity while the participants played a virtual reality shooting game. The experimental task was to shoot down a cannonball flying toward the player using a handgun. The task difficulty was determined from the size and curve of the flying cannonball. These gaming parameters affected the outcome probability of shooting the target in the game. We also implemented configurations in the game, such as the player’s life points and play times. These configurations affected the outcome magnitude of shooting the target in the game. Moreover, we used the temporal accuracy of shooting in the game as the parameter of the mood. We investigated the relationship between these experimental features and the event-related potentials using the single-trial-based linear mixed-effects model analysis. The feedback negativity was observed at an error trial, and its amplitude was modulated with the outcome probability and the mood. Conversely, reward positivity was observed at hit trials, but its amplitude was modulated with the outcome probability and outcome magnitude. This result suggests that feedback negativity is enhanced according to not only the feedback probability but also the mood that was changed depending on the temporal gaming outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Misregulation of Drosophila Sidestep Leads to Uncontrolled Wiring of the Adult Neuromuscular System and Severe Locomotion Defects</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Holometabolic organisms undergo extensive remodelling of their neuromuscular system during metamorphosis. Relatively, little is known whether or not the embryonic guidance of molecules and axonal growth mechanisms are re-activated for the innervation of a very different set of adult muscles. Here, we show that the axonal attractant Sidestep (Side) is re-expressed during Drosophila metamorphosis and is indispensable for neuromuscular wiring. Mutations in side cause severe innervation defects in all legs. Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) show a reduced density or are completely absent at multi-fibre muscles. Misinnervation strongly impedes, but does not completely abolish motor behaviours, including walking, flying, or grooming. Overexpression of Side in developing muscles induces similar innervation defects; for example, at indirect flight muscles, it causes flightlessness. Since muscle-specific overexpression of Side is unlikely to affect the central circuits, the resulting phenotypes seem to correlate with faulty muscle wiring. We further show that mutations in beaten path Ia (beat), a receptor for Side, results in similar weaker adult innervation and locomotion phenotypes, indicating that embryonic guidance pathways seem to be reactivated during metamorphosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neuronal Damage and Neuroinflammation, a Bridge Between Bacterial Meningitis and Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.680858</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bacterial meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges which covers and protects the brain and the spinal cord. Such inflammation is mostly caused by blood-borne bacteria that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and finally invade the brain parenchyma. Pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae are the main etiological causes of bacterial meningitis. After trafficking across the BBB, bacterial pathogens in the brain interact with neurons, the fundamental units of Central Nervous System, and other types of glial cells. Although the specific molecular mechanism behind the interaction between such pathogens with neurons is still under investigation, it is clear that bacterial interaction with neurons and neuroinflammatory responses within the brain leads to neuronal cell death. Furthermore, clinical studies have shown indications of meningitis-caused dementia; and a variety of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease are characterized by the loss of neurons, which, unlike many other eukaryotic cells, once dead or damaged, they are seldom replaced. The aim of this review article is to provide an overview of the knowledge on how bacterial pathogens in the brain damage neurons through direct and indirect interactions, and how the neuronal damage caused by bacterial pathogen can, in the long-term, influence the onset of neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Rare Opportunities for Insights Into Serotonergic Contributions to Brain and Bowel Disorders: Studies of the SERT Ala56 Mouse</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Altered structure, expression, and regulation of the presynaptic serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) have been associated with multiple neurobehavioral disorders, including mood disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Opportunities to investigate mechanistic links supporting these associations were spurred with the identification of multiple, rare human SERT coding variants in a study that established a male-specific linkage of ASD to a linkage marker on chromosome 17 which encompassed the location of the SERT gene (SLC6A4). We have explored the most common of these variants, SERT Ala56, in vitro and in vivo. Results support a tonic elevation of 5-HT transport activity in transfected cells and human lymphoblasts by the variant in vitro that leads to an increased 5-HT clearance rate in vivo when studied in the SERT Ala56 mouse model, along with altered sensitivity to SERT regulatory signaling pathways. Importantly, hyperserotonemia, or an elevated whole blood 5-HT, level, was found in SERT Ala56 mice, reproducing a well-replicated trait observed in a significant fraction of ASD subjects. Additionally, we found multiple biochemical, physiological, and behavioral alterations in the SERT Ala56 mice that can be analogized to those observed in ASD and its medical comorbidities. The similarity of the functional impact of the SERT Ala56 variant to the consequences of p38α MAPK activation, ascribed to the induction of a biased conformation of the transporter toward an outward-facing conformation, has resulted in successful efforts to restore normal behavioral and bowel function via pharmacological and genetic p38α MAPK targeting. Moreover, the ability of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β to enhance SERT activity via a p38α MAPK-dependent pathway suggests that the SERT Ala56 conformation mimics that of a chronic inflammatory state, supporting findings in ASD of elevated inflammatory cytokine levels. In this report, we review studies of the SERT Ala56 variant, discussing opportunities for continued insight into how chronically altered synaptic 5-HT homeostasis can drive reversible, functional perturbations in 5-HT sensitive pathways in the brain and periphery, and how targeting the SERT regulome, particularly through activating pathways such as those involving IL-1β/p38α MAPK, may be of benefit for neurobehavioral disorders, including ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Multimodal Optical Imaging to Investigate Spatiotemporal Changes in Cerebrovascular Function in AUDA Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Administration of 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic acid (AUDA) has been demonstrated to alleviate infarction following ischemic stroke. Reportedly, the main effect of AUDA is exerting anti-inflammation and neovascularization via the inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase. However, the major contribution of this anti-inflammation and neovascularization effect in the acute phase of stroke is not completely elucidated. To investigate the neuroprotective effects of AUDA in acute ischemic stroke, we combined laser speckle contrast imaging and optical intrinsic signal imaging techniques with the implantation of a lab-designed cranial window. Forepaw stimulation was applied to assess the functional changes via measuring cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that accompany neural activity. The rats that received AUDA in the acute phase of photothrombotic ischemia stroke showed a 30.5 ± 8.1% reduction in the ischemic core, 42.3 ± 15.1% reduction in the ischemic penumbra (p &amp;lt; 0.05), and 42.1 ± 4.6% increase of CMRO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in response to forepaw stimulation at post-stroke day 1 (p &amp;lt; 0.05) compared with the control group (N = 10 for each group). Moreover, at post-stroke day 3, increased functional vascular density was observed in AUDA-treated rats (35.9 ± 1.9% higher than that in the control group, p &amp;lt; 0.05). At post-stroke day 7, a 105.4% ± 16.4% increase of astrocytes (p &amp;lt; 0.01), 30.0 ± 10.9% increase of neurons (p &amp;lt; 0.01), and 65.5 ± 15.0% decrease of microglia (p &amp;lt; 0.01) were observed in the penumbra region in AUDA-treated rats (N = 5 for each group). These results suggested that AUDA affects the anti-inflammation at the beginning of ischemic injury and restores neuronal metabolic rate of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and tissue viability. The neovascularization triggered by AUDA restored CBF and may contribute to ischemic infarction reduction at post-stroke day 3. Moreover, for long-term neuroprotection, astrocytes in the penumbra region may play an important role in protecting neurons from apoptotic injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a unique regulated cell death defined by the intracellular iron overload and distinct biological features compared with other well-known programmed cell death. Ferroptosis can be triggered by many causes including decreased expression of glutathione (GSH), inhibition of the function of glutathione-dependent peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and system x&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;, all of which finally lead to the over-accumulation of lipid peroxides in the cell. Ferroptosis has been reported to play an important role in the pathophysiological process of various cancers. In recent years, much evidence also proved that ferroptosis is involved in the progress of cerebral stroke. In this review, we summarized the characteristics of ferroptosis and the potential relationship between ferroptosis and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, to provide new targets and ideas for the therapy of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, and it is characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), as well as the presence of intracellular inclusions with α-synuclein as the main component in surviving DA neurons. Emerging evidence suggests that the imbalance of proteostasis is a key pathogenic factor for PD. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, two major pathways for maintaining proteostasis, play important roles in PD pathology and are considered as attractive therapeutic targets for PD treatment. However, although ER stress/UPR and autophagy appear to be independent cellular processes, they are closely related to each other. In this review, we focused on the roles and molecular cross-links between ER stress/UPR and autophagy in PD pathology. We systematically reviewed and summarized the most recent advances in regulation of ER stress/UPR and autophagy, and their cross-linking mechanisms. We also reviewed and discussed the mechanisms of the coexisting ER stress/UPR activation and dysregulated autophagy in the lesion regions of PD patients, and the underlying roles and molecular crosslinks between ER stress/UPR activation and the dysregulated autophagy in DA neurodegeneration induced by PD-associated genetic factors and PD-related neurotoxins. Finally, we indicate that the combined regulation of ER stress/UPR and autophagy would be a more effective treatment for PD rather than regulating one of these conditions alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Second Language Learning in Older Adults: Effects on Brain Structure and Predictors of Learning Success</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.666851</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has previously been demonstrated that short-term foreign language learning can lead to structural brain changes in younger adults. Experience-dependent brain plasticity is known to be possible also in older age, but the specific effect of foreign language learning on brain structure in language-and memory-relevant regions in the old brain remains unknown. In the present study, 160 older Swedish adults (65–75 years) were randomized to complete either an entry-level Italian course or a relaxation course, both with a total duration of 11 weeks. Structural MRI scans were conducted before and after the intervention in a subset of participants to test for differential change in gray matter in the two groups in the inferior frontal gyrus, the superior temporal gyrus, and the hippocampus, and in white matter microstructure in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), fronto-occipital fasciculus, and the hippocampal (HC) section of the cingulum. The study found no evidence for differential structural change following language training, independent of achieved vocabulary proficiency. However, hippocampal volume and associative memory ability before the intervention were found to be robust predictors of vocabulary proficiency at the end of the language course. The results suggest that having greater hippocampal volume and better associative memory ability benefits vocabulary learning in old age but that the very initial stage of foreign language learning does not trigger detectable changes in brain morphometry in old age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: COVID-19, Neuropathology, and Aging: SARS-CoV-2 Neurological Infection, Mechanism, and Associated Complications</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The spectrum of health complications instigated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been diverse and complex. Besides the evident pulmonary and cardiovascular threats, accumulating clinical data points to several neurological complications, which are more common in elderly COVID-19 patients. Recent pieces of evidence have marked events of neuro infection and neuroinvasion, producing several neurological complications in COVID-19 patients; however, a systematic understanding of neuro-pathophysiology and manifested neurological complications, more specifically in elderly COVID-19 patients is largely elusive. Since the elderly population gradually develops neurological disorders with aging, COVID-19 inevitably poses a higher risk of neurological manifestations to the aged patients. In this report, we reviewed SARS-CoV-2 infection and its role in neurological manifestations with an emphasis on the elderly population. We reviewed neuropathological events including neuroinfection, neuroinvasion, and their underlying mechanisms affecting neuromuscular, central- and peripheral- nervous systems. We further assessed the imminent neurological challenges in the COVID-19 exposed population, post-SARS-CoV-2-infection. Given the present state of clinical preparedness, the emerging role of AI and machine learning was also discussed concerning COVID-19 diagnostics and its management. Taken together, the present review summarizes neurological outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated complications, specifically in elderly patients, and underlines the need for their clinical management in advance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Amyloid β and Amyloid Precursor Protein Synergistically Suppress Large-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channel in Cortical Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.660319</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.660319</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Intracellular amyloid β (Aβ) injection suppresses the large-conductance calcium-dependent potassium (BK) channel in cortical pyramidal cells from wild-type (WT) mice. In 3xTg Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model mice, intraneuronal Aβ is genetically programed to accumulate, which suppresses the BK channel. However, the mode of BK channel suppression remained unclarified. The present report revealed that only one (11A1) of the three anti-Aβ-oligomer antibodies that we examined, but not anti-monomer-Aβ-antibodies, was effective in recovering BK channel activity in 3xTg neurons. Antibodies against amyloid precursor protein (APP) were also found to be effective, suggesting that APP plays an essential part in this Aβ-oligomer-induced BK channel suppression in 3xTg neurons. In WT neurons, by contrast, APP suppressed BK channels by itself, which suggests that either APP or Aβ is sufficient to block BK channels, thus pointing to a different co-operativity of Aβ and APP in WT and 3xTg neurons. To clarify this difference, we relied on our previous finding that the scaffold protein Homer1a reverses the BK channel blockade in both WT and 3xTg neurons. In cortical neurons from 3xTg mice that bear Homer1a knockout (4xTg mice), neither anti-APP antibodies nor 11A1, but only the 6E10 antibody that binds both APP and Aβ, rescued the BK channel suppression. Given that Homer1a expression is activity dependent and 3xTg neurons are hyperexcitable, Homer1a is likely to be expressed sufficiently in 3xTg neurons, thereby alleviating the suppressive influence of APP and Aβ on BK channel. A unique way that APP modifies Aβ toxicity is thus proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Heterogeneity in Regional Damage Detected by Neuroimaging and Neuropathological Studies in Older Adults With COVID-19: A Cognitive-Neuroscience Systematic Review to Inform the Long-Term Impact of the Virus on Neurocognitive Trajectories</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.646908</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.646908</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Other than its direct impact on cardiopulmonary health, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection affects additional body systems, especially in older adults. Several studies have reported acute neurological symptoms that present at onset or develop during hospitalisation, with associated neural injuries. Whilst the acute neurological phase is widely documented, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection on neurocognitive functioning remain unknown. Although an evidence-based framework describing the disease chronic phase is premature, it is important to lay the foundations for future data-driven models. This systematic review aimed at summarising the literature on neuroimaging and neuropathological findings in older over-60 patients with COVID-19 following a cognitive neuroscientific perspective, to clarify the most vulnerable brain areas and speculate on the possible cognitive consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant manuscripts published between 1st March 2020 and 31th December 2020. Outputs were screened and selected by two assessors. Relevant studies not detected by literature search were added manually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Ninety studies, mainly single cases and case series, were included. Several neuroimaging and neuropathological findings in older patients with COVID-19 emerged from these studies, with cerebrovascular damage having a prominent role. Abnormalities (hyperintensities, hypoperfusion, inflammation, and cellular damage) were reported in most brain areas. The most consistent cross-aetiology findings were in white matter, brainstem and fronto-temporal areas. Viral DNA was detected mainly in olfactory, orbitofrontal and brainstem areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Studies on COVID-19 related neural damage are rich and diverse, but limited to description of hospitalised patients with fatal outcome (i.e., in neuropathological studies) or severe symptoms (i.e., in neuroimaging studies). The damage seen in this population indicates acute and largely irreversible dysfunction to neural regions involved in major functional networks that support normal cognitive and behavioural functioning. It is still unknown whether the long-term impact of the virus will be limited to chronic evolution of acute events, whether sub-clinical pathological processes will be exacerbated or whether novel mechanisms will emerge. Based on current literature, future theoretical frameworks describing the long-term impact of COVID-19 infection on mental abilities will have to factor in major trends of aetiological and topographic heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Krüppel-Like Factor 6 Silencing Prevents Oxidative Stress and Neurological Dysfunction Following Intracerebral Hemorrhage via Sirtuin 5/Nrf2/HO-1 Axis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.646729</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As a severe neurological deficit, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with overwhelming mortality. Subsequent oxidative stress and neurological dysfunction are likely to cause secondary brain injury. Therefore, this study sought to define the role of Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) and underlying mechanism in oxidative stress and neurological dysfunction following ICH. An in vivo model of ICH was established in rats by injection of autologous blood, and an in vitro ICH cell model was developed in hippocampal neurons by oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) exposure. Next, gain- and loss-of-function assays were performed in vivo and in vitro to clarify the effect of KLF6 on neurological dysfunction and oxidative stress in ICH rats and neuronal apoptosis and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in OxyHb-induced hippocampal neurons. KLF6, nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) were highly expressed in hippocampal tissues of ICH rats, whereas sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) presented a poor expression. Mechanistically, KLF6 bound to the SIRT5 promoter and transcriptionally repressed SIRT5 to activate the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. KLF6 silencing alleviated neurological dysfunction and oxidative stress in ICH rats and diminished oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis in OxyHb-induced neurons, whereas SIRT5 overexpression negated its effect. To sum up, KLF6 silencing elevated SIRT5 expression to inactivate the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thus attenuating oxidative stress and neurological dysfunction after ICH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Sex Difference in Network Topology and Education Correlated With Sex Difference in Cognition During the Disease Process of Alzheimer</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.639529</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) manifests differently in males and females. However, the neuro-mechanism and influence factors are still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To explore sex differences in brain network topology during AD disease progression and its association with cognition and possible influencing factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and cognitive scores were collected from 82 AD patients (50 females), 56 amnestic mildly cognitive impaired patients (29 females), and 63 healthy controls (38 females). Global and regional topological network metrics and modular architecture were calculated. Two-way ANOVA was performed to explore group and sex interactions and their main effects. Mediation analysis was used to explore the relationship among education, inter/intra-network connectivity, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Lower levels of education, lower MMSE scores, and a positive correlation between the level of education and MMSE scores were found in female AD patients (p = 0.024, r = 0.319). Significantly lower connectivity strength within the sensorimotor network, dorsal attention network, ventral attention network (VAN), and between the sensorimotor and VAN were observed in male AD patients (p = 0.006, 0.028, 0.046, and 0.013, respectively). Group and sex interactions were also found in nodal properties, mainly in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, middle cingulum, precuneus, and postcentral gyrus. Several of the altered brain network properties were associated with cognitive behavior in male AD patients. Education regulated the MMSE score through the mediation of connection strength between the default mode and limbic networks (LN) in the patient group (aMCI and AD combined).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that sex differences exist at the brain network level in AD. Sex differences in network topology and education are correlated with sex differences in cognition during AD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Disrupted Network Topology Contributed to Spatial Navigation Impairment in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.630677</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.630677</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Impairment in spatial navigation (SN) and structural network topology is not limited to patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia and can be detected earlier in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We recruited 32 MCI patients (65.91 ± 11.33 years old) and 28 normal cognition patients (NC; 69.68 ± 10.79 years old), all of whom underwent a computer-based battery of SN tests evaluating egocentric, allocentric, and mixed SN strategies and diffusion-weighted and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). To evaluate the topological features of the structural connectivity network, we calculated its measures such as the global efficiency, local efficiency, clustering coefficient, and shortest path length with GRETNA. We determined the correlation between SN accuracy and network topological properties. Compared to NC, MCI subjects demonstrated a lower egocentric navigation accuracy. Compared with NC, MCI subjects showed significantly decreased clustering coefficients in the left middle frontal gyrus, right rectus, right superior parietal gyrus, and right inferior parietal gyrus and decreased shortest path length in the left paracentral lobule. We observed significant positive correlations of the shortest path length in the left paracentral lobule with both the mixed allocentric–egocentric and the allocentric accuracy measured by the average total errors. A decreased clustering coefficient in the right inferior parietal gyrus was associated with a larger allocentric navigation error. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) did not affect the correlation between network properties and SN accuracy. This study demonstrated that structural connectivity network abnormalities, especially in the frontal and parietal gyri, are associated with a lower SN accuracy, independently of WMH, providing a new insight into the brain mechanisms associated with SN impairment in MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Tight nanoscale clustering of Fcγ receptors using DNA origami promotes phagocytosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68311</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68311</link>
	<description>Macrophages destroy pathogens and diseased cells through Fcγ receptor (FcγR)-driven phagocytosis of antibody-opsonized targets. Phagocytosis requires activation of multiple FcγRs, but the mechanism controlling the threshold for response is unclear. We developed a DNA origami-based engulfment system that allows precise nanoscale control of the number and spacing of ligands. When the number of ligands remains constant, reducing ligand spacing from 17.5 nm to 7 nm potently enhances engulfment, primarily by increasing efficiency of the engulfment-initiation process. Tighter ligand clustering increases receptor phosphorylation, as well as proximal downstream signals. Increasing the number of signaling domains recruited to a single ligand-receptor complex was not sufficient to recapitulate this effect, indicating that clustering of multiple receptors is required. Our results suggest that macrophages use information about local ligand densities to make critical engulfment decisions, which has implications for the mechanism of antibody-mediated phagocytosis and the design of immunotherapies.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+: An information-theoretic co-clustering-based transfer learning framework for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data</title>

Technological advances have enabled us to profile multiple molecular layers at unprecedented single-cell resolution and the available datasets from multiple samples or domains are growing. These datasets, including scRNA-seq data, scATAC-seq data and sc-methylation data, usually have different powers in identifying the unknown cell types through clustering. So, methods that integrate multiple datasets can potentially lead to a better clustering performance. Here we propose &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data. &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ is a transfer learning method based on the information-theoretic co-clustering framework. In &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+, we utilize the information in one dataset, the source data, to facilitate the analysis of another dataset, the target data. &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ uses the linked features in the two datasets for effective knowledge transfer, and it also uses the information of the features in the target data that are unlinked with the source data. In addition, &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ matches similar cell types across the source data and the target data. By applying &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ to the integrative clustering of mouse cortex scATAC-seq data and scRNA-seq data, mouse and human scRNA-seq data, mouse cortex sc-methylation and scRNA-seq data, and human blood dendritic cells scRNA-seq data from two batches, we demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ improves the overall clustering performance and matches the cell subpopulations across multimodal single-cell genomic datasets. &lt;i&gt;couple&lt;/i&gt;CoC+ has fast convergence and it is computationally efficient. The software is available at https://github.com/cuhklinlab/coupleCoC_plus.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/D-UMax9lHC8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Modern analytical techniques enable researchers to collect data about cellular states, before and after perturbations. These states can be characterized using analytical techniques, but the inference of regulatory interactions that explain and predict changes in these states remains a challenge. Here we present a generalizable, unsupervised approach to generate parameter-free, logic-based models of cellular processes, described by multiple discrete states. Our algorithm employs a Hamming-distance based approach to formulate, test, and identify optimized logic rules that link two states. Our approach comprises two steps. First, a model with no prior knowledge except for the mapping between initial and attractor states is built. We then employ biological constraints to improve model fidelity. Our algorithm automatically recovers the relevant dynamics for the explored models and recapitulates key aspects of the biochemical species concentration dynamics in the original model. We present the advantages and limitations of our work and discuss how our approach could be used to infer logic-based mechanisms of signaling, gene-regulatory, or other input-output processes describable by the Boolean formalism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e0809wjDpgo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase SRMS inhibits autophagy and promotes tumor growth by phosphorylating the scaffolding protein FKBP51</title>

Nutrient-responsive protein kinases control the balance between anabolic growth and catabolic processes such as autophagy. Aberrant regulation of these kinases is a major cause of human disease. We report here that the vertebrate nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src-related kinase lacking C-terminal regulatory tyrosine and N-terminal myristylation sites (SRMS) inhibits autophagy and promotes growth in a nutrient-responsive manner. Under nutrient-replete conditions, SRMS phosphorylates the PHLPP scaffold FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), disrupts the FKBP51-PHLPP complex, and promotes FKBP51 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This prevents PHLPP-mediated dephosphorylation of AKT, causing sustained AKT activation that promotes growth and inhibits autophagy. SRMS is amplified and overexpressed in human cancers where it drives unrestrained AKT signaling in a kinase-dependent manner. SRMS kinase inhibition activates autophagy, inhibits cancer growth, and can be accomplished using the FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. This illuminates SRMS as a targetable vulnerability in human cancers and as a new target for pharmacological induction of autophagy in vertebrates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/yxuJNnTVFxE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Episodic memory depends on interactions between the hippocampus and interconnected neocortical regions. Here, using data-driven analyses of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we identified the networks that interact with the hippocampus—the default mode network (DMN) and a “medial temporal network” (MTN) that included regions in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and precuneus. We observed that the MTN plays a critical role in connecting the visual network to the DMN and hippocampus. The DMN could be further divided into 3 subnetworks: a “posterior medial” (PM) subnetwork comprised of posterior cingulate and lateral parietal cortices; an “anterior temporal” (AT) subnetwork comprised of regions in the temporopolar and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; and a “medial prefrontal” (MP) subnetwork comprised of regions primarily in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These networks vary in their functional connectivity (FC) along the hippocampal long axis and represent different kinds of information during memory-guided decision-making. Finally, a Neurosynth meta-analysis of fMRI studies suggests new hypotheses regarding the functions of the MTN and DMN subnetworks, providing a framework to guide future research on the neural architecture of episodic memory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KfoHmH-TZZg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Cytoarchitectural Characteristics Associated with Cognitive Flexibility in Raccoons</title>

	<description>Abstract
With rates of psychiatric illnesses such as depression continuing to rise, additional preclinical models are needed to facilitate translational neuroscience research. In the current study, the raccoon (Procyon lotor) was investigated due to its similarities with primate brains, including comparable proportional neuronal densities, cortical magnification of the forepaw area, and cortical gyrification. Specifically, we report on the cytoarchitectural characteristics of raccoons profiled as high, intermediate, or low solvers in a multi‐access problem‐solving task. Isotropic fractionation indicated that high‐solvers had significantly more cells in the hippocampus (HC) than the other solving groups; further, a nonsignificant trend suggested that this increase in cell profile density was due to increased non‐neuronal (e.g., glial) cells. Group differences were not observed in the cellular density of the somatosensory cortex. Thionin‐based staining confirmed the presence of von Economo neurons (VENs) in the frontoinsular (FI) cortex, although no impact of solving ability on VEN cell profile density levels was observed. Elongated fusiform cells were quantified in the hippocampus dentate gyrus where high‐solvers were observed to have higher levels of this cell type than the other solving groups. In sum, the current findings suggest that varying cytoarchitectural phenotypes contribute to cognitive flexibility. Additional research is necessary to determine the translational value of cytoarchitectural distribution patterns on adaptive behavioral outcomes associated with cognitive performance and mental health.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Hippocampal correlates of episodic memory in Parkinson’s disease: A systematic review of magnetic resonance imaging studies</title>

	<description>Abstract
The present review asks whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are able to define neural correlates of episodic memory within the hippocampus in Parkinson's disease (PD). Systematic searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, CINAHL, and EMBASE using search terms related to structural and functional MRI (fMRI), the hippocampus, episodic memory, and PD. Risk of bias was assessed for each study using the Newtown–Ottawa Scale. Thirty‐nine studies met inclusion criteria; eight fMRI, seven diffusion MRI (dMRI), and 24 structural MRI (14 exploring whole hippocampus and 10 exploring hippocampal subfields). Critical analysis of the literature revealed mixed evidence from functional and dMRI, but stronger evidence from sMRI of the hippocampus as a biomarker for episodic memory impairment in PD. Hippocampal subfield studies most often implicated CA1, CA3/4, and subiculum volume in episodic memory and cognitive decline in PD. Despite differences in imaging methodology, study design, and sample characteristics, MRI studies have helped elucidate an important neural correlate of episodic memory impairment in PD with both clinical and theoretical implications. Natural progression of this work encourages future research on hippocampal subfield function as a potential biomarker of, or therapeutic target for, episodic memory dysfunction in PD.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Spinal A3 adenosine receptor activation acutely restores morphine antinociception in opioid tolerant male rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/jnr.24869</guid>

	<description>Spinal A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) activation by MRS5698 transiently restores morphine antinociception in opioid‐tolerant rats. Intrathecal injection of MRS5698 (“on”) on days 8, 9, 12, and 13 reinstates morphine antinociception. This response is blocked by A3AR antagonist MRS1523 and absent when intrathecal vehicle (“off”) is administered on days 10 and 11.

Abstract
Opioids are potent analgesics, but their pain‐relieving effects diminish with repeated use. The reduction in analgesic potency is a hallmark of opioid analgesic tolerance, which hampers opioid pain therapy. In the central nervous system, opioid analgesia is critically modulated by adenosine, a purine nucleoside implicated in the beneficial and detrimental actions of opioid medications. Here, we focus on the A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) in opioid analgesic tolerance. Intrathecal administration of the A3AR agonist MRS5698 with daily systemic morphine in male rats attenuated the reduction in morphine antinociception over 7 days. In rats with established morphine tolerance, intrathecal MRS5698 partially restored the antinociceptive effects of morphine. However, when MRS5698 was discontinued, these animals displayed a reduced antinociceptive response to morphine. Our results suggest that MRS5698 acutely and transiently potentiates morphine antinociception in tolerant rats. By contrast, in morphine‐naïve rats MRS5698 treatment did not impact thermal nociceptive threshold or affect antinociceptive response to a single injection of morphine. Furthermore, we found that morphine‐induced adenosine release in cerebrospinal fluid was blunted in tolerant animals, but total spinal A3AR expression was not affected. Collectively, our findings indicate that spinal A3AR activation acutely potentiates morphine antinociception in the opioid tolerant state.</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Mini-review: The Role of the Cerebellum in Visuomotor Adaptation</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The incredible capability of the brain to quickly alter performance in response to ever-changing environment is rooted in the process of adaptation. The core aspect of adaptation is to fit an existing motor program to altered conditions. Adaptation to a visuomotor rotation or an external force has been well established as tools to study the mechanisms underlying sensorimotor adaptation. In this mini-review, we summarize recent findings from the field of visuomotor adaptation. We focus on the idea that the cerebellum plays a central role in the process of visuomotor adaptation and that interactions with cortical structures, in particular, the premotor cortex and the parietal cortex, may be crucial for this process. To this end, we cover a range of methodologies used in the literature that link cerebellar functions and visuomotor adaptation; behavioral studies in cerebellar lesion patients, neuroimaging and non-invasive stimulation approaches. The mini-review is organized as follows: first, we provide evidence that sensory prediction errors (SPE) in visuomotor adaptation rely on the cerebellum based on behavioral studies in cerebellar patients. Second, we summarize structural and functional imaging studies that provide insight into spatial localization as well as visuomotor adaptation dynamics in the cerebellum. Third, we discuss premotor — cerebellar interactions and how these may underlie visuomotor adaptation. And finally, we provide evidence from transcranial direct current and magnetic stimulation studies that link cerebellar activity, beyond correlational relationships, to visuomotor adaptation .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Brainstem Involvement in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Combined Structural and Diffusion Tensor MRI Analysis</title>

	<description>Introduction&lt;p&gt;The brainstem is an important component in the pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although neuroimaging studies have shown multiple structural changes in ALS patients, few studies have investigated structural alterations in the brainstem. Herein, we compared the brainstem structure between patients with ALS and healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 33 patients with ALS and 33 healthy controls were recruited in this study. T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were acquired on a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (3T MRI) scanner. Volumetric and vertex-wised approaches were implemented to assess the differences in the brainstem’s morphological features between the two groups. An atlas-based region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed to compare the white matter integrity of the brainstem between the two groups. Additionally, a correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between ALS clinical characteristics and structural features.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Volumetric analyses showed no significant difference in the subregion volume of the brainstem between ALS patients and healthy controls. In the shape analyses, ALS patients had a local abnormal surface contraction in the ventral medulla oblongata and ventral pons. Compared with healthy controls, ALS patients showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left corticospinal tract (CST) and bilateral frontopontine tracts (FPT) at the brainstem level, and higher radial diffusivity (RD) in bilateral CST and left FPT at the brainstem level by ROI analysis in DTI. Correlation analysis showed that disease severity was positively associated with FA in left CST and left FPT.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that the brainstem in ALS suffers atrophy, and degenerative processes in the brainstem may reflect disease severity in ALS. These findings may be helpful for further understanding of potential neural mechanisms in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Low-Cutoff Frequency Reduction in Neural Amplifiers: Analysis and Implementation in CMOS 65 nm</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.667846</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Scaling down technology demotes the parameters of AC-coupled neural amplifiers, such as increasing the low-cutoff frequency due to the short-channel effects. To improve the low-cutoff frequency, one solution is to increase the feedback capacitors' value. This solution is not desirable, as the input capacitors have to be increased to maintain the same gain, which increases the area and decreases the input impedance of the neural amplifier. We analytically analyze the small-signal behavior of the neural amplifier and prove that the main reason for the increase of the low-cutoff frequency in advanced CMOS technologies is the reduction of the input resistance of the operational transconductance amplifier (OTA). We also show that the reduction of the input resistance of the OTA is due to the increase in the gate oxide leakage in the input transistors. In this paper, we explore this fact and propose two solutions to reduce the low-cutoff frequency without increasing the value of the feedback capacitor. The first solution is performed by only simulation and is called cross-coupled positive feedback that uses pseudoresistors to provide a negative resistance to increase the input resistance of the OTA. As an advantage, only standard CMOS transistors are used in this method. Simulation results show that a low-cutoff frequency of 1.5 Hz is achieved while the midband gain is 30.4 dB at 1 V. In addition, the power consumption is 0.6 μW. In the second method, we utilize thick-oxide MOS transistors in the input differential pair of the OTA. We designed and fabricated the second method in the 65 nm TSMC CMOS process. Measured results are obtained by in vitro recordings on slices of mouse brainstem. The measurement results show that the bandwidth is between 2 Hz and 5.6 kHz. The neural amplifier has 34.3 dB voltage gain in midband and consumes 3.63 μW at 1 V power supply. The measurement results show an input-referred noise of 6.1 μV&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt; and occupy 0.04 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; silicon area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This article proposes a multimode medical image fusion with CNN and supervised learning, in order to solve the problem of practical medical diagnosis. It can implement different types of multimodal medical image fusion problems in batch processing mode and can effectively overcome the problem that traditional fusion problems that can only be solved by single and single image fusion. To a certain extent, it greatly improves the fusion effect, image detail clarity, and time efficiency in a new method. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method exhibits state-of-the-art fusion performance in terms of visual quality and a variety of quantitative evaluation criteria. Its medical diagnostic background is wide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Large-Scale Brain Functional Network Integration for Discrimination of Autism Using a 3-D Deep Learning Model</title>

	<description>Goal&lt;p&gt;Brain functional networks (BFNs) constructed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have proven to be an effective way to understand aberrant functional connectivity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. It is still challenging to utilize these features as potential biomarkers for discrimination of ASD. The purpose of this work is to classify ASD and normal controls (NCs) using BFNs derived from rs-fMRI.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A deep learning framework was proposed that integrated convolutional neural network (CNN) and channel-wise attention mechanism to model both intra- and inter-BFN associations simultaneously for ASD diagnosis. We investigate the effects of each BFN on performance and performed inter-network connectivity analysis between each pair of BFNs. We compared the performance of our CNN model with some state-of-the-art algorithms using functional connectivity features.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We collected 79 ASD patients and 105 NCs from the ABIDE-I dataset. The mean accuracy of our classification algorithm was 77.74% for classification of ASD versus NCs.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The proposed model is able to integrate information from multiple BFNs to improve detection accuracy of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;Significance&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that large-scale BFNs is promising to serve as reliable biomarkers for diagnosis of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Bilateral Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Simultaneous Bimanual Handgrip Strength</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.674851</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.674851</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on contralateral unimanual movement have been well reported, its effects on coordinated multi-limb movements remain unclear. Because multi-limb coordination is often performed in daily activities and sports, clarifying the effects of tDCS on multi-limb coordination may have valuable implications. However, considering the neural crosstalk involved in bimanual movements, including the transcallosal pathway and ipsilateral motor pathway, the extent of tDCS-induced improvement may differ between unimanual and bimanual movement. We examined how tDCS affects simultaneous bimanual maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) by testing the effects of tDCS of the bilateral primary motor cortex (M1) on unimanual and bimanual handgrip strength. Twenty-one right-handed healthy adults underwent three bilateral tDCS protocols (“RaLc,” with an anode on right M1 and a cathode on left M1, “RcLa,” with an anode on left M1 and a cathode on right M1, and “Sham”) in a randomized order. A 1.5 mA current was applied for 15 min during tDCS. Participants then performed maximal unimanual and bimanual handgrip tests. Bimanual handgrip force was higher in both hands in the RcLa condition than in the Sham condition. Similarly, unimanual handgrip force was higher in the RcLa condition than in the Sham condition. Stimulus responses were asymmetrical and were not observed in the RaLc condition. Our findings demonstrate that RcLa tDCS leads to neuromodulation that can produce greater unimanual and bimanual handgrip strength. This result provides basic evidence that tDCS may be useful in sports, particularly those involving bilateral coordination of upper limb movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Electrophysiological Correlates of Phoneme Perception in Primary Progressive Aphasia: A Preliminary Case Series</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.618549</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.618549</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aims: This study aimed to investigate phoneme perception in patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) by using the event-related potential (ERP) technique. These ERP components might contribute to the diagnostic process of PPA and its clinical variants (NFV: nonfluent variant, SV: semantic variant, LV: logopenic variant) and reveal insights about phoneme perception processes in these patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Phoneme discrimination and categorization processes were investigated by the mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300 in eight persons with early- and late-stage PPA (3 NFV, 2 LV, 2 SV, and 1 PPA-NOS; not otherwise specified) and 30 age-matched healthy adults. The mean amplitude, the onset latency, and the topographic distribution of both components in each patient were compared to the results of the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The MMN was absent or the onset latency of the MMN was delayed in the patients with the NFV, LV, and PPA-NOS in comparison to the control group. In contrast, no differences in mean amplitudes and onset latencies of the MMN were found between the patients with the SV and the control group. Concerning the P300, variable results were found in the patients with the NFV, SV, and PPA-NOS, but the P300 of both patients with the LV was delayed and prolonged with increased mean amplitude in comparison to the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In this preliminary study, phoneme discrimination deficits were found in the patients with the NFV and LV, and variable deficits in phoneme categorization processes were found in all patients with PPA. In clinical practice, the MMN might be valuable to differentiate the SV from the NFV and the LV and the P300 to differentiate the LV from the NFV and the SV. Further research in larger and independent patient groups is required to investigate the applicability of these components in the diagnostic process and to determine the nature of these speech perception deficits in the clinical variants of PPA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Each neuron in the central nervous system has many dendrites, which provide input information through impulses. Assuming that a neuron's decision to continue or stop firing is made by rules applied to the dendrites' inputs, we associate neuron activity with a quantum like-cellular automaton (QLCA) concepts. Following a previous study that related the CA description with entangled states, we provide a quantum-like description of neuron activity. After reviewing and presenting the entanglement concept expressed by QLCA terminology, we propose a model that relates quantum-like measurement to consciousness. Then, we present a toy model that reviews the QLCA theory, which is adapted to our terminology. The study also focuses on implementing QLCA formalism to describe a single neuron activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Hippocampal Somatostatin Interneurons, Long-Term Synaptic Plasticity and Memory</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A distinctive feature of the hippocampal structure is the diversity of inhibitory interneurons. These complex inhibitory interconnections largely contribute to the tight modulation of hippocampal circuitry, as well as to the formation and coordination of neuronal assemblies underlying learning and memory. Inhibitory interneurons provide more than a simple transitory inhibition of hippocampal principal cells (PCs). The synaptic plasticity of inhibitory neurons provides long-lasting changes in the hippocampal network and is a key component of memory formation. The dendrite targeting interneurons expressing the peptide somatostatin (SOM) are particularly interesting in this regard because they display unique long-lasting synaptic changes leading to metaplastic regulation of hippocampal networks. In this article, we examine the actions of the neuropeptide SOM on hippocampal cells, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. We address the different subtypes of hippocampal SOM interneurons. We describe the long-term synaptic plasticity that takes place at the excitatory synapses of SOM interneurons, its singular induction and expression mechanisms, as well as the consequences of these changes on the hippocampal network, learning, and memory. We also review evidence that astrocytes provide cell-specific dynamic regulation of inhibition of PC dendrites by SOM interneurons. Finally, we cover how, in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), dysfunction of plasticity of SOM interneuron excitatory synapses may also contribute to cognitive impairments in brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neurotrophic Factors in Parkinson’s Disease: Clinical Trials, Open Challenges and Nanoparticle-Mediated Delivery to the Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.682597</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are small secreted proteins that support the development, maturation and survival of neurons. NTFs injected into the brain rescue and regenerate certain neuronal populations lost in neurodegenerative diseases, demonstrating the potential of NTFs to cure the diseases rather than simply alleviating the symptoms. NTFs (as the vast majority of molecules) do not pass through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and therefore, are delivered directly into the brain of patients using costly and risky intracranial surgery. The delivery efficacy and poor diffusion of some NTFs inside the brain are considered the major problems behind their modest effects in clinical trials. Thus, there is a great need for NTFs to be delivered systemically thereby avoiding intracranial surgery. Nanoparticles (NPs), particles with the size dimensions of 1-100 nm, can be used to stabilize NTFs and facilitate their transport through the BBB. Several studies have shown that NTFs can be loaded into or attached onto NPs, administered systemically and transported to the brain. To improve the NP-mediated NTF delivery through the BBB, the surface of NPs can be functionalized with specific ligands such as transferrin, insulin, lactoferrin, apolipoproteins, antibodies or short peptides that will be recognized and internalized by the respective receptors on brain endothelial cells. In this review, we elaborate on the most suitable NTF delivery methods and envision “ideal” NTF for Parkinson’s disease (PD) and clinical trial thereof. We shortly summarize clinical trials of four NTFs, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurturin (NRTN), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), and cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF), that were tested in PD patients, focusing mainly on GDNF and CDNF. We summarize current possibilities of NP-mediated delivery of NTFs to the brain and discuss whether NPs have impact in improving the properties of NTFs and delivery across the BBB. Emerging delivery approaches and future directions of NTF-based nanomedicine are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Mechanisms of Invasion in Glioblastoma: Extracellular Matrix, Ca2+ Signaling, and Glutamate</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and malignant form of primary brain tumor with a median survival time of 14–16 months in GBM patients. Surgical treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy may help increase survival by removing GBM from the brain. However, complete surgical resection to eliminate GBM is almost impossible due to its high invasiveness. When GBM cells migrate to the brain, they interact with various cells, including astrocytes, neurons, endothelial cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). They can also make their cell body shrink to infiltrate into narrow spaces in the brain; thereby, they can invade regions of the brain and escape from surgery. Brain tumor cells create an appropriate microenvironment for migration and invasion by modifying and degrading the ECM. During those processes, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling pathway and other signaling cascades mediated by various ion channels contribute mainly to gene expression, motility, and invasion of GBM cells. Furthermore, GBM cells release glutamate, affecting migration via activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors in an autocrine manner. This review focuses on the cellular mechanisms of glioblastoma invasion and motility related to ECM, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling, and glutamate. Finally, we discuss possible therapeutic interventions to inhibit invasion by GBM cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Preservation of Brain Activity in Unresponsive Patients Identifies MCS Star</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26095</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26095?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Brain‐injured patients who are unresponsive at the bedside (ie, vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome – VS/UWS) may present brain activity similar to patients in minimally conscious state (MCS). This peculiar condition has been termed “non‐behavioural MCS” or “MCS*”. In the present study we aimed to investigate the proportion and underlying brain characteristics of patients in MCS*.


Methods
Brain 18F‐fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG‐PET) was acquired on 135 brain‐injured patients diagnosed in prolonged VS/UWS (n = 48) or MCS (n = 87). From an existing database, relative metabolic preservation in the fronto‐parietal network (measured with standardized uptake value) was visually inspected by three experts. Patients with hypometabolism of the fronto‐parietal network were labelled “VS/UWS”, while its (partial) preservation either confirmed the behavioural diagnosis of “MCS” or, in absence of behavioural signs of consciousness, suggested a diagnosis of “MCS*”. Clinical outcome at 1‐year follow‐up, functional connectivity, grey matter atrophy, and regional brain metabolic patterns were investigated in the three groups (VS/UWS, MCS* and MCS).


Results
67% of behavioural VS/UWS presented a partial preservation of brain metabolism (ie, MCS*). Compared to VS/UWS patients, MCS* patients demonstrated a better outcome, global functional connectivity and grey matter preservation more compatible with the diagnosis of MCS. MCS* patients presented lower brain metabolism mostly in the posterior brain regions compared to MCS patients.


Interpretation
MCS* is a frequent phenomenon that is associated with better outcome and better brain preservation than the diagnosis of VS/UWS. Complementary exams should be provided to all unresponsive patients before taking medical decisions. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The visual cortex produces gamma band echo in response to broadband visual flicker</title>

The aim of this study is to uncover the network dynamics of the human visual cortex by driving it with a broadband random visual flicker. We here applied a broadband flicker (1–720 Hz) while measuring the MEG and then estimated the temporal response function (TRF) between the visual input and the MEG response. This TRF revealed an early response in the 40–60 Hz gamma range as well as in the 8–12 Hz alpha band. While the gamma band response is novel, the latter has been termed the alpha band perceptual echo. The gamma echo preceded the alpha perceptual echo. The dominant frequency of the gamma echo was subject-specific thereby reflecting the individual dynamical properties of the early visual cortex. To understand the neuronal mechanisms generating the gamma echo, we implemented a pyramidal-interneuron gamma (PING) model that produces gamma oscillations in the presence of constant input currents. Applying a broadband input current mimicking the visual stimulation allowed us to estimate TRF between the input current and the population response (akin to the local field potentials). The TRF revealed a gamma echo that was similar to the one we observed in the MEG data. Our results suggest that the visual gamma echo can be explained by the dynamics of the PING model even in the absence of sustained gamma oscillations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/88rEjoc00IA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Existing studies have demonstrated that dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) is involved in the initiation and progression of cancer. Many efforts have been devoted to identify microRNAs as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic targets. With the rapid development of miRNA sequencing technology, a vast amount of miRNA expression data for multiple cancers has been collected. These invaluable data repositories provide new paradigms to explore the relationship between miRNAs and cancer. Thus, there is an urgent need to explore the complex cancer-related miRNA-gene patterns by integrating multi-omics data in a pan-cancer paradigm. In this study, we present a tensor sparse canonical correlation analysis (TSCCA) method for identifying cancer-related miRNA-gene modules across multiple cancers. TSCCA is able to overcome the drawbacks of existing solutions and capture both the cancer-shared and specific miRNA-gene co-expressed modules with better biological interpretations. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of TSCCA using a set of simulated data and matched miRNA/gene expression data across 33 cancer types from the TCGA database. We uncover several dysfunctional miRNA-gene modules with important biological functions and statistical significance. These modules can advance our understanding of miRNA regulatory mechanisms of cancer and provide insights into miRNA-based treatments for cancer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KF6Pqt_AyoU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Increasing interest has emerged in new mathematical approaches that simplify the study of complex differentiation processes by formalizing Waddington’s landscape metaphor. However, a rational method to build these landscape models remains an open problem. Here we study vulval development in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; by developing a framework based on Catastrophe Theory (CT) and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to build data-fitted landscape models. We first identify the candidate qualitative landscapes, and then use CT to build the simplest model consistent with the data, which we quantitatively fit using ABC. The resulting model suggests that the underlying mechanism is a quantifiable two-step decision controlled by EGF and Notch-Delta signals, where a non-vulval/vulval decision is followed by a bistable transition to the two vulval states. This new model fits a broad set of data and makes several novel predictions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UhG6hhJfAHw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Supervised machine learning is an essential but difficult to use approach in biomedical data analysis. The Galaxy-ML toolkit (https://galaxyproject.org/community/machine-learning/) makes supervised machine learning more accessible to biomedical scientists by enabling them to perform end-to-end reproducible machine learning analyses at large scale using only a web browser. Galaxy-ML extends Galaxy (https://galaxyproject.org), a biomedical computational workbench used by tens of thousands of scientists across the world, with a suite of tools for all aspects of supervised machine learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HLJ-GJH9vXM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Growth rules for the repair of Asynchronous Irregular neuronal networks after peripheral lesions</title>

Several homeostatic mechanisms enable the brain to maintain desired levels of neuronal activity. One of these, homeostatic structural plasticity, has been reported to restore activity in networks disrupted by peripheral lesions by altering their neuronal connectivity. While multiple lesion experiments have studied the changes in neurite morphology that underlie modifications of synapses in these networks, the underlying mechanisms that drive these changes are yet to be explained. Evidence suggests that neuronal activity modulates neurite morphology and may stimulate neurites to selective sprout or retract to restore network activity levels. We developed a new spiking network model of peripheral lesioning and accurately reproduced the characteristics of network repair after deafferentation that are reported in experiments to study the activity dependent growth regimes of neurites. To ensure that our simulations closely resemble the behaviour of networks in the brain, we model deafferentation in a biologically realistic balanced network model that exhibits low frequency Asynchronous Irregular (AI) activity as observed in cerebral cortex. Our simulation results indicate that the re-establishment of activity in neurons both within and outside the deprived region, the Lesion Projection Zone (LPZ), requires opposite activity dependent growth rules for excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic elements. Analysis of these growth regimes indicates that they also contribute to the maintenance of activity levels in individual neurons. Furthermore, in our model, the directional formation of synapses that is observed in experiments requires that pre-synaptic excitatory and inhibitory elements also follow opposite growth rules. Lastly, we observe that our proposed structural plasticity growth rules and the inhibitory synaptic plasticity mechanism that also balances our AI network both contribute to the restoration of the network to pre-deafferentation stable activity levels.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yR-Sq_AD2TE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: An image-computable model of human visual shape similarity</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Yaniv Morgenstern, Frieder Hartmann, Filipp Schmidt, Henning Tiedemann, Eugen Prokott, Guido Maiello, Roland W. Fleming&lt;/p&gt;

Shape is a defining feature of objects, and human observers can effortlessly compare shapes to determine how similar they are. Yet, to date, no image-computable model can predict how visually similar or different shapes appear. Such a model would be an invaluable tool for neuroscientists and could provide insights into computations underlying human shape perception. To address this need, we developed a model (‘ShapeComp’), based on over 100 shape features (e.g., area, compactness, Fourier descriptors). When trained to capture the variance in a database of &amp;gt;25,000 animal silhouettes, ShapeComp accurately predicts human shape similarity judgments between pairs of shapes without fitting any parameters to human data. To test the model, we created carefully selected arrays of complex novel shapes using a Generative Adversarial Network trained on the animal silhouettes, which we presented to observers in a wide range of tasks. Our findings show that incorporating multiple ShapeComp dimensions facilitates the prediction of human shape similarity across a small number of shapes, and also captures much of the variance in the multiple arrangements of many shapes. ShapeComp outperforms both conventional pixel-based metrics and state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, and can also be used to generate perceptually uniform stimulus sets, making it a powerful tool for investigating shape and object representations in the human brain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Pi5uf5AhT7M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Categorical judgments do not modify sensory representations in working memory</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Long Luu, Alan A. Stocker&lt;/p&gt;

Categorical judgments can systematically bias the perceptual interpretation of stimulus features. However, it remained unclear whether categorical judgments directly modify working memory representations or, alternatively, generate these biases via an inference process down-stream from working memory. To address this question we ran two novel psychophysical experiments in which human subjects had to reverse their categorical judgments about a stimulus feature, if incorrect, before providing an estimate of the feature. If categorical judgments indeed directly altered sensory representations in working memory, subjects’ estimates should reflect some aspects of their initial (incorrect) categorical judgment in those trials. We found no traces of the initial categorical judgment. Rather, subjects seemed to be able to flexibly switch their categorical judgment if needed and use the correct corresponding categorical prior to properly perform feature inference. A cross-validated model comparison also revealed that feedback may lead to selective memory recall such that only memory samples that are consistent with the categorical judgment are accepted for the inference process. Our results suggest that categorical judgments do not modify sensory information in working memory but rather act as top-down expectations in the subsequent sensory recall and inference process.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ACl1Niq_GPM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Embedding optimization reveals long-lasting history dependence in neural spiking activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008927</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Lucas Rudelt, Daniel González Marx, Michael Wibral, Viola Priesemann&lt;/p&gt;

Information processing can leave distinct footprints on the statistics of neural spiking. For example, efficient coding minimizes the statistical dependencies on the spiking history, while temporal integration of information may require the maintenance of information over different timescales. To investigate these footprints, we developed a novel approach to quantify history dependence within the spiking of a single neuron, using the mutual information between the entire past and current spiking. This measure captures how much past information is necessary to predict current spiking. In contrast, classical time-lagged measures of temporal dependence like the autocorrelation capture how long—potentially redundant—past information can still be read out. Strikingly, we find for model neurons that our method disentangles the &lt;i&gt;strength&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;timescale&lt;/i&gt; of history dependence, whereas the two are mixed in classical approaches. When applying the method to experimental data, which are necessarily of limited size, a reliable estimation of mutual information is only possible for a coarse temporal binning of past spiking, a so-called past embedding. To still account for the vastly different spiking statistics and potentially long history dependence of living neurons, we developed an embedding-optimization approach that does not only vary the number and size, but also an exponential stretching of past bins. For extra-cellular spike recordings, we found that the strength and timescale of history dependence indeed can vary independently across experimental preparations. While hippocampus indicated strong and long history dependence, in visual cortex it was weak and short, while in vitro the history dependence was strong but short. This work enables an information-theoretic characterization of history dependence in recorded spike trains, which captures a footprint of information processing that is beyond time-lagged measures of temporal dependence. To facilitate the application of the method, we provide practical guidelines and a toolbox.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lJdScf-37tM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Implications of diffusion and time-varying morphogen gradients for the dynamic positioning and precision of bistable gene expression boundaries</title>

The earliest models for how morphogen gradients guide embryonic patterning failed to account for experimental observations of temporal refinement in gene expression domains. Following theoretical and experimental work in this area, dynamic positional information has emerged as a conceptual framework to discuss how cells process spatiotemporal inputs into downstream patterns. Here, we show that diffusion determines the mathematical means by which bistable gene expression boundaries shift over time, and therefore how cells interpret positional information conferred from morphogen concentration. First, we introduce a metric for assessing reproducibility in boundary placement or precision in systems where gene products do not diffuse, but where morphogen concentrations are permitted to change in time. We show that the dynamics of the gradient affect the sensitivity of the final pattern to variation in initial conditions, with slower gradients reducing the sensitivity. Second, we allow gene products to diffuse and consider gene expression boundaries as propagating wavefronts with velocity modulated by local morphogen concentration. We harness this perspective to approximate a PDE model as an ODE that captures the position of the boundary in time, and demonstrate the approach with a preexisting model for Hunchback patterning in fruit fly embryos. We then propose a design that employs antiparallel morphogen gradients to achieve accurate boundary placement that is robust to scaling. Throughout our work we draw attention to tradeoffs among initial conditions, boundary positioning, and the relative timescales of network and gradient evolution. We conclude by suggesting that mathematical theory should serve to clarify not just our quantitative, but also our intuitive understanding of patterning processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mEXsX8U--kQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;i&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/i&gt; is a human fungal pathogen that can cause devastating pulmonary infections, termed “aspergilloses,” in individuals suffering immune imbalances or underlying lung conditions. As rapid adaptation to stress is crucial for the outcome of the host–pathogen interplay, here we investigated the role of the versatile posttranslational modification (PTM) persulfidation for both fungal virulence and antifungal host defense. We show that an &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;fumigatus&lt;/i&gt; mutant with low persulfidation levels is more susceptible to host-mediated killing and displays reduced virulence in murine models of infection. Additionally, we found that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human gene encoding cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) causes a reduction in cellular persulfidation and correlates with a predisposition of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), as correct levels of persulfidation are required for optimal antifungal activity of recipients’ lung resident host cells. Importantly, the levels of host persulfidation determine the levels of fungal persulfidation, ultimately reflecting a host–pathogen functional correlation and highlighting a potential new therapeutic target for the treatment of aspergillosis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OZifpfaWVlg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Reduced coupling between cerebrospinal fluid flow and global brain activity is linked to Alzheimer disease–related pathology</title>

The glymphatic system plays an important role in clearing the amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins that are closely linked to Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. Glymphatic clearance, as well as Aβ accumulation, is highly dependent on sleep, but the sleep-dependent driving forces behind cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) movements essential to the glymphatic flux remain largely unclear. Recent studies have reported that widespread, high-amplitude spontaneous brain activations in the drowsy state and during sleep, which are shown as large global signal peaks in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), are coupled with CSF movements, suggesting their potential link to glymphatic flux and metabolite clearance. By analyzing multimodal data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project, here we showed that the coupling between the global fMRI signal and CSF influx is correlated with AD-related pathology, including various risk factors for AD, the severity of AD-related diseases, the cortical Aβ level, and cognitive decline over a 2-year follow-up. These results provide critical initial evidence for involvement of sleep-dependent global brain activity, as well as the associated physiological modulations, in the clearance of AD-related brain waste.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/lySWRRRKryk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Global biodiversity loss is a profound consequence of human activity. Disturbingly, biodiversity loss is greater than realized because of the unknown number of undocumented species. Conservation fundamentally relies on taxonomic recognition of species, but only a fraction of biodiversity is described. Here, we provide a new quantitative approach for prioritizing rigorous taxonomic research for conservation. We implement this approach in a highly diverse vertebrate group—Australian lizards and snakes. Of 870 species assessed, we identified 282 (32.4%) with taxonomic uncertainty, of which 17.6% likely comprise undescribed species of conservation concern. We identify 24 species in need of immediate taxonomic attention to facilitate conservation. Using a broadly applicable return-on-investment framework, we demonstrate the importance of prioritizing the fundamental work of identifying species before they are lost.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/y9QlVuTXNHI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: An in vitro model of tumor heterogeneity resolves genetic, epigenetic, and stochastic sources of cell state variability</title>

Tumor heterogeneity is a primary cause of treatment failure and acquired resistance in cancer patients. Even in cancers driven by a single mutated oncogene, variability in response to targeted therapies is well known. The existence of additional genomic alterations among tumor cells can only partially explain this variability. As such, nongenetic factors are increasingly seen as critical contributors to tumor relapse and acquired resistance in cancer. Here, we show that both genetic and nongenetic factors contribute to targeted drug response variability in an experimental model of tumor heterogeneity. We observe significant variability to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition among and within multiple versions and clonal sublines of PC9, a commonly used EGFR mutant nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line. We resolve genetic, epigenetic, and stochastic components of this variability using a theoretical framework in which distinct genetic states give rise to multiple epigenetic “basins of attraction,” across which cells can transition driven by stochastic noise. Using mutational impact analysis, single-cell differential gene expression, and correlations among Gene Ontology (GO) terms to connect genomics to transcriptomics, we establish a baseline for genetic differences driving drug response variability among PC9 cell line versions. Applying the same approach to clonal sublines, we conclude that drug response variability in all but one of the sublines is due to epigenetic differences; in the other, it is due to genetic alterations. Finally, using a clonal drug response assay together with stochastic simulations, we attribute subclonal drug response variability within sublines to stochastic cell fate decisions and confirm that one subline likely contains genetic resistance mutations that emerged in the absence of drug treatment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/-3GnOPaF4YY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Cerebellar spongiform degeneration is accompanied by metabolic, cellular, and motor disruption in male rats with portacaval anastomosis</title>

	<description>Portacaval anastomosis (PCA) promoted spongiform degeneration at the cerebellar molecular layer. There was loss of Purkinje cells, microglia activation and increase expression of NLRP3 and aquaporin‐4. By NMR spectroscopy, there was reduction in osmolytes that can be cause the cellular edema. PCA rats showed a motor deficiency in rotarod test.

Abstract
The episodes of cerebral dysfunction, known as encephalopathy, are usually coincident with liver failure. The primary metabolic marker of liver diseases is the increase in blood ammonium, which promotes neuronal damage. In the present project, we used an experimental model of hepatic encephalopathy in male rats by portacaval anastomosis (PCA) surgery. Sham rats had a false operation. After 13 weeks of surgery, the most distinctive finding was vacuolar/spongiform neurodegeneration exclusively in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. This cerebellar damage was further characterized by metabolic, histopathological, and behavioral approaches. The results were as follows: (a) Cellular alterations, namely loss of Purkinje cells, morphological changes, such as swelling of astrocytes and Bergmann glia, and activation of microglia; (b) Cytotoxic edema, shown by an increase in aquaporin‐4 and N‐acetylaspartate and a reduction in taurine and choline‐derivate osmolytes; (c) Metabolic adjustments, noted by the elevation of circulating ammonium, enhanced presence of glutamine synthetase, and increase in glutamine and creatine/phosphocreatine; (d) Inflammasome activation, detected by the elevation of the marker NLRP3 and microglial activation; (e) Locomotor deficits in PCA rats as assessed by the Rotarod and open field tests. These results lead us to suggest that metabolic disturbances associated with PCA can generate the cerebellar damage that is similar to morphophysiological modifications observed in amyloidogenic disorders. In conclusion, we have characterized a distinctive cerebellar multi‐disruption accompanied by high levels of ammonium and associated with spongiform neurodegeneration in a model of hepatic hypofunctioning.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: ACSA‐2 and GLAST classify subpopulations of multipotent and glial‐restricted cerebellar precursors</title>

	<description>Glial cells of the cerebellum are still insufficiently classified. In this study we describe the subclassification of GLAST+ precursors in the prospective white matter using immunophenotyping, transcriptomics, and transplantation assays. A subclass of GLAST+ cells, which co‐express astrocyte cell surface antigen‐2 (ACSA‐2), generates only parenchymal astrocytes—as revealed by protein expression, their genetic signature and transplantation. The absence of the astrocyte marker (ACSA‐2) reveals GLAST+ cells to maintain a multipotent potential, giving rise to interneurons, glia, and Bergmann glia.

Abstract
The formation of the cerebellum is highly coordinated to obtain its characteristic morphology and all cerebellar cell types. During mouse postnatal development, cerebellar progenitors with astroglial‐like characteristics generate mainly astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. However, a subset of astroglial‐like progenitors found in the prospective white matter (PWM) produces astroglia and interneurons. Characterizing these cerebellar astroglia‐like progenitors and distinguishing their developmental fates is still elusive. Here, we reveal that astrocyte cell surface antigen‐2 (ACSA‐2), lately identified as ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, beta 2 polypeptide, is expressed by glial precursors throughout postnatal cerebellar development. In contrast to common astrocyte markers, ACSA‐2 appears on PWM cells but is absent on Bergmann glia (BG) precursors. In the adult cerebellum, ACSA‐2 is broadly expressed extending to velate astrocytes in the granular layer, white matter astrocytes, and to a lesser extent to BG. Cell transplantation and transcriptomic analysis revealed that marker staining discriminates two postnatal progenitor pools. One subset is defined by the co‐expression of ACSA‐2 and GLAST and the expression of markers typical of parenchymal astrocytes. These are PWM precursors that are exclusively gliogenic. They produce predominantly white matter and granular layer astrocytes. Another subset is constituted by GLAST positive/ACSA‐2 negative precursors that express neurogenic and BG‐like progenitor genes. This population displays multipotency and gives rise to interneurons besides all glial types, including BG. In conclusion, this work reports about ACSA‐2, a marker that in combination with GLAST enables for the discrimination and isolation of multipotent and glia‐committed progenitors, which generate different types of cerebellar astrocytes.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Golgi defects including Golgi fragmentation are pathological features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). As a pathogenic factor in AD, amyloid precursor protein (APP) induces Golgi fragmentation in the soma. However, how APP regulates Golgi outposts (GOs) in dendrites remains unclear. Given that APP resides in and affects the movements of GOs, and in particular, reverses the distribution of multi-compartment GOs (mcGOs), we investigated the regulatory mechanism of mcGO movements in the Drosophila larvae. Knockdown experiments showed that the bidirectional mcGO movements were cooperatively controlled by the dynein heavy chain (Dhc) and kinesin heavy chain subunits. Notably, only Dhc mediated APP’s regulation of mcGO movements. Furthermore, by loss-of-function screening, the adaptor protein Sunday driver (Syd) was identified to mediate the APP-induced alteration of the direction of mcGO movements and dendritic defects. Collectively, by elucidating a model of bidirectional mcGO movements, we revealed the mechanism by which APP regulates the direction of mcGO movements. Our study therefore provides new insights into AD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a complex neurodegenerative disease caused by degeneration of motor neurons (MNs). ALS pathogenic features include accumulation of misfolded proteins, glutamate excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction at distal axon terminals, and neuronal cytoskeleton changes. Synergies between loss of C9orf72 functions and gain of function by toxic effects of repeat expansions also contribute to C9orf72-mediated pathogenesis. However, the impact of haploinsufficiency of C9orf72 on neurons and in synaptic functions requires further examination. As the motor neurons degenerate, the disease symptoms will lead to neurotransmission deficiencies in the brain, spinal cord, and neuromuscular junction. Altered neuronal excitability, synaptic morphological changes, and C9orf72 protein and DPR localization at the synapses, suggest a potential involvement of C9orf72 at synapses. In this review article, we provide a conceptual framework for assessing the putative involvement of C9orf72 as a synaptopathy, and we explore the underlying and common disease mechanisms with other neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we reflect on the major challenges of understanding C9orf72-ALS as a synaptopathy focusing on integrating mitochondrial and neuronal cytoskeleton degeneration as biomarkers and potential targets to treat ALS neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Inhalation of Molecular Hydrogen, a Rescue Treatment for Noise-Induced Hearing Loss</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Noise exposure is the most important external factor causing acquired hearing loss in humans, and it is strongly associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cochlea. Several studies reported that the administration of various compounds with antioxidant effects can treat oxidative stress-induced hearing loss. However, traditional systemic drug administration to the human inner ear is problematic and has not been successful in a clinical setting. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop rescue treatment for patients with acute acoustic injuries. Hydrogen gas has antioxidant effects, rapid distribution, and distributes systemically after inhalation.The purpose of this study was to determine the protective efficacy of a single dose of molecular hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on cochlear structures. Guinea pigs were divided into six groups and sacrificed immediately after or at 1 or 2 weeks. The animals were exposed to broadband noise for 2 h directly followed by 1-h inhalation of 2% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or room air. Electrophysiological hearing thresholds using frequency-specific auditory brainstem response (ABR) were measured prior to noise exposure and before sacrifice. ABR thresholds were significantly lower in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-treated animals at 2 weeks after exposure, with significant preservation of outer hair cells in the entire cochlea. Quantification of synaptophysin immunoreactivity revealed that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhalation protected the cochlear inner hair cell synaptic structures containing synaptophysin. The inflammatory response was greater in the stria vascularis, showing increased Iba1 due to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhalation.Repeated administration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhalation may further improve the therapeutic effect. This animal model does not reproduce conditions in humans, highlighting the need for additional real-life studies in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Two-Year Follow-Up Study of the Relationship Between Brain Structure and Cognitive Control Function Across the Adult Lifespan</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Age-related decline in cognitive control and general slowing are prominent phenomena in aging research. These declines in cognitive functions have been shown to also involve age-related decline in brain structure. However, most evidence in support of these associations is based on cross-sectional data. Therefore, the aim of this study is to contrast cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses to re-examine if the relationship between age-related brain structure and cognitive function are similar between the two approaches. One hundred and two participants completed two sessions with an average interval of 2 years. All participants were assessed by questionnaires, a series of cognitive tasks, and they all underwent neuroimaging acquisition. The main results of this study show that the majority of the conclusions regarding age effect in cognitive control function and processing speed in the literature can be replicated based on the cross-sectional data. Conversely, when we followed up individuals over an average interval of 2 years, then we found much fewer significant relationships between age-related change in gray matter structure of the cognitive control network and age-related change in cognitive control function. Furthermore, there was no “initial age” effect in the relationships between age-related changes in brain structure and cognitive function. This finding suggests that the “aging” relationship between brain structure and cognitive function over a short period of time are independent of “initial age” difference at time point 1. The result of this study warrants the importance of longitudinal research for aging studies to elucidate actual aging processes on cognitive control function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Reconstruction of nitrergic neurons (NNs) found in one section of the representation of the forepaw of the rat in different cortical compartments in somatosensory area S1 and motor area M1. NNs are more densely packed in the upper layers (I–III) and more sparsely distributed in Layer V. Scale bar: 100 μm.







Abstract
Nitrergic neurons (NNs) are inhibitory neurons capable of releasing nitric oxide (NO) that are labeled with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase histochemistry. The rat primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices are a favorable model to investigate NN populations by comparing their morphology, since these areas share the border of forepaw representation. The distribution of the Type I NN of the forepaw representation in the S1 and M1 cortices of the rat in different laminar compartments and the morphological parameters related to the cell body and dendritic arborization were measured and compared. We observed that the neuronal density in the S1 (130 NN/mm3) was higher than the neuronal density in the M1 (119 NN/mm3). Most NN neurons were multipolar (S1 with 58%; M1 with 69%), and a minority of the NN neurons were horizontal (S1 with 6%; M1 with 12%). NN found in S1 had a higher verticality index than NN found in M1, and no significant differences were observed for the other morphological parameters. We also demonstrated significant differences in most of the morphological parameters of the NN between different cortical compartments of S1 and M1. Our results indicate that the NN of the forepaw in S1 and M1 corresponds to a neuronal population, where the functionality is independent of the different types of sensory and motor processing. However, the morphological differences found between the cortical compartments of S1 and M1, as well as the higher density of NNs found in S1, indicate that the release of NO varies between the areas.</description>

Abstract
Egg laying in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis is regulated by the photoperiod; long‐day conditions (16L8D) promote egg laying whereas medium‐day conditions (12L12D) suppress it. In this snail, a caudo‐dorsal cell hormone (CDCH) is produced by neurosecretory cells, CDCs in the cerebral ganglion (CG), and its release triggers ovulation and subsequent egg laying. However, the physiological basis for photoperiod‐dependent egg laying remains unraveled. Here, we compared electrophysiological properties of CDCs between 16L8D and 12L12D using intracellular recording, and found that CDC excitability is higher in 16L8D than in 12L12D. Striking differences are as follows: 1) A shallower resting membrane potential in 16L8D than in 12L12D, and 2) a smaller threshold voltage (minimum depolarization from rest to elicit action potentials) in 16L8D than in 12L12D. Switching of the excitability can be a physiological basis of a photoperiod‐dependent CDCH release. Simultaneous intracellular dye injection identified two morphological subtypes of CDCs, validating a previous report. Both types bear short lateral extensions in CG, some of which probably function as integration sites of photoperiodic inputs. In addition, we found two novel CDCH‐immunoreactive cell groups (CDCCOM and SCm) in the CG besides conventional CDCs and small cells expressing CDCH. The CDCCOM with cell bodies and fibers in the neurohemal commissure may be involved in triggering ovulation. Notably, the total number of CDCs is larger than that previously reported, the right CDC cluster with more cells than the left. Our findings are instructive in following the neurophysiology of photoperiodism in L. stagnalis.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Intrathecal Immunoglobulin M synthesis is an independent biomarker for higher disease activity and severity in multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26137</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26137?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
We aimed to determine whether in relapsing multiple sclerosis intrathecal IgM and IgG synthesis are associated with outcomes reflecting inflammatory activity and chronic worsening.


Methods
We compared CSF analysis, clinical and MRI data, and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels at baseline and follow‐up in 530 patients with relapsing MS. Patients were categorized by presence of oligoclonal IgG bands (OCGB) and intrathecal synthesis of IgG and IgM (IgGIntrathecal Fraction (IF), IgMIF). Relations to time to first relapse, sNfL concentrations, T2w lesions, MS Severity Score (MSSS), and time to initiation of high efficacy therapy were analyzed in covariate adjusted statistical models.


Results
By categorical analysis, in patients with IgMIF median time to first relapse was 28 months shorter and MSSS was on average higher by 1.11 steps compared to those without intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis. Moreover, patients with IgMIF had higher sNfL concentrations, more new/enlarging T2w lesions and higher total T2w lesion counts (all p&amp;lt;/= 0.01). These associations were absent, or equally smaller in patients who were only positive for OCGB or OCGB/IgGIF.
Furthermore, quantitative analyses revealed that in patients with IgMIF ≥ median, time to first relapse and to initiation of high efficacy therapy was shorter by 32 and by 203 months (both p &amp;lt; 0.01), as compared to patients with IgMIF &amp;lt; median; dose‐dependent associations were also found for IgMIF but not for IgGIF with MRI defined disease activity and sNfL.


Interpretation
This large study supports the value of intrathecal IgM synthesis as an independent biomarker of disease activity and severity in relapsing MS.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: A causal role for the pulvinar in coordinating task‐independent cortico–cortical interactions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25193</guid>

	<description>Abstract
The pulvinar is the largest nucleus in the primate thalamus and has topographically organized connections with multiple cortical areas, thereby forming extensive cortico‐pulvino‐cortical input–output loops. Neurophysiological studies have suggested a role for these transthalamic pathways in regulating information transmission between cortical areas. However, evidence for a causal role of the pulvinar in regulating cortico–cortical interactions is sparse and it is not known whether pulvinar's influences on cortical networks are task‐dependent or, alternatively, reflect more basic large‐scale network properties that maintain functional connectivity across networks regardless of active task demands. In the current study, under passive viewing conditions, we conducted simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from ventral (area V4) and dorsal (lateral intraparietal area [LIP]) nodes of macaque visual system, while reversibly inactivating the dorsal part of the lateral pulvinar (dPL), which shares common anatomical connectivity with V4 and LIP, to probe a causal role of the pulvinar. Our results show a significant reduction in local field potential phase coherence between LIP and V4 in low frequencies (4–15 Hz) following muscimol injection into dPL. At the local level, no significant changes in firing rates or LFP power were observed in LIP or in V4 following dPL inactivation. Synchronization between pulvinar spikes and cortical LFP phase decreased in low frequencies (4–15 Hz) both in LIP and V4, while the low frequency synchronization between LIP spikes and pulvinar phase increased. These results indicate a causal role for pulvinar in synchronizing neural activity between interconnected cortical nodes of a large‐scale network, even in the absence of an active task state.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Understanding the Role of Sensorimotor Beta Oscillations</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Beta oscillations have been predominantly observed in sensorimotor cortices and basal ganglia structures and they are thought to be involved in somatosensory processing and motor control. Although beta activity is a distinct feature of healthy and pathological sensorimotor processing, the role of this rhythm is still under debate. Here we review recent findings about the role of beta oscillations during experimental manipulations (i.e., drugs and brain stimulation) and their alteration in aging and pathology. We show how beta changes when learning new motor skills and its potential to integrate sensory input with prior contextual knowledge. We conclude by discussing a novel methodological approach analyzing beta oscillations as a series of transient bursting events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging are emerging as powerful tools to study brain structures and functions. The skull introduces significant distortion and attenuation of the ultrasound signals deteriorating image quality. For biological studies employing rodents, craniotomy is often times performed to enhance image qualities. However, craniotomy is unsuitable for longitudinal studies, where a long-term cranial window is needed to prevent repeated surgeries. Here, we propose a mouse model to eliminate sound blockage by the top portion of the skull, while minimum physiological perturbation to the imaged object is incurred. With the new mouse model, no craniotomy is needed before each imaging experiment. The effectiveness of our method was confirmed by three imaging systems: photoacoustic computed tomography, ultrasound imaging, and photoacoustic mesoscopy. Functional photoacoustic imaging of the mouse brain hemodynamics was also conducted. We expect new applications to be enabled by the new mouse model for photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Miniaturized implantable devices play a crucial role in neural interfaces by monitoring and modulating neural activities on the peripheral and central nervous systems. Research efforts toward a compact wireless closed-loop system stimulating the nerve automatically according to the user's condition have been maintained. These systems have several advantages over open-loop stimulation systems such as reduction in both power consumption and side effects of continuous stimulation. Furthermore, a compact and wireless device consuming low energy alleviates foreign body reactions and risk of frequent surgical operations. Unfortunately, however, the miniaturized closed-loop neural interface system induces several hardware design challenges such as neural activity recording with severe stimulation artifact, real-time stimulation artifact removal, and energy-efficient wireless power delivery. Here, we will review recent approaches toward the miniaturized closed-loop neural interface system with integrated circuit (IC) techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;It is reported that radiomic features extracted from quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) had promising clinical value for the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). We aimed to explore the usefulness of radiomics features based on magnitude images to distinguish PD from non-PD controls.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We retrospectively recruited PD patients and controls who underwent brain 3.0T MR including susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). A total of 396 radiomics features were extracted from the SN of 95 PD patients and 95 non-PD controls based on SWI. Intra-/inter-observer correlation coefficients (ICCs) were applied to measure the observer agreement for the radiomic feature extraction. Then the patients were randomly grouped into training and validation sets in a ratio of 7:3. In the training set, the maximum correlation minimum redundancy algorithm (mRMR) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were conducted to filter and choose the optimized subset of features, and a radiomics signature was constructed. Moreover, radiomics signatures were constructed by different machine learning models. Area under the ROC curves (AUCs) were applied to evaluate the predictive performance of the models. Then correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation between the optimized features and clinical factors.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The intro-observer CC ranged from 0.82 to 1.0, and the inter-observer CC ranged from 0.77 to 0.99. The LASSO logistic regression model showed good prediction efficacy in the training set [AUC = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI, 0.74–0.88)] and the validation set [AUC = 0.81, 95% CI (0.68–0.91)]. One radiomic feature showed a moderate negative correlation with Hoehn-Yahr stage (r = −0.49, P = 0.012).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Radiomic predictive features based on SWI magnitude images could reflect the Hoehn-Yahr stage of PD to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal morphology is characterized by salient features such as complex axonal and dendritic arbors. In the mammalian brain, variations in dendritic morphology among cell classes, brain regions, and animal species are thought to underlie known differences in neuronal function. In this work, we obtained a large dataset from http://neuromorpho.org/ comprising layer III pyramidal cells in different cortical areas of the ventral visual pathway (V1, V2, V4, TEO, and TE) of the macaque monkey at different developmental stages. We performed an in depth quantitative analysis of pyramidal cell morphology throughout development in an effort to determine which aspects mature early in development and which features require a protracted period of maturation. We were also interested in establishing if developmental changes in morphological features occur simultaneously or hierarchically in multiple visual cortical areas. We addressed these questions by performing principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis on relevant morphological features. Our analysis indicates that the maturation of pyramidal cell morphology is largely based on early development of topological features in most visual cortical areas. Moreover, the maturation of pyramidal cell morphology in V1, V2, V4, TEO, and TE is characterized by unique developmental trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The nervous systems converts the physical quantities sensed by its primary receptors into trains of events that are then processed in the brain. The unmatched efficiency in information processing has long inspired engineers to seek brain-like approaches to sensing and signal processing. The key principle pursued in neuromorphic sensing is to shed the traditional approach of periodic sampling in favor of an event-driven scheme that mimicks sampling as it occurs in the nervous system, where events are preferably emitted upon the change of the sensed stimulus. In this paper we highlight the advantages and challenges of event-based sensing and signal processing in the visual, auditory and olfactory domains. We also provide a survey of the literature covering neuromorphic sensing and signal processing in all three modalities. Our aim is to facilitate research in event-based sensing and signal processing by providing a comprehensive overview of the research performed previously as well as highlighting conceptual advantages, current progress and future challenges in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Transparent Touch: Insights From Model Systems on Epidermal Control of Somatosensory Innervation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Somatosensory neurons (SSNs) densely innervate our largest organ, the skin, and shape our experience of the world, mediating responses to sensory stimuli including touch, pressure, and temperature. Historically, epidermal contributions to somatosensation, including roles in shaping innervation patterns and responses to sensory stimuli, have been understudied. However, recent work demonstrates that epidermal signals dictate patterns of SSN skin innervation through a variety of mechanisms including targeting afferents to the epidermis, providing instructive cues for branching morphogenesis, growth control and structural stability of neurites, and facilitating neurite-neurite interactions. Here, we focus onstudies conducted in worms (Caenorhabditis elegans), fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), and zebrafish (Danio rerio): prominent model systems in which anatomical and genetic analyses have defined fundamental principles by which epidermal cells govern SSN development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Deciphering in silico the Role of Mutated NaV1.1 Sodium Channels in Enhancing Trigeminal Nociception in Familial Hemiplegic Migraine Type 3</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.644047</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Familial hemiplegic migraine type 3 (FHM3) is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the SCN1A gene that encodes the α1 subunit of voltage-gated Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 sodium channels. The high level of expression of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 channels in peripheral trigeminal neurons may lead to abnormal nociceptive signaling thus contributing to migraine pain. Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 dysfunction is relevant also for other neurological disorders, foremost epilepsy and stroke that are comorbid with migraine. Here we used computer modeling to test the functional role of FHM3-mutated Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 channels in mechanisms of trigeminal pain. The activation of Aδ-fibers was studied for two algogens, ATP and 5-HT, operating through P2X3 and 5-HT3 receptors, respectively, at trigeminal nerve terminals. In WT Aδ-fibers of meningeal afferents, Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 channels efficiently participate in spike generation induced by ATP and 5-HT supported by Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.6 channels. Of the various FHM3 mutations tested, the L263V missense mutation, with a longer activation state and lower activation voltage, resulted in the most pronounced spiking activity. In contrast, mutations that result in a loss of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.1 function largely reduced firing of trigeminal nerve fibers. The combined activation of P2X3 and 5-HT3 receptors and branching of nerve fibers resulted in very prolonged and high-frequency spiking activity in the mutants compared to WT. We identified, in silico, key determinants of long-lasting nociceptive activity in FHM3-mutated Aδ-fibers that naturally express P2X3 and 5-HT3 receptors and suggest mutant-specific correction options. Modeled trigeminal nerve firing was significantly higher for FHM3 mutations, compared to WT, suggesting that pronounced nociceptive signaling may contribute to migraine pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Towards a Bio-Inspired Real-Time Neuromorphic Cerebellum</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This work presents the first simulation of a large-scale, bio-physically constrained cerebellum model performed on neuromorphic hardware. A model containing 97,000 neurons and 4.2 million synapses is simulated on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic system. Results are validated against a baseline simulation of the same model executed with NEST, a popular spiking neural network simulator using generic computational resources and double precision floating point arithmetic. Individual cell and network-level spiking activity is validated in terms of average spike rates, relative lead or lag of spike times, and membrane potential dynamics of individual neurons, and SpiNNaker is shown to produce results in agreement with NEST. Once validated, the model is used to investigate how to accelerate the simulation speed of the network on the SpiNNaker system, with the future goal of creating a real-time neuromorphic cerebellum. Through detailed communication profiling, peak network activity is identified as one of the main challenges for simulation speed-up. Propagation of spiking activity through the network is measured, and will inform the future development of accelerated execution strategies for cerebellum models on neuromorphic hardware. The large ratio of granule cells to other cell types in the model results in high levels of activity converging onto few cells, with those cells having relatively larger time costs associated with the processing of communication. Organizing cells on SpiNNaker in accordance with their spatial position is shown to reduce the peak communication load by 41%. It is hoped that these insights, together with alternative parallelization strategies, will pave the way for real-time execution of large-scale, bio-physically constrained cerebellum models on SpiNNaker. This in turn will enable exploration of cerebellum-inspired controllers for neurorobotic applications, and execution of extended duration simulations over timescales that would currently be prohibitive using conventional computational platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Developmental Differences in Neocortex Neurogenesis and Maturation Between the Altricial Dwarf Rabbit and Precocial Guinea Pig</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mammals are born on a precocial–altricial continuum. Altricial species produce helpless neonates with closed distant organs incapable of locomotion, whereas precocial species give birth to well-developed young that possess sophisticated sensory and locomotor capabilities. Previous studies suggest that distinct patterns of cortex development differ between precocial and altricial species. This study compares patterns of neocortex neurogenesis and maturation in the precocial guinea pig and altricial dwarf rabbit, both belonging to the taxon of Glires. We show that the principal order of neurodevelopmental events is preserved in the neocortex of both species. Moreover, we show that neurogenesis starts at a later postconceptional day and takes longer in absolute gestational days in the precocial than the altricial neocortex. Intriguingly, our data indicate that the dwarf rabbit neocortex contains a higher abundance of highly proliferative basal progenitors than the guinea pig, which might underlie its higher encephalization quotient, demonstrating that the amount of neuron production is determined by complex regulation of multiple factors. Furthermore, we show that the guinea pig neocortex exhibits a higher maturation status at birth, thus providing evidence for the notions that precocial species might have acquired the morphological machinery required to attain their high functional state at birth and that brain expansion in the precocial newborn is mainly due to prenatally initiating processes of gliogenesis and neuron differentiation instead of increased neurogenesis. Together, this study reveals important insights into the timing and cellular differences that regulate mammalian brain growth and maturation and provides a better understanding of the evolution of mammalian altriciality and presociality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Three-Dimensional Structure of Dendritic Spines Revealed by Volume Electron Microscopy Techniques</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electron microscopy (EM)-based synaptology is a fundamental discipline for achieving a complex wiring diagram of the brain. A quantitative understanding of synaptic ultrastructure also serves as a basis to estimate the relative magnitude of synaptic transmission across individual circuits in the brain. Although conventional light microscopic techniques have substantially contributed to our ever-increasing understanding of the morphological characteristics of the putative synaptic junctions, EM is the gold standard for systematic visualization of the synaptic morphology. Furthermore, a complete three-dimensional reconstruction of an individual synaptic profile is required for the precise quantitation of different parameters that shape synaptic transmission. While volumetric imaging of synapses can be routinely obtained from the transmission EM (TEM) imaging of ultrathin sections, it requires an unimaginable amount of effort and time to reconstruct very long segments of dendrites and their spines from the serial section TEM images. The challenges of low throughput EM imaging have been addressed to an appreciable degree by the development of automated EM imaging tools that allow imaging and reconstruction of dendritic segments in a realistic time frame. Here, we review studies that have been instrumental in determining the three-dimensional ultrastructure of synapses. With a particular focus on dendritic spine synapses in the rodent brain, we discuss various key studies that have highlighted the structural diversity of spines, the principles of their organization in the dendrites, their presynaptic wiring patterns, and their activity-dependent structural remodeling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Different Modulatory Effects of Cognitive Training and Aerobic Exercise on Resting State Functional Connectivity of Entorhinal Cortex in Community-Dwelling Older Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The entorhinal cortex (EC) plays an essential role in age-related cognitive decline. However, the effect of functional connectivity (FC) changes between EC and other cerebral cortices on cognitive function remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the modulation of two interventions (cognitive training and aerobic exercise) on EC-FC in community-dwelling older adults. In total, 94 healthy older adults aged between 65 and 75 years were assigned to either the cognitive training or aerobic exercise group to receive 24 sessions over 12 weeks, or to a control group. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed at both baseline and 12-month follow-up. Compared to the cognitive training group, the aerobic exercise group showed greater EC-FC in the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, right supramarginal gyrus, left angular gyrus, and right postcentral gyrus. Compared to the control group, the cognitive training group had a decreased EC-FC in the right hippocampus, right middle temporal gyrus, left angular gyrus, and right postcentral gyrus and an increased EC-FC in the bilateral pallidum, while the aerobic exercise group showed increased EC-FC between the right medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC), bilateral pallidum, and right precuneus. Baseline EC-FC in the mPFC was positively correlated with the visuospatial/constructional index score of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. In the cognitive training group, EC-FC value changes in the right hippocampus were negatively correlated with changes in the RBANS delayed memory index score, while in the aerobic exercise group, EC-FC value changes in the left angular gyrus were positively correlated with changes in the RBANS attention index score. These findings support the hypothesis that both cognitive training and aerobic exercise can modulate EC-FC in aging populations but through different neural pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cortical Structural Connectivity Alterations and Potential Pathogenesis in Mid-Stage Sporadic Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.650371</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many clinical symptoms of sporadic Parkinson’s disease (sPD) cannot be completely explained by a lesion of the simple typical extrapyramidal circuit between the striatum and substantia nigra. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the new potential damaged pathogenesis of other brain regions associated with the multiple and complex clinical symptoms of sPD through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A total of 65 patients with mid-stage sPD and 35 healthy controls were recruited in this study. Cortical structural connectivity was assessed by seed-based analysis using the vertex-based morphology of MRI. Seven different clusters in the brain regions of cortical thickness thinning derived from the regression analysis using brain size as covariates between sPD and control were selected as seeds. Results showed that the significant alteration of cortical structural connectivity mainly occurred in the bilateral frontal orbital, opercular, triangular, precentral, rectus, supplementary-motor, temporal pole, angular, Heschl, parietal, supramarginal, postcentral, precuneus, occipital, lingual, cuneus, Rolandic-opercular, cingulum, parahippocampal, calcarine, olfactory, insula, paracentral-lobule, and fusiform regions at the mid-stage of sPD. These findings suggested that the extensive alteration of cortical structural connectivity is one of possible pathogenesis resulting in the multiple and complex clinical symptoms in sPD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Association Between Postoperative Long-Term Heart Rate Variability and Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients Undergoing Orthopedic Surgery: A Prospective Cohort Study</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication after orthopedic surgery in elderly patients. The elderly may experience drastic changes in autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity and circadian rhythm disorders after surgery. Therefore, we intend to explore the relationship between postoperative long-term heart rate (HR) variability (HRV), as a measure of ANS activity and circadian rhythm, and occurrence of POD in elderly patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The study population of this cohort was elderly patients over 60 years of age who scheduled for orthopedic surgery under spinal anesthesia. Patients were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria before surgery. Then, participants were invited to wear a Holter monitor on the first postoperative day to collect 24-h electrocardiographic (ECG) data. Parameters in the time domain [the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal (NN) intervals (SDNN), mean of the standard deviations of all the NN intervals for each 5-min segment of a 24-h HRV recording (SDNNI), and the root mean square of successive differences of the NN intervals (RMSSD)] and frequency domain [heart rate (HR), high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF), very low frequency (VLF), ultra low frequency (ULF), and total power (TP)] were calculated. Assessment of delirium was performed daily up to the seventh postoperative day using the Chinese version of the 3-Min Diagnostic Interview for CAM-defined Delirium (3D-CAM). The relationship between HRV and POD, as well as the association between HRV and duration of POD, was assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Of the 294 cases that finally completed the follow-up, 60 cases developed POD. Among the HRV parameters, SDNNI, VLF, and ULF were related to the occurrence of POD. After adjustment for potential confounders, the correlation between HRV indices and POD disappeared. Through stratified analysis, two significant negative correlations emerged: ULF in young-old participants and SDNNI, VLF, and ULF in male patients.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The lower HRV parameters may be related to the occurrence of POD, and this correlation is more significant in young-old and male patients. ANS disorders and rhythm abnormalities reflected by HRV changes may represent a possible mechanism that promotes POD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: A common genetic variant in fatty acid amide hydrolase is linked to alterations in fear extinction neural circuitry in a racially diverse, nonclinical sample of adults</title>

	<description>Genetic variation in a key neuromodulatory enzyme of the endocannabinoid system is linked to alterations in fear extinction neural circuitry. Variation in this system may help identify individuals who are at risk of developing a trauma‐related disorder or may benefit from exposure‐based therapies.

Abstract
Poor fear extinction learning and recall are linked to the development of fear‐based disorders, like posttraumatic stress disorder, and are associated with aberrant activation of fear‐related neural circuitry. This includes greater amygdala activation during extinction learning and lesser hippocampal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation during recall. Emerging data indicate that genetic variation in fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH C385A; rs324420) is associated with increased peripheral endocannabinoid (eCB) levels and lesser threat‐related amygdala reactivity. Preclinical studies link increased eCB signaling to better extinction learning and recall, thus FAAH C385A may protect against the development of trauma‐related psychopathology by facilitating extinction learning. However, how this FAAH variant affects fear extinction neural circuitry remains unknown. In the present study, we used a novel, immersive‐reality fear extinction paradigm paired with functional neuroimaging to assess FAAH C385A effects on fear‐related neural circuitry and conditioned fear responding (US expectancy ratings, subjective units of distress, and skin conductance responding) in healthy adults from an urban area (Detroit, MI; N = 59; C/C = 35, A‐carrier = 24). We found lesser amygdala activation in A‐allele carriers, compared to C/C homozygotes, during early extinction recall. Likewise, we found lesser dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and greater hippocampus activation in early extinction learning in A‐carriers compared to C/C homozygotes. We found no effects of FAAH C385A on vmPFC activation or behavioral fear indices. These data support and extend previous findings that FAAH genetic variation, associated with increased eCB signaling and subsequent enhanced fear extinction, may predict individual differences in successful fear learning.</description>

	<description>Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) sense glutamate released at synapses via direct synaptic contacts and through volume transmission, which regulates the OPC stem cell like property of self‐renewal. In this study, we show that blocking synaptic transmission using botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) significantly decreased OPC numbers and resulted in cellular atrophy in vivo in the adult mouse hippocampus. Adult OPCs are responsible for life‐long generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes and dysregulation of OPC function would potentially decrease their capacity for repair in pathological scenarios characterized by decreased synaptic activity, such as Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.
​

Abstract
Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are responsible for generating oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS. Life‐long myelination is promoted by neuronal activity and is essential for neural network plasticity and learning. OPCs are known to contact synapses and it is proposed that neuronal synaptic activity in turn regulates their behavior. To examine this in the adult, we performed unilateral injection of the synaptic blocker botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) into the hippocampus of adult mice. We confirm BoNT/A cleaves SNAP‐25 in the CA1 are of the hippocampus, which has been proven to block neurotransmission. Notably, BoNT/A significantly decreased OPC density and caused their shrinkage, as determined by immunolabeling for the OPC marker NG2. Furthermore, BoNT/A resulted in an overall decrease in the number of OPC processes, as well as a decrease in their lengths and branching frequency. These data indicate that synaptic activity is important for maintaining adult OPC numbers and cellular integrity, which is relevant to pathophysiological scenarios characterized by dysregulation of synaptic activity, such as age‐related cognitive decline, Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.</description>

	<description>Memory formation requires initiation of new protein synthesis as well as protein synthesis in dendrites, but it is unknown whether initiation can happen within dendritic spines. We combined immunolabeling with serial section 3D electron microscopy to examine the distribution of three initiation factors, eIF4E, eIF4G1, and eIF2α in dendritic spines of the lateral amygdala during formation of a Pavlovian conditioning memory. Top row: Electron micrographs showing labeled spines (arrows) with synapses (arrowheads). Bottom left: Segment of dendrite reconstructed from serial sections with synapses shown in red. Bottom right: The percentage of spines containing labeling for eIF4E was higher after training, but there were no differences for eIF4G1 or eIF2α labeling.







Abstract
Local translation can provide a rapid, spatially targeted supply of new proteins in distal dendrites to support synaptic changes that underlie learning. Learning and memory are especially sensitive to manipulations of translational control mechanisms, particularly those that target the initiation step, and translation initiation at synapses could be a means of maintaining synapse specificity during plasticity. Initiation predominantly occurs via recruitment of ribosomes to the 5′ mRNA cap by complexes of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), and the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G1 is a particularly important target of translational control pathways. Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E–eIF4G1 binding impairs formation of memory for aversive Pavlovian conditioning as well as the accompanying increase in polyribosomes in the heads of dendritic spines in the lateral amygdala (LA). This is consistent with a role for initiation at synapses in memory formation, but whether eIFs are even present near synapses is unknown. To determine whether dendritic spines contain eIFs and whether eIF distribution is affected by learning, we combined immunolabeling with serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) volume reconstructions of LA dendrites after Pavlovian conditioning. Labeling for eIF4E, eIF4G1, and eIF2α—another key target of regulation—occurred in roughly half of dendritic spines, but learning effects were only found for eIF4E, which was upregulated in the heads of dendritic spines. Our results support the possibility of regulated translation initiation as a means of synapse‐specific protein targeting during learning and are consistent with the model of eIF4E availability as a central point of control.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Synaptic inputs to broad thorny ganglion cells in macaque retina</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25156</guid>

	<description>These are the identified wide‐field and medium‐field amacrine cells that made synapses onto a broad thorny ganglion cell (purple) in central macaque retina. The wide field amacrine cells included three wiry amacrine cells (green), a semilunar cell (aqua), and a stellate wavy cell (yellow). The medium‐field cells included a starburst amacrine cell (red) and a spiny amacrine cell (orange). These amacrine cell inputs are expected to mediate the responses of the broad thorny ganglion cells to stimuli outside their classical receptive fields.







Abstract
In primates, broad thorny retinal ganglion cells are highly sensitive to small, moving stimuli. They have tortuous, fine dendrites with many short, spine‐like branches that occupy three contiguous strata in the middle of the inner plexiform layer. The neural circuits that generate their responses to moving stimuli are not well‐understood, and that was the goal of this study. A connectome from central macaque retina was generated by serial block‐face scanning electron microscopy, a broad thorny cell was reconstructed, and its synaptic inputs were analyzed. It received fewer than 2% of its inputs from both ON and OFF types of bipolar cells; the vast majority of its inputs were from amacrine cells. The presynaptic amacrine cells were reconstructed, and seven types were identified based on their characteristic morphology. Two types of narrow‐field cells, knotty bistratified Type 1 and wavy multistratified Type 2, were identified. Two types of medium‐field amacrine cells, ON starburst and spiny, were also presynaptic to the broad thorny cell. Three types of wide‐field amacrine cells, wiry Type 2, stellate wavy, and semilunar Type 2, also made synapses onto the broad thorny cell. Physiological experiments using a macaque retinal preparation in vitro confirmed that broad thorny cells received robust excitatory input from both the ON and the OFF pathways. Given the paucity of bipolar cell inputs, it is likely that amacrine cells provided much of the excitatory input, in addition to inhibitory input.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: CX3CR1 mutation alters synaptic and astrocytic protein expression, topographic gradients, and response latencies in the auditory brainstem</title>

	<description>Mice lacking the microglial receptor CX3CR1 display several phenotypes in the auditory brainstem. They have normal pruning in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and increased expression of mature astrocyte markers. They have normal auditory brainstem recording (ABR) thresholds, but the ABR latencies are decreased. They show increased expression of inhibitory presynaptic terminal markers, possibly reflecting impaired inhibitory pruning. Finally, CX3CR1−/− mice lack the tonotopic gradients seen for cell body size and calyx of Held size in the MNTB.







Abstract
The precise and specialized circuitry in the auditory brainstem develops through adaptations of cellular and molecular signaling. We previously showed that elimination of microglia during development impairs synaptic pruning that leads to maturation of the calyx of Held, a large encapsulating synapse that terminates on neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Microglia depletion also led to a decrease in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for mature astrocytes. Here, we investigated the role of signaling through the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1), which is expressed by microglia and mediates communication with neurons. CX3CR1−/− and wild‐type mice were studied before and after hearing onset and at 9 weeks of age. Levels of GFAP were significantly increased in the MNTB in mutants at 9 weeks. Pruning was unaffected at the calyx of Held, but we found an increase in expression of glycinergic synaptic marker in mutant mice at P14, suggesting an effect on maturation of inhibitory inputs. We observed disrupted tonotopic gradients of neuron and calyx size in MNTB in mutant mice. Auditory brainstem recording (ABR) revealed that CX3CR1−/− mice had normal thresholds and amplitudes but decreased latencies and interpeak latencies, particularly for the highest frequencies. These results demonstrate that disruption of fractalkine signaling has a significant effect on auditory brainstem development. Our findings highlight the importance of neuron–microglia–astrocyte communication in pruning of inhibitory synapses and establishment of tonotopic gradients early in postnatal development.</description>

	<description>Using monosynaptic rabies virus tracing, we have identified the distribution of input cells to basolateral amygdala (BLA) neuronal subtypes defined by axonal projection patterns. Overall, central nucleus of amygdala‐, nucleus accumbens‐, ventral hippocampus‐projecting BLA neurons receive similar monosynaptic input from various brain regions. However, there are some preferential input patterns among the subtypes, which are likely to be attributed to the differential localization of the starter cells.







Abstract
The basolateral amygdala (BLA), a region critical for emotional processing, is the limbic hub that is connected with various brain regions. BLA neurons are classified into different subtypes that exhibit differential projection patterns and mediate distinct emotional behaviors; however, little is known about their presynaptic input patterns. In this study, we employed projection‐specific monosynaptic rabies virus tracing to identify the direct monosynaptic inputs to BLA subtypes. We found that each neuronal subtype receives long‐range projection input from specific brain regions. In contrast to their specific axonal projection patterns, all BLA neuronal subtypes exhibited relatively similar input patterns. This anatomical organization supports the idea that the BLA is a central integrator that associates sensory information in different modalities with valence and sends associative information to behaviorally relevant brain regions.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Somatosensory innervation of healthy human oral tissues</title>

	<description>Mechanosensory neurons in the human tongue and hard palate were identified using immunohistochemical methods. In fungiform taste papillae, Meissner‐like corpuscles were found within the lamina propria and putative mechanosensory neurons were identified that surround taste buds. In filiform non‐taste papillae, end bulbs of Krause were the predominant sensory ending. Novel sensory endings were also identified, including subepithelial neuronal densities and the endings of myelinated neurons that innervate the epithelium. In the hard‐palate mucosa, Meissner corpuscles and glomerular endings were identified in the lamina propria, and Merkel‐cell neurite complexes were identified in epithelia. This rich cadre of neuronal endings is poised to mediate mechanosensory control of feeding and speech.







Abstract
The oral somatosensory system relays essential information about mechanical stimuli to enable oral functions such as feeding and speech. The neurochemical and anatomical diversity of sensory neurons across oral cavity sites have not been systematically compared. To address this gap, we analyzed healthy human tongue and hard‐palate innervation. Biopsies were collected from 12 volunteers and underwent fluorescent immunohistochemistry (≥2 specimens per marker/structure). Afferents were analyzed for markers of neurons (βIII tubulin), myelinated afferents (neurofilament heavy, NFH), and Merkel cells and taste cells (keratin 20, K20). Hard‐palate innervation included Meissner corpuscles, glomerular endings, Merkel cell‐neurite complexes, and free nerve endings. The organization of these somatosensory endings is reminiscent of fingertips, suggesting that the hard palate is equipped with a rich repertoire of sensory neurons for pressure sensing and spatial localization of mechanical inputs, which are essential for speech production and feeding. Likewise, the tongue is innervated by afferents that impart it with exquisite acuity and detection of moving stimuli that support flavor construction and speech. Filiform papillae contained end bulbs of Krause, as well as endings that have not been previously reported, including subepithelial neuronal densities, and NFH+ neurons innervating basal epithelia. Fungiform papillae had Meissner corpuscles and densities of NFH+ intraepithelial neurons surrounding taste buds. The differing compositions of sensory endings within filiform and fungiform papillae suggest that these structures have distinct roles in mechanosensation. Collectively, this study has identified previously undescribed neuronal endings in human oral tissues and provides an anatomical framework for understanding oral mechanosensory functions.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The Lbx1 lineage differentially contributes to inhibitory cell types of the dorsal cochlear nucleus, a cerebellum‐like structure, and the cerebellum</title>

	<description>Pancreatic transcription factor 1a (Ptf1a) expressing serial sister cell types of the mammalian cerebellum and dorsal cochlear nucleus are supposed to share genetic programs. We show that two out of three Ptf1a lineal cell types differ with respect to their Ladybird homeobox protein homolog 1 expression. Our results uncover an unexpected genetic incongruence.







Abstract
The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) is a mammalian‐specific nucleus of the auditory system. Anatomically, it is classified as a cerebellum‐like structure. These structures are proposed to share genetic programs with the cerebellum. Previous analyses demonstrated that inhibitory serial sister cell types (SCTs) of the DCN and cerebellum are derived from the pancreatic transcription factor 1a (Ptf1a) lineage. Postmitotic neurons of the Ptf1a lineage often express the transcription factor Ladybird homeobox protein homolog 1 (Lbx1) which is involved in neuronal cell fate determination. Lbx1 is therefore an attractive candidate for a further component of the genetic program shared between the DCN and cerebellum. Here, we used cell‐type specific marker analysis in combination with an Lbx1 reporter mouse line to analyze in both tissues which cell types of the Ptf1a lineage express Lbx1. In the DCN, stellate cells and Purkinje‐like cartwheel cells were part of the Lbx1 lineage and Golgi cells were not, as determined by cell counts. In contrast, in the cerebellum, stellate cells and Golgi cells were part of the Lbx1 lineage and Purkinje cells were not. Hence, two out of three phenotypically similar cell types differed with respect to their Lbx1 expression. Our study demonstrates that Lbx1 is differentially recruited to the developmental genetic program of inhibitory neurons both within a given tissue and between the DCN and cerebellum. The differential expression of Lbx1 within the DCN and the cerebellum might contribute to the genetic individuation of the inhibitory SCTs to adapt to circuit specific tasks.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Disrupted eye and head development in rainbow trout with reduced ultraviolet (sws1) opsin expression</title>

	<description>Retinal photoreceptors express visual opsins that capture light to begin the process of phototransduction. The consequences of opsin disruption on retinal development are poorly understood. Here, the ultraviolet (short‐wavelength sensitive 1, sws1) opsin of rainbow trout was partially knocked out using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing system. Knockouts showed a disrupted outer retina consisting of diminished opsin expression, absent or stunted outer segments, photoreceptor degeneration, and loss of mosaic regularity. These findings indicate developmental roles of visual opsins beyond phototransduction.







Abstract
Visual opsins are proteins expressed by retinal photoreceptors that capture light to begin the process of phototransduction. In vertebrates, the two types of photoreceptors (rods and cones) express one or multiple opsins and are distributed in variable patterns across the retina. Some cones form opsin retinal gradients, as in the mouse, whereas others form more demarcated opsin domains, as in the lattice‐like mosaic retinas of teleost fishes. Reduced rod opsin (rh1) expression in mouse, zebrafish, and African clawed frog results in lack of photoreceptor outer segments (i.e., the cilium that houses the opsins) and, in the case of the mouse, to retinal degeneration. The effects of diminished cone opsin expression have only been studied in the mouse where knockout of the short‐wavelength sensitive 1 (sws1) opsin leads to ventral retinal cones lacking outer segments, but no retinal degeneration. Here we show that, following CRISPR/Cas9 injections that targeted knockout of the sws1 opsin in rainbow trout, fish with diminished sws1 opsin expression exhibited a variety of developmental defects including head and eye malformations, underdeveloped outer retina, mislocalized opsin expression, cone degeneration, and mosaic irregularity. All photoreceptor types were affected even though sws1 is only expressed in the single cones of wild fish. Our results reveal unprecedented developmental defects associated with diminished cone opsin expression and suggest that visual opsin genes are involved in regulatory processes that precede photoreceptor differentiation.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Projections from the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus to the cochlea in the mouse</title>

	<description>Using neuronal tract tracing and immunohistochemical methods, we have identified a previously unreported group of auditory efferent neurons located in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus that project unmyelinated axons to the inner hair cell region in mouse. These “dorsal efferents” were then anatomically characterized using a combination of light, fluorescent and electron microscopy, and their possible functional significance within the context of the known olivocochlear efferents is discussed.







Abstract
Auditory efferents originate in the central auditory system and project to the cochlea. Although the specific anatomy of the olivocochlear (OC) efferents can vary between species, two types of auditory efferents have been identified based upon the general location of their cell bodies and their distinctly different axon terminations in the organ of Corti. In the mouse, the relatively small somata of the lateral (LOC) efferents reside in the lateral superior olive (LSO), have unmyelinated axons, and terminate around ipsilateral inner hair cells (IHCs), primarily against the afferent processes of type I auditory nerve fibers. In contrast, the larger somata of the medial (MOC) efferents are distributed in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB), have myelinated axons, and terminate bilaterally against the base of multiple outer hair cells (OHCs). Using in vivo retrograde cell body marking, anterograde axon tracing, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy, we have identified a group of efferent neurons in mouse, whose cell bodies reside in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL). By virtue of their location, we call them dorsal efferent (DE) neurons. Labeled DE cells were immuno‐negative for tyrosine hydroxylase, glycine, and GABA, but immuno‐positive for choline acetyltransferase. Morphologically, DEs resembled LOC efferents by their small somata, unmyelinated axons, and ipsilateral projection to IHCs. These three classes of efferent neurons all project axons directly to the cochlea and exhibit cholinergic staining characteristics. The challenge is to discover the contributions of this new population of neurons to auditory efferent function.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The mouth matters most: A functional magnetic resonance imaging study of how dogs perceive inanimate objects</title>

	<description>Prichard et al. examined dogs' perception of real‐world objects using awake, unrestrained fMRI. Using the same video stimuli and real‐world objects, they identified object‐selective regions of the dog brain. Object regions of the dog brain responded more to objects associated with a mouth action than objects associated with a paw action. Somatosensory cortex was active during dogs' anticipation of performing a mouth action on an object. This suggests that dogs' perception of objects depends on how dogs expect to interact with them.







Abstract
The perception and representation of objects in the world are foundational to all animals. The relative importance of objects' physical properties versus how the objects are interacted with continues to be debated. Neural evidence in humans and nonhuman primates suggests animate‐inanimate and face‐body dimensions of objects are represented in the temporal cortex. However, because primates have opposable thumbs and interact with objects in similar ways, the question remains as to whether this similarity represents the evolution of a common cognitive process or whether it reflects a similarity of physical interaction. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in dogs to test whether the type of interaction affects object processing in an animal that interacts primarily with its mouth. In Study 1, we identified object‐processing regions of cortex by having dogs passively view movies of faces and objects. In Study 2, dogs were trained to interact with two new objects with either the mouth or the paw. Then, we measured responsivity in the object regions to the presentation of these objects. Mouth‐objects elicited significantly greater activity in object regions than paw‐objects. Mouth‐objects were also associated with activity in somatosensory cortex, suggesting dogs were anticipating mouthing interactions. These findings suggest that object perception in dogs is affected by how dogs expect to interact with familiar objects.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Neurogenesis and the development of neural sex differences in vocal control regions of songbirds</title>

	<description>We labeled markers of cell division (PCNA), cell migration (DCX), and neuronal maturation (NeuN) in vocal control brain regions of male and female zebra finch brains at four different stages of song learning. Sex differences in the size of these regions emerged by the onset of song learning, and the rate of neurogenic processes varied across brain regions in a sex‐ and region‐specific manner.







Abstract
The brain regions that control the learning and production of song and other learned vocalizations in songbirds exhibit some of the largest sex differences in the brain known in vertebrates and are associated with sex differences in singing behavior. Song learning takes place through multiple stages: an early sensory phase when song models are memorized, followed by a sensorimotor phase in which auditory feedback is used to modify song output through subsong, plastic song, to adult crystalized song. However, how patterns of neurogenesis in these brain regions change through these learning stages, and differ between the sexes, is little explored. We collected brains from 63 young male and female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) over four stages of song learning. Using neurogenesis markers for cell division (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), neuron migration (doublecortin), and mature neurons (neuron‐specific nuclear protein), we demonstrate that there are sex‐specific changes in neurogenesis over song development that differ between the caudal motor pathway and anterior forebrain pathway of the vocal control circuit. In many of these regions, sex differences emerged very early in development, by 25 days post hatch, at the beginning of song learning. The emergence of sex differences in other components of the system was more gradual and had specific trajectories depending on the brain region and its function. In conclusion, we found that sex differences occurred early and continued during song learning. Moreover, transitions from the different phases of song development do not seem to depend on large changes in neurogenesis in the vocal control areas measured.</description>

	<description>By means of serial block‐face electron microscopy, Wang et al. revealed subcellular structural bases for row‐specific cytoarchitecture and innervation pattern in mouse cochlear amplifier.







Abstract
In mammalian cochlea, sound‐induced vibration is amplified by a three‐row lattice of Y‐shaped microstructures consisting of electromotile outer hair cell and supporting Deiters cell. This highly organized structure is thought to be essential for hearing of low‐level sounds. Prior studies reported differences in geometry and synaptic innervation of the outer hair cells between rows, but how these fine features are achieved at subcellular level still remains unclear. Using serial block‐face electron microscopy, we acquired few‐hundred‐micron‐sized cytoarchitecture of mouse organ of Corti at nanometer resolution. Structural quantifications were performed on the Y‐shapes as well as afferent and efferent projections to outer hair cells (OHCs). Several new features, which support the previously observed inter‐row heterogeneity, are described. Our result provides structural bases for the gradient of mechanical properties and diverse centrifugal regulation of OHC rows.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Efferent projections of CGRP/Calca‐expressing parabrachial neurons in mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25136</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25136?af=R</link>
	<description>Abstract
The parabrachial nucleus (PB) is composed of glutamatergic neurons at the midbrain–hindbrain junction. These neurons form many subpopulations, one of which expresses Calca, which encodes the neuropeptide calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP). This Calca‐expressing subpopulation has been implicated in a variety of homeostatic functions, but the overall distribution of Calca‐expressing neurons in this region remains unclear. Also, while previous studies in rats and mice have identified output projections from CGRP‐immunoreactive or Calca‐expressing neurons, we lack a comprehensive understanding of their efferent projections. We began by identifying neurons with Calca mRNA and CGRP immunoreactivity in and around the PB, including populations in the locus coeruleus and motor trigeminal nucleus. Calca‐expressing neurons in the PB prominently express the mu opioid receptor (Oprm1) and are distinct from neighboring neurons that express Foxp2 and Pdyn. Next, we used Cre‐dependent anterograde tracing with synaptophysin‐mCherry to map the efferent projections of these neurons. Calca‐expressing PB neurons heavily target subregions of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, basal forebrain, thalamic intralaminar and ventral posterior parvicellular nuclei, and hindbrain, in different patterns depending on the injection site location within the PB region. Retrograde axonal tracing revealed that the previously unreported hindbrain projections arise from a rostral‐ventral subset of CGRP/Calca neurons. Finally, we show that these efferent projections of Calca‐expressing neurons are distinct from those of neighboring PB neurons that express Pdyn. This information provides a detailed neuroanatomical framework for interpreting experimental work involving CGRP/Calca‐expressing neurons and opioid action in the PB region.</description>

	<description>In normal rats, ocular dominance columns (ODCs) overlap with callosal patches in V1. ODCs (a) and callosal patches (c) are present by postnatal day 10 (P10). In rats monocularly enucleated (ME) at P10 and perfused before the onset of the critical period (~P20), ODCs desegregate in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the remaining eye (b), whereas callosal patches do not desegregate in this hemisphere (d).







Abstract
In Long Evans rats, ocular dominance columns (ODCs) in V1 overlap with patches of callosal connections. Using anatomical tracers, we found that ODCs and callosal patches are present at postnatal day 10 (P10), several days before eye opening, and about 10 days before the activation of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity (~P20). In rats monocularly enucleated at P10 and perfused ~P20, ODCs ipsilateral to the remaining eye desegregated, indicating that rat ODCs are highly susceptible to monocular enucleation during a precritical period. Monocular enucleation during the critical period exerted significant, although smaller, effects. Monocular eye lid suture during the critical period led to a significant expansion of the ipsilateral projection from the nondeprived eye, whereas the contralateral projection invaded into, and intermixed with, ipsilateral ODCs innervated by the deprived eye. We propose that this intermixing allows callosal connections to contribute to the effects of monocular deprivation assessed in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the nondeprived eye. The ipsilateral and contralateral projections from the deprived eye did not undergo significant shrinkage. In contrast, we found that callosal patches are less susceptible to imbalance of eye input. In rats monocularly enucleated during either the precritical or critical periods, callosal patches were maintained in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the remaining eye, but desegregated in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the enucleated orbit. Callosal patches were maintained in rats binocularly enucleated at P10 or later. Similarly, monocular deprivation during the critical period had no significant effect on callosal patches in either hemisphere.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Neuropeptide expression in the box jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora—New insights into the complexity of a “simple” nervous system</title>

	<description>Custom made antibodies against four putative neuropeptides where used on whole mounts of the box jellyfish, Tripedalia cystophora, and revealed new details of the neuroanatomy in both the rhopalium and in the bell. These neuropeptides are most likely neurotransmitters in most stained neurons but might also be involved in neuronal development.







Abstract
Box jellyfish have an elaborate visual system and perform advanced visually guided behaviors. However, the rhopalial nervous system (RNS), believed to be the main visual processing center, only has 1000 neurons in each of the four eye carrying rhopalia. We have examined the detailed structure of the RNS of the box jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora, using immunolabeling with antibodies raised against four putative neuropeptides (T. cystophora RFamide, VWamide, RAamide, and FRamide). In the RNS, T. cystophora RF‐, VW‐, and RAamide antibodies stain sensory neurons, the pit eyes, the neuropil, and peptide‐specific subpopulations of stalk‐associated neurons and giant neurons. Furthermore, RFamide ir+ neurites are seen in the epidermal stalk nerve, whereas VWamide antibodies stain the gastrodermal stalk nerve. RFamide has the most widespread expression including in the ring and radial nerves, the pedalium nerve plexus, and the tentacular nerve net. RAamide is the putative neurotransmitter in the motor neurons of the subumbrellar nerve net, and VWamide is a potential marker for neuronal differentiation as it is found in subpopulations of undifferentiated cells both in the rhopalia and in the bell. The results from the FRamide antibodies were not included as only few cells were stained, and in an unreproducible way. Our studies show hitherto‐unseen details of the nervous system of T. cystophora and allowed us to identify specific functional groups of neurons. This identification is important for understanding visual processing in the RNS and enables experimental work, directly addressing the role of the different neuropeptides in vision.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Macaque monkey trigeminal blink reflex circuits targeting orbicularis oculi motoneurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25130</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25130?af=R</link>
	<description>The blink reflex is critical for protecting the eyes and spreading the tear film, and is a commonly used for learning model. We demonstrate monosynaptic trigeminal (shown here) and disynaptic reticular formation pathways connecting the principal and the spinal trigeminal nucleus (pars caudalis) with orbicularis oculi motoneurons in the macaque monkey.







Abstract
The trigeminal blink reflex plays an important role in protecting the corneal surface from damage and preserving visual function in an unpredictable environment. The closing phase of the human reflex, produced by activation of the orbicularis oculi (ObOc) muscles, consists of an initial, small, ipsilateral R1 component, followed by a larger, bilateral R2 component. We investigated the circuitry that underlies this reflex in macaque (Macaca fascicularis and Macaca mulatta) monkeys by the use of single and dual tracer methods. Injection of retrograde tracer into the facial nucleus labeled neurons in the principal trigeminal nucleus, and in the spinal nucleus pars oralis and interpolaris, bilaterally, and in pars caudalis, ipsilaterally. Injection of anterograde tracer into the principal trigeminal nucleus labeled axons that directly terminated on ObOc motoneurons, with an ipsilateral predominance. Injection of anterograde tracer into pars caudalis of the spinal trigeminal nucleus labeled axons that directly terminated on ipsilateral ObOc motoneurons. The observed pattern of labeling indicates that the reticular formation ventromedial to the principal and spinal nuclei also contributes extensive bilateral input to ObOc motoneurons. Thus, much of the trigeminal sensory complex is in a position to supply a monosynaptic drive for lid closure, and the adjacent reticular formation can supply a disynaptic drive. These findings indicate that the assignment of the R1 and R2 components of the blink reflex to different parts of the trigeminal sensory complex cannot be exclusively based on subdivision connectional relationships with facial motoneurons. The characteristics of the R2 component may be due, instead, to other circuit properties.</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Development of parvalbumin neurons and perineuronal nets in the visual cortex of normal and dark‐exposed cats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/10.1002/cne.25127</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25127?af=R</link>
	<description>At the peak of the critical period, immersion into complete darkness for 10 days significantly reduces the number of perineuronal nets (PNN) in the primary visual cortex of cats but does not alter the number of parvalbumin (PV) cells that they usually surround. Darkness also reduces the size of PV cells even if they are surrounded by a PNN, indicating that PNNs do not inhibit all forms of neural plasticity.







Abstract
During development, the visual system maintains a high capacity for modification by expressing characteristics permissive for plasticity, enabling neural circuits to be refined by visual experience to achieve their mature form. This period is followed by the emergence of characteristics that stabilize the brain to consolidate for lifetime connections that were informed by experience. Attenuation of plasticity potential is thought to derive from an accumulation of plasticity‐inhibiting characteristics that appear at ages beyond the peak of plasticity. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are molecular aggregations that primarily surround fast‐spiking inhibitory neurons called parvalbumin (PV) cells, which exhibit properties congruent with a plasticity inhibitor. In this study, we examined the development of PNNs and PV cells in the primary visual cortex of a highly visual mammal, and assessed the impact that 10 days of darkness had on both characteristics. Here, we show that labeling for PV expression emerges earlier and reaches adult levels sooner than PNNs. We also demonstrate that darkness, a condition known to enhance plasticity, significantly reduces the density of PNNs and the size of PV cell somata but does not alter the number of PV cells in the visual cortex. The darkness‐induced reduction of PV cell size occurred irrespective of whether neurons were surrounded by a PNN, suggesting that PNNs have a restricted capacity to inhibit plasticity. Finally, we show that PV cells surrounded by a PNN were significantly larger than those without one, supporting the view that PNNs may mediate trophic support to the cells they surround.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Digging behavior discrimination test to probe burrowing and exploratory digging in male and female mice</title>

	<description>Behavioral tests assaying digging can be difficult to interpret. We present a novel paradigm combining burrowing and free digging that can be used to explore digging motivation and sex‐specific deficits.
​

Abstract
Digging behavior is often used to test motor function and repetitive behaviors in mice. Different digging paradigms have been developed for behaviors related to anxiety and compulsion in mouse lines generated to recapitulate genetic mutations leading to psychiatric and neurological disorders. However, the interpretation of these tests has been confounded by the difficulty of determining the motivation behind digging in mice. Digging is a naturalistic mouse behavior that can be focused toward different goals, that is foraging for food, burrowing for shelter, burying objects, or even for recreation as has been shown for dogs, ferrets, and human children. However, the interpretation of results from current testing protocols assumes the motivation behind the behavior often concluding that increased digging is a repetitive or compulsive behavior. We asked whether providing a choice between different types of digging activities would increase sensitivity to assess digging motivation. Here, we present a test to distinguish between burrowing and exploratory digging in mice. We found that mice prefer burrowing when the option is available. When food restriction was used to promote a switch from burrowing to exploration, males readily switched from burrowing to digging outside, while females did not. In addition, when we tested a model of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder that had shown inconsistent results in the marble burying test, the Cc2d1a conditional knockout mouse, we found greatly reduced burrowing only in males. Our findings indicate that digging is a nuanced motivated behavior and suggest that male and female rodents may perform it differently.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A novel multisystem proteinopathy caused by a missense ANXA11 variant</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26136</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26136?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
Protein misfolding plays a central role not only in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but also in other conditions, such as frontemporal dementia (FTD), inclusion body myopathy (hIBM) or Paget's disease of bone. The concept of multisystem proteinopathies (MSP) was created to account for those rare families that segregate at least 2 out of these 4 conditions in the same pedigree. The calcium‐dependent phospholipid‐binding protein annexin A11 was recently associated to ALS in European pedigrees. Herein, we describe in detail 3 Brazilian families presenting hIBM (isolated or in combination with ALS/FTD) caused by the novel p.D40Y change in the gene encoding annexin A11 (ANXA11).


Methods
We collected clinical, genetic, pathological and skeletal muscle imaging from 11 affected subjects. Neuroimaging was also obtained from 8 patients and 8 matched controls.


Results
Clinico‐radiological phenotype of this novel hIBM reveals a slowly progressive predominant limb‐girdle syndrome, but with frequent axial (ptosis/dropped head) and distal (medial gastrocnemius) involvement as well. Muscle pathology identified numerous rimmed vacuoles with positive annexin A11, TDP‐43 and p62 inclusions, but no inflammation. Central nervous system was also involved: two patients had FTD, but diffusion tensor imaging uncovered multiple areas of cerebral white matter damage in the whole group (including the corticospinal tracts and frontal subcortical regions).


Interpretation
These findings expand the phenotypic spectrum related to ANXA11. This gene should be considered the cause of a novel multisystem proteinopathy (MSP type 6), rather than just ALS.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Parafacial neurons in the human brainstem express specific markers for neurons of the retrotrapezoid nucleus</title>

	<description>Relying on duplex in situ hybridization, targeting PPGAL (pre‐pro‐galanin) and SLC17A6 mRNAs, neurons of the human retrotrapezoid nucleus were identified within the parafacial region of the brainstem. NeuromedinB (NMB), suggested as being a specific marker of RTN neurons in mice by others, was not convincing in our anatomical study, but could benefit from more thorough investigations.







Abstract
The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is a hub for respiratory chemoregulation in the mammal brainstem that integrates chemosensory information from peripheral sites and central relays. Chemosensitive neurons of the RTN express specific genetic and molecular determinants, which have been used to identify RTN precise location within the brainstem of rodents and nonhuman primates. Based on a comparative approach, we hypothesized that among mammals, neurons exhibiting the same specific molecular and genetic signature would have the same function. The co‐expression of preprogalanin (PPGAL) and SLC17A6 (VGluT2) mRNAs with duplex in situ hybridization has been studied in formalin fixed paraffin‐embedded postmortem human brainstems. Two specimens were processed and analyzed in line with RTN descriptions in adult rats and macaques. Double‐labeled PPGAL+/SLC17A6+ neurons were only identified in the parafacial region of the brainstem. These neurons were found surrounding the nucleus of the facial nerve, located ventrally to the nucleus VII on caudal sections, and slightly more dorsally on rostral sections. The expression of neuromedin B (NMB) mRNA as a single marker of chemosensitive RTN neurons has not been confirmed in humans. The location of the RTN in human adults is provided. This should help to develop investigation tools combining anatomic high‐resolution imaging and respiratory functional investigations to explore the pathogenic role of the RTN in congenital or acquired neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Characterization of Extracranial Giant Cell Arteritis with Intracranial Involvement and its Rapidly Progressive Subtype</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26101</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26101?af=R</link>
	<description>Objective
The objective of this study was to characterize patients with extracranial giant cell arteritis with intracranial involvement.


Methods
In a multicenter retrospective study, we included 31 patients with systemic giant cell arteritis (GCA) with intracranial involvement. Clinical characteristics, pattern of arterial involvement, and cytokine profiles were assessed. Patients with GCA without intracranial involvement (n = 17), and with intracranial atherosclerosis (n = 25) served as controls.


Results
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated in 18 patients (69.2%) with and in 16 patients (100%) without intracranial involvement (p = 0.02). Headache was complained by 15 patients (50.0%) with and 13 patients (76.5%) without intracranial involvement (p = 0.03). Posterior circulation arteries were affected in 26 patients (83.9%), anterior circulation arteries in 17 patients (54.8%), and both territories in 12 patients (38.7%). Patients with GCA had vertebral artery stenosis proximal and, in contrast, patients with atherosclerosis distal to the origin of posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Among patients with GCA with intracranial involvement, 11 patients (37.9%) had a rapid progressive disease course characterized by short‐term recurrent ischemic events. The median modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at follow‐up in these patients was 4 (interquartile range [IQR] = 2.0–6.0) and 4 patients (36.4%) died. Vessel wall expression of IL‐6 and IL‐17 was significantly increased in patients with rapid progressive course.


Interpretation
Typical characteristics of GCA, headache, and an elevated ESR, are frequently absent in patients with intracranial involvement. However, differentiation of intracranial GCA from atherosclerosis can be facilitated by the typical pattern of vertebral artery stenosis. About one‐third of patients with intracranial GCA had a rapid progressive course with poor outcome. IL‐17 and IL‐6 may represent potential future treatment targets. ANN NEUROL 2021</description>

Understanding the function of the nervous system necessitates mapping the spatial distributions of its constituent cells defined by function, anatomy or gene expression. Recently, developments in tissue preparation and microscopy allow cellular populations to be imaged throughout the entire rodent brain. However, mapping these neurons manually is prone to bias and is often impractically time consuming. Here we present an open-source algorithm for fully automated 3D detection of neuronal somata in mouse whole-brain microscopy images using standard desktop computer hardware. We demonstrate the applicability and power of our approach by mapping the brain-wide locations of large populations of cells labeled with cytoplasmic fluorescent proteins expressed via retrograde trans-synaptic viral infection.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MAScjJ0lnL4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

RNA tertiary structure is crucial to its many non-coding molecular functions. RNA architecture is shaped by its secondary structure composed of stems, stacked canonical base pairs, enclosing loops. While stems are precisely captured by free-energy models, loops composed of non-canonical base pairs are not. Nor are distant interactions linking together those secondary structure elements (SSEs). Databases of conserved 3D geometries (a.k.a. modules) not captured by energetic models are leveraged for structure prediction and design, but the computational complexity has limited their study to local elements, loops. Representing the RNA structure as a graph has recently allowed to expend this work to pairs of SSEs, uncovering a hierarchical organization of these 3D modules, at great computational cost. Systematically capturing recurrent patterns on a large scale is a main challenge in the study of RNA structures. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to compute maximal isomorphisms in edge colored graphs. We extend this algorithm to a framework well suited to identify RNA modules, and fast enough to considerably generalize previous approaches. To exhibit the versatility of our framework, we first reproduce results identifying all common modules spanning more than 2 SSEs, in a few hours instead of weeks. The efficiency of our new algorithm is demonstrated by computing the maximal modules between any pair of entire RNA in the non-redundant corpus of known RNA 3D structures. We observe that the biggest modules our method uncovers compose large shared sub-structure spanning hundreds of nucleotides and base pairs between the ribosomes of &lt;i&gt;Thermus thermophilus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia Coli&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IT8KKikwB4Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Modification of the &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; clock gene in &lt;i&gt;mPer2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Luc&lt;/sup&gt; reporter mice significantly alters circadian function. Behavioral period in constant dark is lengthened, and dissociates into two distinct components in constant light. Rhythms exhibit increased bimodality, enhanced phase resetting to light pulses, and altered entrainment to scheduled feeding. Mechanistic mathematical modelling predicts that enhanced protein interactions with the modified mPER2 C-terminus, combined with differential clock regulation among SCN subregions, can account for effects on circadian behavior via increased &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt; transcript and protein stability. PER2::LUC produces greater suppression of CLOCK:BMAL1 E-box activity than PER2. &lt;i&gt;mPer2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Luc&lt;/sup&gt; carries a 72 bp deletion in exon 23 of &lt;i&gt;Per2&lt;/i&gt;, and retains a neomycin resistance cassette that affects rhythm amplitude but not period. The results show that &lt;i&gt;mPer2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Luc&lt;/sup&gt; acts as a circadian clock mutation illustrating a need for detailed assessment of potential impacts of c-terminal tags in genetically modified animal models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JtO_M4W_2tE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
Human brain injury elicits accumulation of water within the brain due to a variety of pathophysiological processes. As our understanding of edema emerged two temporally (and cellular) distinct processes were identified, cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. The emergence of both types of edema is reflected by the temporal evolution and is influenced by the underlying pathology (type and extent). However, this two‐edema compartment model does not adequately describe the transition between cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. Hence, a third category has been proposed, termed ionic edema, that is observed in the transition between cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. Magnetic resonance neuroimaging of edema today primarily utilizes T2‐weighted (T2WI) and diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI). Clinical diagnostics and translational science studies have clearly demonstrated the temporal ability of both T2WI and DWI to monitor edema content and evolution. DWI measures water mobility within the brain reflecting cytotoxic edema. T2WI at later time points when vasogenic edema develops visualizes increased water content in the brain. Clinically relevant imaging modalities, including ultrasound and positron emission tomography, are not typically used to assess edema. In sum, edema imaging is an important cornerstone of clinical diagnostics and translational studies and can guide effective therapeutics manage edema and improve patient outcomes.</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Nitrergic modulation of neuronal excitability in the mouse hippocampus is mediated via regulation of Kv2 and voltage‐gated sodium channels</title>

	<description>Abstract
Regulation of neuronal activity is a necessity for communication and information transmission. Many regulatory processes which have been studied provide a complex picture of how neurons can respond to permanently changing functional requirements. One such activity‐dependent mechanism involves signaling mediated by nitric oxide (NO). Within the brain, NO is generated in response to neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) activation but NO‐dependent pathways regulating neuronal excitability in the hippocampus remain to be fully elucidated. This study was set out to systematically assess the effects of NO on ion channel activities and intrinsic excitabilities of pyramidal neurons within the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus. We characterized whole‐cell potassium and sodium currents, both involved in action potential (AP) shaping and propagation and determined NO‐mediated changes in excitabilities and AP waveforms. Our data describe a novel signaling by which NO, in a cGMP‐independent manner, suppresses voltage‐gated Kv2 potassium and voltage‐gated sodium channel activities, thereby widening AP waveforms and reducing depolarization‐induced AP firing rates. Our data show that glutathione, which possesses denitrosylating activity, is sufficient to prevent the observed nitrergic effects on potassium and sodium channels, whereas inhibition of cGMP signaling is also sufficient to abolish NO modulation of sodium currents. We propose that NO suppresses both ion channel activities via redox signaling and that an additional cGMP‐mediated component is required to exert effects on sodium currents. Both mechanisms result in a dampened excitability and firing ability providing new data on nitrergic activities in the context of activity‐dependent regulation of neuronal function following nNOS activation.</description>

Then, we studied longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) differences between groups (stable and decliners) and across two multifocal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) montages (fitting “compensatory” and “maintenance” fMRI patterns related to high WM performance) applied inside the scan using a single‐blind sham‐controlled cross‐over design. Among the decliner group, the “compensatory”‐tDCS montage reduced the activity over the posterior regions where these subjects showed longitudinal hyperactivation.

Abstract
The combination of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can provide original data to investigate age‐related brain changes. We examined neural activity modulations induced by two multifocal tDCS procedures based on two distinct montages fitting two N‐back task‐based fMRI patterns (“compensatory” and “maintenance”) related to high working memory (WM) in a previous publication (Fernández‐Cabello et al. Neurobiol Aging (2016);48:23–33). We included 24 participants classified as stable or decliners according to their 4‐year WM trajectories following a retrospective longitudinal approach. Then, we studied longitudinal fMRI differences between groups (stable and decliners) and across multifocal tDCS montages (“compensatory” and “maintenance”) applied using a single‐blind sham‐controlled cross‐over design. Decliners evidenced over‐activation of non‐related WM areas after 4 years of follow‐up. Focusing on tDCS effects, among the decliner group, the “compensatory”‐tDCS montage reduced the activity over the posterior regions where these subjects showed longitudinal hyperactivation. These results reinforce the notion that tDCS effects are characterized by an activity reduction and might be more noticeable in compromised systems. Importantly, the data provide novel evidence that cognitive trajectories predict tDCS effects in older adults.</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Cleaved PINK1 induces neuronal plasticity through PKA‐mediated BDNF functional regulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/jnr.24854</guid>

	<description>In healthy mitochondria, cleaved PINK1 retro‐translocates to the cytosol, where it phosphorylates and activates protein kinase A (PKA). PKA activation results in the PKA‐mediated phosphorylation of cAMP response element‐binding protein (CREB), which subsequently relocates to the nucleus to promote the transcription of genes in CRE‐localized domains. Brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the targets of CREB‐mediated transcription. BDNF gets transcribed, translated, post‐translationally cleaved, and released into the extracellular space, where it binds to the TRKβ receptor and triggers the synaptic delivery of PSD95.

Abstract
Mutations in PTEN‐induced kinase 1 (PINK1) lead to early onset autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease in humans. In healthy neurons, full‐length PINK1 (fPINK1) is post‐translationally cleaved into different lower molecular weight forms, and cleaved PINK1 (cPINK1) gets shuttled to the cytosolic compartments to support extra‐mitochondrial functions. While numerous studies have exemplified the role of mitochondrially localized PINK1 in modulating mitophagy in oxidatively stressed neurons, little is known regarding the physiological role of cPINK1 in healthy neurons. We have previously shown that cPINK1, but not fPINK1, modulates the neurite outgrowth and the maintenance of dendritic arbors by activating downstream protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in healthy neurons. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cPINK1 promotes neurite outgrowth remain to be elucidated. In this report, we show that cPINK1 supports neuronal development by modulating the expression and extracellular release of brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Consistent with this role, we observed a progressive increase in the level of endogenous cPINK1 but not fPINK1 during prenatal and postnatal development of mouse brains and during development in primary cortical neurons. In cultured primary neurons, the pharmacological activation of endogenous PINK1 leads to enhanced downstream PKA activity, subsequent activation of the PKA‐modulated transcription factor cAMP response element‐binding protein (CREB), increased intracellular production and extracellular release of BDNF, and enhanced activation of the BDNF receptor‐TRKβ. Mechanistically, cPINK1‐mediated increased dendrite complexity requires the binding of extracellular BDNF to TRKβ. In summary, our data support a physiological role of cPINK1 in stimulating neuronal development by activating the PKA‐CREB‐BDNF signaling axis in a feedforward loop.</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: The Role of Unimodal Feedback Pathways in Gender Perception During Activation of Voice and Face Areas</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.669256</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-modal effects provide a model framework for investigating hierarchical inter-areal processing, particularly, under conditions where unimodal cortical areas receive contextual feedback from other modalities. Here, using complementary behavioral and brain imaging techniques, we investigated the functional networks participating in face and voice processing during gender perception, a high-level feature of voice and face perception. Within the framework of a signal detection decision model, Maximum likelihood conjoint measurement (MLCM) was used to estimate the contributions of the face and voice to gender comparisons between pairs of audio-visual stimuli in which the face and voice were independently modulated. Top–down contributions were varied by instructing participants to make judgments based on the gender of either the face, the voice or both modalities (N = 12 for each task). Estimated face and voice contributions to the judgments of the stimulus pairs were not independent; both contributed to all tasks, but their respective weights varied over a 40-fold range due to top–down influences. Models that best described the modal contributions required the inclusion of two different top–down interactions: (i) an interaction that depended on gender congruence across modalities (i.e., difference between face and voice modalities for each stimulus); (ii) an interaction that depended on the within modalities’ gender magnitude. The significance of these interactions was task dependent. Specifically, gender congruence interaction was significant for the face and voice tasks while the gender magnitude interaction was significant for the face and stimulus tasks. Subsequently, we used the same stimuli and related tasks in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm (N = 12) to explore the neural correlates of these perceptual processes, analyzed with Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) and Bayesian Model Selection. Results revealed changes in effective connectivity between the unimodal Fusiform Face Area (FFA) and Temporal Voice Area (TVA) in a fashion that paralleled the face and voice behavioral interactions observed in the psychophysical data. These findings explore the role in perception of multiple unimodal parallel feedback pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: An Interpretable Machine Learning Method for the Detection of Schizophrenia Using EEG Signals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.652662</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.652662</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this work we propose a machine learning (ML) method to aid in the diagnosis of schizophrenia using electroencephalograms (EEGs) as input data. The computational algorithm not only yields a proposal of diagnostic but, even more importantly, it provides additional information that admits clinical interpretation. It is based on an ML model called random forest that operates on connectivity metrics extracted from the EEG signals. Specifically, we use measures of generalized partial directed coherence (GPDC) and direct directed transfer function (dDTF) to construct the input features to the ML model. The latter allows the identification of the most performance-wise relevant features which, in turn, provide some insights about EEG signals and frequency bands that are associated with schizophrenia. Our preliminary results on real data show that signals associated with the occipital region seem to play a significant role in the diagnosis of the disease. Moreover, although every frequency band might yield useful information for the diagnosis, the beta and theta (frequency) bands provide features that are ultimately more relevant for the ML classifier that we have implemented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Targeting Endocannabinoid Signaling in the Lateral Habenula as an Intervention to Prevent Mental Illnesses Following Early Life Stress: A Perspective</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adverse events and childhood trauma increase the susceptibility towards developing psychiatric disorders (substance use disorder, anxiety, depression, etc.) in adulthood. Although there are treatment strategies that have utility in combating these psychiatric disorders, little attention is placed on how to therapeutically intervene in children exposed to early life stress (ELS) to prevent the development of later psychopathology. The lateral habenula (LHb) has been a topic of extensive investigation in mental health disorders due to its prominent role in emotion and mood regulation through modulation of brain reward and motivational neural circuits. Importantly, rodent models of ELS have been shown to promote LHb dysfunction. Moreover, one of the potential mechanisms contributing to LHb neuronal and synaptic dysfunction involves endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling, which has been observed to critically regulate emotion/mood and motivation. Many pre-clinical studies targeting eCB signaling suggest that this neuromodulatory system could be exploited as an intervention therapy to halt maladaptive processes that promote dysfunction in reward and motivational neural circuits involving the LHb. In this perspective article, we report what is currently known about the role of eCB signaling in LHb function and discuss our opinions on new research directions to determine whether the eCB system is a potentially attractive therapeutic intervention for the prevention and/or treatment of ELS-associated psychiatric illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As a significant public health issue, chronic pain, mainly neuropathic pain (NP) and inflammatory pain, has a severe impact. The underlying mechanisms of chronic pain are enigmatic at present. The roles of ubiquitin have been demonstrated in various physiological and pathological conditions and underscore its potential as therapeutic targets. The dysfunction of the component of the ubiquitin system that occurs during chronic pain is rapidly being discovered. These results provide insight into potential molecular mechanisms of chronic pain. Chronic pain is regulated by ubiquitination, SUMOylation, ubiquitin ligase, and deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), etc. Insight into the mechanism of the ubiquitin system regulating chronic pain might contribute to relevant therapeutic targets and the development of novel analgesics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Cannabidiol Displays Proteomic Similarities to Antipsychotics in Cuprizone-Exposed Human Oligodendrocytic Cell Line MO3.13</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.673144</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.673144</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cannabidiol, a compound of Cannabis sativa, has been proposed as an alternative treatment of schizophrenia. Preclinical and clinical data have suggested that cannabidiol shares more similarity with atypical antipsychotics than typical, both of which are customarily used to manage schizophrenia symptoms. While oligodendrocytes are known to be relevant targets of antipsychotics, the biochemical knowledge in this regard is still limited. Here we evaluated the molecular pathways modulated by cannabidiol compared to the antipsychotics clozapine (atypical) and haloperidol (typical), additionally evaluating the effects of benztropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist that displays a protective effect in oligodendrocytes and myelination. For this purpose, we employed nano-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry to investigate the proteomic response to these drugs both in healthy oligodendrocytic cells and in a cuprizone-based toxicity model, using the human oligodendrocyte precursor cell line MO3.13. Cannabidiol shares similarities of biochemical pathways with clozapine and benztropine, in agreement with other studies that indicated an atypical antipsychotic profile. All drugs tested affected metabolic and gene expression pathways and cannabidiol, benztropine, and clozapine modulated cell proliferation and apoptosis when administered after cuprizone-induced toxicity. These general pathways are associated with cuprizone-induced cytotoxicity in MO3.13 cells, indicating a possible proteomic approach when acting against the toxic effects of cuprizone. In conclusion, although modeling oligodendrocytic cytotoxicity with cuprizone does not represent the entirety of the pathophysiology of oligodendrocyte impairments, these results provide insight into the mechanisms associated with the effects of cannabidiol and antipsychotics against cuprizone toxicity, offering new directions of study for myelin-related processes and deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Astroglial Connexins in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes play a crucial role in the maintenance of the normal functions of the Central Nervous System (CNS). During the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, astrocytes undergo morphological and functional remodeling, a process called reactive astrogliosis, in response to the insults to the CNS. One of the key aspects of the reactive astrocytes is the change in the expression and function of connexins. Connexins are channel proteins that highly expressed in astrocytes, forming gap junction channels and hemichannels, allowing diffusional trafficking of small molecules. Alterations of astrocytic connexin expression and function found in neurodegenerative diseases have been shown to affect the disease progression by changing neuronal function and survival. In this review, we will summarize the role of astroglial connexins in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Also, we will discuss why targeting connexins can be a plausible therapeutic strategy to manage these neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Post-stroke Delivery of Valproic Acid Promotes Functional Recovery and Differentially Modifies Responses of Peri-Infarct Microglia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The specific role of peri-infarct microglia and the timing of its morphological changes following ischemic stroke are not well understood. Valproic acid (VPA) can protect against ischemic damage and promote recovery. In this study, we first determined whether a single dose of VPA after stroke could decrease infarction area or improve functional recovery. Next, we investigated the number and morphological characteristic of peri-infarct microglia at different time points and elucidated the mechanism of microglial response by VPA treatment. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAo) for 90 min, followed by reperfusion. Some received a single injection of VPA (200 mg/kg) 90 min after the induction of ischemia, while vehicle-treated animals underwent the same procedure with physiological saline. Infarction volume was calculated at 48 h after reperfusion, and neurological symptoms were evaluated. VPA didn’t significantly reduce infarct volume but did ameliorate neurological deficit at least partially compared with vehicle. Meanwhile, VPA reduced dMCAo-induced elevation of IL-6 at 24 h post-stroke and significantly decreased the number of CD11b-positive microglia within peri-infarct cortex at 7 days. Morphological analysis revealed that VPA therapy leads to higher fractal dimensions, smaller soma size and lower circularity index of CD11b-positive cells within peri-infarct cortex at both 2 and 7 days, suggesting that VPA has core effects on microglial morphology. The modulation of microglia morphology caused by VPA might involve HDAC inhibition-mediated suppression of galectin-3 production. Furthermore, qPCR analysis of CD11b-positive cells at 3 days post-stroke suggested that VPA could partially enhance M2 subset polarization of microglia in peri-infarct cortex. Analysis of VPA-induced changes to gene expressions at 3 days post-stroke implies that these alternations of the biomarkers and microglial responses are implicated in the upregulation of wound healing, collagen trimmer, and extracellular matrix genes within peri-infarct cortex. Our results are the first to show that a low dose of VPA promotes short-term functional recovery but does not alter infarct volume. The decreases in the expression of both IL-6 and galectin-3 might influence the morphological characteristics and transcriptional profiles of microglia and extracellular matrix remodeling, which could contribute to the improved recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Oral Administration of Brain Protein Combined With Probiotics Induces Immune Tolerance Through the Tryptophan Pathway</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammation leads to secondary immune damage after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The intestinal mucosa is a key component of immune tolerance due to gut-brain axis regulation, but the curative effect is not optimal. Intestinal dysfunction impairs the establishment of immune tolerance in patients with TBI. Therefore, we orally administered brain protein (BP) combined with probiotics to induce immune tolerance and explored the mechanism by which the homeostasis of the microbiota contributes to the enhancement of curative effects by BPs. Herein, we demonstrated that patients with TBI and surgical brain injury (SBI) models of rats had obvious dysbiosis. Notably, the intestinal barrier, proinflammatory cytokines, and activation of microglia demonstrated that excessive inflammatory damage was better controlled in the combined group (oral administration of BP combined with probiotics) than in the BP group (oral administration of BP). Fundamentally, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics analysis revealed that BP and probiotics preferentially affect Try-related pathways. A series of experiments further confirmed that Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO)/Kynurenine (Kyn)/Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expression was high in the BP group, while Tryptophan hydroxylase 1(TpH1)/5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) only changed in the combined group. This study suggests that probiotics can enhance the efficacy of oral BP-induced immune tolerance through the Try pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Transfer Model Based on Supervised Multi-Layer Dictionary Learning for Brain Tumor MRI Image Recognition</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) is an effective technology for automatic brain tumor MRI image recognition. The training of an AI model requires a large number of labeled data, but medical data needs to be labeled by professional clinicians, which makes data collection complex and expensive. Moreover, a traditional AI model requires that the training data and test data must follow the independent and identically distributed. To solve this problem, we propose a transfer model based on supervised multi-layer dictionary learning (TSMDL) for brain tumor MRI image recognition in this paper. With the help of the knowledge learned from related domains, the goal of this model is to solve the task of transfer learning where the target domain has only a small number of labeled samples. Based on the framework of multi-layer dictionary learning, the proposed model learns the common shared dictionary of source and target domains in each layer to explore the intrinsic connections and shared information between different domains. At the same time, by making full use of the label information of samples, the Laplacian regularization term is introduced to make the dictionary coding of similar samples as close as possible and the dictionary coding of different class samples as different as possible. The recognition experiments on brain MRI image datasets REMBRANDT and Figshare show that the model performs better than competitive state of-the-art methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain tumor image classification is an important part of medical image processing. It assists doctors to make accurate diagnosis and treatment plans. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is one of the main imaging tools to study brain tissue. In this article, we propose a brain tumor MR image classification method using convolutional dictionary learning with local constraint (CDLLC). Our method integrates the multi-layer dictionary learning into a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure to explore the discriminative information. Encoding a vector on a dictionary can be considered as multiple projections into new spaces, and the obtained coding vector is sparse. Meanwhile, in order to preserve the geometric structure of data and utilize the supervised information, we construct the local constraint of atoms through a supervised k-nearest neighbor graph, so that the discrimination of the obtained dictionary is strong. To solve the proposed problem, an efficient iterative optimization scheme is designed. In the experiment, two clinically relevant multi-class classification tasks on the Cheng and REMBRANDT datasets are designed. The evaluation results demonstrate that our method is effective for brain tumor MR image classification, and it could outperform other comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Predicting brain age has become one of the most attractive challenges in computational neuroscience due to the role of the predicted age as an effective biomarker for different brain diseases and conditions. A great variety of machine learning (ML) approaches and deep learning (DL) techniques have been proposed to predict age from brain magnetic resonance imaging scans. If on one hand, DL models could improve performance and reduce model bias compared to other less complex ML methods, on the other hand, they are typically black boxes as do not provide an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods have been recently introduced to provide interpretable decisions of ML and DL algorithms both at local and global level. In this work, we present an explainable DL framework to predict the age of a healthy cohort of subjects from ABIDE I database by using the morphological features extracted from their MRI scans. We embed the two local XAI methods SHAP and LIME to explain the outcomes of the DL models, determine the contribution of each brain morphological descriptor to the final predicted age of each subject and investigate the reliability of the two methods. Our findings indicate that the SHAP method can provide more reliable explanations for the morphological aging mechanisms and be exploited to identify personalized age-related imaging biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Classification-Biased Apparent Brain Age for the Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning methods are often adopted to infer useful biomarkers for the early diagnosis of many neurodegenerative diseases and, in general, of neuroanatomical ageing. Some of these methods estimate the subject age from morphological brain data, which is then indicated as “brain age”. The difference between such a predicted brain age and the actual chronological age of a subject can be used as an indication of a pathological deviation from normal brain ageing. An important use of the brain age model as biomarker is the prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Many different machine learning approaches have been applied to this specific predictive task, some of which have achieved high accuracy at the expense of the descriptiveness of the model. This work investigates an appropriate combination of data science techniques and linear models to provide, at the same time, high accuracy and good descriptiveness. The proposed method is based on a data workflow that include typical data science methods, such as outliers detection, feature selection, linear regression, and logistic regression. In particular, a novel inductive bias is introduced in the regression model, which is aimed at improving the accuracy and the specificity of the classification task. The method is compared to other machine learning approaches for AD classification based on morphological brain data with and without the use of the brain age, including Support Vector Machines and Deep Neural Networks. This study adopts brain MRI scans of 1, 901 subjects which have been acquired from three repositories (ADNI, AIBL, and IXI). A predictive model based only on the proposed apparent brain age and the chronological age has an accuracy of 88% and 92%, respectively, for male and female subjects, in a repeated cross-validation analysis, thus achieving a comparable or superior performance than state of the art machine learning methods. The advantage of the proposed method is that it maintains the morphological semantics of the input space throughout the regression and classification tasks. The accurate predictive model is also highly descriptive and can be used to generate potentially useful insights on the predictions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Dynamics of Long-Range Temporal Correlations in Broadband EEG During Different Motor Execution and Imagery Tasks</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain activity is composed of oscillatory and broadband arrhythmic components; however, there is more focus on oscillatory sensorimotor rhythms to study movement, but temporal dynamics of broadband arrhythmic electroencephalography (EEG) remain unexplored. We have previously demonstrated that broadband arrhythmic EEG contains both short- and long-range temporal correlations that change significantly during movement. In this study, we build upon our previous work to gain a deeper understanding of these changes in the long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) in broadband EEG and contrast them with the well-known LRTC in alpha oscillation amplitude typically found in the literature. We investigate and validate changes in LRTCs during five different types of movements and motor imagery tasks using two independent EEG datasets recorded with two different paradigms—our finger tapping dataset with single self-initiated asynchronous finger taps and publicly available EEG dataset containing cued continuous movement and motor imagery of fists and feet. We quantified instantaneous changes in broadband LRTCs by detrended fluctuation analysis on single trial 2 s EEG sliding windows. The broadband LRTC increased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) during all motor tasks as compared to the resting state. In contrast, the alpha oscillation LRTC, which had to be computed on longer stitched EEG segments, decreased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) consistently with the literature. This suggests the complementarity of underlying fast and slow neuronal scale-free dynamics during movement and motor imagery. The single trial broadband LRTC gave high average binary classification accuracy in the range of 70.54±10.03% to 76.07±6.40% for all motor execution and imagery tasks and hence can be used in brain–computer interface (BCI). Thus, we demonstrate generalizability, robustness, and reproducibility of novel motor neural correlate, the single trial broadband LRTC, during different motor execution and imagery tasks in single asynchronous and cued continuous motor-BCI paradigms and its contrasting behavior with LRTC in alpha oscillation amplitude.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurofeedback training (NFT) is a non-invasive, safe, and effective method of regulating the nerve state of the brain. Presently, NFT is widely used to prevent and rehabilitate brain diseases and improve an individual’s external performance. Among the various NFT methods, NFT to improve sport performance (SP-NFT) has become an important research and application focus worldwide. Several studies have shown that the method is effective in improving brain function and motor control performance. However, appropriate reviews and prospective directions for this technology are lacking. This paper proposes an SP-NFT classification method based on user experience, classifies and discusses various SP-NFT research schemes reported in the existing literature, and reviews the technical principles, application scenarios, and usage characteristics of different SP-NFT schemes. Several key issues in SP-NFT development, including the factors involved in neural mechanisms, scheme selection, learning basis, and experimental implementation, are discussed. Finally, directions for the future development of SP-NFT, including SP-NFT based on other electroencephalograph characteristics, SP-NFT integrated with other technologies, and SP-NFT commercialization, are suggested. These discussions are expected to provide some valuable ideas to researchers in related fields.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for Ischemic Stroke Treatment</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is one of the main central nervous system diseases and is associated with high disability and mortality rates. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and mechanical thrombectomy are the optimal therapies available currently to restore blood flow in patients with stroke; however, their limitations are well recognized. Therefore, new treatments are urgently required to overcome these shortcomings. Recently, stem cell transplantation technology, involving the transplantation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), has drawn the interest of neuroscientists and is considered to be a promising alternative for ischemic stroke treatment. iPSCs are a class of cells produced by introducing specific transcription factors into somatic cells, and are similar to embryonic stem cells in biological function. Here, we have reviewed the current applications of stem cells with a focus on iPSC therapy in ischemic stroke, including the neuroprotective mechanisms, development constraints, major challenges to overcome, and clinical prospects. Based on the current state of research, we believe that stem cells, especially iPSCs, will pave the way for future stroke treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: The Interaction Between Microglia and Macroglia in Glaucoma</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma, a neurodegenerative disease that leads to irreversible vision loss, is characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic axons. To date, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) has been recognized as the main phenotypic factor associated with glaucoma. However, some patients with normal IOP also have glaucomatous visual impairment and RGC loss. Unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms behind such cases remain unclear. Recent studies have suggested that retinal glia play significant roles in the initiation and progression of glaucoma. Multiple types of glial cells are activated in glaucoma. Microglia, for example, act as critical mediators that orchestrate the progression of neuroinflammation through pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, macroglia (astrocytes and Müller cells) participate in retinal inflammatory responses as modulators and contribute to neuroprotection through the secretion of neurotrophic factors. Notably, research results have indicated that intricate interactions between microglia and macroglia might provide potential therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of glaucoma. In this review, we examine the specific roles of microglia and macroglia in open-angle glaucoma, including glaucoma in animal models, and analyze the interaction between these two cell types. In addition, we discuss potential treatment options based on the relationship between glial cells and neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: CoMB-Deep: Composite Deep Learning-Based Pipeline for Classifying Childhood Medulloblastoma and Its Classes</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.663592</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Childhood medulloblastoma (MB) is a threatening malignant tumor affecting children all over the globe. It is believed to be the foremost common pediatric brain tumor causing death. Early and accurate classification of childhood MB and its classes are of great importance to help doctors choose the suitable treatment and observation plan, avoid tumor progression, and lower death rates. The current gold standard for diagnosing MB is the histopathology of biopsy samples. However, manual analysis of such images is complicated, costly, time-consuming, and highly dependent on the expertise and skills of pathologists, which might cause inaccurate results. This study aims to introduce a reliable computer-assisted pipeline called CoMB-Deep to automatically classify MB and its classes with high accuracy from histopathological images. This key challenge of the study is the lack of childhood MB datasets, especially its four categories (defined by the WHO) and the inadequate related studies. All relevant works were based on either deep learning (DL) or textural analysis feature extractions. Also, such studies employed distinct features to accomplish the classification procedure. Besides, most of them only extracted spatial features. Nevertheless, CoMB-Deep blends the advantages of textural analysis feature extraction techniques and DL approaches. The CoMB-Deep consists of a composite of DL techniques. Initially, it extracts deep spatial features from 10 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It then performs a feature fusion step using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), a texture analysis method capable of reducing the dimension of fused features. Next, the CoMB-Deep explores the best combination of fused features, enhancing the performance of the classification process using two search strategies. Afterward, it employs two feature selection techniques on the fused feature sets selected in the previous step. A bi-directional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) network; a DL-based approach that is utilized for the classification phase. CoMB-Deep maintains two classification categories: binary category for distinguishing between the abnormal and normal cases and multi-class category to identify the subclasses of MB. The results of the CoMB-Deep for both classification categories prove that it is reliable. The results also indicate that the feature sets selected using both search strategies have enhanced the performance of Bi-LSTM compared to individual spatial deep features. CoMB-Deep is compared to related studies to verify its competitiveness, and this comparison confirmed its robustness and outperformance. Hence, CoMB-Deep can help pathologists perform accurate diagnoses, reduce misdiagnosis risks that could occur with manual diagnosis, accelerate the classification procedure, and decrease diagnosis costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
