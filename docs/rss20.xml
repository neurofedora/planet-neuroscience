Electrical stimulation of neural systems is a key tool for understanding neural dynamics and ultimately for developing clinical treatments. Many applications of electrical stimulation affect large populations of neurons. However, computational models of large networks of spiking neurons are inherently hard to simulate and analyze. We evaluate a reduced mean-field model of excitatory and inhibitory adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neurons which can be used to efficiently study the effects of electrical stimulation on large neural populations. The rich dynamical properties of this basic cortical model are described in detail and validated using large network simulations. Bifurcation diagrams reflecting the network’s state reveal asynchronous up- and down-states, bistable regimes, and oscillatory regions corresponding to fast excitation-inhibition and slow excitation-adaptation feedback loops. The biophysical parameters of the AdEx neuron can be coupled to an electric field with realistic field strengths which then can be propagated up to the population description. We show how on the edge of bifurcation, direct electrical inputs cause network state transitions, such as turning on and off oscillations of the population rate. Oscillatory input can frequency-entrain and phase-lock endogenous oscillations. Relatively weak electric field strengths on the order of 1 V/m are able to produce these effects, indicating that field effects are strongly amplified in the network. The effects of time-varying external stimulation are well-predicted by the mean-field model, further underpinning the utility of low-dimensional neural mass models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7zMWipN6ZMc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Converging theories suggest that organisms learn and exploit probabilistic models of their environment. However, it remains unclear how such models can be learned in practice. The open-ended complexity of natural environments means that it is generally infeasible for organisms to model their environment comprehensively. Alternatively, &lt;i&gt;action-oriented&lt;/i&gt; models attempt to encode a parsimonious representation of adaptive agent-environment interactions. One approach to learning action-oriented models is to learn online in the presence of goal-directed behaviours. This constrains an agent to behaviourally relevant trajectories, reducing the diversity of the data a model need account for. Unfortunately, this approach can cause models to prematurely converge to sub-optimal solutions, through a process we refer to as a &lt;i&gt;bad-bootstrap&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we exploit the normative framework of &lt;i&gt;active inference&lt;/i&gt; to show that efficient action-oriented models can be learned by balancing goal-oriented and epistemic (&lt;i&gt;information-seeking&lt;/i&gt;) behaviours in a principled manner. We illustrate our approach using a simple agent-based model of bacterial chemotaxis. We first demonstrate that learning via goal-directed behaviour indeed constrains models to behaviorally relevant aspects of the environment, but that this approach is prone to sub-optimal convergence. We then demonstrate that epistemic behaviours facilitate the construction of accurate and comprehensive models, but that these models are not tailored to any specific behavioural niche and are therefore less efficient in their use of data. Finally, we show that active inference agents learn models that are parsimonious, tailored to action, and which avoid bad bootstraps and sub-optimal convergence. Critically, our results indicate that models learned through active inference can support adaptive behaviour in spite of, and indeed &lt;i&gt;because of&lt;/i&gt;, their departure from veridical representations of the environment. Our approach provides a principled method for learning adaptive models from limited interactions with an environment, highlighting a route to sample efficient learning algorithms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kVx4Eq3TDIk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Telling ecological networks apart by their structure: An environment-dependent approach</title>

The network architecture of an ecological community describes the structure of species interactions established in a given place and time. It has been suggested that this architecture presents unique features for each type of ecological interaction: e.g., nested and modular architectures would correspond to mutualistic and antagonistic interactions, respectively. Recently, Michalska-Smith and Allesina (2019) proposed a computational challenge to test whether it is indeed possible to differentiate ecological interactions based on network architecture. Contrary to the expectation, they found that this differentiation is practically impossible, moving the question to why it is not possible to differentiate ecological interactions based on their network architecture alone. Here, we show that this differentiation becomes possible by adding the local environmental information where the networks were sampled. We show that this can be explained by the fact that environmental conditions are a confounder of ecological interactions and network architecture. That is, the lack of association between network architecture and type of ecological interactions changes by conditioning on the local environmental conditions. Additionally, we find that environmental conditions are linked to the stability of ecological networks, but the direction of this effect depends on the type of interaction network. This suggests that the association between ecological interactions and network architectures exists, but cannot be fully understood without attention to the environmental conditions acting upon them.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xleeyv_OWW0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

A massive number of biological entities, such as genes and mutations, are mentioned in the biomedical literature. The capturing of the semantic relatedness of biological entities is vital to many biological applications, such as protein-protein interaction prediction and literature-based discovery. Concept embeddings—which involve the learning of vector representations of concepts using machine learning models—have been employed to capture the semantics of concepts. To develop concept embeddings, named-entity recognition (NER) tools are first used to identify and normalize concepts from the literature, and then different machine learning models are used to train the embeddings. Despite multiple attempts, existing biomedical concept embeddings generally suffer from suboptimal NER tools, small-scale evaluation, and limited availability. In response, we employed high-performance machine learning-based NER tools for concept recognition and trained our concept embeddings, BioConceptVec, via four different machine learning models on ~30 million PubMed abstracts. BioConceptVec covers over 400,000 biomedical concepts mentioned in the literature and is of the largest among the publicly available biomedical concept embeddings to date. To evaluate the validity and utility of BioConceptVec, we respectively performed two intrinsic evaluations (identifying related concepts based on drug-gene and gene-gene interactions) and two extrinsic evaluations (protein-protein interaction prediction and drug-drug interaction extraction), collectively using over 25 million instances from nine independent datasets (17 million instances from six intrinsic evaluation tasks and 8 million instances from three extrinsic evaluation tasks), which is, by far, the most comprehensive to our best knowledge. The intrinsic evaluation results demonstrate that BioConceptVec consistently has, by a large margin, better performance than existing concept embeddings in identifying similar and related concepts. More importantly, the extrinsic evaluation results demonstrate that using BioConceptVec with advanced deep learning models can significantly improve performance in downstream bioinformatics studies and biomedical text-mining applications. Our BioConceptVec embeddings and benchmarking datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/BioConceptVec.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xMJKDTCgxA4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Components of Endocannabinoid Signaling System Are Expressed in the Perinatal Mouse Cerebellum and Required for Its Normal Development</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling system (ECS), encompassing cannabinoid receptors and enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of the endogenous cannabinoid signaling lipids, is highly expressed in the cerebellar cortex of adult humans and rodents. In addition to their well-established role in neuromodulation, eCBs have been shown to play key roles in aspects of neurodevelopment in the fore- and mid-brain, including neurogenesis, cell migration, and synapse specification. However, little is known about the role of ECS in cerebellar development. In this study, we conducted immunohistochemical characterization of ECS components through key stages of cerebellar development in mice using antibodies for 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) synthetizing and degrading enzymes and the major brain cannabinoid receptor, cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), in combination with cerebellar cell markers. Our results reveal a temporally, spatially, and cytologically dynamic pattern of expression. Production, receptor binding, and degradation of eCBs are tightly controlled, thus localization of eCB receptors and the complementary cannabinoid signaling machinery determines the direction, duration, and ultimately the outcome of eCB signaling. To gain insights into the role of eCB signaling in cerebellar development, we characterized gross anatomy of cerebellar midvermis in CB1 knock-out (CB1 KO) mice, as well as their performance in cerebellar-influenced motor tasks. Our results show persistent and selective anatomic and behavioral alterations in CB1 KOs. Consequently, the insights gained from this study lay down the foundation for investigating specific cellular and molecular mechanisms regulated by eCB signaling during cerebellar development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Differential Scaling of Synaptic Molecules within Functional Zones of an Excitatory Synapse during Homeostatic Plasticity</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Homeostatic scaling is a form of synaptic plasticity where individual synapses scale their strengths to compensate for global suppression or elevation of neuronal activity. This process can be studied by measuring miniature EPSP (mEPSP) amplitudes and frequencies following the regulation of activity in neuronal cultures. Here, we demonstrate a quantitative approach to characterize multiplicative synaptic scaling using immunolabelling of hippocampal neuronal cultures treated with tetrodotoxin (TTX) or bicuculline to extract scaling factors for various synaptic proteins. This approach allowed us to directly examine the scaling of presynaptic and postsynaptic scaffolding molecules along with neurotransmitter receptors in primary cultures from mouse and rat hippocampal neurons. We show robust multiplicative scaling of synaptic scaffolding molecules namely, Shank2, PSD95, Bassoon, and AMPA receptor subunits and quantify their scaling factors. We use super-resolution microscopy to calculate scaling factors of surface expressed GluA2 within functional zones of the synapse and show that there is differential and correlated scaling of GluA2 levels within the spine, the postsynaptic density (PSD), and the perisynaptic regions. Our method opens a novel paradigm to quantify relative molecular changes of synaptic proteins within distinct subsynaptic compartments from a large number of synapses in response to alteration of neuronal activity, providing anatomic insights into the intricacies of variability in strength of individual synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Effect of Stimulus-Dependent Spike Timing on Population Coding of Sound Location in the Owls Auditory Midbrain</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In the auditory system, the spectrotemporal structure of acoustic signals determines the temporal pattern of spikes. Here, we investigated this effect in neurons of the barn owl’s auditory midbrain (&lt;i&gt;Tyto furcata&lt;/i&gt;) that are selective for auditory space and whether it can influence the coding of sound direction. We found that in the nucleus where neurons first become selective to combinations of sound localization cues, reproducibility of spike trains across repeated trials of identical sounds, a metric of across-trial temporal fidelity of spiking patterns evoked by a stimulus, was maximal at the sound direction that elicited the highest firing rate. We then tested the hypothesis that this stimulus-dependent patterning resulted in rate co-modulation of cells with similar frequency and spatial selectivity, driving stimulus-dependent synchrony of population responses. Tetrodes were used to simultaneously record multiple nearby units in the optic tectum (OT), where auditory space is topographically represented. While spiking of neurons in OT showed lower reproducibility across trials compared with upstream nuclei, spike-time synchrony between nearby OT neurons was highest for sounds at their preferred direction. A model of the midbrain circuit explained the relationship between stimulus-dependent reproducibility and synchrony, and demonstrated that this effect can improve the decoding of sound location from the OT output. Thus, stimulus-dependent spiking patterns in the auditory midbrain can have an effect on spatial coding. This study reports a functional connection between spike patterning elicited by spectrotemporal features of a sound and the coding of its location.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;A fundamental challenge in studying principles of organization used by the olfactory system to encode odor concentration information has been identifying comprehensive sets of activated odorant receptors (ORs) across a broad concentration range inside freely behaving animals. In mammals, this has recently become feasible with high-throughput sequencing-based methods that identify populations of activated ORs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In this study, we characterized the mouse OR repertoires activated by the two odorants, acetophenone (ACT) and 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT), from 0.01% to 100% (v/v) as starting concentrations using phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 capture followed by RNA-Seq. We found Olfr923 to be one of the most sensitive ORs that is enriched by ACT. Using a mouse line that genetically labels Olfr923-positive axons, we provided evidence that ACT activates the Olfr923 glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Through molecular dynamics stimulations, we identified amino acid residues in the Olfr923 binding cavity that facilitate ACT binding. This study sheds light on the active process by which unique OR repertoires may collectively facilitate the discrimination of odorant concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: An Indexing Theory for Working Memory Based on Fast Hebbian Plasticity</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) is a key component of human memory and cognition. Computational models have been used to study the underlying neural mechanisms, but neglected the important role of short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) interactions for WM. Here, we investigate these using a novel multiarea spiking neural network model of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and two parietotemporal cortical areas based on macaque data. We propose a WM indexing theory that explains how PFC could associate, maintain, and update multimodal LTM representations. Our simulations demonstrate how simultaneous, brief multimodal memory cues could build a temporary joint memory representation as an &quot;index&quot; in PFC by means of fast Hebbian synaptic plasticity. This index can then reactivate spontaneously and thereby also the associated LTM representations. Cueing one LTM item rapidly pattern completes the associated uncued item via PFC. The PFC–STM network updates flexibly as new stimuli arrive, thereby gradually overwriting older representations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Unique Organization of Actin Cytoskeleton in Magnocellular Vasopressin Neurons in Normal Conditions and in Response to Salt-Loading</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) are intrinsically osmosensitive and can be activated by increases in blood osmolality, triggering the release of antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (VP) to promote water retention. Hence, the activity of magnocellular VP neurons is one of the key elements contributing to the regulation of body fluid homeostasis in healthy organisms. Chronic exposure to high dietary salt leads to excessive activation of VP neurons, thereby elevating levels of circulating VP, which can cause increases in blood pressure contributing to salt-dependent hypertension. However, the molecular basis underlying high-salt diet-induced hyperactivation of magnocellular VP neurons remains not fully understood. Previous studies suggest that magnocellular neurosecretory neurons contain a subcortical layer of actin filaments and pharmacological stabilization of this actin network potentiates osmotically-induced activation of magnocellular neurons. Using super-resolution imaging &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;, we investigated the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in rat MNCs under normal physiological conditions and after a chronic increase in blood osmolality following 7 d of salt-loading (SL). We found that, in addition to the subcortical layer of actin filaments, magnocellular VP neurons are endowed with a unique network of cytoplasmic actin filaments throughout their somata. Moreover, we revealed that the density of both subcortical and cytoplasmic actin networks in magnocellular VP neurons is dramatically increased following SL. These results suggest that increased osmo-responsiveness of VP neurons following chronic exposure to high dietary salt may be mediated by the modulation of unique actin networks in magnocellular VP neurons, possibly contributing to elevated blood pressure in this condition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10701</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose an alternative method to the disjoint principal
component analysis. The method consists of a principal component analysis with
constraints, which allows us to determine disjoint components that are linear
combinations of disjoint subsets of the original variables. The proposed method
is named constrained binary optimization by particle swarm disjoint principal
component analysis, since it is based on the particle swarm optimization. The
method uses stochastic optimization to find solutions in cases of high
computational complexity. The algorithm associated with the method starts
generating randomly a particle population which iteratively evolves until
attaining a global optimum which is function of the disjoint components.
Numerical results are provided to confirm the quality of the solutions attained
by the proposed method. Illustrative examples with real data are conducted to
show the potential applications of the method.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Foraging is a fundamental behavior as animals' search for food is crucial for
their survival. Patch leaving is a canonical foraging behavior, but classic
theoretical conceptions of patch leaving decisions lack some key naturalistic
details. Optimal foraging theory provides general rules for when an animal
should leave a patch, but does not provide mechanistic insights about how those
rules change with the structure of the environment. Such a mechanistic
framework would aid in designing quantitative experiments to unravel behavioral
and neural underpinnings of foraging. To address these shortcomings, we develop
a normative theory of patch foraging decisions. Using a Bayesian approach, we
treat patch leaving behavior as a statistical inference problem. We derive the
animals' optimal decision strategies in both non-depleting and depleting
environments. A majority of these cases can be analyzed explicitly using
methods from stochastic processes. Our behavioral predictions are expressed in
terms of the optimal patch residence time and the decision rule by which an
animal departs a patch. We also extend our theory to a hierarchical model in
which the forager learns the environmental food resource distribution. The
quantitative framework we develop will therefore help experimenters move from
analyzing trial based behavior to continuous behavior without the loss of
quantitative rigor. Our theoretical framework both extends optimal foraging
theory and motivates a variety of behavioral and neuroscientific experiments
investigating patch foraging behavior.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain dynamics can exhibit narrow-band nonlinear oscillations and
multistability. For a subset of disorders of consciousness and motor control,
we hypothesize that some symptoms originate from the inability to spontaneously
transition from one attractor to another. Using external perturbations, such as
electrical pulses delivered by deep brain stimulation devices, it may be
possible to induce such transition out of the pathological attractors. However,
the induction of transition may be non-trivial, rendering the current open-loop
stimulation strategies insufficient. In order to develop next-generation neural
stimulators that can intelligently learn to induce attractor transitions, we
require a platform to test the efficacy of such systems. To this end, we
designed an analog circuit as a model for the multistable brain dynamics. The
circuit spontaneously oscillates stably on two periods as an instantiation of a
3-dimensional continuous-time gated recurrent neural network. To discourage
simple perturbation strategies such as constant or random stimulation patterns
from easily inducing transition between the stable limit cycles, we designed a
state-dependent nonlinear circuit interface for external perturbation. We
demonstrate the existence of nontrivial solutions to the transition problem in
our circuit implementation.

both deterministic and stochastic driven case, we proceed to the analysis of
the network. Our numerical analysis highlights emergent properties such as
partial synchronization and synchronization, waves of excitability, and

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: No evidence that epilepsy impacts criticality in pre-seizure single-neuron activity of human cortex. (arXiv:2004.10642v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epileptic seizures are characterized by abnormal and excessive neural
activity, where cortical network dynamics seem to become unstable. However,
most of the time, during seizure-free periods, cortex of epilepsy patients
shows perfectly stable dynamics. This raises the question of how recurring
instability can arise in the light of this stable default state. In this work,
we examine two potential scenarios of seizure generation: (i) epileptic
cortical areas might generally operate closer to instability, which would make
epilepsy patients generally more susceptible to seizures, or (ii) epileptic
cortical areas might drift systematically towards instability before seizure
onset. We analyzed single-unit spike recordings from both the epileptogenic
(focal) and the nonfocal cortical hemispheres of 20 epilepsy patients. We
quantified the distance to instability in the framework of criticality, using a
novel estimator, which enables an unbiased inference from a small set of
recorded neurons. Surprisingly, we found no evidence for either scenario:
Neither did focal areas generally operate closer to instability, nor were
seizures preceded by a drift towards instability. In fact, our results from
both pre-seizure and seizure-free intervals suggest that despite epilepsy,
human cortex operates in the stable, slightly subcritical regime, just like
cortex of other healthy mammalians.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Evolving Dyadic Strategies for a Cooperative Physical Task. (arXiv:2004.10558v1 [cs.NE])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Many cooperative physical tasks require that individuals play specialized
roles (e.g., leader-follower). Humans are adept cooperators, negotiating these
roles and transitions between roles innately. Yet how roles are delegated and
reassigned is not well understood. Using a genetic algorithm, we evolve
simulated agents to explore a space of feasible role-switching policies.
Applying these switching policies in a cooperative manual task, agents process
visual and haptic cues to decide when to switch roles. We then analyze the
evolved virtual population for attributes typically associated with
cooperation: load sharing and temporal coordination. We find that the best
performing dyads exhibit high temporal coordination (anti-synchrony). And in
turn, anti-synchrony is correlated to symmetry between the parameters of the
cooperative agents. These simulations furnish hypotheses as to how human
cooperators might mediate roles in dyadic tasks.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper investigates how often the popular configurations of Differential
Evolution generate solutions outside the feasible domain. Following previous
publications in the field, we argue that what the algorithm does with such
solutions and how often this has to happen is important for the overall
performance of the algorithm and interpretation of results. Significantly more
solutions than what is usually assumed by practitioners have to undergo some
sort of 'correction' to conform with the definition of the problem's search
domain. A wide range of popular Differential Evolution configurations is
considered in this study. Conclusions are made regarding the effect the
Differential Evolution components and parameter settings have on the
distribution of percentages of infeasible solutions generated in a series of
independent runs. Results shown in this study suggest strong dependencies
between percentages of generated infeasible solutions and every aspect
mentioned above. Further investigation of the distribution of percentages of
generated infeasible solutions is required.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10424</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are general-purpose problem solvers that
usually perform an unbiased search. This is reasonable and desirable in a
black-box scenario. For combinatorial optimization problems, often more
knowledge about the structure of optimal solutions is given, which can be
leveraged by means of biased search operators. We consider the Minimum Spanning
Tree (MST) problem in a single- and multi-objective version, and introduce a
biased mutation, which puts more emphasis on the selection of edges of low rank
in terms of low domination number. We present example graphs where the biased
mutation can significantly speed up the expected runtime until (Pareto-)optimal
solutions are found. On the other hand, we demonstrate that bias can lead to
exponential runtime if heavy edges are necessarily part of an optimal solution.
However, on general graphs in the single-objective setting, we show that a
combined mutation operator which decides for unbiased or biased edge selection
in each step with equal probability exhibits a polynomial upper bound -- as
unbiased mutation -- in the worst case and benefits from bias if the
circumstances are favorable.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Optical coherence tomography imaging of evoked neural activity in sciatic nerve of rat. (arXiv:2004.10352v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10352</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Significance: Imaging neural activity in myelinated tissue using optical
coherence tomography (OCT) creates exciting possibilities for functional
imaging in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Aim: To investigate
changes in OCT images in response to evoked neural activity in sciatic nerve of
rat in vitro. Approach: M-scans were obtained on peripheral nerves of rat using
a swept source polarisation sensitive OCT system, while a nerve cuff acquired
electrical neural recordings. From a total of 10 subjects: 3 had no stimulation
(controls), 3 had paw stimulation, and 4 had nerve stimulation. Changes in the
OCT signal intensity, phase retardation, phase, and frequency spectra were
calculated for each subject and reference samples of a mirror and microspheres
in solution. Results: Observed changes in intensity in 3 paw stimulation and 2
nerve stimulation subjects and changes in frequency spectra amplitude in 2 paw
stimulation subjects were above the reference noise level and were temporally
consistent with osmotic swelling from ion currents during neural activity.
Conclusion: Light scattering changes produced by osmotic swelling, which have
previously been characterized in squid and crab nerve, are also thought to
occur in myelinated fibres on a scale which is detectable using OCT.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Learning Multi-Modal Image Registration without Real Data. (arXiv:2004.10282v1 [cs.CV])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10282</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a learning-based strategy for multi-modal registration of images
acquired with any modality, without requiring real data during training. While
classical registration methods can accurately align multi-modal image pairs,
they solve a costly optimization problem for every new pair of images.
Learning-based techniques are fast at test time, but can only register images
of the specific anatomy and modalities they were trained on. In contrast, our
approach leverages a generative model to synthesize label maps and gray-scale
images that expose a network to a wide range of anatomy and contrast during
training. We demonstrate that this strategy enables robust registration of
arbitrary modalities, without the need to retrain for a new modality.
Critically, we show that input labels need not be of actual anatomy: training
on randomly synthesized shapes, or supervoxels, results in competitive
registration performance and makes the network agnostic to anatomy and
contrast, all while eradicating the need for real data. We present extensive
experiments demonstrating that this strategy enables registration of modalities
not seen during training and surpasses the state of art in cross-contrast
registration. Our code is integrated with the VoxelMorph library at:

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Effective Reinforcement Learning through Evolutionary Surrogate-Assisted Prescription. (arXiv:2002.05368v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05368</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is now significant historical data available on decision making in
organizations, consisting of the decision problem, what decisions were made,
and how desirable the outcomes were. Using this data, it is possible to learn a
surrogate model, and with that model, evolve a decision strategy that optimizes
the outcomes. This paper introduces a general such approach, called
Evolutionary Surrogate-Assisted Prescription, or ESP. The surrogate is, for
example, a random forest or a neural network trained with gradient descent, and
the strategy is a neural network that is evolved to maximize the predictions of
the surrogate model. ESP is further extended in this paper to sequential
decision-making tasks, which makes it possible to evaluate the framework in
reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks. Because the majority of evaluations are
done on the surrogate, ESP is more sample efficient, has lower variance, and
lower regret than standard RL approaches. Surprisingly, its solutions are also
better because both the surrogate and the strategy network regularize the
decision-making behavior. ESP thus forms a promising foundation to decision
optimization in real-world problems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transgender individuals (TIs) show brain structural alterations that differ
from their biological sex as well as their perceived gender. To substantiate
evidence that the brain structure of TIs differs from male and female, we use a
combined multivariate and univariate approach. Gray matter segments resulting
from voxel-based morphometry preprocessing of $N = 1753$ cisgender (CG) healthy
participants were used to train ($N=1402$) and validate (20 % hold-out; $N =
351$) a support-vector machine classifying the biological sex. As a second
validation, we classified $N = 1104$ patients with depression. A third
validation was performed using the matched CG sample of the transgender women
(TWs) application-sample. Subsequently, the classifier was applied to $N = 26$
TWs. Finally, we compared brain volumes of CG-men, women and TW-pre/post
treatment (cross-sex hormone treatment) in a univariate analysis controlling
for sexual orientation, age and total brain volume. The application of our
biological sex classifier to the transgender sample resulted in a significantly
lower true positive rate (TPR) (TPR-male = 56.0 %). The TPR did not differ
between CG-individuals with (TPR-male = 86.9 %) and without depression
(TPR-male = 88.5 %). The univariate analysis of the transgender
application-sample revealed that TW-pre/post treatment show brain structural
differences from CG-women and CG-men in the putamen and insula, as well as the
whole-brain analysis. Our results support the hypothesis that brain structure
in TW differs from brain structure of their biological sex (male) as well as
their perceived gender (female). This finding substantiates evidence that TIs
show specific brain structural alterations leading to a different pattern of
brain structure than CG-individuals.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A lack of software reproducibility has become increasingly apparent in the
last several years, calling into question the validity of scientific findings
affected by published tools. Reproducibility issues may have numerous sources
of error, including the underlying numerical stability of algorithms and
implementations employed. Various forms of instability have been observed in
neuroimaging, including across operating system versions, minor noise
injections, and implementation of theoretically equivalent algorithms. In this
paper we explore the effect of various perturbation methods on a typical
neuroimaging pipeline through the use of i) targeted noise injections, ii)
Monte Carlo Arithmetic, and iii) varying operating systems to identify the
quality and severity of their impact. The work presented here demonstrates that
even low order computational models such as the connectome estimation pipeline
that we used are susceptible to noise. This suggests that stability is a
relevant axis upon which tools should be compared, developed, or improved,
alongside more commonly considered axes such as accuracy/biological feasibility
or performance. The heterogeneity observed across participants clearly
illustrates that stability is a property of not just the data or tools
independently, but their interaction. Characterization of stability should
therefore be evaluated for specific analyses and performed on a representative
set of subjects for consideration in subsequent statistical testing.
Additionally, identifying how this relationship scales to higher-order models
is an exciting next step which will be explored. Finally, the joint application
of perturbation methods with post-processing approaches such as bagging or
signal normalization may lead to the development of more numerically stable
analyses while maintaining sensitivity to meaningful variation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I review unsupervised or self-supervised neural networks playing minimax
games in game-theoretic settings: (i) Artificial Curiosity (AC, 1990) is based
on two such networks. One network learns to generate a probability distribution
over outputs, the other learns to predict effects of the outputs. Each network
minimizes the objective function maximized by the other. (ii) Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs, 2010-2014) are an application of AC where the
effect of an output is 1 if the output is in a given set, and 0 otherwise.
(iii) Predictability Minimization (PM, 1990s) models data distributions through
a neural encoder that maximizes the objective function minimized by a neural
predictor of the code components. I correct a previously published claim that
PM is not based on a minimax game.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Behavior stability and individual differences in Pavlovian extended conditioning. (arXiv:1806.01778v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01778</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01778</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;How stable and general is behavior once maximum learning is reached? To
answer this question and understand post-acquisition behavior and its related
individual differences, we propose a psychological principle that naturally
extends associative models of Pavlovian conditioning to a dynamical oscillatory
model where subjects have a greater memory capacity than usually postulated,
but with greater forecast uncertainty. This results in a greater resistance to
learning in the first few sessions followed by an over-optimal response peak
and a sequence of progressively damped response oscillations. We detected the
first peak and trough of the new learning curve in our data, but their
dispersion was too large to also check the presence of oscillations with
smaller amplitude. We ran an unusually long experiment with 32 rats over 3960
trials, where we excluded habituation and other well-known phenomena as sources
of variability in the subjects' performance. Using the data of this and another
Pavlovian experiment by Harris et al. (2015), as an illustration of the
principle we tested the theory against the basic associative single-cue
Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model. We found evidence that the RW model is the best
nonlinear regression to data only for a minority of the subjects, while its
dynamical extension can explain the almost totality of data with strong to very
strong evidence. Finally, an analysis of short-scale fluctuations of individual
responses showed that they are described by random white noise, in contrast
with the colored-noise findings in human performance.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Inducing Partner Preference in Mice by Chemogenetic Stimulation of CA2 Hippocampal Subfield</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social recognition is fundamental for social decision making and the establishment of long-lasting affiliative behaviors in behaviorally complex social groups. It is a critical step in establishing a selective preference for a social partner or group member. C57BL/6J lab mice do not form monogamous relationships, and typically do not show prolonged social preferences for familiar mice. The CA2 hippocampal subfield plays a crucial role in social memory and optogenetic stimulation of inputs to the dorsal CA2 field during a short memory acquisition period can enhance and extend social memories in mice. Here, we show that partner preference in mice can be induced by chemogenetic selective stimulation of the monosynaptic projections from the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to the CA2 during the cohabitation period. Specifically, male mice spend more time in social contact, grooming and huddling with the partner compared to a novel female. Preference was not induced by prolonging the cohabitation period and allowing more time for social interactions and males to sire pups with the familiar female. These results suggest that PVN-to-CA2 projections are part of an evolutionarily conserved neural circuitry underlying the formation of social preference and may promote behavioral changes with appropriate stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Merosin deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (MDC1A), or LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-RD), is a recessive disorder resulting from mutations in the LAMA2 gene, encoding for the alpha-2 chain of laminin-211. The disease is predominantly characterized by progressive muscular dystrophy affecting patient motor function and reducing life expectancy. However, LAMA2-RD also comprises a developmentally-associated dysmyelinating neuropathy that contributes to the disease progression, in addition to brain abnormalities; the latter often underappreciated. In this brief review, we present data supporting the impact of peripheral neuropathy in the LAMA2-RD phenotype, including both mouse models and human studies. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying nerve abnormalities and involved in the laminin-211 pathway, which affects axon sorting, ensheathing and myelination. We conclude with some final considerations of consequences on nerve regeneration and potential therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Measures of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) activity have been shown to be sensitive to cognitive function and disease state. However, there is growing evidence that variations in vigilance can lead to pronounced and spatially widespread differences in resting-state brain activity. Unless properly accounted for, differences in vigilance can give rise to changes in resting-state activity that can be misinterpreted as primary cognitive or disease-related effects. In this paper, we examine in detail the link between vigilance and rsfMRI measures, such as signal variance and functional connectivity. We consider how state changes due to factors such as caffeine and sleep deprivation affect both vigilance and rsfMRI measures and review emerging approaches and methodological challenges for the estimation and interpretation of vigilance effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Meta-Analysis of Gray Matter Differences Between Bilinguals and Monolinguals</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bilingualism is of great interest to the neuroscience of language, and understanding the anatomical changes associated with second language learning help inform theories of bilingual advantage across the lifespan. While the literature on structural differences between bilinguals and monolinguals is robust, relatively few studies of gray matter (GM) have directly compared bilinguals with monolinguals in a whole-brain analysis. Overall, this and heterogeneity of study samples and methodology have led to a lack of clear anatomical support for major theories. Here, we engage in an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies of GM for cases that directly compare bilingual and monolingual subjects in a whole-brain analysis. The analysis (sixteen foci, from ten contrasts across eight studies) resulted in one cluster located primarily within the anterior lobe of the right cerebellum. However, when the one pediatric study was removed, the analysis revealed no consistent results across the studies included in this meta-analysis. This suggests that for VBM studies of bilingual and monolingual adults there is considerable heterogeneity of results that complicate the understanding of the bilingual brain. Future studies will need to include larger, more well-defined samples and interrogate more fine-grained anatomical features such as cortical thickness and surface area in order to more fully examine the anatomical changes associated with bilingualism across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Agency and Performance of Reach-to-Grasp With Modified Control of a Virtual Hand: Implications for Rehabilitation</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00126</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study investigated how modified control of a virtual hand executing reach-to-grasp affects functional performance and agency (perception of control). The objective of this work was to demonstrate positive relationships between reaching performance and grasping agency and motivate greater consideration of agency in movement rehabilitation. We hypothesized that agency and performance have positive correlation across varying control modes of the virtual hand. In this study, each participant controlled motion of a virtual hand through motion of his or her own hand. Control of the virtual hand was modified according to a specific control mode. Each mode involved the virtual hand moving at a modified speed, having noise, or including a level of automation. These specific modes represent potential control features to adapt for a rehabilitation device such as a prosthetic arm and hand. In this study, significant changes in agency and performance were observed across the control modes. Overall, a significant positive relationship (p &amp;lt; 0.001) was observed between the primary performance metric of reach (tracking a minimum path length trajectory) and an implicit measurement of agency (intentional binding). Intentional binding was assessed through participant perceptions of time-intervals between grasp contact and a sound event. Other notable findings include improved movement efficiency (increased smoothness, reduced acceleration) during expression of higher agency and shift toward greater implicit versus explicit agency with higher control speed. Positively relating performance and agency incentivizes control adaptation of powered movement devices, such as prostheses or exoskeletons, to maximize both user engagement and functional performance. Agency-based approaches may foster user-device integration at a cognitive level and facilitate greater clinical retention of the device. Future work should identify robust and automated methods to adapt device control for increased agency. Objectives include how virtual reality (VR) may identify optimal control of real-world devices and assessing real-time agency from neurophysiological signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that neurons can represent sensory input using probability distributions and neural circuits can perform probabilistic inference. Lateral connections between neurons have been shown to have non-random connectivity and modulate responses to stimuli within the classical receptive field. Large-scale efforts mapping local cortical connectivity describe cell type specific connections from inhibitory neurons and like-to-like connectivity between excitatory neurons. To relate the observed connectivity to computations, we propose a neuronal network model that approximates Bayesian inference of the probability of different features being present at different image locations. We show that the lateral connections between excitatory neurons in a circuit implementing contextual integration in this should depend on correlations between unit activities, minus a global inhibitory drive. The model naturally suggests the need for two types of inhibitory gates (normalization, surround inhibition). First, using natural scene statistics and classical receptive fields corresponding to simple cells parameterized with data from mouse primary visual cortex, we show that the predicted connectivity qualitatively matches with that measured in mouse cortex: neurons with similar orientation tuning have stronger connectivity, and both excitatory and inhibitory connectivity have a modest spatial extent, comparable to that observed in mouse visual cortex. We incorporate lateral connections learned using this model into convolutional neural networks. Features are defined by supervised learning on the task, and the lateral connections provide an unsupervised learning of feature context in multiple layers. Since the lateral connections provide contextual information when the feedforward input is locally corrupted, we show that incorporating such lateral connections into convolutional neural networks makes them more robust to noise and leads to better performance on noisy versions of the MNIST dataset. Decomposing the predicted lateral connectivity matrices into low-rank and sparse components introduces additional cell types into these networks. We explore effects of cell-type specific perturbations on network computation. Our framework can potentially be applied to networks trained on other tasks, with the learned lateral connections aiding computations implemented by feedforward connections when the input is unreliable and demonstrate the potential usefulness of combining supervised and unsupervised learning techniques in real-world vision tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: GABAergic Input From the Basal Forebrain Promotes the Survival of Adult-Born Neurons in the Mouse Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00017</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A unique feature of the olfactory system is the continuous generation and integration of new neurons throughout adulthood. Adult-born neuron survival and integration is dependent on activity and sensory experience, which is largely mediated by early synaptic inputs that adult-born neurons receive upon entering the olfactory bulb (OB). As in early postnatal development, the first synaptic inputs onto adult-born neurons are GABAergic. However, the specific sources of early synaptic GABA and the influence of specific inputs on adult-born neuron development are poorly understood. Here, we use retrograde and anterograde viral tracing to reveal robust GABAergic projections from the basal forebrain horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB) to the granule cell layer (GCL) and glomerular layer (GL) of the mouse OB. Whole-cell electrophysiological recordings indicate that these projections target interneurons in the GCL and GL, including adult-born granule cells (abGCs). Recordings from birth-dated abGCs reveal a developmental time course in which HDB GABAergic input onto abGCs emerges as the neurons first enter the OB, and strengthens throughout the critical period of abGC development. Finally, we show that removing GABAergic signaling from HDB neurons results in decreased abGC survival. Together these data show that GABAergic projections from the HDB synapse onto immature abGCs in the OB to promote their survival through the critical period, thus representing a source of long-range input modulating plasticity in the adult OB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Sonic Hedgehog Signaling Agonist (SAG) Triggers BDNF Secretion and Promotes the Maturation of GABAergic Networks in the Postnatal Rat Hippocampus</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling plays critical roles during early central nervous system development, such as neural cell proliferation, patterning of the neural tube and neuronal differentiation. While Shh signaling is still present in the postnatal brain, the roles it may play are, however, largely unknown. In particular, Shh signaling components are found at the synaptic junction in the maturing hippocampus during the first two postnatal weeks. This period is characterized by the presence of ongoing spontaneous synaptic activity at the cellular and network levels thought to play important roles in the onset of neuronal circuit formation and synaptic plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that non-canonical Shh signaling increases the frequency of the synchronized electrical activity called Giant Depolarizing Potentials (GDP) and enhances spontaneous GABA post-synaptic currents in the rodent hippocampus during the early postnatal period. This effect is mediated specifically through the Shh co-receptor Smoothened via intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signal and the activation of the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway. Given the importance of these spontaneous events on neuronal network maturation and refinement, this study opens new perspectives for Shh signaling on the control of early stages of postnatal brain maturation and physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Exercise Attenuates Brain Aging by Rescuing Down-Regulated Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling in Aged Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Down-regulated Wnt signaling is involved in brain aging with declined cognitive capacity due to its modulation on neuronal function and synaptic plasticity. However, the molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In the present study, the naturally aged rat model was established by feeding rats from 6 months old to 21 months old. The cognitive capacity of aged rats was compared with young rats as the controls and the aged rats upon 12-week exercise interventions including treadmill running, resistance exercise, and alternating exercise with resistance exercise and treadmill running. Wnt signaling was examined in hippocampal tissues of the rats from different groups. Results indicated that the expression of Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) as an antagonist of Wnt signal pathway, the activation of GSK-3β, and the hyperphosphorylated Tau were markedly increased as the extension of age. Meanwhile, higher p-β-catenin&lt;sup&gt;Ser33, 37, Thr41&lt;/sup&gt; promoted neuronal degradation of aged rats. In contrast, three kinds of exercise interventions rescued the abnormal expression of DKK-1 and synaptophysin such as PSD-93 and PSD-95 in hippocampal tissues of the aged rats; especially 12-week treadmill running suppressed DKK-1 up-regulation, GSK-3β activation, β-catenin phosphorylation, and hyperphosphorylated Tau. In addition, the down-regulated PI3K/AKT and Wnt signal pathways were observed in aged rats, but could be reversed by resistance exercise and treadmill running. Moreover, the increased Bax and reduced Bcl-2 levels in hippocampal tissues of aged rats were also reversed upon treadmill running intervention. Taken together, down-regulated Wnt signaling suppressed PI3K/Akt signal pathway, aggravated synaptotoxicity, induced neuron apoptosis, and accelerated cognitive impairment of aged rats. However, exercise interventions, especially treadmill running, can attenuate their brain aging process via restoring Wnt signaling and corresponding targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Serotonin signaling by maternal neurons upon stress ensures progeny survival</title>

	<description>Germ cells are vulnerable to stress. Therefore, how organisms protect their future progeny from damage in a fluctuating environment is a fundamental question in biology. We show that in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, serotonin released by maternal neurons during stress ensures the viability and stress resilience of future offspring. Serotonin acts through a signal transduction pathway conserved between &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; and mammalian cells to enable the transcription factor HSF1 to alter chromatin in soon-to-be fertilized germ cells by recruiting the histone chaperone FACT, displacing histones, and initiating protective gene expression. Without serotonin release by maternal neurons, FACT is not recruited by HSF1 in germ cells, transcription occurs but is delayed, and progeny of stressed &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;mothers fail to complete development. These studies uncover a novel mechanism by which stress sensing by neurons is coupled to transcription response times of germ cells to protect future offspring.</description>

	<title>eLife: Opponent regulation of action performance and timing by striatonigral and striatopallidal pathways</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54831</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54831</link>
	<description>The basal ganglia have been implicated in action selection and timing, but the relative contributions of the striatonigral (direct) and striatopallidal (indirect) pathways to these functions remain unclear. We investigated the effects of optogenetic stimulation of D1+ (direct) and A2A+ (indirect) neurons in the ventrolateral striatum in head-fixed mice on a fixed time reinforcement schedule. Direct pathway stimulation initiates licking, whereas indirect pathway stimulation suppresses licking and results in rebound licking after stimulation. Moreover, direct and indirect pathways also play distinct roles in timing. Direct pathway stimulation produced a resetting of the internal timing process, whereas indirect pathway stimulation transiently paused timing, and proportionally delayed the next bout of licking. Our results provide evidence for the continuous and opposing contributions of the direct and indirect pathways in the production and timing of reward-guided behavior.</description>

	<title>eLife: R-spondin signalling is essential for the maintenance and differentiation of mouse nephron progenitors</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53895</link>
	<description>During kidney development, WNT/b-catenin signalling has to be tightly controlled to ensure proliferation and differentiation of nephron progenitor cells. Here we show in mice that the signalling molecules RSPO1 and RSPO3 act in a functionally redundant manner to permit WNT/b-catenin signalling and their genetic deletion leads to a rapid decline of nephron progenitors. By contrast, tissue specific deletion in cap mesenchymal cells abolishes mesenchyme to epithelial transition (MET) that is linked to a loss of &lt;i&gt;Bmp7&lt;/i&gt; expression, absence of SMAD1/5 phosphorylation and a concomitant failure to activate &lt;i&gt;Lef1, Fgf8&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wnt4, &lt;/i&gt;thus explaining the observed phenotype on a molecular level. Surprisingly, the full knockout of LGR4/5/6, the cognate receptors of R-spondins, only mildly affects progenitor numbers, but does not interfere with MET. Taken together our data demonstrate key roles for R-spondins in permitting stem cell maintenance and differentiation and reveal &lt;i&gt;Lgr&lt;/i&gt;-dependent and independent functions for these ligands during kidney formation.</description>

	<title>eLife: High-fat diet enhances starvation-induced hyperactivity via sensitizing hunger-sensing neurons in Drosophila</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53103</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53103</link>
	<description>The function of the central nervous system to regulate food intake can be disrupted by sustained metabolic challenges such as high-fat diet (HFD), which may contribute to various metabolic disorders. Previously, we showed that a group of octopaminergic (OA) neurons mediated starvation-induced hyperactivity, an important aspect of food-seeking behavior (Yu et al., 2016). Here we find that HFD specifically enhances this behavior. Mechanistically, HFD increases the excitability of these OA neurons to a hunger hormone named adipokinetic hormone (AKH), via increasing the accumulation of AKH receptor (AKHR) in these neurons. Upon HFD, excess dietary lipids are transported by a lipoprotein LTP to enter these OA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;AKHR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons via the cognate receptor LpR1, which in turn suppresses autophagy-dependent degradation of AKHR. Taken together, we uncover a mechanism that links HFD, neuronal autophagy, and starvation-induced hyperactivity, providing insight in the reshaping of neural circuitry under metabolic challenges and the progression of metabolic diseases.</description>

	<title>eLife: Pre-stimulus phase and amplitude regulation of phase-locked responses is maximized in the critical state</title>

	<description>Understanding why identical stimuli give differing neuronal responses and percepts is a central challenge in research on attention and consciousness. Ongoing oscillations reflect functional states that bias processing of incoming signals through amplitude and phase. It is not known, however, whether the effect of phase or amplitude on stimulus processing depends on the long-term global dynamics of the networks generating the oscillations. Here, we show, using a computational model, that the ability of networks to regulate stimulus response based on pre-stimulus activity requires near-critical dynamics—a dynamical state that emerges from networks with balanced excitation and inhibition, and that is characterized by scale-free fluctuations. We also find that networks exhibiting critical oscillations produce differing responses to the largest range of stimulus intensities. Thus, the brain may bring its dynamics close to the critical state whenever such network versatility is required.</description>

	<title>eLife: Optogenetic control of excitatory post-synaptic differentiation through neuroligin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.52027</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52027</link>
	<description>Neuroligins (Nlgns) are adhesion proteins mediating trans-synaptic contacts in neurons. However, conflicting results around their role in synaptic differentiation arise from the various techniques used to manipulate Nlgn expression level. Orthogonally to these approaches, we triggered here the phosphorylation of endogenous Nlgn1 in CA1 mouse hippocampal neurons using a photoactivatable tyrosine kinase receptor (optoFGFR1). Light stimulation for 24 hr selectively increased dendritic spine density and AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSCs in wild-type neurons, but not in Nlgn1 knock-out neurons or when endogenous Nlgn1 was replaced by a non-phosphorylatable mutant (Y782F). Moreover, light stimulation of optoFGFR1 partially occluded LTP in a Nlgn1-dependent manner. Combined with computer simulations, our data support a model by which Nlgn1 tyrosine phosphorylation promotes the assembly of an excitatory post-synaptic scaffold that captures surface AMPA receptors. This optogenetic strategy highlights the impact of Nlgn1 intracellular signaling in synaptic differentiation and potentiation, while enabling an acute control of these mechanisms.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Circuit mechanisms underlying chronic epilepsy in a mouse model of focal cortical malformation</title>

	<description>How aberrant neural circuits contribute to chronic epilepsy remains unclear. Using a mouse model of focal cortical malformation with spontaneous seizures, we dissected the circuit mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis. Spontaneous and optogenetically induced hyperexcitable bursts in vivo were present in a cortical region distal to (&amp;gt; 1mm) freeze-lesion induced microgyrus, instead of a region near it. ChR2-assisted circuit mapping revealed ectopic interlaminar excitatory inputs from infragranular layers to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons as a key component of the hyperexcitable circuitry. This disrupted balance between excitation and inhibition was prominent in the cortical region distal to the microgyrus. Consistently, the synapses of both parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV) and somatostatin-positive interneurons (SOM) to pyramidal neurons were maladaptive in a layer- and site-specific fashion. Finally, closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of SOM, but not PV, terminated spontaneous spike-wave discharges. Together, these results demonstrate highly site- and cell-type specific synaptic reorganizations underlying chronic cortical epilepsy and provide insights into potential treatment strategies for this devastating neurological disorder.</description>

	<description>Discrimination between predictive and non-predictive threat stimuli decrease as threat intensity increases. The central mechanisms that mediate the transition from discriminatory to generalized threat responding remain poorly resolved. Here, we identify the stress- and dysphoria-associated kappa opioid receptor (KOR) and its ligand dynorphin (Dyn), acting in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as a key substrate for regulating threat generalization. We identified several dynorphinergic inputs to the VTA and demonstrate that projections from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) both contribute to anxiety-like behavior but differentially affect threat generalization. These data demonstrate that conditioned threat discrimination has an inverted -U- relationship with threat intensity and establish a role for KOR/Dyn signaling in the midbrain for promoting threat generalization.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: White matter microstructure across the adult lifespan: A mixed longitudinal and cross-sectional study using advanced diffusion models and brain-age prediction</title>

	<description>The macro- and microstructural architecture of human brain white matter undergo substantial alterations throughout development and ageing. Most of our understanding of the spatial and temporal characteristics of these lifespan adaptations come from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in particular diffusion MRI (dMRI), which enables visualization and quantification of brain white matter with unprecedented sensitivity and detail. However, with some notable exceptions, previous studies have relied on cross-sectional designs, limited age ranges, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based on conventional single-shell dMRI. In this mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal study (mean interval: 15.2 months) including 702 multi-shell dMRI datasets, we combined complementary dMRI models to investigate age trajectories in healthy individuals aged 18 to 94 years (56.98% women). Using linear mixed effect models and machine learning based brain age prediction, we assessed the age-dependence of diffusion metrics, and compared the prediction accuracy of six different diffusion models, including diffusion tensor (DTI) and kurtosis imaging (DKI), neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), spherical mean technique multi-compartment (SMT-mc), and white matter tract integrity (WMTI). The results showed that the age slopes for conventional DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy [FA], medial diffusivity [MD], radial diffusivity [RD]) were largely consistent with previous research, and that all diffusion models indicated lower white matter integrity with older age. Linear mixed effects models and brain age prediction showed that the FA fine metric of the RSI model and orientation dispersion (OD) metric of the NODDI model showed highest sensitivity to age. The results indicate that advanced diffusion models (DKI, NODDI, RSI, SMT mc, WMTI) yield the capability of detecting sensitive measures of age-related microstructural changes of white matter in the brain that complement and extend the contribution of conventional DTI. Key words: ageing, white matter, multi-shell, longitudinal, diffusion, brain age</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Non-bursting non-rhythmic neurons of the ventral pallidum form cell assemblies and respond to reward and punishment during Pavlovian conditioning</title>

	<description>The ventral pallidum (VP) is a major hub interfacing striatopallidal and limbic circuits, conveying information about salience and valence crucial to adjusting behavior. However, how neuron populations of the VP with different firing properties represent these variables is not fully understood. Therefore, we trained mice on auditory Pavlovian conditioning and recorded the activity of VP neurons while mice were performing the task. Many VP neurons responded to punishment (51%) and reward (44%), either by firing rate increase or decrease. Additionally, 20% of cells responded to outcome-predicting auditory stimuli, showing larger responses to reward-predicting cues compared to those that signaled likely punishment. We found that a large subset of VP neurons showed burst firing based on their auto-correlograms, while a small population exhibited fast rhythmic discharge in the beta/gamma frequency range. Some bursting neurons exhibited distinct response properties of their bursts and single spikes, suggesting a multiplexed coding scheme in the VP. However, non-bursting, non-rhythmic neurons were the most sensitive to reward and punishment. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of synchronously firing neuron assemblies in the VP. Neurons participating in such assemblies were particularly responsive to reinforcing stimuli. This suggests that a synchronous, non-bursting, non-rhythmic neuron population of the VP is responsible for the lion's share of ventral pallidal salience representation, likely important for reinforcement learning.</description>

	<description>Perineuronal Nets (PNNs) are extracellular matrix (ECM) structures that envelop neurons and regulate synaptic functions. Long thought to be stable structures, PNNs have been recently shown to respond dynamically during learning, potentially regulating the formation of new synapses. We postulated that PNNs may vary during sleep, a period of active synaptic modification. Notably, PNN components are cleaved by matrix proteases such as the protease cathepsin-S, synthesized by microglia. Cathepsin-S is expressed in a diurnal manner in the mouse cortex, coinciding with dendritic spine density rhythms. Thus, cathepsin-S may induce PNN remodeling during sleep, mediating synaptic reorganization. These studies were designed to test the hypothesis that PNN numbers vary in a diurnal manner in the rodent and human brain, and in a circadian manner in the rodent brain, in association with cathepsin-S expression rhythms coinciding with reported rhythms in synaptic plasticity. In mice, we observed diurnal and circadian rhythms of PNNs labeled with the lectin wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA+PNNs) in several brain regions involved in emotional memory processing. Sleep deprivation prevented the daytime decrease of WFA+ PNNs. Diurnal rhythms of cathepsin-S expression in microglia were observed in the same brain regions, opposite to PNN rhythms. Finally, incubation of mouse sections with cathepsin-S eliminated PNN labeling. In humans, WFA+PNNs showed a diurnal rhythm in the amygdala and thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Our results demonstrate that PNNs vary in a circadian manner that coincides with expression rhythms of cathepsin-S in the mouse hippocampus. We suggest that rhythmic modification of PNNs may contribute to memory consolidation during sleep.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Network communication models improve the behavioral and functional predictive utility of the human structural connectome</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.21.053702v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The structure and function of the human connectome are coupled, but the correspondence is far from exact. We aimed to establish whether accounting for polysynaptic (multi-hop) paths in structural brain networks would improve prediction of interindividual variation in behavior as well as the strength of coupling with functional brain networks. Diffusion-weighted MRI and tractography were used to map structural connectomes for 889 healthy adults participating in the Human Connectome Project. To account for polysynaptic transmission, paths between unconnected pairs of regions were identified using each of 15 candidate models of brain network communication, giving rise to 15 communication matrices for each individual. Communication matrices were (i) used to perform predictions of five data-driven behavioral dimensions and (ii) correlated to interregional resting-state functional connectivity (FC). While FC was the most accurate predictor of behavior, network communication models improved the performance of structural connectivity. Communicability and navigation typically led to the most accurate behavioral predictions amongst the explored communication models. Accounting for polysynaptic communication in structural brain networks also significantly strengthened structure-function coupling in the human connectome. We observed that parcellation resolution and whether analyses were performed on individual- or population-level structural connectivity matrices had marked influence on the strength of associations to FC. Despite these effects, navigation and shortest paths produced consistently top-ranking FC predictions, leading to 35-65% improvements in structure-function coupling. Combining behavioral and functional results into a single ranking of communication models positioned navigation as the top model, suggesting that it may more faithfully recapitulate underlying neural signaling patterns. We conclude that network communication models augment the functional and behavioral predictive utility of the human structural connectome and contribute to narrowing the gap between brain structure and function.</description>

	<description>Human brain activity is not merely responsive to environmental context but includes intrinsic dynamics, as suggested by the discovery of functionally meaningful neural networks at rest, i.e., even without explicit engagement of the corresponding function. Yet, the neurophysiological coupling mechanisms distinguishing intrinsic (i.e., task-invariant) from extrinsic (i.e., task-dependent) brain networks remain indeterminate. Here, we investigated functional brain integration using magnetoencephalography throughout rest and various tasks recruiting different functional systems and modulating perceptual/cognitive loads. We demonstrated that two distinct modes of neural communication continually operate in parallel: extrinsic coupling supported by phase synchronization and intrinsic integration encoded in amplitude correlation. Intrinsic integration also contributes to phase synchronization, especially over short (second-long) timescales, through modulatory effects of amplitude correlation. Our study establishes the foundations of a novel conceptual framework for human brain function that fundamentally relies on electrophysiological features of functional integration. This framework blurs the boundary between resting-state and task-related neuroimaging.</description>

	<description>Detecting and correcting incorrect body movements is an essential part of everyday interaction with one's environment. The human brain has a constant monitoring system that controls and adjusts our actions according to our surroundings. However, when our brain's predictions about a planned action do not match the sensory inputs resulting from that action, cognitive conflict occurs. Much is known about cognitive conflict in 1D/2D environments; however, less is known about the role of movement characteristics on cognitive conflict in 3D environment. Hence, we devised an object selection task in a virtual reality environment to test how the velocity of hand movements impact a number of brain responses. From a series of analyses of EEG recordings synchronized with motion capture, we found that the velocity of the participants' hand movements modulated the brain's proprioception during the task and induced prediction error negativity. Additionally, prediction error negativity originates in the anterior cingulate cortex and is itself modulated by the ballistic phase of the hand's movement. These findings suggest that velocity is an essential component of integrating hand movements with visual and proprioceptive information during interactions with real and virtual objects.</description>

	<description>Quantitatively characterising brain-wide connectivity of neural circuits is of vital importance in understanding the function of the mammalian cortex. Here we have designed an analytical approach to examine data from hierarchical segmentation ontologies, and applied it in the comparison of long-range presynaptic connectivity onto excitatory and inhibitory neurons in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We find that long-range connections onto these two general cell classes in L2/3 originate from highly similar brain regions, and in similar proportions, when compared to input to layer 6. These anatomical data suggest that distal information received by excitatory and inhibitory networks is highly homogenous in L2/3.</description>

	<description>How the brain dynamics transition during anesthetic-induced altered states of consciousness is not completely understood. The 2 adrenergic agonist is a unique anesthetic that generates unconsciousness selectively through 2 adrenergic receptors and related circuits. We studied intracortical neuronal dynamics during transitions of loss of consciousness (LOC) with the 2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine and return of consciousness (ROC) in a functionally interconnecting somatosensory and ventral premotor network in non-human primates. LOC, ROC and full task performance recovery were all associated with distinct neural changes. The early recovery demonstrated characteristic intermediate dynamics distinguished by sustained high spindle activities. Awakening by the 2 adrenergic antagonist completely eliminated this intermediate state and instantaneously restored awake dynamics and the top task performance while the anesthetic was still being infused. The results suggest that instantaneous functional recovery is possible following anesthetic-induced unconsciousness and the intermediate recovery state is not a necessary path for the brain recovery.</description>

	<description>Several theories propose that emotions and self-awareness arise from the integration of internal and external signals and their respective precision-weighted expectations. Supporting these mechanisms, research indicates that the brain uses temporal cues from cardiac signals to predict auditory stimuli, and that these predictions and their prediction errors can be observed in the scalp heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP). We investigated the effect of precision modulations on these cross-modal predictive mechanisms, via attention and interoceptive ability. We presented auditory sequences at short (perceived synchronous) or long (perceived asynchronous) cardio-audio delays, with half of the trials including an omission. Participants attended to the cardio-audio synchronicity of the tones (internal attention) or the auditory stimuli alone (external attention). Comparing HEPs during omissions allowed for the observation of pure predictive signals, without contaminating auditory input. We observed an early effect of cardio-audio delay, reflecting a difference in heartbeat-driven expectations. We also observed a larger positivity to omissions of sounds perceived as synchronous than to omissions of sounds perceived as asynchronous when attending internally only, consistent with the role of attentional precision for enhancing predictions. These results provide support for attentionally-modulated cross-modal predictive coding, and suggest a potential tool for investigating its role in emotion and self-awareness.</description>

	<description>In the field of neurobiology of language, neuroimaging studies are generally based on stimulation paradigms consisting of at least two different conditions. Depending on the desired evaluation, these conditions, in turn, have to contain dozens of items to achieve a good signal to noise ratio. Designing those paradigms can be very time-consuming. Subsequently, a group of participants is stimulated with the new paradigm, while brain activity is assessed, e.g. with EEG/MEG. The measured data are then pre-processed and finally contrasted according to the different stimulus conditions. In this way, only a limited number of analyses and hypothesis tests can be performed, while for alternative or further analyses, completely new paradigms usually need to be designed. This traditional approach is necessarily data-limited, and the cost-benefit ratio is therefore rather poor. In contrast, in computational linguistics analyses are based on text corpora, which allow a vast variety of hypotheses to be tested by repeatedly re-evaluating the data set. Furthermore, text corpora also allow exploratory data analysis in order to generate new hypotheses. By combining the two approaches, we here present a unified approach of continuous natural speech and MEG to generate a corpus-like database of speech-evoked neuronal activity.</description>

	<description>Investigating how visual inputs are encoded in visual cortex is important for elucidating the roles of cell populations in circuit computations. We here use a recently developed, large-scale model of mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and perturb both single neurons as well as functional- and cell-type defined population of neurons to mimic equivalent optogenetic perturbations. First, perturbations were performed to study the functional roles of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons in inter-laminar interactions. We observed activity changes consistent with the canonical cortical model (Douglas and Martin 1991). Second, single neuron perturbations in layer 2/3 revealed a center-surround inhibition-dominated effect, consistent with recent experiments. Finally, perturbations of multiple excitatory layer 2/3 neurons during visual stimuli of varying contrasts indicated that the V1 model has both efficient and robust coding features. The circuit transitions from predominantly broad like-to-like inhibition at high contrasts to predominantly specific like-to-like excitation at low contrasts. These in silico results demonstrate how the circuit can shift from redundancy reduction to robust codes as a function of stimulus contrast.</description>

	<description>The extent to which brain functions are localized or distributed is a foundational question in neuroscience. In the human brain, common fMRI methods such as cluster correction, atlas parcellation, and anatomical searchlight are biased by design toward finding localized representations. Here we introduce the functional searchlight approach as an alternative to anatomical searchlight analysis, the most commonly used exploratory multivariate fMRI technique. Functional searchlight removes any anatomical bias by grouping voxels based only on functional similarity and ignoring anatomical proximity. We report evidence that visual and auditory features from deep neural networks and semantic features from a natural language processing model are more widely distributed across the brain than previously acknowledged. This approach provides a new way to evaluate and constrain computational models with brain activity and pushes our understanding of human brain function further along the spectrum from strict modularity toward distributed representation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Reactive Oxygen Species Modulate Activity-Dependent AMPA Receptor Transport in C. elegans</title>

	<description>The AMPA subtype of synaptic glutamate receptors (AMPARs) play an essential role in cognition. Their function, numbers and change at synapses during synaptic plasticity, is tightly regulated by neuronal activity. Although we know that long-distance transport of AMPARs is essential for this regulation, we do not understand the regulatory mechanisms of it. Neuronal transmission is a metabolically demanding process in which ATP consumption and production are tightly coupled and regulated. Aerobic ATP synthesis unavoidably produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide, which are known modulators of calcium signaling. Although a role for calcium signaling in AMPAR transport has been described, there is little understanding of the mechanisms involved and no known link to physiological ROS signaling. Here, using real-time in vivo imaging of AMPAR transport in the intact C. elegans nervous system, we demonstrate that long-distance synaptic AMPAR transport is bidirectionally regulated by calcium influx and activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Quantifying in vivo calcium dynamics revealed that modest, physiological increases in ROS decrease calcium transients in C. elegans glutamatergic neurons. By combining genetic and pharmacological manipulation of ROS levels and calcium influx, we reveal a mechanism in which physiological increases in ROS cause a decrease in synaptic AMPAR transport and delivery by modulating activity-dependent calcium signaling. Taken together, our results identify a novel role for oxidant signaling in the regulation of synaptic AMPAR transport and delivery, which in turn could be critical for coupling the metabolic demands of neuronal activity with excitatory neurotransmission.</description>

	<description>Theta and gamma rhythms temporally coordinate sequences of hippocampal place cell ensembles during active behaviors, while sharp wave-ripples coordinate place cell sequences during rest. We used a delayed match-to-place memory task to investigate whether such coordination of hippocampal place cell sequences is disrupted when memory errors occur. As rats approached a learned reward location, place cell sequences represented paths extending toward the reward location during correct trials. During error trials, paths coded by place cell sequences were significantly shorter as rats approached incorrect stop locations, with place cell sequences starting at a significantly delayed phase of the theta cycle. During rest, place cell sequences replayed representations of paths that were highly likely to end at the correct reward location during correct but not error trials. The relationship between place cell sequences and gamma rhythms, however, did not differ between correct and error trials. These results suggest that coordination of place cell sequences by theta rhythms and sharp wave-ripples is important for successful spatial memory.</description>

	<description>Anxiety outcomes following traumatic brain injury (TBI) are complex, and the underlying neural mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we developed a multidimensional behavioral profiling approach to investigate anxiety-like outcomes in mice that takes into account individual variability. Departing from the tradition of comparing outcomes in TBI versus sham groups, we identified animals within the TBI group that are vulnerable to anxiety dysfunction by applying dimensionality reduction, clustering and post-hoc validation to behavioral data obtained from multiple assays for anxiety at several post-injury timepoints. These vulnerable animals expressed distinct molecular profiles in the corticolimbic network, with downregulation in GABA and glutamate, and upregulation in NPY markers. Indeed, among vulnerable animals, not resilient or sham controls, severity of anxiety outcomes correlated strongly with expression of molecular markers. Our results establish a foundational approach, with predictive power, for reliably identifying maladaptive anxiety outcomes following TBI and uncovering neural signatures of vulnerability to anxiety.</description>

	<description>Neural network models are an invaluable tool to understand brain function, since they allow to connect the cellular and circuit levels with behaviour. Neural networks usually comprise a huge number of parameters, which must be chosen carefully such that networks reproduce anatomical, behavioural and neurophysiological data. These parameters are usually fitted with off-the-shelf optimization algorithms that iteratively change network parameters and simulate the network to evaluate the changes and improve fitting. Here we propose to invert the fitting process by proceeding from the network dynamics towards network parameters. Firing state transitions are chosen according to the transition graph followed by an agent when solving a given behavioural task. Then, a system of linear equations is constructed from the network firing states and membrane potentials, in such a way that system consistency in guarantee. This allows to uncouple the activity features of the model, like its neurons firing rate and correlation, from the connectivity features and from the task-solving algorithm implemented by the network, allowing to fit these three levels separately. We employed the method to probe the structure-function relationship in a stimuli sequence memory task, finding solution networks where commonly employed optimization algorithms failed. The constructed networks showed reciprocity and correlated firing patterns that recapitulated experimental observations. We argue that the proposed method is a complementary and needed alternative to the way neural networks are constructed to model brain function.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Weight Sensitivity of Temporal SNR Metrics in multi-echo fMRI</title>

	<description>Purpose: In multi-echo fMRI (ME-fMRI), various weighting schemes have been proposed for the combination of the data across echoes. Here we introduce a framework that facilitates a deeper understanding of the weight dependence of temporal SNR measures in ME-fMRI. Theory and Methods: We examine two metrics that have been used to characterize ME-fMRI performance: temporal SNR (tSNR) and multi-echo temporal (metSNR). Both metrics can be described using the generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ) and are predicted to be relatively insensitive to the weights when there is a high degree of similarity between a metric-specific matrix in the GRQ numerator and a metric-independent covariance matrix in the GRQ denominator. The application of the GRQ framework to experimental data is demonstrated using a resting-state fMRI dataset acquired with a multi-echo multi-band EPI sequence. Results: In the example dataset, similarities between the covariance matrix and the metSNR and tSNR numerator matrices are highest in grey matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) voxels, respectively. For representative GM and CSF voxels that exhibit high matrix similarity values, the metSNR and tSNR values, respectively, are both within 4% of their optimal values across a range of weighting schemes. However, there is a fundamental tradeoff, witha high degree of weight sensitivity in the tSNR and metSNR metrics for the representative GM and CSF voxels, respectively. Geometric insight into the observed weight dependencies is provided through a graphical interpretation of the GRQ. Conclusion: A GRQ framework can provide insight into the factors that determine the weight sensitivity of tSNR and metSNR measures in ME-fMRI.</description>

Author summary &lt;p&gt;Recent work has indicated that anthropogenic pollution of floral-scent may have negative impacts on bumblebee foraging behavior. We need quantitative tools to both measure how much pollution of a learned floral-odor bumblebees can tolerate and identify which scent-pollutants are problematic. This study used encoding characteristics of insect olfactory systems to develop a new paradigm for quantifying complex odors. This ‘Compounds Without Borders’ method builds multidimensional vectors of scents based on physiologically relevant physical characteristics of component odorant-compounds. The angular distance between CWB-vectors then provides a single quantitative variable describing how similar (or dissimilar) two complex odors are. This angular representation of odor similarity is predictive of bumblebees’ behavior in an associative odor learning task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ctFPWr22uUU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Mosquitoes are important vectors for pathogens that infect humans and other vertebrate animals. Some aspects of adult mosquito behavior and mosquito ecology play an important role in determining the capacity of vector populations to transmit pathogens. Here, we re-examine factors affecting the transmission of pathogens by mosquitoes using a new approach. Unlike most previous models, this framework considers the behavioral states and state transitions of adult mosquitoes through a sequence of activity bouts. We developed a new framework for individual-based simulation models called MBITES (Mosquito Bout-based and Individual-based Transmission Ecology Simulator). In MBITES, it is possible to build models that simulate the behavior and ecology of adult mosquitoes in exquisite detail on complex resource landscapes generated by spatial point processes. We also developed an ordinary differential equation model which is the Kolmogorov forward equations for models developed in MBITES under a specific set of simplifying assumptions. While mosquito infection and pathogen development are one possible part of a mosquito’s state, that is not our main focus. Using extensive simulation using some models developed in MBITES, we show that vectorial capacity can be understood as an emergent property of simple behavioral algorithms interacting with complex resource landscapes, and that relative density or sparsity of resources and the need to search can have profound consequences for mosquito populations’ capacity to transmit pathogens.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4RoPuWiOonc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Transient appearance of Ca2+‐permeable AMPA receptors is crucial for the production of repetitive LTP‐induced synaptic enhancement (RISE) in cultured hippocampal slices</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have previously shown that repetitive induction of long‐term potentiation (LTP) by glutamate (100 μM, 3 min, three times at 24‐hr intervals) provoked long‐lasting synaptic enhancement accompanied by synaptogenesis in rat hippocampal slice cultures, a phenomenon termed RISE (repetitive LTP‐induced synaptic enhancement). Here, we examined the role of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;‐permeable (CP) AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in the establishment of RISE. We first found a component sensitive to the Joro‐spider toxin (JSTX), a blocker of CP‐AMPARs, in a field EPSP recorded from CA3‐CA1 synapses at 2–3 days after stimulation, but this component was not found for 9–10 days. We also observed that rectification of AMPAR‐mediated current appeared only 2–3 days after stimulation, using a whole‐cell patch clamp recording from CA1 pyramidal neurons. These findings indicate that CP‐AMPAR is transiently expressed in the developing phase of RISE. The blockade of CP‐AMPARs by JSTX for 24 hr at this developing phase inhibited RISE establishment, accompanied by the loss of small synapses at the ultrastructural level. These results suggest that transiently induced CP‐AMPARs play a critical role in synaptogenesis in the developing phase of long‐lasting hippocampal synaptic plasticity, RISE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precuneus (PreC; Brodmann area 7), a key hub within the default mode network (DMN) displays amyloid and tau‐containing neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology during the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PreC layer III projection neurons contain lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D (CatD), 14)a marker of neurons vulnerable to NFT pathology. Here we applied single population laser capture microdissection coupled with custom‐designed microarray profiling to determine the genetic signature of PreC CatD‐positive‐layer III neurons accrued from postmortem tissue obtained from the Rush Religious Orders Study (RROS) cases with a premortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Expression profiling revealed significant differential expression of key transcripts in MCI and AD compared to NCI that underlie signaling defects, including dysregulation of genes within the endosomal‐lysosomal and autophagy pathways, cytoskeletal elements, AD‐related genes, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, cholinergic enzyme and receptors, markers of monoamine neurotransmission as well as steroid‐related transcripts. Pervasive defects in both MCI and AD were found in select transcripts within these key gene ontology categories, underscoring the vulnerability of these corticocortical neurons during the onset and progression of dementia. Select PreC dysregulated genes detected via custom‐designed microarray analysis were validated using qPCR. In summary, expression profiling of CatD positive PreC layer III neurons revealed significant dysregulation of a mosaic of genes in MCI and AD that were not previously appreciated in terms of their indication of systems‐wide signaling defects in a key hub of the DMN.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Altered synaptic function is thought to play a role in many neurodegenerative diseases, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms for synaptic dysfunction. The squid giant synapse (SGS) is a classical model for studying synaptic electrophysiology and ultrastructure, as well as molecular mechanisms of neurotransmission. Here, we conduct a multidisciplinary study of synaptic actions of misfolded human G85R-SOD1 causing familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). G85R-SOD1, but not WT-SOD1, inhibited synaptic transmission, altered presynaptic ultrastructure, and reduced both the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles and mobility from the reserved pool (RP) to the RRP. Unexpectedly, intermittent high-frequency stimulation (iHFS) blocked inhibitory effects of G85R-SOD1 on synaptic transmission, suggesting aberrant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling may underlie G85R-SOD1 toxicity. Ratiometric Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging showed significantly increased presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; induced by G85R-SOD1 that preceded synaptic dysfunction. Chelating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; using EGTA prevented synaptic inhibition by G85R-SOD1, confirming the role of aberrant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in mediating G85R-SOD1 toxicity. These results extended earlier findings in mammalian motor neurons and advanced our understanding by providing possible molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets for synaptic dysfunctions in ALS as well as a unique model for further studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In the central nervous system, melastatin transient receptor potential (TRPM) channels function as receptors for the neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PregS). The expression and function of TRPM3 has been explored in adult retina, although its role during development is unknown. We found, during the second postnatal week in mice, TRPM3 immunofluorescence labeled distinct subsets of inner retinal neurons, including a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), similar to what has been reported in the adult. Labeling for a TRPM3 promoter-driven reporter confirmed expression of the TRPM3 gene in RGCs and revealed additional expression in nearly all Müller glial cells. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we show that PregS and the synthetic TRPM3 agonist CIM0216 (CIM) induced prolonged calcium transients in RGCs, which were mostly absent in TRPM3 knock-out (KO) mice. These prolonged calcium transients were not associated with strong membrane depolarizations but induced c-Fos expression. To elucidate the impact of PregS-activation of TRPM3 on retinal circuits we took two sets of physiological measurements. First, PregS induced a robust increase in the frequency but not amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (PSCs). This increase was absent in the TRPM3 KO mice. Second, PregS induced a small increase in cell participation and duration of retinal waves, but this modulation persisted in TRPM3 KO mice, indicating PregS was acting on wave generating circuits independent of TRPM3 channels. Though baseline frequency of retinal waves was slightly reduced in the TRPM3 KO mice, other properties of waves were indistinguishable from wildtype. Together, these results indicate that the presence of neurosteroids impact spontaneous synaptic activity and retinal waves during development via both TRPM3-dependent and independent mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dysregulation of the retromer complex system in Down syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25752?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25752?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Down syndrome (DS) patients develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology by age 40. Although this increased susceptibility to AD in DS is thought to be primarily due to triplication of the amyloid precursor protein located on chromosome 21, the precise molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Recent evidence has implicated defective protein sorting and trafficking secondary to deficiencies in retromer complex proteins in AD pathogenesis. Thus, the objective of the present study is to assess the retromer complex system in DS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human post‐mortem brain tissue and fibroblasts from subjects with DS and healthy controls were examined for the various retromer protein components using western blot analysis and RT‐qPCR.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retromer recognition core proteins were significantly decreased in DS fibroblasts, and in both the hippocampi and cortices of young (age 15‐40 years old) and aged (40‐65 years old) DS subjects compared to controls. Correlation analyses showed a significant inverse relationship between recognition core proteins and levels of soluble forms of Aβ 1‐40 and 1‐42 in both hippocampus (n=33, Spearman=‐0.59 to ‐0.38, p≤0.03 for VPS35, VPS26, VPS29, and VPS26B) and cortex tissue (n=57, Spearman=‐0.46 to ‐0.27, p≤0.04 for VPS35, VPS26, and VPS29) of the same patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that dysregulation of the retromer complex system is an early event in the development of the AD‐like pathology and cognitive decline in DS, and for this reason the system could represent a novel potential therapeutic target for DS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Extra‐Axial Inflammatory Signal in Parameninges in Migraine with Visual Aura</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25731?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25731?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (CSD) underlies the neurobiology of migraine with aura (MWA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal studies reveal networks of microvessels linking brain–meninges–bone marrow. CSD activates the trigeminovascular system, evoking a meningeal inflammatory response. Accordingly, this study examines the upregulation of an inflammatory marker in extra‐axial tissues in migraine with visual aura.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used simultaneously acquired &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C‐PBR28 positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging data of 18kDa translocator protein (an inflammatory marker) in MWA patients (n = 11) who experienced headaches and visual aura in the preceding month. We measured mean tracer uptake (standardized uptake value ratio [SUVR]) in 4 regions of interest comprising the meninges plus the adjacent overlying skull bone (parameningeal tissues [PMT]). These data were compared to healthy controls and patients with pain (chronic low back pain).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MWA had significantly higher mean SUVR in PMT overlying occipital cortex than both other groups, although not in the PMT overlying 3 other cortical areas. A positive correlation was also found between the number of visual auras and tracer uptake in occipital PMT.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong persistent extra‐axial inflammatory signal was found in meninges and calvarial bone overlying the occipital lobe in migraine with visual auras. Our findings are reminiscent of CSD‐induced meningeal inflammation and provide the first imaging evidence implicating inflammation in the pathophysiology of migraine meningeal symptoms. We suspect that this inflammatory focus results from a signal that migrates from underlying brain and if so, may implicate newly discovered bridging vessels that crosstalk between brain and skull marrow, a finding of potential relevance to migraine and other neuroinflammatory brain disorders.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The NK model has been used widely to explore aspects of natural evolution and
complex systems. This paper introduces a modified form of the NK model for
exploring distributed control in complex systems such as organisations, social
networks, collective robotics, etc. Initial results show how varying the size
and underlying functional structure of a given system affects the performance
of different distributed control structures and decision making, including
within dynamically formed structures and those with differing numbers of
control nodes.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Devolutionary genetic algorithms with application to the minimum labeling Steiner tree problem. (arXiv:2004.10048v1 [math.OC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10048</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10048</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper characterizes and discusses devolutionary genetic algorithms and
evaluates their performances in solving the minimum labeling Steiner tree
(MLST) problem. We define devolutionary algorithms as the process of reaching a
feasible solution by devolving a population of super-optimal unfeasible
solutions over time. We claim that distinguishing them from the widely used
evolutionary algorithms is relevant. The most important distinction lies in the
fact that in the former type of processes, the value function decreases over
successive generation of solutions, thus providing a natural stopping condition
for the computation process. We show how classical evolutionary concepts, such
as crossing, mutation and fitness can be adapted to aim at reaching an optimal
or close-to-optimal solution among the first generations of feasible solutions.
We additionally introduce a novel integer linear programming formulation of the
MLST problem and a valid constraint used for speeding up the devolutionary
process. Finally, we conduct an experiment comparing the performances of
devolutionary algorithms to those of state of the art approaches used for
solving randomly generated instances of the MLST problem. Results of this
experiment support the use of devolutionary algorithms for the MLST problem and
their development for other NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10042</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Classical benchmark problems utilize multiple transformation techniques to
increase optimization difficulty, e.g., shift for anti centering effect and
rotation for anti dimension sensitivity. Despite testing the transformation
invariance, however, such operations do not really change the landscape's
&quot;shape&quot;, but rather than change the &quot;view point&quot;. For instance, after rotated,
ill conditional problems are turned around in terms of orientation but still
keep proportional components, which, to some extent, does not create much
obstacle in optimization. In this paper, inspired from image processing, we
investigate a novel graphic conformal mapping transformation on benchmark
problems to deform the function shape. The bending operation does not alter the
function basic properties, e.g., a unimodal function can almost maintain its
unimodality after bent, but can modify the shape of interested area in the
search space. Experiments indicate the same optimizer spends more search budget
and encounter more failures on the conformal bent functions than the rotated
version. Several parameters of the proposed function are also analyzed to
reveal performance sensitivity of the evolutionary algorithms.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Bio-inspired optimization (including Evolutionary Computation and Swarm
Intelligence) is a growing research topic with many competitive bio-inspired
algorithms being proposed every year. In such an active area, preparing a
successful proposal of a new bio-inspired algorithm is not an easy task. Given
the maturity of this research field, proposing a new optimization technique
with innovative elements is no longer enough. Apart from the novelty, results
reported by the authors should be proven to achieve a significant advance over
previous outcomes from the state of the art. Unfortunately, not all new
proposals deal with this requirement properly. Some of them fail to select an
appropriate benchmark or reference algorithms to compare with. In other cases,
the validation process carried out is not defined in a principled way (or is
even not done at all). Consequently, the significance of the results presented
in such studies cannot be guaranteed. In this work we review several
recommendations in the literature and propose methodological guidelines to
prepare a successful proposal, taking all these issues into account. We expect
these guidelines to be useful not only for authors, but also for reviewers and
editors along their assessment of new contributions to the field.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic linear functions on the hypercube are functions which assign to each
bit a positive weight, but the weights change over time. Throughout
optimization, these functions maintain the same global optimum, and never have
defecting local optima. Nevertheless, it was recently shown [Lengler, Schaller,
FOCI 2019] that the $(1+1)$-Evolutionary Algorithm needs exponential time to
find or approximate the optimum for some algorithm configurations. In this
paper, we study the effect of larger population sizes for Dynamic BinVal, the
extremal form of dynamic linear functions. We find that moderately increased
population sizes extend the range of efficient algorithm configurations, and
that crossover boosts this positive effect substantially. Remarkably, similar
to the static setting of monotone functions in [Lengler, Zou, FOGA 2019], the
hardest region of optimization for $(\mu+1)$-EA is not close the optimum, but
far away from it. In contrast, for the $(\mu+1)$-GA, the region around the
optimum is the hardest region in all studied cases.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The recent spreading of coronavirus made many countries impose restrictions
in order to control its dangerous effect on the citizens. We developed a
theoretical dynamical model based on compartmental SIR system with additional
adjustment taken from Flow network and Markov chain frameworks to illustrate
developments and trends based on publicly available data. Based on this Model,
code in R was written and fed by stamped publicly available data from
authorized governmental websites in Spain and in the Nederlands, to compare
trends. Our results show that the 'peak' of infection is already behind us in
both countries, but also demonstrate that there is a danger of rebound of a
spread. It is obvious that measures imposed are giving the results, but we
should be precarious of near future practices and developments since the
majority of population will still be without immunity.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A multi-modal multi-objective optimization problem is a special kind of
multi-objective optimization problem with multiple Pareto subsets. In this
paper, we propose an efficient multi-modal multi-objective optimization
algorithm based on the widely used MOEA/D algorithm. In our proposed algorithm,
each weight vector has its own sub-population. With a clearing mechanism and a
greedy removal strategy, our proposed algorithm can effectively preserve
equivalent Pareto optimal solutions (i.e., different Pareto optimal solutions
with same objective values). Experimental results show that our proposed
algorithm can effectively preserve the diversity of solutions in the decision
space when handling large-scale multi-modal multi-objective optimization
problems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Runtime analysis aims at contributing to our understanding of evolutionary
algorithms through mathematical analyses of their runtimes. In the context of
discrete optimization problems, runtime analysis classically studies the time
needed to find an optimal solution. However, both from a practical and a
theoretical viewpoint, more fine-grained performance measures are needed. Two
complementary approaches have been suggested: fixed-budget analysis and
fixed-target analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we conduct an in-depth study on the advantages and limitations
of fixed-target analyses. We show that, different from fixed-budget analyses,
many classical methods from the runtime analysis of discrete evolutionary
algorithms yield fixed-target results without greater effort. We use this to
conduct a number of new fixed-target analyses. However, we also point out
examples where an extension of the existing runtime result to a fixed-target
result is highly non-trivial.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider the expected runtime of non-elitist evolutionary algorithms
(EAs), when they are applied to a family of fitness functions with a plateau of
second-best fitness in a Hamming ball of radius r around a unique global
optimum. On one hand, using the level-based theorems, we obtain polynomial
upper bounds on the expected runtime for some modes of non-elitist EA based on
unbiased mutation and the bitwise mutation in particular. On the other hand, we
show that the EA with fitness proportionate selection is inefficient if the
bitwise mutation is used with the standard settings of mutation probability.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Embedding computation in molecular contexts incompatible with traditional
electronics is expected to have wide ranging impact in synthetic biology,
medicine, nanofabrication and other fields. A key remaining challenge lies in
developing programming paradigms for molecular computation that are
well-aligned with the underlying chemical hardware and do not attempt to
shoehorn ill-fitting electronics paradigms. We discover a surprisingly tight
connection between a popular class of neural networks (Binary-weight ReLU aka
BinaryConnect) and a class of coupled chemical reactions that are absolutely
robust to reaction rates. The robustness of rate-independent chemical
computation makes it a promising target for bioengineering implementation. We
show how a BinaryConnect neural network trained in silico using well-founded
deep learning optimization techniques, can be compiled to an equivalent
chemical reaction network, providing a novel molecular programming paradigm. We
illustrate such translation on the paradigmatic IRIS and MNIST datasets. Toward
intended applications of chemical computation, we further use our method to
generate a CRN that can discriminate between different virus types based on
gene expression levels. Our work sets the stage for rich knowledge transfer
between neural network and molecular programming communities.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Binary neural networks improve computationally efficiency of deep models with
a large margin. However, there is still a performance gap between a successful
full-precision training and binary training. We bring some insights about why
this accuracy drop exists and call for a better understanding of binary network
geometry. We start with analyzing full-precision neural networks with ReLU
activation and compare it with its binarized version. This comparison suggests
to initialize networks with random bias, a counter-intuitive remedy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Robotic vision is a field where continual learning can play a significant
role. An embodied agent operating in a complex environment subject to frequent
and unpredictable changes is required to learn and adapt continuously. In the
context of object recognition, for example, a robot should be able to learn
(without forgetting) objects of never before seen classes as well as improving
its recognition capabilities as new instances of already known classes are
discovered. Ideally, continual learning should be triggered by the availability
of short videos of single objects and performed on-line on on-board hardware
with fine-grained updates. In this paper, we introduce a novel continual
learning protocol based on the CORe50 benchmark and propose two rehearsal-free
continual learning techniques, CWR* and AR1*, that can learn effectively even
in the challenging case of nearly 400 small non-i.i.d. incremental batches. In
particular, our experiments show that AR1* can outperform other
state-of-the-art rehearsal-free techniques by more than 15% accuracy in some
cases, with a very light and constant computational and memory overhead across
training batches.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Activatable Fluorescence Imaging of Macrophages in Cerebral Aneurysms Using Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Conjugated With Indocyanine Green</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00370</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00370</link>
	<description>Background and Purpose&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is involved in the formation and enlargement of cerebral aneurysms (CAs), with macrophages playing a key role in the process. The present study evaluated visualization of macrophages present in CAs using an activatable fluorescent probe (IONP-ICG) comprising an iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) conjugated with indocyanine green (ICG).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;IONP-ICG was intravenously administered to 15-week-old CA model rats (n = 8), and ex vivo near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging and histological assessment of exposed CAs and cerebral arteries were performed 48 h later. Similar evaluations were performed in the control group, which included CA model rats given IONPs or ICG (n = 8 each).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;ICG-derived NIRF signals were detected in three IONP-ICG group rats but not in IONP or ICG control groups. Among the three rats that exhibited signals, NIRF signal accumulation was observed in the CA of two rats and at the site of hemodynamic stress in the left posterior cerebral artery in one rat. Histologically, NIRF signals correlated strongly with macrophage localization. A total of 13 CAs formed in the IONP-ICG group. The number of macrophages in the CA wall was significantly greater in the two CAs that exhibited NIRF signals compared to the remaining 11 CAs that did not (P = 0.037). Moreover, all 11 CAs that did not exhibit NIRF signals were iron-negative, while the two CAs that exhibited NIRF signals were both iron-positive (P = 0.013).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;NIRF imaging using an activatable IONP-ICG probe is feasible for detecting the macrophage-rich regions in CAs and the cerebral artery wall, which is considered an early lesion in the process of CA formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Spillover Effect of Autonomy Frustration on Human Motivation and Its Electrophysiological Representation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00134</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00134</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is a commonplace that some people may adopt a controlling style, which brings about autonomy frustration to others. Existing studies on autonomy frustration mainly examined its effect in the primary thwarting context, ignoring its potential spillover to subsequent activities. In this study, we examined whether prior autonomy frustration would have a sustaining negative impact on one’s motivation in another autonomy-supportive activity that follows. In this electrophysiological study, participants worked on two irrelevant tasks organized by two different experimenters. We adopted a between-group design and manipulated participants’ autonomy frustration by providing varied audio instructions during Session 1. In Session 2, all participants were instructed to complete a moderately difficult task that is autonomy-supportive instead, and we observed a less pronounced reward positivity (RewP) difference wave and a smaller P300 in the autonomy-frustration group compared with the control group. These findings suggested that the negative influence of autonomy frustration is longstanding and that it can undermine one’s motivation and attention in a following activity that is autonomy-supportive itself. Thus, our findings provided original neutral evidence for the adverse intertemporal effect of autonomy frustration, and suggested important practical implications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spatio-temporal brain activities with variable delay detectable in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) give rise to highly reproducible structures, termed cortical lag threads, that propagate from one brain region to another. Using a computational topology of data approach, we found that persistent, recurring blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in triangulated rs-fMRI videoframes display previously undetected topological findings, i.e., vortex structures that cover brain activated regions. Measure of persistence of vortex shapes in BOLD signal propagation is carried out in terms of Betti numbers that rise and fall over time during spontaneous activity of the brain. Importantly, a topology of data given in terms of geometric shapes of BOLD signal propagation offers a practical approach in coping with and sidestepping massive noise in neurodata, such as unwanted dark (low intensity) regions in the neighborhood of non-zero BOLD signals. Our findings have been codified and visualized in plots able to track the non-trivial BOLD signals that appear intermittently in a sequence of rs-fMRI videoframes. The end result of this tracking of changing lag structures is a so-called persistent barcode, which is a pictograph that offers a convenient visual means of exhibiting, comparing, and classifying brain activation patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: An Investigation of the Free Energy Principle for Emotion Recognition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00030</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper offers a prospectus of what might be achievable in the development of emotional recognition devices. It provides a conceptual overview of the free energy principle; including Markov blankets, active inference, and—in particular—a discussion of selfhood and theory of mind, followed by a brief explanation of how these concepts can explain both neural and cultural models of emotional inference. The underlying hypothesis is that emotion recognition and inference devices will evolve from state-of-the-art deep learning models into active inference schemes that go beyond marketing applications and become adjunct to psychiatric practice. Specifically, this paper proposes that a second wave of emotion recognition devices will be equipped with an emotional lexicon (or the ability to epistemically search for one), allowing the device to resolve uncertainty about emotional states by actively eliciting responses from the user and learning from these responses. Following this, a third wave of emotional devices will converge upon the user's generative model, resulting in the machine and human engaging in a reciprocal, prosocial emotional interaction, i.e., sharing a generative model of emotional states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Anatomy and Connectivity of the Subthalamic Nucleus in Humans and Non-human Primates</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Subthalamic Nucleus (STh) is an oval-shaped diencephalic structure located ventrally to the thalamus, playing a fundamental role in the circuitry of the basal ganglia. In addition to being involved in the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disease, the STh is one of the target nuclei for deep brain stimulation. However, most of the anatomical evidence available derives from non-human primate studies. In this review, we will present the topographical and morphological organization of the nucleus and its connections to structurally and functionally related regions of the basal ganglia circuitry. We will also highlight the importance of additional research in humans focused on validating STh connectivity, cytoarchitectural organization, and its functional subdivision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Nodal and Planar Cell Polarity signaling cooperate to regulate zebrafish convergence and extension gastrulation movements</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54445</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54445</link>
	<description>During vertebrate gastrulation, convergence &amp;amp; extension (C&amp;amp;E) of the primary anteroposterior (AP) embryonic axis is driven by polarized mediolateral (ML) cell intercalations and is influenced by AP axial patterning. Nodal signaling is essential for patterning of the AP axis while Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling polarizes cells with respect to this axis, but how these two signaling systems interact during C&amp;amp;E is unclear. We find that the neuroectoderm of Nodal-deficient zebrafish gastrulae exhibits reduced C&amp;amp;E cell behaviors, which require Nodal signaling in both cell- and non-autonomous fashions. PCP signaling is partially active in Nodal-deficient embryos and its inhibition exacerbates their C&amp;amp;E defects. Within otherwise naïve zebrafish blastoderm explants, however, Nodal induces C&amp;amp;E in a largely PCP-dependent manner, arguing that Nodal acts both upstream of and in parallel with PCP during gastrulation to cooperatively regulate embryonic axis extension.</description>

	<title>eLife: Spatiotemporally precise optogenetic activation of sensory neurons in freely walking Drosophila</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54183</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54183</link>
	<description>Previous work has characterized how walking &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; coordinate the movements of individual limbs (DeAngelis, Zavatone-Veth, and Clark, 2019). To understand the circuit basis of this coordination, one must characterize how sensory feedback from each limb affects walking behavior. However, it has remained difficult to manipulate neural activity in individual limbs of freely moving animals. Here, we demonstrate a simple method for optogenetic stimulation with body side-, body segment-, and limb-specificity that does not require real-time tracking. Instead, we activate at random, precise locations in time and space and use post hoc analysis to determine behavioral responses to specific activations. Using this method, we have characterized limb coordination and walking behavior in response to transient activation of mechanosensitive bristle neurons and sweet-sensing chemoreceptor neurons. Our findings reveal that activating these neurons has opposite effects on turning, and that activations in different limbs and body regions produce distinct behaviors.</description>

	<title>eLife: Partial loss of CFIm25 causes learning deficits and aberrant neuronal alternative polyadenylation</title>

	<description>We previously showed that &lt;i&gt;NUDT21&lt;/i&gt;-spanning copy-number variations (CNVs) are associated with intellectual disability (Gennarino et al., 2015). However, the patients’ CNVs also included other genes. To determine if reduced &lt;i&gt;NUDT21&lt;/i&gt; function alone can cause disease, we generated &lt;i&gt;Nudt21&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice to mimic &lt;i&gt;NUDT21&lt;/i&gt;-deletion patients. We found that although these mice have 50% reduced &lt;i&gt;Nudt21&lt;/i&gt; mRNA, they only have 30% less of its cognate protein, CFIm25. Despite this partial protein-level compensation, the &lt;i&gt;Nudt21&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice have learning deficits, cortical hyperexcitability, and misregulated alternative polyadenylation (APA) in their hippocampi. Further, to determine the mediators driving neural dysfunction in humans, we partially inhibited &lt;i&gt;NUDT21&lt;/i&gt; in human stem cell-derived neurons to reduce CFIm25 by 30%. This induced APA and protein level misregulation in hundreds of genes, a number of which cause intellectual disability when mutated. Altogether, these results show that disruption of &lt;i&gt;NUDT21&lt;/i&gt;-regulated APA events in the brain can cause intellectual disability.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Seasonal weight changes in laboratory ferrets</title>

	<description>Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are a valuable animal model used in biomedical research. Ferrets undergo significant variation in body weight seasonally, affected by photoperiod, and these variations make it difficult to use weight as an indicator of health status. To overcome this requires a better understanding of these seasonal weight changes. We provide a normative weight data set for the female ferret accounting for seasonal changes, and also investigate the effect of fluid regulation on weight change. Thirty nine female ferrets underwent behavioural testing from May 2017 to August 2019 and were weighed daily while housed in an animal care facility with controlled light exposure. In the winter (October to March), animals experienced 10 hours of light and 14 hours of dark, while in summer (March to October), this contingency was reversed. Individual animals varied in their body weight from approximately 700 to 1200 g. However, weights fluctuated with light cycle, with animals losing weight in summer, and gaining weight in winter such that they fluctuated between approximately 80 percent and 120 percent of their long term average weight. Ferrets were weighed as part of their health assessment while experiencing water regulation for behavioural training. Water regulation superimposed additional weight changes on these seasonal fluctuations, with weight loss during the five day water regulation period being greater in summer than winter. These data establish a normative benchmark for seasonal weight variation in female ferrets that can be incorporated into the health assessment of an animal's condition.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Zinc oxide nanoparticles modulate the gene expression of ZnT1 and ZIP8 to manipulate zinc homeostasis and stress-induced cytotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells</title>

	<description>Zinc ions (Zn 2+ ) are important messenger molecules involved in various physiological functions. To maintain the homeostasis of cytosolic Zn 2+ concentration ([Zn 2+ ] c ), Zrt/Irt-related proteins (ZIPs) and Zn 2+ transporters (ZnTs) are the two families of proteins responsible for decreasing and increasing the [Zn 2+ ] c , respectively, by fluxing Zn 2+ across the membranes of the cell and intracellular compartments in opposite directions. Most studies focus on the cytotoxicity incurred by a high concentration of [Zn 2+ ] c and less investigate the [Zn 2+ ] c at physiological levels. Zinc oxide-nanoparticle (ZnO-NP) is blood brain barrier-permeable and elevates the [Zn 2+ ] c to different levels according to the concentrations of ZnO-NP applied. In this study, we mildly elevated the [Zn 2+ ] c by zinc oxide-nanoparticles (ZnO-NP) at concentrations below 1 mg/ml, which had little cytotoxicity, in cultured human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and characterized the importance of Zn 2+ transporters in 6-hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA)-induced cell death. The results show that ZnO-NP at low concentrations elevated the [Zn 2+ ] c transiently in 6 hr, then declined gradually to a basal level in 24 hr. Knocking down the expression levels of ZnT 1 (mostly at the plasma membrane) and ZIP 8 (present in endosomes and lysosomes) increased and decreased the ZnO-NP-induced elevation of [Zn 2+ ] c , respectively. ZnO-NP treatment reduced the basal levels of reactive oxygen species and Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratios; in addition, ZnO-NP decreased the 6-OHDA-induced ROS production, p53 expression, and cell death. Therefore, mild elevations in [Zn 2+ ] c induced by ZnO-NP activate beneficial effects in reducing the 6-OHDA-induced cytotoxic effects. Therefore, brain-delivery of ZnO-NP can be regarded as a potential therapy for neurological disease.</description>

	<description>Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and anxiety disorders. The disruption in the function of the FMR1 gene results in a range of alterations in cellular and synaptic function. Previous studies have identified dynamic alterations in inhibitory neurotransmission in early postnatal development in the amygdala of the mouse model of FXS. Yet little is known how these changes alter microcircuit development and plasticity in the lateral amygdala (LA). Using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, we demonstrate that principal neurons (PNs) in the LA exhibit hyperexcitability with a concomitant increase in the synaptic strength of excitatory synapses in the BLA. Further, reduced feed-forward inhibition appears to enhance synaptic plasticity in the FXS amygdala. These results demonstrate that plasticity is enhanced in the amygdala of the juvenile Fmr1 KO mouse and that E/I imbalance may underpin anxiety disorders commonly seen in FXS and ASDs.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Tgfbr2 in dental pulp cells guides sensory innervation in developing teeth</title>

	<description>Transforming growth factor {beta} (TGF{beta}) plays an important role in tooth morphogenesis and mineralization. Our laboratory established a mouse model in which Tgfbr2 was conditionally deleted in the dental pulp (DP) mesenchyme using an Osterix promoter-driven Cre recombinase (Tgfbr2cko). These mice survived postnatally, but had significant defects in bones and teeth, including reduced mineralization and short roots. H&amp;amp;E staining revealed reduced axon-like structures in the mutant mice. Reporter imaging demonstrated that Osterix-Cre activity was localized within the tooth and was active in the DP and derivatives, but not in neurons. Previous research has established that paracrine signals from the dental pulp attract trigeminal axons toward and into the tooth during postnatal development, yet very little is known about the signals that regulate tooth innervation. Immunofluorescent staining for a neuronal marker, {beta}3 tubulin, was performed on serial cryosections from control and mutant molars at two different postnatal stages. Confocal imaging and pixel quantification of {beta}3 tubulin demonstrated reduced innervation in P7 and P24 Tgfbr2cko first molars compared to controls, indicating that the signals necessary to promote neurite outgrowth were disrupted by Tgfbr2 deletion. Quantitative real time PCR showed that the mRNA expression levels of several neuronal genes were reduced. Lastly, trigeminal neurons were co-cultured atop Transwell filters overlying primary Tgfbr2f/f DP cells. Tgfbr2 in the DP was deleted with an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase. Confocal imaging of axons through the filter pores showed increased axonal sprouting from neurons cultured in the presence of Tgfbr2-positive DP cells compared to neurons cultured alone. Further, axon sprouting was reduced when Tgfbr2 was knocked down in the DP cells. These results indicate that Tgfbr2 in the DP mesenchyme regulates paracrine signals that guide sensory innervation of the tooth.</description>

	<description>Migraine is the third most prevalent disease worldwide and current therapies provide only partial relief. Greater insight into molecular migraine mechanisms would create novel therapies. Cytoskeletal flexibility is fundamental to neuronal-plasticity and is dependent on microtubule dynamicity. Histone-deacetylase-6 (HDAC6) decreases microtubule dynamics by deacetylating its primary substrate, -tubulin. We use validated models of chronic migraine to show that HDAC6-inhibition is an effective migraine treatment and reveal an undiscovered cytoarchitectural basis for migraine chronicity. The human migraine trigger, nitroglycerin, produced chronic migraine-associated pain and decreased neurite growth in pain-processing regions, and these were reversed by HDAC6 inhibition. Cortical spreading depression (CSD), a physiological correlate of migraine aura, also caused decreased cortical neurite growth, while administration of HDAC6-inhibitor restored neuronal complexity and decreased CSD. Our results demonstrate that disruptions in neuronal cytoarchitecture are a feature of chronic migraine, and evolving migraine therapies might include agents that restore microtubule stability and neuronal plasticity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The early development and physiology of Xenopus laevis tadpole lateral line system</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.21.052969v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Xenopus laevis has a lateral line mechanosensory system throughout its full life cycle. Previous studies of the tadpole lateral line system revealed that it may play a role in escape behaviour. In this study, we used DASPEI staining to reveal the location of tadpole lateral line neuromasts. Destroying these neuromasts with neomycin resulted in loss of escape responses in tadpoles. We then studied the physiology of anterior lateral line in immobilised tadpoles. Activating the neuromasts behind one eye could evoke asymmetrical motor nerve discharges when the tadpole was resting, suggestive of turning/escape, followed by fictive swimming. When the tadpole was already producing fictive swimming however, anterior lateral line activation reliably led to the termination of swimming. The anterior lateral line had spontaneous afferent discharges at rest, and when activated showed typical adaptation. There were also efferent activities during tadpole swimming, the activity of which was loosely in phase with ipsilateral motor nerve discharges, implying modulation by the motor circuit from the same side. Calcium imaging experiments located sensory interneurons in the primary anterior lateral line nucleus in the hindbrain. Future studies are needed to reveal how sensory information is processed by the central circuit to determine tadpole motor behaviour.</description>

	<description>Substance use disorders are prevalent and present a tremendous societal cost but the mechanisms underlying addiction behavior are poorly understood and few biological treatments exist. One strategy to identify novel molecular mechanisms of addiction is through functional genomic experimentation. However, results from individual experiments are often noisy. To address this problem, the convergent analysis of multiple genomic experiments can prioritize signal from these studies. In the present study, we examine genetic loci identified in the recombinant inbred (BXD RI) genetic reference population that modulate the locomotor response to cocaine. We then applied the GeneWeaver software system for heterogeneous functional genomic analysis to integrate and aggregate multiple studies of addiction genomics, resulting in the identification of Rab3b, as a functional correlate of the locomotor response to cocaine in rodents. This gene encodes a member of the RAB family of Ras-like GTPases known to be involved in trafficking of secretory and endocytic vesicles in eukaryotic cells. The convergent evidence for a role of Rab3b was included co-occurrence in previously published genetic mapping studies of cocaine related behaviors; methamphetamine response and Cartpt (Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript prepropeptide) abundance; evidence related to other addictive substances; density of polymorphisms; and its expression pattern in reward pathways. To evaluate this finding, we examined the effect of RAB3 complex perturbation in cocaine response. B6;129-Rab3btm1Sud Rab3ctm1sud Rab3dtm1sud triple null mice (Rab3bcd-/-) exhibited significant deficits in habituation, and increased acute and repeated cocaine responses. This previously unidentified mechanism of the behavioral predisposition and response to cocaine is an example of many that can be identified and validated using aggregate genomic studies.</description>

	<description>Neuronal cell diversity is essential to endow distinct brain regions with specific functions. During development, progenitors within these regions are characterised by specific gene expression programs, contributing to the generation of diversity in postmitotic neurons and glia. While the region-specific molecular diversity of neurons and astrocytes is increasingly understood, whether these cells share region-specific programs remains unknown. Here, we show that in the neocortex and thalamus, neurons and astrocytes express shared region-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures. These signatures not only distinguish cells across brain regions but are also detected across substructures within regions, such as distinct thalamic nuclei, where clonal analysis revealed the existence of common nucleus-specific progenitors for neurons and glia. Consistent with their shared molecular signature, regional specificity was maintained following astrocyte-to-neuron reprogramming. A detailed understanding of these regional-specific signatures may thus inform strategies for future cell-based brain repair.</description>

	<description>Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 3 (TRPM3) is a Ca2+ permeable non-selective cation channel activated by heat and chemical agonists such as pregnenolone sulfate and CIM0216. TRPM3 mutations in humans were recently reported to be associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy; the functional effects of those mutations however were not reported. Here we show that both disease-associated mutations of TRPM3 render the channel overactive, but likely via different mechanisms. The Val to Met substitution in the S4-S5 loop induced a larger increase in basal activity and agonist sensitivity at room temperature than the Pro to Gln substitution in the extracellular segment of S6. In contrast, heat activation was increased more by the S6 mutant than by the S4-S5 segment mutant. Both mutants were inhibited by the TRPM3 antagonist primidone, suggesting a potential therapeutic intervention to treat this disease.</description>

The growth of the malaria parasite &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; in human blood causes all the symptoms of malaria. To proliferate, non-motile parasites must have access to susceptible red blood cells, which they invade using pairs of parasite ligands and host receptors that define invasion pathways. Parasites can switch invasion pathways, and while this flexibility is thought to facilitate immune evasion, it may also reflect the heterogeneity of red blood cell surfaces within and between hosts. Host genetic background affects red blood cell structure, for example, and red blood cells also undergo dramatic changes in morphology and receptor density as they age. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; consequences of both the accessibility of susceptible cells, and their heterogeneous susceptibility, remain unclear. Here, we measured invasion of laboratory strains of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; relying on distinct invasion pathways into red blood cells of different ages. We estimated invasion efficiency while accounting for red blood cell accessibility to parasites. This approach revealed different tradeoffs made by parasite strains between the fraction of cells they can invade and their invasion rate into them, and we distinguish “specialist” strains from “generalist” strains in this context. We developed a mathematical model to show that generalist strains would lead to higher peak parasitemias &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; compared to specialist strains with similar overall proliferation rates. Thus, the ecology of red blood cells may play a key role in determining the rate of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; parasite proliferation and malaria virulence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EkcZZAKB4Vg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Structural and molecular insight into the pH-induced low-permeability of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.2 through dewetting of the water cavity</title>

Understanding the gating mechanism of ion channel proteins is key to understanding the regulation of cell signaling through these channels. Channel opening and closing are regulated by diverse environmental factors that include temperature, electrical voltage across the channel, and proton concentration. Low permeability in voltage-gated potassium ion channels (Kv) is intimately correlated with the prolonged action potential duration observed in many acidosis diseases. The Kv channels consist of voltage-sensing domains (S1–S4 helices) and central pore domains (S5–S6 helices) that include a selectivity filter and water-filled cavity. The voltage-sensing domain is responsible for the voltage-gating of Kv channels. While the low permeability of Kv channels to potassium ion is highly correlated with the cellular proton concentration, it is unclear how an intracellular acidic condition drives their closure, which may indicate an additional pH-dependent gating mechanism of the Kv family. Here, we show that two residues E327 and H418 in the proximity of the water cavity of Kv1.2 play crucial roles as a pH switch. In addition, we present a structural and molecular concept of the pH-dependent gating of Kv1.2 in atomic detail, showing that the protonation of E327 and H418 disrupts the electrostatic balance around the S6 helices, which leads to a straightening transition in the shape of their axes and causes dewetting of the water-filled cavity and closure of the channel. Our work offers a conceptual advancement to the regulation of the pH-dependent gating of various voltage-gated ion channels and their related biological functions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5aEdI3jnfI8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: A salt-induced kinase is required for the metabolic regulation of sleep</title>

Many lines of evidence point to links between sleep regulation and energy homeostasis, but mechanisms underlying these connections are unknown. During &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; sleep, energetic stores are allocated to nonneural tasks with a resultant drop in the overall fat stores and energy charge. Mutants lacking KIN-29, the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; homolog of a mammalian Salt-Inducible Kinase (SIK) that signals sleep pressure, have low ATP levels despite high-fat stores, indicating a defective response to cellular energy deficits. Liberating energy stores corrects adiposity and sleep defects of &lt;i&gt;kin-29&lt;/i&gt; mutants. &lt;i&gt;kin-29&lt;/i&gt; sleep and energy homeostasis roles map to a set of sensory neurons that act upstream of fat regulation as well as of central sleep-controlling neurons, suggesting hierarchical somatic/neural interactions regulating sleep and energy homeostasis. Genetic interaction between &lt;i&gt;kin-29&lt;/i&gt; and the histone deacetylase &lt;i&gt;hda-4&lt;/i&gt; coupled with subcellular localization studies indicate that KIN-29 acts in the nucleus to regulate sleep. We propose that KIN-29/SIK acts in nuclei of sensory neuroendocrine cells to transduce low cellular energy charge into the mobilization of energy stores, which in turn promotes sleep.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/WJY3KcJFlug&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroanatomical and neurophysiological mechanisms of acoustic and weakly electric signaling in synodontid catfish&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9cc6877d-1c48-4db9-9de6-30d4d5c2431f/cne24920-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synodontid catfishes use an Elastic Spring Apparatus, including protractor muscles, to produce electric discharges or sounds. Anatomical characterization, together with motoneuron patch‐clamp recordings and protractor muscle EMGs suggest that adaptive changes in peripheral and central characters underlie the transition from an ancestral sound to a derived electric discharge producing system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To what extent do modifications in the nervous system and peripheral effectors contribute to novel behaviors? Using a combination of morphometric analysis, neuroanatomical tract‐tracing, and intracellular neuronal recording, we address this question in a sound‐producing and a weakly electric species of synodontid catfish, &lt;i&gt;Synodontis grandiops&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Synodontis nigriventris&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. The same peripheral mechanism, a bilateral pair of protractor muscles associated with vertebral processes (elastic spring mechanism), is involved in both signaling systems. Although there were dramatic species differences in several morphometric measures, electromyograms provided strong evidence that simultaneous activation of paired protractor muscles accounts for an individual sound and electric discharge pulse. While the general architecture of the neural network and the intrinsic properties of the motoneuron population driving each target was largely similar, differences could contribute to species‐specific patterns in electromyograms and the associated pulse repetition rate of sounds and electric discharges. Together, the results suggest that adaptive changes in both peripheral and central characters underlie the transition from an ancestral sound to a derived electric discharge producing system, and thus the evolution of a novel communication channel among synodontid catfish. Similarities with characters in other sonic and weakly electric teleost fish provide a striking example of convergent evolution in functional adaptations underlying the evolution of the two signaling systems among distantly related taxa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Clinical and MRI Outcome Predictors in Pediatric Anti‐NMDA Receptor Encephalitis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25754?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25754?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate disease symptoms, clinical and MRI findings and to perform longitudinal volumetric MRI analyses in a European multi‐center cohort of pediatric anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (NMDARE) patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied 38 children with NMDARE (median age 12.9years, range:1‐18) and a total of 82 MRI scans for volumetric MRI analyses compared to matched healthy controls. Mixed‐effect models and brain volume z‐scores were applied to estimate longitudinal brain volume development. Ordinal logistic regression and ordinal mixed models were used to predict disease outcome and severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial MRI scans showed abnormal findings in 15/38(39.5%) patients, mostly white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities. Volumetric MRI analyses revealed reductions of whole brain, grey matter as well as hippocampal and basal ganglia volumes in NMDARE children. Longitudinal mixed‐effect models and z‐score transformation showed failure of age‐expected brain growth in patients. Importantly, patients with abnormal MRI findings at onset were more likely to have poor outcome (PCPC score&amp;gt;1, incidence rate ratio (IIR)[95%CI]: 3.50[1.31‐9.31], p=0.012) compared to patients with normal MRI. Ordinal logistic regression models corrected for time from onset confirmed abnormal MRI at onset OR[95%CI]: 9.90[2.51, 17.28]; p=0.009), a presentation with sensorimotor deficits (13.71[2.68, 24.73]; p=0.015), and a treatment delay &amp;gt;4 weeks (5.15[0.47, 9.82]; p=0.031) as independent predictors of poor clinical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children with NMDARE exhibit significant brain volume loss and failure of age‐expected brain growth. Abnormal MRI findings, a clinical presentation with sensorimotor deficits, and a treatment delay &amp;gt;4 weeks are associated with worse clinical outcome. These characteristics represent promising prognostic biomarkers in pediatric NMDARE.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Serial section electron microscopy (ssEM), a technique where volumes of tissue can be anatomically reconstructed by imaging consecutive tissue slices, has proven to be a powerful tool for the investigation of brain anatomy. Between the process of cutting the slices, or &quot;sections,&quot; and imaging them, however, handling 10°–10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; delicate sections remains a bottleneck in ssEM, especially for batches in the &quot;mesoscale&quot; regime, i.e., 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; sections. We present a tissue section handling device that transports and positions sections, accurately and repeatability, for automated, robotic section pick-up and placement onto an imaging substrate. The device interfaces with a conventional ultramicrotomy diamond knife, accomplishing in-line, exact-constraint trapping of sections with 100-μm repeatability. An associated mathematical model includes capillary-based and Stokes-based forces, accurately describing observed behavior and fundamentally extends the modeling of water-air interface forces. Using the device, we demonstrate and describe the limits of reliable handling of hundreds of slices onto a variety of electron and light microscopy substrates without significant defects (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8 datasets composed of 126 serial sections in an automated fashion with an average loss rate and throughput of 0.50% and 63 s/section, respectively. In total, this work represents an automated mesoscale serial sectioning system for scalable 3D-EM connectomics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neuroplasticity forms the basis for neuronal circuit complexity and differences between otherwise similar circuits. We show that the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (&lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt;) plays a central role in intrinsic plasticity of olfactory bulb (OB) projection neurons. Mitral and tufted (M/T) neurons from &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice are hyperexcitable, have a reduced A-type potassium current (I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) and exhibit reduced expression of &lt;i&gt;Kcnd3&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a potassium voltage-gated channel subunit (Kv4.3) important for generating the I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, expression of the &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kcnd3&lt;/i&gt; genes is activity dependent in OB projection neurons and the MITF protein activates expression from &lt;i&gt;Kcnd3&lt;/i&gt; regulatory elements. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice have changes in olfactory habituation and have increased habituation for an odorant following long-term exposure, indicating that regulation of &lt;i&gt;Kcnd3&lt;/i&gt; is pivotal for long-term olfactory adaptation. Our findings show that &lt;i&gt;Mitf&lt;/i&gt; acts as a direct regulator of intrinsic homeostatic feedback and links neuronal activity, transcriptional changes and neuronal function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: ATPase Domain AFG3L2 Mutations Alter OPA1 Processing and Cause Optic Neuropathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25723?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25723?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is the most common inherited optic neuropathy, with a prevalence of 1:12,000 to 1:25,000. &lt;i&gt;OPA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations are found in 70% of DOA patients, with a significant number remaining undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We screened 286 index cases presenting optic atrophy, negative for &lt;i&gt;OPA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations, by targeted next generation sequencing or whole exome sequencing. Pathogenicity and molecular mechanisms of the identified variants were studied in yeast and patient‐derived fibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve cases (4%) were found to carry novel variants in &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2,&lt;/i&gt; a gene that has been associated with autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 28 (SCA28). Half of cases were familial with a dominant inheritance, whereas the others were sporadic, including &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; mutations. Biallelic mutations were found in 3 probands with severe syndromic optic neuropathy, acting as recessive or phenotype‐modifier variants. All the DOA‐associated &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; mutations were clustered in the ATPase domain, whereas SCA28‐associated mutations mostly affect the proteolytic domain. The pathogenic role of DOA‐associated &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; mutations was confirmed in yeast, unraveling a mechanism distinct from that of SCA28‐associated &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; mutations. Patients' fibroblasts showed abnormal OPA1 processing, with accumulation of the fission‐inducing short forms leading to mitochondrial network fragmentation, not observed in SCA28 patients' cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates that mutations in &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; are a relevant cause of optic neuropathy, broadening the spectrum of clinical manifestations and genetic mechanisms associated with &lt;i&gt;AFG3L2&lt;/i&gt; mutations, and underscores the pivotal role of OPA1 and its processing in the pathogenesis of DOA.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: How higher goals are constructed and collapse under stress: a hierarchical Bayesian control systems perspective. (arXiv:2004.09426v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09426</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09426</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we aim to integrate findings from the fields of machine
learning and network science to argue that organisms can be modeled as
hierarchical Bayesian control systems with small world and bottleneck (bow tie)
network structure. The nested hierarchical organization of such networks allows
organisms to form increasingly integrated percepts and concepts of their inner
and outer context, which can be compared to increasingly encompassing
predictive models of the world (goal states), to allow for an optimal control
of actions. We argue that hierarchical Bayesian inference produces a hierarchy
of goal states, from which it follows that organisms must have some form of
`highest goals'. For all organisms, these predictive models involve interior
(self) models, exterior (social) models and overarching (normative) models. We
show how such goals are constructed from progressively lesser goal states and
that goal hierarchies tend to decompose in a top-down manner under severe and
prolonged levels of stress. This loss of high-level control leads to a
disinhibition of subordinate hierarchical levels, producing `critical' behavior
and tipping points (a sudden loss of homeostasis). Such phase transitions
amount either to disease or the death of the organism. This model can be used
to model organisms of any type, including humans. In humans, learning
higher-level world models corresponds to personality development. A top-down
collapse of high-level integrative goal states under stress is identified as a
common factor in all forms of mental disease (psychopathology). The paper
concludes by discussing ways of testing these hypotheses empirically.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;With the rise of machines to human-level performance in complex recognition
tasks, a growing amount of work is directed towards comparing information
processing in humans and machines. These works have the potential to deepen our
understanding of the inner mechanisms of human perception and to improve
machine learning. Drawing robust conclusions from comparison studies, however,
turns out to be difficult. Here, we highlight common shortcomings that can
easily lead to fragile conclusions. First, if a model does achieve high
performance on a task similar to humans, its decision-making process is not
necessarily human-like. Moreover, further analyses can reveal differences.
Second, the performance of neural networks is sensitive to training procedures
and architectural details. Thus, generalizing conclusions from specific
architectures is difficult. Finally, when comparing humans and machines,
equivalent experimental settings are crucial in order to identify innate
differences. Addressing these shortcomings alters or refines the conclusions of
studies. We show that, despite their ability to solve closed-contour tasks, our
neural networks use different decision-making strategies than humans. We
further show that there is no fundamental difference between same-different and
spatial tasks for common feed-forward neural networks and finally, that neural
networks do experience a &quot;recognition gap&quot; on minimal recognizable images. All
in all, care has to be taken to not impose our human systematic bias when
comparing human and machine perception.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A New Intrusion Detection System using the Improved Dendritic Cell Algorithm. (arXiv:2004.09274v1 [cs.CR])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09274</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09274</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) as one of the emerging evolutionary
algorithms is based on the behavior of the specific immune agents; known as
Dendritic Cells (DCs). DCA has several potentially beneficial features for
binary classification problems. In this paper, we aim at providing a new
version of this immune-inspired mechanism acts as a semi-supervised classifier
which can be a defensive shield in network intrusion detection problem. Till
now, no strategy or idea has already been adopted on the GetAntigen() function
on detection phase, but randomly sampling entails the DCA to provide
undesirable results in several cycles in each time. This leads to uncertainty.
Whereas it must be accomplished by biological behaviors of DCs in tissues, we
have proposed a novel strategy which exactly acts based on its immunological
functionalities of dendritic cells. The proposed mechanism focuses on two
items: First, to obviate the challenge of needing to have a preordered antigen
set for computing danger signal, and the second, to provide a novel
immune-inspired idea in order to non-random data sampling. A variable
functional migration threshold is also computed cycle by cycle that shows
necessity of the Migration threshold (MT) flexibility. A significant criterion
so called capability of intrusion detection (CID) used for tests. All of the
tests have been performed in a new benchmark dataset named UNSW-NB15.
Experimental consequences demonstrate that the present schema dominates the
standard DCA and has higher CID in comparison with other approaches found in
literature.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Gelatinase Biosensor Reports Cellular Remodeling During Epileptogenesis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00015</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00015</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Epileptogenesis is the gradual process responsible for converting a healthy brain into an epileptic brain. This process can be triggered by a wide range of factors, including brain injury or tumors, infections, and status epilepticus. Epileptogenesis results in aberrant synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation and seizure-induced cell death. As Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a crucial role in cellular plasticity by remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM), gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) were recently highlighted as key players in epileptogenesis. In this work, we engineered a biosensor to report in situ gelatinase activity in a model of epileptogenesis. This biosensor encompasses a gelatinase-sensitive activatable cell penetrating peptide (ACPP) coupled to a TAMRA fluorophore, allowing fluorescence uptake in cells displaying endogenous gelatinase activities. In a preclinical mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the intrahippocampal kainate injection, ACPPs revealed a localized distribution of gelatinase activities, refining temporal cellular changes during epileptogenesis. The activity was found particularly but not only in the ipsilateral hippocampus, starting from the CA1 area and spreading to dentate gyrus from the early stages throughout chronic epilepsy, notably in neurons and microglial cells. Thus, our work shows that ACPPs are suitable molecular imaging probes for detecting the spatiotemporal pattern of gelatinase activity during epileptogenesis, suggesting their possible use as vectors to target cellular reactive changes with treatment for epileptogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: A Family of Laminin α2 Chain-Deficient Mouse Mutants: Advancing the Research on LAMA2-CMD</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The research on laminin α2 chain-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-CMD) advanced rapidly in the last few decades, largely due to availability of good mouse models for the disease and a strong interest in preclinical studies from scientists all over the world. These mouse models continue to provide a solid platform for understanding the LAMA2-CMD pathology. In addition, they enable researchers to test laborious, necessary routines, but also the most creative scientific approaches in order to design therapy for this devastating disorder. In this review we present animals belonging to the laminin α2 chain-deficient “dy/dy” mouse family (dy/dy, dy&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;/dy&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;, dy&lt;sup&gt;3K&lt;/sup&gt;/dy&lt;sup&gt;3K&lt;/sup&gt;, dy&lt;sup&gt;W&lt;/sup&gt;/dy&lt;sup&gt;W&lt;/sup&gt;, et al.) and a summary of the scientific progress they facilitated. We also raise a few questions that need to be addressed in order to maximize the usefulness of laminin α2 murine mutants and to further advance the LAMA2-CMD studies. We believe that research opportunities offered by the mouse models for LAMA2-CMD will continuously support our efforts to find a treatment for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Experience Creates the Multisensory Transform in the Superior Colliculus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00018</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although the ability to integrate information across the senses is compromised in some individuals for unknown reasons, similar defects have been observed when animals are reared without multisensory experience. The experience-dependent development of multisensory integration has been studied most extensively using the visual-auditory neuron of the cat superior colliculus (SC) as a neural model. In the normally-developed adult, SC neurons react to concordant visual-auditory stimuli by integrating their inputs in real-time to produce non-linearly amplified multisensory responses. However, when prevented from gathering visual-auditory experience, their multisensory responses are no more robust than their responses to the individual component stimuli. The mechanisms operating in this defective state are poorly understood. Here we examined the responses of SC neurons in “naïve” (i.e., dark-reared) and “neurotypic” (i.e., normally-reared) animals on a millisecond-by-millisecond basis to determine whether multisensory experience changes the operation by which unisensory signals are converted into multisensory outputs (the “multisensory transform”), or whether it changes the dynamics of the unisensory inputs to that transform (e.g., their synchronization and/or alignment). The results reveal that the major impact of experience was on the multisensory transform itself. Whereas neurotypic multisensory responses exhibited non-linear amplification near their onset followed by linear amplification thereafter, the naive responses showed no integration in the initial phase of the response and a computation consistent with competition in its later phases. The results suggest that multisensory experience creates an entirely new computation by which convergent unisensory inputs are used cooperatively to enhance the physiological salience of cross-modal events and thereby facilitate normal perception and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) seriously affects a patient’s quality of life, and it is urgent to find a method that can effectively alleviate the PHN of the upper extremity.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To observe the Efficacy of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) to cervical nerve root for PHN in upper extremity under CT guidance.&lt;/p&gt;Study Design&lt;p&gt;Retrospective comparative study.&lt;/p&gt;Setting&lt;p&gt;Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifty patients with PHN in upper extremity were enrolled in Pain Management. Patients were randomized into two groups: cervical nerve root block (A group, n = 25) and cervical nerve root PRF (B group, n = 25). At each observation time, the general characteristics, visual analog scale (VAS), quality of life scores assessment (SF-36), the total efficacy rate, dosage of antiepileptic and narcotic analgesics, and the incidence of complications were followed up.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with the preoperative, the postoperative VAS decreased, the physical component summary (PCS) and the mental component summary (MCS) increased in both groups (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The differences between group B and group A were statistically significant after 1 month, which could be maintained for 1 year (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The total efficacy rate of group A and group B was 52.0% and 80.0% at 1 Year, respectively. The total efficacy rate of group B was higher than that of group A (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The dosage of antiepileptic and narcotic analgesics in group B decreased significantly, and the decline was significant compared with group A (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The incidence of complications between the two groups were similar (P &amp;gt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;CT-guided PRF to cervical nerve root for the treatment of PHN in the upper extremity is safe and effective. PRF can replicate the location of pain, precise positioning, reduce trauma, and increased pain relief rate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Concurrent Imaging of Markers of Current Flow and Neurophysiological Changes During tDCS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00374</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite being a popular neuromodulation technique, clinical translation of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is hampered by variable responses observed within treatment cohorts. Addressing this challenge has been difficult due to the lack of an effective means of mapping the neuromodulatory electromagnetic fields together with the brain’s response. In this study, we present a novel imaging technique that provides the capability of concurrently mapping markers of tDCS currents, as well as the brain’s response to tDCS. A dual-echo echo-planar imaging (DE-EPI) sequence is used, wherein the phase of the acquired MRI-signal encodes the tDCS current induced magnetic field, while the magnitude encodes the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast. The proposed technique was first validated in a custom designed phantom. Subsequent test–retest experiments in human participants showed that tDCS-induced magnetic fields can be detected reliably in vivo. The concurrently acquired BOLD data revealed large-scale networks characteristic of a brain in resting-state as well as a ‘cathodal’ and an ‘anodal’ resting-state component under each electrode. Moreover, ‘cathodal’s BOLD-signal was observed to significantly decrease with the applied current at the group level in all datasets. With its ability to image markers of electromagnetic cause as well as neurophysiological changes, the proposed technique may provide an effective means to visualize neural engagement in tDCS at the group level. Our technique also contributes to addressing confounding factors in applying BOLD fMRI concurrently with tDCS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Modulation on Glutamic Pathway of Frontal-Striatum-Thalamus by rs11146020 and rs3813296 Gene Polymorphism in First-Episode Negative Schizophrenia</title>

	<description>Objectives&lt;p&gt;The frontal-striatum-thalamus pathway is important in the glutamic neural circuit. The hypofunction of GRIN1 and GRIA2 subunits from glutamic receptors has been hypothesized as the primary process in the etiology of schizophrenia. Identified gene polymorphism involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia may uncover relevant mechanism pathways.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We selected two loci of rs11146020 and rs3813296 distributed in GRIN1 and GRIA2 genes and tested their main and interaction effects on causality connections and structural characteristics in the frontal-striatum-thalamus pathway in 55 Han Chinese first-episode negative schizophrenia patients.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We found that: (1) rs11146020 has a significant main effect on the causality connections between the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and rs3813296 mainly influences those of the descending pathway from the prefrontal cortex to the striatum; (2) interaction effect of rs11146020 and rs3813296 on causality connections are located in the ascending pathway from the pallidum to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; and (3) the two loci have effects on the volumes of several regions of this pathway.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our results suggested there is modulation on glutamic frontal-striatum-thalamus pathway by rs11146020 and rs3813296 gene polymorphism. Patients with different genotypes have different neuroimaging characteristics, which indirectly reminded clinicians those patients should receive different clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A New Approach for Noise Suppression in Cochlear Implants: A Single-Channel Noise Reduction Algorithm1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00301</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The cochlea “translates” the in-air vibrational acoustic “language” into the spikes of neural “language” that are then transmitted to the brain for auditory understanding and/or perception. During this intracochlear “translation” process, high resolution in time–frequency–intensity domains guarantees the high quality of the input neural information for the brain, which is vital for our outstanding hearing abilities. However, cochlear implants (CIs) have coarse artificial coding and interfaces, and CI users experience more challenges in common acoustic environments than their normal-hearing (NH) peers. Noise from sound sources that a listener has no interest in may be neglected by NH listeners, but they may distract a CI user. We discuss the CI noise-suppression techniques and introduce noise management for a new implant system. The monaural signal-to-noise ratio estimation-based noise suppression algorithm “eVoice,” which is incorporated in the processors of Nurotron&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Enduro&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;, was evaluated in two speech perception experiments. The results show that speech intelligibility in stationary speech-shaped noise can be significantly improved with eVoice. Similar results have been observed in other CI devices with single-channel noise reduction techniques. Specifically, the mean speech reception threshold decrease in the present study was 2.2 dB. The Nurotron society already has more than 10,000 users, and eVoice is a start for noise management in the new system. Future steps on non-stationary-noise suppression, spatial-source separation, bilateral hearing, microphone configuration, and environment specification are warranted. The existing evidence, including our research, suggests that noise-suppression techniques should be applied in CI systems. The artificial hearing of CI listeners requires more advanced signal processing techniques to reduce brain effort and increase intelligibility in noisy settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Human Cerebrospinal Fluid Induces Neuronal Excitability Changes in Resected Human Neocortical and Hippocampal Brain Slices</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00283</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human cerebrospinal fluid (hCSF) has proven advantageous over conventional medium for culturing both rodent and human brain tissue. In addition, increased activity and synchrony, closer to the dynamic states exclusively recorded in vivo, were reported in rodent slices and cell cultures switching from artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) to hCSF. This indicates that hCSF possesses properties that are not matched by the aCSF, which is generally used for most electrophysiological recordings. To evaluate the possible significance of using hCSF as an electrophysiological recording medium, also for human brain tissue, we compared the network and single-cell firing properties of human brain slice cultures during perfusion with hCSF and aCSF. For measuring the overall activity from a majority of neurons within neocortical and hippocampal human slices, we used a microelectrode array (MEA) recording technique with 252 electrodes covering an area of 3.2 × 3.2 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A second CMOS-based MEA with 4225 sensors on a 2 × 2 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area was used for detailed mapping of action potential waveforms and cell identification. We found that hCSF increased the number of active electrodes and neurons and the firing rate of the neurons in the slices and induced an increase in the numbers of single channel and population bursts. Interestingly, not only an increase in the overall activity in the slices was observed, but a reconfiguration of the network could also be detected with specific activation and inactivation of subpopulations of neuronal ensembles. In conclusion, hCSF is an important component to consider for future human brain slice studies, especially for experiments designed to mimic parts of physiology and disease observed in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Hypothesis and Theory: A Pathophysiological Concept of Stroke-Induced Acute Phase Response and Increased Intestinal Permeability Leading to Secondary Brain Damage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00272</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gut integrity impairment leading to increased intestinal permeability (IP) is hypothesized to be a trigger of critically illness. Approximately 15–20% of human ischemic stroke (IS) victims require intensive care, including patients with impaired level of consciousness or a high risk for developing life-threatening cerebral edema. Local and systemic inflammatory reactions are a major component of the IS pathophysiology and can significantly aggravate brain tissue damage. Intracerebral inflammatory processes following IS have been well studied. Until now, less is known about systemic inflammatory responses and IS consequences apart from a frequently observed post-IS immunosuppression. Here, we provide a hypothesis of a crosstalk between systemic acute phase response (APR), IP and potential secondary brain damage during acute and subacute IS stages supported by preliminary experimental data. Alterations of the acute phase proteins (APPs) C-reactive protein and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and serum level changes of antibodies directed against Escherichia coli-cell extract antigen (IgA-, IgM-, and IgG-anti-E. coli) were investigated at 1, 2, and 7 days following IS in ten male sheep. We found an increase of both APPs as well as a decrease of all anti-E. coli antibodies within 48 h following IS. This may indicate an early systemic APR and increased IP, and underlines the importance of the increasingly recognized gut-brain axis and of intestinal antigen release for systemic immune responses in acute and subacute stroke stages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a kind of regulated cell death (RCD) caused by the redox state disorder of intracellular microenvironment controlled by glutathione (GSH) peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which is inhibited by iron chelators and lipophilic antioxidants. In addition to classical regulatory mechanisms, new regulatory factors for ferroptosis have been discovered in recent years, such as the P53 pathway, the activating transcription factor (ATF)3/4 pathway, Beclin 1 (BECN1) pathway, and some non-coding RNA. Ferroptosis is closely related to cancer treatment, neurodegenerative diseases, ischemia–reperfusion of organ, neurotoxicity, and others, in particular, in the field of neurodegenerative diseases treatment has aroused people’s interest. The nuclear factor E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2/NFE2L2) has been proved to play a key role in neurodegenerative disease treatment and ferroptosis regulation. Ferroptosis promotes the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, while the expression of Nrf2 and its target genes (Ho-1, Nqo-1, and Trx) has been declined with aging; therefore, there is still insufficient evidence for ferroptosis and Nrf2 regulatory networks in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will provide a brief overview of ferroptosis regulatory mechanisms, as well as an emphasis on the mechanism of Nrf2 regulating ferroptosis. We also highlight the role of ferroptosis and Nrf2 during the process of neurodegenerative diseases and investigate a theoretical basis for further research on the relationship between Nrf2 and ferroptosis in the process of neurodegenerative diseases treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Disentangling the Amyloid Pathways: A Mechanistic Approach to Etiology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00256</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyloids are fibrillar protein aggregates associated with diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), type II diabetes and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. The process of amyloid polymerization involves three pathological protein transformations; from natively folded conformation to the cross-β conformation, from biophysically soluble to insoluble, and from biologically functional to non-functional. While amyloids share a similar cross-β conformation, the biophysical transformation can either take place spontaneously via a homogeneous nucleation mechanism (HON) or catalytically on an exogenous surface via a heterogeneous nucleation mechanism (HEN). Here, we postulate that the different nucleation pathways can serve as a mechanistic basis for an etiological classification of amyloidopathies, where hereditary forms generally follow the HON pathway, while sporadic forms follow seed-induced (prions) or surface-induced (including microbially induced) HEN pathways. Critically, the conformational and biophysical amyloid transformation results in loss-of-function (LOF) of the original natively folded and soluble protein. This LOF can, at least initially, be the mechanism of amyloid toxicity even before amyloid accumulation reaches toxic levels. By highlighting the important role of non-protein species in amyloid formation and LOF mechanisms of toxicity, we propose a generalized mechanistic framework that could help better understand the diverse etiology of amyloid diseases and offer new opportunities for therapeutic interventions, including replacement therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Intrastriatal Administration of Exosome-Associated Pathological Alpha-Synuclein Is Not Sufficient by Itself to Cause Pathology Transmission</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00246</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein (α-syn) has been genetically and biochemically linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). There is accumulating evidence that misfolded α-syn species spread between cells in a prion-like manner and seed the aggregation of endogenous protein in the recipient cells. Exosomes have been proposed to mediate the transfer of misfolded α-syn and thus facilitate disease transmission, although the pathological mechanism remains elusive. Here, we investigated the seeding capacity of exosome-associated α-syn, in vivo. Disease-associated α-syn was present in exosome fractions isolated from transgenic A53T mouse brain. However, following intrastriatal injection of such exosomes in wild-type (wt) mice, we were not able to detect any accumulation of endogenous α-syn. In addition, recombinant fibrillar α-syn, when loaded to isolated brain exosomes, induced minor pathological α-syn brain accumulation at 7 months post injection. These data suggest that exosomes neutralize the effect of toxic α-syn species and raise additional questions on their paracrine modulatory role in disease transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Dynamic Responses of Monetary and Social Reward Processes in Adolescents</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adolescence is an essential developmental period characterized by reward-related processes. The current study investigated the development of monetary and social reward processes in adolescents compared with that in children and adults; furthermore, it assessed whether adolescents had different levels of sensitivity to various types of rewards. Two adapted incentive delay tasks were employed for each participant, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. The behavioral results showed that both monetary and social rewards could motivate response speed, and participants were more accurate under the monetary reward condition than under the social reward condition. The behavioral performances of individuals increased with age. For the ERP data, the cue-P3, target-P2, target-P3 and feedback-related negativity (FRN) components were investigated to identify reward motivation, emotional arousal, attention allocation and feedback processing. Children and adolescents showed higher motivation (larger cue-P3) to rewards than adults. Adolescents showed larger emotional responses to rewards; that is, they had larger target-P2 amplitudes than adults and shorter target-P2 latencies than children. Children showed stronger emotional reactivity for monetary rewards than for social rewards. All age groups had stronger attentional control (larger target-P3) under the monetary reward condition than under the social reward condition. The present study sheds light on the neurodevelopment of reward processes in children, adolescents and adults and shows that various reward process stages demonstrate different age-related and reward-type-related characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Path Integration Changes as a Cognitive Marker for Vascular Cognitive Impairment?—A Pilot Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00131</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Path integration spatial navigation processes are emerging as promising cognitive markers for prodromal and clinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, such path integration changes have been less explored in Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI), despite neurovascular change being a major contributing factor to dementia and potentially AD. In particular, the sensitivity and specificity of path integration impairments in VCI compared to AD is unclear. In the current pilot study, we explore path integration performance in early-stage AD and VCI patient groups and hypothesize that: (i) medial parietal mediated egocentric processes will be more affected in VCI; and (ii) medial temporal mediated allocentric processes will be more affected in AD. This cross-sectional study included early-stage VCI patients (n = 9), AD patients (n = 10) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 20). All participants underwent extensive neuropsychological testing, as well as spatial navigation testing. The spatial navigation tests included the virtual reality “Supermarket” task assessing egocentric (body-based) and allocentric (map-based) navigation as well as the “Clock Orientation” test assessing egocentric and path integration processes. Results showed that egocentric integration processes are only impaired in VCI, potentially distinguishing it from AD. However, in contrast to our prediction, allocentric integration was not more impaired in AD compared to VCI. These preliminary findings suggest limited specificity of allocentric integration deficits between VCI and AD. By contrast, egocentric path integration deficits emerge as more specific to VCI, potentially allowing for more specific diagnostic and treatment outcome measures for vascular impairment in dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Species Classification for Neuroscience Literature Based on Span of Interest Using Sequence-to-Sequence Learning Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00128</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Large-scale neuroscience literature call for effective methods to mine the knowledge from species perspective to link the brain and neuroscience communities, neurorobotics, computing devices, and AI research communities. Structured knowledge can motivate researchers to better understand the functionality and structure of the brain and link the related resources and components. However, the abstracts of massive scientific works do not explicitly mention the species. Therefore, in addition to dictionary-based methods, we need to mine species using cognitive computing models that are more like the human reading process, and these methods can take advantage of the rich information in the literature. We also enable the model to automatically distinguish whether the mentioned species is the main research subject. Distinguishing the two situations can generate value at different levels of knowledge management. We propose SpecExplorer project which is used to explore the knowledge associations of different species for brain and neuroscience. This project frees humans from the tedious task of classifying neuroscience literature by species. Species classification task belongs to the multi-label classification which is more complex than the single-label classification due to the correlation between labels. To resolve this problem, we present the sequence-to-sequence classification framework to adaptively assign multiple species to the literature. To model the structure information of documents, we propose the hierarchical attentive decoding (HAD) to extract span of interest (SOI) for predicting each species. We create three datasets from PubMed and PMC corpora. We present two versions of annotation criteria (mention-based annotation and semantic-based annotation) for species research. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves improvements in the final results. Finally, we perform species-based analysis of brain diseases, brain cognitive functions, and proteins related to the hippocampus and provide potential research directions for certain species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cerebral Hemodynamic Responses to the Sensory Conflict Between Visual and Rotary Vestibular Stimuli: An Analysis With a Multichannel Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) System</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory conflict among visual, vestibular, and somatosensory information induces vertiginous sensation and postural instability. To elucidate the cognitive mechanisms of the integration between the visual and vestibular cues in humans, we analyzed the cortical hemodynamic responses during sensory conflict between visual and horizontal rotatory vestibular stimulation using a multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system. The subjects sat on a rotatory chair that was accelerated at 3°/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 20 s to the right or left, kept rotating at 60°/s for 80 s, and then decelerated at 3°/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 20 s. The subjects were instructed to watch white stripes projected on a screen surrounding the chair during the acceleration and deceleration periods. The white stripes moved in two ways; in the “congruent” condition, the stripes moved in the opposite direction of chair rotation at 3°/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e., natural visual stimulation), whereas in the “incongruent” condition, the stripes moved in the same direction of chair rotation at 3°/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e., conflicted visual stimulation). The cortical hemodynamic activity was recorded from the bilateral temporoparietal regions. Statistical analyses using NIRS-SPM software indicated that hemodynamic activity increased in the bilateral temporoparietal junctions (TPJs) and human MT+ complex, including the medial temporal (MT) area and medial superior temporal (MST) area in the incongruent condition. Furthermore, the subjective strength of the vertiginous sensation was negatively correlated with hemodynamic activity in the dorsal part of the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) in and around the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). These results suggest that sensory conflict between the visual and vestibular stimuli promotes cortical cognitive processes in the cortical network consisting of the TPJ, the medial temporal gyrus (MTG), and IPS, which might contribute to self-motion perception to maintain a sense of balance or equilibrioception during sensory conflict.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Histological Confirmation of Myelinated Neural Filaments Within the Tip of the Neurotrophic Electrode After a Decade of Neural Recordings</title>

	<description>Aim&lt;p&gt;Electrodes that provide brain to machine or computer interfacing must survive the lifetime of the person to be considered an acceptable prosthetic. The electrodes may be external such as with electroencephalographic (EEG), internal extracortical such as electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Most intracortical electrodes are placed close to the neuropil being recorded and do not survive years of recording. However, the Neurotrophic Electrode is placed within the cortex and the neuropil grows inside and through the hollow tip of the electrode and is thus trapped inside. Highly flexible coiled lead wires minimize the strain on the electrode tip. Histological analysis includes immunohistochemical detection of neurofilaments and the absence of gliosis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;This configuration led to a decade long recording in this locked-in person. At year nine, the neural activity underwent conditioning experiments indicating that the neural activity was functional and not noise. This paper presents data on the histological analysis of the tissue inside the electrode tip after 13 years of implantation.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This paper is a singular example of histological analysis after a decade of recording. The histological analysis laid out herein is strong evidence that the brain can grow neurites into the electrode tip and record for a decade. This is profoundly important in the field of brain to machine or computer interfacing by implying that long term electrodes should incorporate some means of growing the neuropil into the electrode rather than placing the electrode into the neuropil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cross-Dataset Variability Problem in EEG Decoding With Deep Learning</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-subject variability problems hinder practical usages of Brain-Computer Interfaces. Recently, deep learning has been introduced into the BCI community due to its better generalization and feature representation abilities. However, most studies currently only have validated deep learning models for single datasets, and the generalization ability for other datasets still needs to be further verified. In this paper, we validated deep learning models for eight MI datasets and demonstrated that the cross-dataset variability problem weakened the generalization ability of models. To alleviate the impact of cross-dataset variability, we proposed an online pre-alignment strategy for aligning the EEG distributions of different subjects before training and inference processes. The results of this study show that deep learning models with online pre-alignment strategies could significantly improve the generalization ability across datasets without any additional calibration data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Intrinsic and Synaptic Properties Shaping Diverse Behaviors of Neural Dynamics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00026</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The majority of neurons in the neuronal system of the brain have a complex morphological structure, which diversifies the dynamics of neurons. In the granular layer of the cerebellum, there exists a unique cell type, the unipolar brush cell (UBC), that serves as an important relay cell for transferring information from outside mossy fibers to downstream granule cells. The distinguishing feature of the UBC is that it has a simple morphology, with only one short dendritic brush connected to its soma. Based on experimental evidence showing that UBCs exhibit a variety of dynamic behaviors, here we develop two simple models, one with a few detailed ion channels for simulation and the other one as a two-variable dynamical system for theoretical analysis, to characterize the intrinsic dynamics of UBCs. The reasonable values of the key channel parameters of the models can be determined by analysis of the stability of the resting membrane potential and the rebound firing properties of UBCs. Considered together with a large variety of synaptic dynamics installed on UBCs, we show that the simple-structured UBCs, as relay cells, can extend the range of dynamics and information from input mossy fibers to granule cells with low-frequency resonance and transfer stereotyped inputs to diverse amplitudes and phases of the output for downstream granule cells. These results suggest that neuronal computation, embedded within intrinsic ion channels and the diverse synaptic properties of single neurons without sophisticated morphology, can shape a large variety of dynamic behaviors to enhance the computational ability of local neuronal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Distinct Synchronous Network Activity During the Second Postnatal Week of Medial Entorhinal Cortex Development</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00091</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00091</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) contains specialized cell types whose firing is tuned to aspects of an animal’s position and orientation in the environment, reflecting a neuronal representation of space. The spatially tuned firing properties of these cells quickly emerge during the third postnatal week of development in rodents. Spontaneous synchronized network activity (SSNA) has been shown to play a crucial role in the development of neuronal circuits prior to week 3. SSNA in MEC is well described in rodents during the first postnatal week, but there are little data about its development immediately prior to eye opening and spatial exploration. Furthermore, existing data lack single-cell resolution and are not integrated across layers. In this study, we addressed the question of whether the characteristics and underlying mechanisms of SSNA during the second postnatal week resemble that of the first week or whether distinct features emerge during this period. Using a combined calcium imaging and electrophysiology approach in vitro, we confirm that in mouse MEC during the second postnatal week, SSNA persists and in fact peaks, and is dependent on ionotropic glutamatergic signaling. However, SSNA differs from that observed during the first postnatal week in two ways: First, EC does not drive network activity in the hippocampus but only in neighboring neocortex (NeoC). Second, GABA does not drive network activity but influences it in a manner that is dependent both on age and receptor type. Therefore, we conclude that while there is a partial mechanistic overlap in SSNA between the first and second postnatal weeks, unique mechanistic features do emerge during the second week, suggestive of different or additional functions of MEC within the hippocampal-entorhinal circuitry with increasing maturation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Quantitative Imaging of Changes in Astrocytic and Neuronal Adenosine Triphosphate Using Two Different Variants of ATeam</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00080</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00080</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genetically encoded nanosensors such as the FRET-based adenosine triphosphate (ATP) sensor ATeam enable the measurement of changes in ATP levels inside cells, promoting our understanding of metabolic interactions between astrocytes and neurons. The sensors are usually well characterized in vitro but display altered properties when expressed inside cells, precluding a meaningful conversion of changes in FRET ratios into changes in intracellular ATP concentrations ([ATP]) on the basis of their in vitro properties. Here, we present an experimental strategy for the intracellular calibration of two different variants of ATeam in organotypic tissue slice culture of the mouse brain. After cell-type-specific expression of the sensors in astrocytes or neurons, slices were first perfused with a saline containing the saponin β-escin to permeabilize plasma membranes for ATP. Next, cells were depleted of ATP by perfusion with ATP-free saline containing metabolic inhibitors. Finally, ATP was re-added at defined concentrations and resulting changes in the FRET ratio recorded. When employing this protocol, ATeam1.03 expressed in astrocytes reliably responds to changes in [ATP], exhibiting an apparent K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; of 9.4 mM. The high-affinity sensor ATeam1.03&lt;sup&gt;YEMK&lt;/sup&gt; displayed a significantly lower intracellular K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; of 2.7 mM. On the basis of these calibrations, we found that induction of a recurrent neuronal network activity resulted in an initial transient increase in astrocytic [ATP] by ~0.12 mM as detected by ATeam1.03&lt;sup&gt;YEMK&lt;/sup&gt;, a result confirmed using ATeam1.03. In neurons, in contrast, [ATP] immediately started to decline upon initiation of a network activity, amounting to a decrease by an average of 0.29 mM after 2 min. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ATeam1.03&lt;sup&gt;YEMK&lt;/sup&gt; and ATeam1.03 display a significant increase in their apparent K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; when expressed inside cells as compared with in vitro. Moreover, they show that both ATeam variants enable the quantitative detection of changes of astrocytic and neuronal [ATP] in the physiological range. ATeam1.03&lt;sup&gt;YEMK&lt;/sup&gt;, however, seems preferable because its K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is close to baseline ATP levels. Finally, our data support the idea that synchronized neuronal activity initially stimulates the generation of ATP in astrocytes, presumably through increased glycolysis, whereas ATP levels in neurons decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Stability in the Face of Change: Lifelong Experience-Dependent Plasticity in the Sensory Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00076</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00076</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Plasticity is a fundamental property of the nervous system that enables its adaptations to the ever-changing environment. Heightened plasticity typical for developing circuits facilitates their robust experience-dependent functional maturation. This plasticity wanes during adolescence to permit the stabilization of mature brain function, but abundant evidence supports that adult circuits exhibit both transient and long-term experience-induced plasticity. Cortical plasticity has been extensively studied throughout the life span in sensory systems and the main distinction between development and adulthood arising from these studies is the concept that passive exposure to relevant information is sufficient to drive robust plasticity early in life, while higher-order attentional mechanisms are necessary to drive plastic changes in adults. Recent work in the primary visual and auditory cortices began to define the circuit mechanisms that govern these processes and enable continuous adaptation to the environment, with transient circuit disinhibition emerging as a common prerequisite for both developmental and adult plasticity. Drawing from studies in visual and auditory systems, this review article summarizes recent reports on the circuit and cellular mechanisms of experience-driven plasticity in the developing and adult brains and emphasizes the similarities and differences between them. The benefits of distinct plasticity mechanisms used at different ages are discussed in the context of sensory learning, as well as their relationship to maladaptive plasticity and neurodevelopmental brain disorders. Knowledge gaps and avenues for future work are highlighted, and these will hopefully motivate future research in these areas, particularly those about the learning of complex skills during development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Distinct Components in the Right Extended Frontal Aslant Tract Mediate Language and Working Memory Performance: A Tractography-Informed VBM Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The extended frontal aslant tract (exFAT) is a tractography-based extension of the frontal aslant tract (FAT) which has been shown to be related with language and working memory performance in healthy human adults, but whether those functional implications map to structurally separate regions along its trajectory is still an open question. We present a tractography-informed Voxel-Based Morphometry procedure capable of detecting local tract-specific structural differences in white matter regions and apply it in two maximum variation sampling studies by comparing local differences in diffusion-derived microstructural parameters and fiber density along the exFAT territory between top performers and bottom performers in language and working memory tasks. In the right hemisphere we were able to detect, without prior constraints, a vertical frontal aslant component approximating the original FAT trajectory whose fiber density was significantly correlated with language (but not working memory) performance and an anterior cluster component corresponding to a distinct anterior frontal aslant component whose fiber density was significantly correlated with working memory (but not language) performance. The reported sub-division of the exFAT territory describes a set of frontal connections that are compatible with previously reported results on the Broca’s territory and frontal cortex hierarchical organization along an anterior-posterior gradient, suggesting that the exFAT could be part of a common neuroanatomical scaffold where language and working memory functions are integrated in the healthy human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Calcium stores in neurons are heterogeneous in compartmentalization and molecular composition. Danio rerio (zebrafish) is an animal model with a simply folded cerebellum similar in cellular organization to that of mammals. The aim of the study was to identify new endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium store markers in zebrafish adult brain with emphasis on cerebellum and optic tectum. By quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we found three RNA transcripts coding for the intra-ER calcium binding protein calsequestrin: casq1a, casq1b, and casq2. In brain homogenates, two isoforms were detected by mass spectrometry and western blotting. Fractionation experiments of whole brain revealed that Casq1a and Casq2 were enriched in a heavy fraction containing ER microsomes and synaptic membranes. By in situ hybridization, we found the heterogeneous expression of casq1a and casq2 mRNA to be compatible with the cellular localization of calsequestrins investigated by immunofluorescence. Casq1 was expressed in neurogenic differentiation 1 expressing the granule cells of the cerebellum and the periventricular zone of the optic tectum. Casq2 was concentrated in parvalbumin expressing Purkinje cells. At a subcellular level, Casq1 was restricted to granular cell bodies, and Casq2 was localized in cell bodies, dendrites, and axons. Data are discussed in relation to the differential cellular and subcellular distribution of other cerebellum calcium store markers and are evaluated with respect to the putative relevance of calsequestrins in the neuron-specific functional activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cilostazol, a Phosphodiesterase 3 Inhibitor, Moderately Attenuates Behaviors Depending on Sex in the Ts65Dn Mouse Model of Down Syndrome</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;People with Down syndrome, which is a trisomy of chromosome 21, exhibit intellectual disability from infancy and neuropathology similar to Alzheimer’s disease, such as amyloid plaques, from an early age. Recently, we showed that cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3, promotes the clearance of amyloid β and rescues cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. The objective of the present study was to examine whether cilostazol improves behaviors in the most widely used animal model of Down syndrome, i.e., Ts65Dn mice. Mice were supplemented with cilostazol from the fetal period until young adulthood. Supplementation significantly ameliorated novel-object recognition in Ts65Dn females and partially ameliorated sensorimotor function as determined by the rotarod test in Ts65Dn females and hyperactive locomotion in Ts65Dn males. Cilostazol supplementation significantly shortened swimming distance in Ts65Dn males in the Morris water maze test, suggesting that the drug improved cognitive function, although it did not shorten swimming duration, which was due to decreased swimming speed. Thus, this study suggests that early supplementation with cilostazol partially rescues behavioral abnormalities seen in Down syndrome and indicates that the effects are sex-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mitochondrial Homeostasis and Signaling in Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra leads to a progressive, long-term decline of movement and other non-motor deficits. The symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) often appear later in the course of the disease, when most of the functional dopaminergic neurons have been lost. The late onset of the disease, the severity of the illness, and its impact on the global health system demand earlier diagnosis and better targeted therapy. PD etiology and pathogenesis are largely unknown. There are mutations in genes that have been linked to PD and, from these complex phenotypes, mitochondrial dysfunction emerged as central in the pathogenesis and evolution of PD. In fact, several PD-associated genes negatively impact on mitochondria physiology, supporting the notion that dysregulation of mitochondrial signaling and homeostasis is pathogenically relevant. Derangement of mitochondrial homeostatic controls can lead to oxidative stress and neuronal cell death. Restoring deranged signaling cascades to and from mitochondria in PD neurons may then represent a viable opportunity to reset energy metabolism and delay the death of dopaminergic neurons. Here, we will highlight the relevance of dysfunctional mitochondrial homeostasis and signaling in PD, the molecular mechanisms involved, and potential therapeutic approaches to restore mitochondrial activities in damaged neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Gaussian Graphical Models Reveal Inter-Modal and Inter-Regional Conditional Dependencies of Brain Alterations in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00099</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a sequence of pathological changes, which are commonly assessed in vivo using various brain imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Currently, the most approaches to analyze statistical associations between regions and imaging modalities rely on Pearson correlation or linear regression models. However, these models are prone to spurious correlations arising from uninformative shared variance and multicollinearity. Notably, there are no appropriate multivariate statistical models available that can easily integrate dozens of multicollinear variables derived from such data, being able to utilize the additional information provided from the combination of data sources. Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) can estimate the conditional dependency from given data, which is conceptually expected to closely reflect the underlying causal relationships between various variables. Hence, we applied GGMs to assess multimodal regional brain alterations in AD. We obtained data from N = 972 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The mean amyloid load (AV45-PET), glucose metabolism (FDG-PET), and gray matter volume (MRI) were calculated for each of the 108 cortical and subcortical brain regions. GGMs were estimated using a Bayesian framework for the combined multimodal data and the resulted conditional dependency networks were compared to classical covariance networks based on Pearson correlation. Additionally, graph-theoretical network statistics were calculated to determine network alterations associated with disease status. The resulting conditional dependency matrices were much sparser (≈10% density) than Pearson correlation matrices (≈50% density). Within imaging modalities, conditional dependency networks yielded clusters connecting anatomically adjacent regions. For the associations between different modalities, only few region-specific connections were detected. Network measures such as small-world coefficient were significantly altered across diagnostic groups, with a biphasic u-shape trajectory, i.e., increased small-world coefficient in early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), similar values in late MCI, and decreased values in AD dementia patients compared to cognitively normal controls. In conclusion, GGMs removed commonly shared variance among multimodal measures of regional brain alterations in MCI and AD, and yielded sparser matrices compared to correlation networks based on the Pearson coefficient. Therefore, GGMs may be used as alternative to thresholding-approaches typically applied to correlation networks to obtain the most informative relations between variables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Glucocerebrosidase Defects as a Major Risk Factor for Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00097</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Heterozygous mutations of the GBA1 gene, encoding for lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), occur in a considerable percentage of all patients with sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD), varying between 8% and 12% across the world. Genome wide association studies have confirmed the strong correlation between PD and GBA1 mutations, pointing to this element as a major risk factor for PD, possibly the most important one after age. The pathobiological mechanisms underlying the link between a defective function of GCase and the development of PD are still unknown and are currently the focus of intense investigation in the community of pre-clinical and clinical researchers in the PD field. A major controversy regards the fact that, despite the unequivocal correlation between the presence of GBA1 mutations and the risk of developing PD, only a minority of asymptomatic carriers with GBA1 mutations convert to PD in their lifetime. GBA1 mutations reduce the enzymatic function of GCase, impairing lysosomal efficiency and the cellular ability to dispose of pathological alpha-synuclein. Changes in the cellular lipidic content resulting from the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, triggered by lysosomal dysfunction, may contribute to the pathological modification of alpha-synuclein, due to its ability to interact with cell membrane lipids. Mutant GCase can impair mitochondrial function and cause endoplasmic reticulum stress, thereby impacting on cellular energy production and proteostasis. Importantly, reduced GCase activity is associated with clear activation of microglia, a major mediator of neuroinflammatory response within the brain parenchyma, which points to neuroinflammation as a major consequence of GCase dysfunction. In this present review article, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of GBA1 mutations in PD development and their phenotypic correlations. We also discuss the potential role of the GCase pathway in the search for PD biomarkers that may enable the development of disease modifying therapies. Answering these questions will aid clinicians in offering more appropriate counseling to the patients and their caregivers and provide future directions for PD preclinical research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Development and Evaluation of Maze-Like Puzzle Games to Assess Cognitive and Motor Function in Aging and Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is currently a need for engaging, user-friendly, and repeatable tasks for assessment of cognitive and motor function in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. This study evaluated the feasibility of a maze-like Numberlink puzzle game in assessing differences in game-based measures of cognition and motor function due to age and neurodegenerative diseases. Fifty-five participants, including young (18–31 years, n = 18), older (64–79 years, n = 14), and oldest adults (86–98 years, n = 14), and patients with Parkinson’s (59–76 years, n = 4) and Huntington’s disease (HD; 35–66 years, n = 5) played different difficulty levels of the Numberlink puzzle game and completed usability questionnaires and tests for psychomotor, attentional, visuospatial, and constructional and executive function. Analyses of Numberlink game-based cognitive (solving time and errors) and motor [mean velocity and movement direction changes (MDC)] performance metrics revealed statistically significant differences between age groups and between patients with HD and older adults. However, patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) did not differ from older adults. Correlational analyses showed significant associations between game-based performance and movement metrics and performance on neuropsychological tests for psychomotor, attentional, visuospatial, and constructional and executive function. Furthermore, varying characteristics of the Numberlink puzzle game succeeded in creating graded difficulty levels. Findings from this study support recent suggestions that data from a maze-like puzzle game provide potential “digital biomarkers” to assess changes in psychomotor, visuoconstructional, and executive function related to aging and neurodegeneration. In particular, game-based movement measures from the maze-like puzzle Numberlink games are promising as a tool to monitor the progression of motor impairment in neurodegenerative diseases. Further studies are needed to more comprehensively establish the cognitive validity and test–retest reliability of using Numberlink puzzles as a valid cognitive assessment tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eLife: Population coupling predicts the plasticity of stimulus responses in cortical circuits</title>

	<description>Some neurons have stimulus responses that are stable over days, whereas other neurons have highly plastic stimulus responses. Using a recurrent network model, we explore whether this could be due to an underlying diversity in their synaptic plasticity. We find that, in a network with diverse learning rates, neurons with fast rates are more coupled to population activity than neurons with slow rates. This plasticity-coupling link predicts that neurons with high population coupling exhibit more long-term stimulus response variability than neurons with low population coupling. We substantiate this prediction using recordings from the Allen Brain Observatory, finding that a neuron's population coupling is correlated with the plasticity of its orientation preference. Simulations of a simple perceptual learning task suggest a particular functional architecture: a stable 'backbone' of stimulus representation formed by neurons with low population coupling, on top of which lies a flexible substrate of neurons with high population coupling.</description>

	<title>eLife: A single power stroke by ATP binding drives substrate translocation in a heterodimeric ABC transporter</title>

	<description>ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters constitute the largest family of primary active transporters, responsible for many physiological processes and human maladies. However, the mechanism how chemical energy of ATP facilitates translocation of chemically diverse compounds across membranes is poorly understood. Here, we advance the quantitative mechanistic understanding of the heterodimeric ABC transporter TmrAB, a functional homolog of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) by single-turnover analyses at single-liposome resolution. We reveal that a single conformational switch by ATP binding drives unidirectional substrate translocation. After this power stroke, ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release launch the return to the resting state, which facilitates nucleotide exchange and a new round of substrate binding and translocation. In contrast to hitherto existing steady-state assays, our single-turnover approach uncovers the power stroke in substrate translocation and the tight chemomechanical coupling in these molecular machines.</description>

	<description>Centering and decentering of cellular components is essential for internal organization of cells and their ability to perform basic cellular functions such as division and motility. How cells achieve proper localization of their organelles is still not well-understood, especially in large cells such as oocytes. Here, we study actin-based positioning mechanisms in artificial cells with persistently contracting actomyosin networks, generated by encapsulating cytoplasmic &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; egg extracts into cell-sized ‘water-in-oil’ droplets. We observe size-dependent localization of the contraction center, with a symmetric configuration in larger cells and a polar one in smaller cells. Centering is achieved via a hydrodynamic mechanism based on Darcy friction between the contracting network and the surrounding cytoplasm. During symmetry breaking, transient attachments to the cell boundary drive the contraction center to a polar location. The centering mechanism is cell-cycle dependent and weakens considerably during interphase. Our findings demonstrate a robust, yet tunable, mechanism for subcellular localization.</description>

	<title>eLife: A discrete subtype of neural progenitor crucial for cortical folding in the gyrencephalic mammalian brain</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54873</link>
	<description>An increase in the diversity of neural progenitor subtypes and folding of the cerebral cortex are characteristic features which appeared during the evolution of the mammalian brain. Here, we show that the expansion of a specific subtype of neural progenitor is crucial for cortical folding. We found that outer radial glial (oRG) cells can be subdivided by HOPX expression in the gyrencephalic cerebral cortex of ferrets. Compared with HOPX-negative oRG cells, HOPX-positive oRG cells had high self-renewal activity and were accumulated in prospective gyral regions. Using our in vivo genetic manipulation technique for ferrets, we found that the number of HOPX-positive oRG cells and their self-renewal activity were regulated by sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Importantly, suppressing Shh signaling reduced HOPX-positive oRG cells and cortical folding, while enhancing it had opposing effects. Our results reveal a novel subtype of neural progenitor important for cortical folding in gyrencephalic mammalian cerebral cortex.</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54462</link>
	<description>Seasonal migration is a taxonomically widespread behaviour that integrates across many traits. The European blackcap exhibits enormous variation in migration and is renowned for research on its evolution and genetic basis. We assembled a reference genome for blackcaps and obtained whole genome resequencing data from individuals across its breeding range. Analyses of population structure and demography suggested divergence began ~30,000 ya, with evidence for one admixture event between migrant and resident continent birds ~5000 ya. The propensity to migrate, orientation and distance of migration all map to a small number of genomic regions that do not overlap with results from other species, suggesting that there are multiple ways to generate variation in migration. Strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were located in regulatory regions of candidate genes that may serve as major regulators of the migratory syndrome. Evidence for selection on shared variation was documented, providing a mechanism by which rapid changes may evolve.</description>

	<title>eLife: Dual orexin and MCH neuron-ablated mice display severe sleep attacks and cataplexy</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54275</link>
	<description>Orexin/hypocretin-producing and melanin-concentrating hormone-producing (MCH) neurons are co-extensive in the hypothalamus and project throughout the brain to regulate sleep/wakefulness. Ablation of orexin neurons decreases wakefulness and results in a narcolepsy-like phenotype, whereas ablation of MCH neurons increases wakefulness. Since it is unclear how orexin and MCH neurons interact to regulate sleep/wakefulness, we generated transgenic mice in which both orexin and MCH neurons could be ablated. Double-ablated mice exhibited increased wakefulness and decreased both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Double-ablated mice showed severe cataplexy compared with orexin neuron-ablated mice, suggesting that MCH neurons normally suppress cataplexy. Double-ablated mice also showed frequent sleep attacks with elevated spectral power in the delta and theta range, a unique state that we call ‘delta-theta sleep’. Together, these results indicate a functional interaction between orexin and MCH neurons in vivo that suggests the synergistic involvement of these neuronal populations in the sleep/wakefulness cycle.</description>

	<title>eLife: A neuropeptide regulates fighting behavior in Drosophila melanogaster</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54229</link>
	<description>Aggressive behavior is regulated by various neuromodulators such as neuropeptides and biogenic amines. Here we found that the neuropeptide &lt;i&gt;Drosulfakinin (Dsk&lt;/i&gt;) modulates aggression in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. Knock-out of &lt;i&gt;Dsk&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Dsk&lt;/i&gt; receptor &lt;i&gt;CCKLR-17D1&lt;/i&gt; reduced aggression. Activation and inactivation of Dsk-expressing neurons increased and decreased male aggressive behavior, respectively. Moreover, data from transsynaptic tracing, electrophysiology and behavioral epistasis reveal that Dsk-expressing neurons function downstream of a subset of P1 neurons (&lt;i&gt;P1&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;-splitGAL4&lt;/i&gt;) to control fighting behavior. In addition, winners show increased calcium activity in Dsk-expressing neurons. Conditional overexpression of Dsk promotes social dominance, suggesting a positive correlation between Dsk signaling and winning effects. The mammalian ortholog CCK has been implicated in mammal aggression, thus our work suggests a conserved neuromodulatory system for the modulation of aggressive behavior.</description>

	<description>The &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; ventral nerve cord (VNC) receives and processes descending signals from the brain to produce a variety of coordinated locomotor outputs. It also integrates sensory information from the periphery and sends ascending signals to the brain. We used single-cell transcriptomics to generate an unbiased classification of cellular diversity in the VNC of five-day old adult flies. We produced an atlas of 26,000 high-quality cells, representing more than 100 transcriptionally distinct cell types. The predominant gene signatures defining neuronal cell types reflect shared developmental histories based on the neuroblast from which cells were derived, as well as their birth order. The relative position of cells along the anterior-posterior axis could also be assigned using adult Hox gene expression. This single-cell transcriptional atlas of the adult fly VNC will be a valuable resource for future studies of neurodevelopment and behavior.</description>

	<title>eLife: Vascular permeability in retinopathy is regulated by VEGFR2 Y949 signaling to VE-cadherin</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54056</link>
	<description>Edema stemming from leaky blood vessels is common in eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Whereas therapies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) can suppress leakage, side-effects include vascular rarefaction and geographic atrophy. By challenging mouse models representing different steps in VEGFA/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2)-induced vascular permeability, we show that targeting signaling downstream of VEGFR2 pY949 limits vascular permeability in retinopathy induced by high oxygen or by laser-wounding. Although suppressed permeability is accompanied by reduced pathological neoangiogenesis in oxygen-induced retinopathy, similarly sized lesions leak less in mutant mice, separating regulation of permeability from angiogenesis,. Strikingly, vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin phosphorylation at the Y685, but not Y658, residue is reduced when VEGFR2 pY949 signaling is impaired. These findings support a mechanism whereby VE-cadherin Y685 phosphorylation is selectively associated with excessive vascular leakage. Therapeutically, targeting VEGFR2-regulated VE-cadherin phosphorylation could suppress edema while leaving other VEGFR2-dependent functions intact.</description>

	<title>eLife: Slo2 potassium channel function depends on RNA editing-regulated expression of a SCYL1 protein</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53986</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53986</link>
	<description>Slo2 potassium channels play important roles in neuronal function, and their mutations in humans may cause epilepsies and cognitive defects. However, it is largely unknown how Slo2 is regulated by other proteins. Here we show that the function of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; Slo2 (SLO-2) depends on &lt;i&gt;adr-1&lt;/i&gt;, a gene important to RNA editing. ADR-1 promotes SLO-2 function not by editing the transcripts of &lt;i&gt;slo-2&lt;/i&gt; but those of &lt;i&gt;scyl-1&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes an orthologue of mammalian SCYL1. Transcripts of &lt;i&gt;scyl-1&lt;/i&gt; are greatly decreased in &lt;i&gt;adr-1&lt;/i&gt; mutants due to deficient RNA editing at a single adenosine in their 3'-UTR. SCYL-1 physically interacts with SLO-2 in neurons. Single-channel open probability (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) of neuronal SLO-2 is ~50% lower in &lt;i&gt;scyl-1 &lt;/i&gt;knockout mutant than wild type. Moreover, human Slo2.2/Slack &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is doubled by SCYL1 in a heterologous expression system. These results suggest that SCYL-1/SCYL1 is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of Slo2 channels.</description>

	<title>eLife: EphA7 promotes myogenic differentiation via cell-cell contact</title>

	<description>The conversion of proliferating skeletal muscle precursors (myoblasts) to terminally-differentiated myocytes is a critical step in skeletal muscle development and repair. We show that EphA7, a juxtacrine signaling receptor, is expressed on myocytes during embryonic and fetal myogenesis and on nascent myofibers during muscle regeneration in vivo. In &lt;i&gt;EphA7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice, hindlimb muscles possess fewer myofibers at birth, and those myofibers are reduced in size and have fewer myonuclei and reduced overall numbers of precursor cells throughout postnatal life. Adult &lt;i&gt;EphA7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice have reduced numbers of satellite cells and exhibit delayed and protracted muscle regeneration, and satellite cell-derived myogenic cells from &lt;i&gt;EphA7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice are delayed in their expression of differentiation markers in vitro. Exogenous EphA7 extracellular domain will rescue the null phenotype in vitro, and will also enhance commitment to differentiation in WT cells. We propose a model in which EphA7 expression on differentiated myocytes promotes commitment of adjacent myoblasts to terminal differentiation.</description>

	<title>eLife: Activated αIIbβ3 on platelets mediates flow-dependent NETosis via SLC44A2</title>

	<description>Platelet-neutrophil interactions are important for innate immunity, but also contribute to the pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke. Here we report that, under flow, von Willebrand factor/glycoprotein Iba-dependent platelet 'priming' induces integrin a&lt;sub&gt;IIb&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; activation that, in turn, mediates neutrophil and T-cell binding. Binding of platelet a&lt;sub&gt;IIb&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to SLC44A2 on neutrophils leads to mechanosensitive-dependent production of highly prothrombotic neutrophil extracellular traps. A polymorphism in &lt;i&gt;SLC44A2&lt;/i&gt; (rs2288904-A) present in 22% of the population causes an R154Q substitution in an extracellular loop of SLC44A2 that is protective against venous thrombosis results in severely impaired binding to both activated a&lt;sub&gt;IIb&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;3 &lt;/sub&gt;and&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;VWF-primed platelets. This was confirmed using neutrophils homozygous for the &lt;i&gt;SLC44A2&lt;/i&gt; R154Q polymorphism. Taken together, these data reveal a previously unreported mode of platelet-neutrophil crosstalk, mechanosensitive NET production, and provide mechanistic insight into the protective effect of the &lt;i&gt;SLC44A2&lt;/i&gt; rs2288904-A polymorphism in venous thrombosis.</description>

	<description>HLA-restricted T cell responses can induce antitumor effects in cancer patients. Previous human T cell research has largely focused on the few HLA alleles prevalent in a subset of ethnic groups. Here, using a panel of newly developed peptide-exchangeable peptide/HLA multimers and artificial antigen-presenting cells for 25 different class I alleles and greater than 800 peptides, we systematically and comprehensively mapped shared antigenic epitopes recognized by tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) from eight melanoma patients for all their class I alleles. We were able to determine the specificity, on average, of 12.2% of the TILs recognizing a mean of 3.1 shared antigen-derived epitopes across HLA-A, B, and C. Furthermore, we isolated a number of cognate T cell receptor genes with tumor reactivity. Our novel strategy allows for a more complete examination of the immune response and development of novel cancer immunotherapy not limited by HLA allele prevalence or tumor mutation burden.</description>

	<description>The World Health Organization has included three bunyaviruses posing an increasing threat to human health on the Blueprint list of viruses likely to cause major epidemics and for which no, or insufficient countermeasures exist. Here, we describe a broadly applicable strategy, based on llama-derived single-domain antibodies (VHHs), for the development of bunyavirus biotherapeutics. The method was validated using the zoonotic Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV), an emerging pathogen of ruminants, as model pathogens. VHH building blocks were assembled into highly potent neutralizing complexes using bacterial superglue technology. The multimeric complexes were shown to reduce and prevent virus-induced morbidity and mortality in mice upon prophylactic administration. Bispecific molecules engineered to present two different VHHs fused to an Fc domain were further shown to be effective upon therapeutic administration. The presented VHH-based technology holds great promise for the development of bunyavirus antiviral therapies.</description>

	<title>eLife: Layered roles of fruitless isoforms in specification and function of male aggression-promoting neurons in Drosophila</title>

	<description>Inter-male aggressive behavior is a prominent sexually dimorphic behavior. Neural circuits that underlie aggressive behavior are therefore likely under the control of sex-determining genes. However, the neurogenetic mechanism that generates sex-specific aggressive behavior remains largely unknown. Here, we found that a neuronal class specified by one of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; sex determining genes, &lt;i&gt;fruitless&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;fru&lt;/i&gt;), belongs to the neural circuit that generates male-type aggressive behavior. This neuronal class can promote aggressive behavior independent of another sex determining gene, &lt;i&gt;doublesex&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;dsx&lt;/i&gt;), although &lt;i&gt;dsx&lt;/i&gt; is involved in ensuring that aggressive behavior is performed only toward males. We also found that three &lt;i&gt;fru&lt;/i&gt; isoforms with different DNA binding domains show a division of labor on male aggressive behaviors. A dominant role of &lt;i&gt;fru&lt;/i&gt; in specifying sex-specific aggressive behavior may underscore a genetic mechanism that allows male-type aggressive behavior to evolve at least partially independently from courtship behavior, which is under different selective pressures.</description>

	<title>eLife: Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and target preference via sexually dimorphic neurons</title>

	<description>For successful mating, a male animal must execute effective courtship behaviors toward a receptive target sex, which is female. Whether the courtship execution capability and upregulation of courtship toward females are specified through separable sex-determining genetic pathways remains uncharacterized. Here, we found that one of the two &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; sex-determining genes, &lt;i&gt;doublesex&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;dsx&lt;/i&gt;), specifies a male-specific neuronal component that serves as an execution mechanism for courtship behavior, whereas &lt;i&gt;fruitless&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;fru&lt;/i&gt;) is required for enhancement of courtship behavior toward females. The &lt;i&gt;dsx&lt;/i&gt;-dependent courtship execution mechanism includes a specific subclass within a neuronal cluster that co-express &lt;i&gt;dsx&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fru&lt;/i&gt;. This cluster contains at least another subclass that is specified cooperatively by both &lt;i&gt;dsx&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fru&lt;/i&gt;. Although these neuronal populations can also promote aggressive behavior toward male flies, this capacity requires &lt;i&gt;fru&lt;/i&gt;-dependent mechanisms. Our results uncover how sex-determining genes specify execution capability and female-specific enhancement of courtship behavior through separable yet cooperative neurogenetic mechanisms.</description>

	<title>eLife: Shape selection and mis-assembly in viral capsid formation by elastic                    frustration</title>

	<description>The successful assembly of a closed protein shell (or capsid) is a key step in                    the replication of viruses and in the production of artificial viral cages for                    bio/nanotechnological applications. During self-assembly, the favorable binding                    energy competes with the energetic cost of the growing edge and the elastic                    stresses generated due to the curvature of the capsid. As a result, incomplete                    structures such as open caps, cylindrical or ribbon-shaped shells may emerge,                    preventing the successful replication of viruses. Using elasticity theory and                    coarse-grained simulations, we analyze the conditions required for these                    processes to occur and their significance for empty virus self-assembly. We find                    that the outcome of the assembly can be recast into a universal phase diagram                    showing that viruses with high mechanical resistance cannot be self-assembled                    directly as spherical structures. The results of our study justify the need of a                    maturation step and suggest promising routes to hinder viral infections by                    inducing mis-assembly.</description>

	<description>ERK3 is a ubiquitously expressed member of the atypical mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the physiological significance of its short half-life remains unclear. By employing gastrointestinal 3D organoids, we detect that ERK3 protein levels steadily decrease during epithelial differentiation. ERK3 is not required for 3D growth of human gastric epithelium. However, ERK3 is stabilized and activated in tumourigenic cells, but deteriorates over time in primary cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ERK3 is necessary for production of several cellular factors including interleukin-8 (IL-8), in both, normal and tumourigenic cells. Particularly, ERK3 is critical for AP-1 signaling through its interaction and regulation of c-Jun protein. The secretome of ERK3 deficient cells is defective in chemotaxis of neutrophils and monocytes both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Further, knockdown of ERK3 reduces metastatic potential of invasive breast cancer cells. We unveil an ERK3-mediated regulation of IL-8 and epithelial secretome for chemotaxis.</description>

	<description>Astrocytes play essential roles in brain function by supporting synaptic connectivity and associated circuits. We found the transcription factor NFIA is required to maintain astrocyte function in the hippocampus through region-specific DNA binding mechanisms. Alterations in astrocyte-neuron communication disrupt hippocampal circuit function, resulting in impaired learning and memory behaviors.</description>

	<description>Thiele et al. show that importin-α3 is one of the major nuclear transporters of NF-κB in the mammalian lung. High-level TNF-α-inducing HPAIVs inhibit importin-α3 mRNA transcription by interfering with its promoter activity. Thus, HPAIVs may evade antiviral immunity in the respiratory tract by generating a bottleneck in importin-α3 availability.</description>

	<description>The molecular chaperone TRAP1 regulates energy metabolism, and its activity is relevant in cancer and degenerative diseases. Here, Sanchez-Martin et al. identify highly selective allosteric inhibitors of TRAP1. These compounds revert biochemical and pro-neoplastic effects of TRAP1 and could both enlighten its mode of action and disclose novel therapeutic strategies.</description>

	<description>Lau et al. show that interleukin-33 (IL-33) enhances microglial amyloid-beta clearance by inducing a subpopulation of MHC-II+ phagocytic microglia, which is, in turn, controlled by PU.1-dependent transcriptome reprogramming. Thus, the authors reveal an IL-33-PU.1 axis involved in transcriptional regulation that promotes beneficial microglial functions in Alzheimer’s disease.</description>

	<description>Early neuronal development is a well-coordinated process in which neuronal stem cells differentiate into polarized neurons. This process has been well studied in classical non-human model systems, but to what extent this is recapitulated in human neurons remains unclear. To study neuronal polarization in human neurons, we cultured human iPSC-derived neurons, characterized early developmental stages, measured electrophysiological responses, and systematically profiled transcriptomic and proteomic dynamics during these steps. We found extensive remodeling of the neuron transcriptome and proteome, with altered mRNA expression of ~1,100 genes and different expression profiles of ~1,500 proteins during neuronal differentiation and polarization. We also identified a distinct stage in axon development marked by an increase in microtubule remodeling and apparent relocation of the axon initial segment from the distal to proximal axon. Our comprehensive characterization and quantitative map of transcriptome and proteome dynamics provides a solid framework for studying polarization in human neurons.</description>

	<description>In theory, neurons can compute all threshold functions, but in practice, synaptic weight resolution limits their computing capacity. Here, we study how dendrites alleviate this practical limitation by demonstrating a computation where dendrites considerably decrease the necessary synaptic weights resolution. We show how a biophysical neuron model with two passive dendrites and a soma that can implement this computation more efficiently than a point neuron. The latter requires synaptic weight orders of magnitudes larger than the others, the former implement the computation with equivalent synaptic weights. This work paves the way for a new generation of neuromorphic chips composed of dendritic neurons. These chips will require less space and less energy to function.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Flux-based hierarchical organization of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;’s metabolic network</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Semidán Robaina-Estévez, Zoran Nikoloski&lt;/p&gt;

Biological networks across scales exhibit hierarchical organization that may constrain network function. Yet, understanding how these hierarchies arise due to the operational constraint of the networks and whether they impose limits to molecular phenotypes remains elusive. Here we show that metabolic networks include a hierarchy of reactions based on a natural flux ordering that holds for every steady state. We find that the hierarchy of reactions is reflected in experimental measurements of transcript, protein and flux levels of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; under various growth conditions as well as in the catalytic rate constants of the corresponding enzymes. Our findings point at resource partitioning and a fine-tuning of enzyme levels in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; to respect the constraints imposed by the network structure at steady state. Since reactions in upper layers of the hierarchy impose an upper bound on the flux of the reactions downstream, the hierarchical organization of metabolism due to the flux ordering has direct applications in metabolic engineering.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qQph3EDddVU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Methodological challenges in translational drug response modeling in cancer: A systematic analysis with FORESEE</title>

Translational models directly relating drug response specific processes that can be observed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to their &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; role in cancer patients constitute a crucial part of the development of personalized medication. Unfortunately, current studies often focus on the optimization of isolated model characteristics instead of examining the overall modeling workflow and the interplay of the individual model components. Moreover, they are often limited to specific data sets only. Therefore, they are often confined by the irreproducibility of the results and the non-transferability of the approaches into other contexts. In this study, we present a thorough investigation of translational models and their ability to predict the drug responses of cancer patients originating from diverse data sets using the R-package FORESEE. By systematically scanning the modeling space for optimal combinations of different model settings, we can determine models of extremely high predictivity and work out a few modeling guidelines that promote simplicity. Yet, we identify noise within the data, sample size effects, and drug unspecificity as factors that deteriorate the models’ robustness. Moreover, we show that cell line models of high accuracy do not necessarily excel in predicting drug response processes in patients. We therefore hope to motivate future research to consider &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; aspects more carefully to ultimately generate deeper insights into applicable precision medicine.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IvU2KaKPQNI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Expression of quasi-equivalence and capsid dimorphism in the Hepadnaviridae</title>

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a leading cause of liver disease. The capsid is an essential component of the virion and it is therefore of interest how it assembles and disassembles. The capsid protein is unusual both for its rare fold and that it polymerizes according to two different icosahedral symmetries, causing the polypeptide chain to exist in seven quasi-equivalent environments: A, B, and C in AB and CC dimers in T = 3 capsids, and A, B, C, and D in AB and CD dimers in T = 4 capsids. We have compared the two capsids by cryo-EM at 3.5 Å resolution. To ensure a valid comparison, the two capsids were prepared and imaged under identical conditions. We find that the chains have different conformations and potential energies, with the T = 3 C chain having the lowest. Three of the four quasi-equivalent dimers are asymmetric with respect to conformation and potential energy; however, the T = 3 CC dimer is symmetrical and has the lowest potential energy although its intra-dimer interface has the least free energy of formation. Of all the inter-dimer interfaces, the CB interface has the least area and free energy, in both capsids. From the calculated energies of higher-order groupings of dimers discernible in the lattices we predict early assembly intermediates, and indeed we observe such structures by negative stain EM of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assembly reactions. By sequence analysis and computational alanine scanning we identify key residues and motifs involved in capsid assembly. Our results explain several previously reported observations on capsid assembly, disassembly, and dimorphism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1gKDlqd1oAs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Recent years have seen rising incidence of dengue and large outbreaks of Zika and chikungunya, which are all caused by viruses transmitted by &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes. In most settings, the primary intervention against &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt;-transmitted viruses is vector control, such as indoor, ultra-low volume (ULV) spraying. Targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS) has the potential to more effectively impact &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt;-borne diseases, but its implementation requires careful planning and evaluation. The optimal time to deploy these interventions and their relative epidemiological effects are, however, not well understood. We used an agent-based model of dengue virus transmission calibrated to data from Iquitos, Peru to assess the epidemiological effects of these interventions under differing strategies for deploying them. Specifically, we compared strategies where spray application was initiated when incidence rose above a threshold based on incidence in recent years to strategies where spraying occurred at the same time(s) each year. In the absence of spraying, the model predicted 361,000 infections [inter-quartile range (IQR): 347,000–383,000] in the period 2000–2010. The ULV strategy with the fewest median infections was spraying twice yearly, in March and October, which led to a median of 172,000 infections [IQR: 158,000–183,000], a 52% reduction from baseline. Compared to spraying once yearly in September, the best threshold-based strategy utilizing ULV had fewer median infections (254,000 vs. 261,000), but required more spraying (351 vs. 274 days). For TIRS, the best strategy was threshold-based, which led to the fewest infections of all strategies tested (9,900; [IQR: 8,720–11,400], a 94% reduction), and required fewer days spraying than the equivalent ULV strategy (280). Although spraying twice each year is likely to avert the most infections, our results indicate that a threshold-based strategy can become an alternative to better balance the translation of spraying effort into impact, particularly if used with a residual insecticide.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QKd-nkAFWE0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The drift diffusion model as the choice rule in inter-temporal and risky choice: A case study in medial orbitofrontal cortex lesion patients and controls</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jan Peters, Mark D’Esposito&lt;/p&gt;

Sequential sampling models such as the drift diffusion model (DDM) have a long tradition in research on perceptual decision-making, but mounting evidence suggests that these models can account for response time (RT) distributions that arise during reinforcement learning and value-based decision-making. Building on this previous work, we implemented the DDM as the choice rule in inter-temporal choice (temporal discounting) and risky choice (probability discounting) using hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation. We validated our approach in data from nine patients with focal lesions to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex / medial orbitofrontal cortex (vmPFC/mOFC) and nineteen age- and education-matched controls. Model comparison revealed that, for both tasks, the data were best accounted for by a variant of the drift diffusion model including a non-linear mapping from value-differences to trial-wise drift rates. Posterior predictive checks confirmed that this model provided a superior account of the relationship between value and RT. We then applied this modeling framework and 1) reproduced our previous results regarding temporal discounting in vmPFC/mOFC patients and 2) showed in a previously unpublished data set on risky choice that vmPFC/mOFC patients exhibit increased risk-taking relative to controls. Analyses of DDM parameters revealed that patients showed substantially increased non-decision times and reduced response caution during risky choice. In contrast, vmPFC/mOFC damage abolished neither scaling nor asymptote of the drift rate. Relatively intact value processing was also confirmed using DDM mixture models, which revealed that in both groups &amp;gt;98% of trials were better accounted for by a DDM with value modulation than by a null model without value modulation.

Analytical forms for neuronal firing rates are important theoretical tools for the analysis of network states. Since the 1960s, the majority of approaches have treated neurons as being electrically compact and therefore isopotential. These approaches have yielded considerable insight into how single-cell properties affect network activity; however, many neuronal classes, such as cortical pyramidal cells, are electrically extended objects. Calculation of the complex flow of electrical activity driven by stochastic spatio-temporal synaptic input streams in these structures has presented a significant analytical challenge. Here we demonstrate that an extension of the level-crossing method of Rice, previously used for compact cells, provides a general framework for approximating the firing rate of neurons with spatial structure. Even for simple models, the analytical approximations derived demonstrate a surprising richness including: independence of the firing rate to the electrotonic length for certain models, but with a form distinct to the point-like leaky integrate-and-fire model; a non-monotonic dependence of the firing rate on the number of dendrites receiving synaptic drive; a significant effect of the axonal and somatic load on the firing rate; and the role that the trigger position on the axon for spike initiation has on firing properties. The approach necessitates only calculating the mean and variances of the non-thresholded voltage and its rate of change in neuronal structures subject to spatio-temporal synaptic fluctuations. The combination of simplicity and generality promises a framework that can be built upon to incorporate increasing levels of biophysical detail and extend beyond the low-rate firing limit treated in this paper.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y8Nf5bPog3Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Visualization of two architectures in class-II CAP-dependent transcription activation</title>

Transcription activation by cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CAP) is the classic paradigm of transcription regulation in bacteria. CAP was suggested to activate transcription on class-II promoters via a recruitment and isomerization mechanism. However, whether and how it modifies RNA polymerase (RNAP) to initiate transcription remains unclear. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of an intact &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; class-II CAP-dependent transcription activation complex (CAP-TAC) with and without de novo RNA transcript. The structures reveal two distinct architectures of TAC and raise the possibility that CAP binding may induce substantial conformational changes in all the subunits of RNAP and transiently widen the main cleft of RNAP to facilitate DNA promoter entering and formation of the initiation open complex. These structural changes vanish during further RNA transcript synthesis. The observations in this study may reveal a possible on-pathway intermediate and suggest a possibility that CAP activates transcription by inducing intermediate state, in addition to the previously proposed stabilization mechanism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/IL2sq4EEp9s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Interhemispheric connections between olfactory bulbs improve odor detection</title>

Interhemispheric connections enable interaction and integration of sensory information in bilaterian nervous systems and are thought to optimize sensory computations. However, the cellular and spatial organization of interhemispheric networks and the computational properties they mediate in vertebrates are still poorly understood. Thus, it remains unclear to what extent the connectivity between left and right brain hemispheres participates in sensory processing. Here, we show that the zebrafish olfactory bulbs (OBs) receive direct interhemispheric projections from their contralateral counterparts in addition to top-down inputs from the contralateral zebrafish homolog of olfactory cortex. The direct interhemispheric projections between the OBs reach peripheral layers of the contralateral OB and retain a precise topographic organization, which directly connects similarly tuned olfactory glomeruli across hemispheres. In contrast, interhemispheric top-down inputs consist of diffuse projections that broadly innervate the inhibitory granule cell layer. Jointly, these interhemispheric connections elicit a balance of topographically organized excitation and nontopographic inhibition on the contralateral OB and modulate odor responses. We show that the interhemispheric connections in the olfactory system enable the modulation of odor response and contribute to a small but significant improvement in the detection of a reproductive pheromone when presented together with complex olfactory cues by potentiating the response of the pheromone selective neurons. Taken together, our data show a previously unknown function for an interhemispheric connection between chemosensory maps of the olfactory system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Jo-Gyw42cMs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Resident microbial communities inhibit growth and antibiotic-resistance evolution of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; in human gut microbiome samples</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000465</guid>

Countering the rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens requires improved understanding of how resistance emerges and spreads in individual species, which are often embedded in complex microbial communities such as the human gut microbiome. Interactions with other microorganisms in such communities might suppress growth and resistance evolution of individual species (e.g., via resource competition) but could also potentially accelerate resistance evolution via horizontal transfer of resistance genes. It remains unclear how these different effects balance out, partly because it is difficult to observe them directly. Here, we used a gut microcosm approach to quantify the effect of three human gut microbiome communities on growth and resistance evolution of a focal strain of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. We found the resident microbial communities not only suppressed growth and colonisation by focal &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; but also prevented it from evolving antibiotic resistance upon exposure to a beta-lactam antibiotic. With samples from all three human donors, our focal &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strain only evolved antibiotic resistance in the absence of the resident microbial community, even though we found resistance genes, including a highly effective resistance plasmid, in resident microbial communities. We identified physical constraints on plasmid transfer that can explain why our focal strain failed to acquire some of these beneficial resistance genes, and we found some chromosomal resistance mutations were only beneficial in the absence of the resident microbiota. This suggests, depending on in situ gene transfer dynamics, interactions with resident microbiota can inhibit antibiotic-resistance evolution of individual species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7BukWKQPzEA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Different Mismatch Concepts for Magnetic Resonance Imaging–Guided Thrombolysis in Unknown Onset Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25730?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25730?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the prevalence of the perfusion‐weighted imaging (PWI)–diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) mismatch and response to intravenous thrombolysis in the WAKE‐UP trial.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a prespecified post hoc analysis of ischemic stroke patients screened for DWI–fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch in WAKE‐UP who underwent PWI. We defined PWI‐DWI mismatch as ischemic core volume &amp;lt; 70ml, mismatch volume &amp;gt; 10ml, and mismatch ratio &amp;gt; 1.2. Primary efficacy end point was a modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1 at 90 days, adjusted for age and symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 1,362 magnetic resonance imaging–screened patients, 431 underwent PWI. Of these, 57 (13%) had a double mismatch, 151 (35%) only a DWI‐FLAIR mismatch, and 54 (13%) only a PWI‐DWI mismatch. DWI‐FLAIR mismatch was more prevalent than PWI‐DWI mismatch (48%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 43–53% vs 26%, 95% CI = 22–30%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Screening for either one of the mismatch profiles resulted in a yield of 61% (95% CI = 56–65%). Prevalence of PWI‐DWI mismatch was similar in patients with (27%) or without (24%) DWI‐FLAIR mismatch (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.52). In an exploratory analysis in the small subgroup of 208 randomized patients with PWI, PWI‐DWI mismatch status did not modify the treatment response (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; for interaction = 0.73).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluating both the DWI‐FLAIR and PWI‐DWI mismatch patterns in patients with unknown time of stroke onset will result in the highest yield of thrombolysis treatment. The treatment benefit of alteplase in patients with a DWI‐FLAIR mismatch seems to be driven not merely by the presence of a PWI‐DWI mismatch, although this analysis was underpowered.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mean Oxygen Saturation during Sleep Is Related to Specific Brain Atrophy Pattern</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25728?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25728?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much controversy about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of sleep‐disordered breathing on the brain. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between markers of sleep‐related hypoxemia and brain anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used data from a large‐scale cohort from the general population (n = 775, 50.6% males, age range = 45–86 years, mean age = 60.3 ± 9.9) that underwent full polysomnography and brain magnetic resonance imaging to correlate respiratory variables with regional brain volume estimates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, gender, and cardiovascular risk factors, only mean oxygen saturation during sleep was associated with bilateral volume of hippocampus (right: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001; left: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), thalamus (right: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; left: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), putamen (right: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001; left: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001), and angular gyrus (right: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011; left: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). We observed the same relationship in left hemispheric amygdala (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010), caudate (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008), inferior frontal gyrus (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004), and supramarginal gyrus (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003). The other respiratory variables—lowest oxygen saturation, percentage of sleep time with oxygen saturation &amp;lt; 90%, apnea–hypopnea index, and oxygen desaturation index—did not show any significant association with brain volumes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower mean oxygen saturation during sleep was associated with atrophy of cortical and subcortical brain areas known for high sensitivity to oxygen supply. Their vulnerability to hypoxemia may contribute to behavioral phenotype and cognitive decline in patients with sleep‐disordered breathing. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Central afferents to the nucleus of the solitary tract in rats and mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24927?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24927?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) regulates life‐sustaining functions ranging from appetite and digestion to heart rate and breathing. It is also the brain’s primary sensory nucleus for visceral sensations relevant to symptoms in medical and psychiatric disorders. To better understand which neurons may exert top‐down control over the NTS, here we provide a brain‐wide map of all neurons that project axons directly to the caudal, viscerosensory NTS, focusing on a medial subregion with aldosterone‐sensitive HSD2 neurons. Injecting an axonal tracer (cholera toxin b) into the NTS produces a similar pattern of retrograde labeling in rats and mice. The paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), lateral hypothalamic area, and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) contain the densest concentrations of NTS‐projecting neurons. PVH afferents are glutamatergic (express &lt;i&gt;Slc17a6&lt;/i&gt;/Vglut2) and are distinct from neuroendocrine PVH neurons. CeA afferents are GABAergic (express &lt;i&gt;Slc32a1&lt;/i&gt;/Vgat) and are distributed largely in the medial CeA subdivision. Other retrogradely labeled neurons are located in a variety of brain regions, including the cerebral cortex (insular and infralimbic areas), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, periaqueductal gray, Barrington’s nucleus, Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus, hindbrain reticular formation, and rostral NTS. Similar patterns of retrograde labeling result from tracer injections into different NTS subdivisions, with dual retrograde tracing revealing that many afferent neurons project axon collaterals to both the lateral and medial NTS subdivisions. This information provides a roadmap for studying descending axonal projections that may influence visceromotor systems and visceral “mind–body” symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A Prospective Study of Acute Blood‐Based Biomarkers for Sport‐Related Concussion</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25725?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25725?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prospectively characterize changes in serum proteins following sport‐related concussion and determine whether candidate biomarkers discriminate concussed athletes from controls and are associated with duration of symptoms following concussion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High school and collegiate athletes were enrolled between 2015 and 2018. Blood was collected at preinjury baseline and within 6 hours (early acute) and at 24 to 48 hours (late acute) following concussion in football players (n = 106), matched uninjured football players (n = 84), and non–contact‐sport athletes (n = 50). Glial fibrillary acidic protein, ubiquitin c‐terminal hydrolase‐L1, S100 calcium binding protein B, alpha‐II‐spectrin breakdown product 150, interleukin 6, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, and c‐reactive protein were measured in serum. Linear models assessed changes in protein concentrations over time. Receiver operating curves quantified the discrimination of concussed athletes from controls. A Cox proportional hazard model determined whether proteins were associated with symptom recovery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All proteins except glial fibrillary acidic protein and c‐reactive protein were significantly elevated at the early acute phase postinjury relative to baseline and both control groups and discriminated concussed athletes from controls with areas under the curve of 0.68 to 0.84. The candidate biomarkers also significantly improved the discrimination of concussed athletes from noncontact controls compared to symptom severity alone. Glial fibrillary acidic protein was elevated postinjury relative to baseline in concussed athletes with a loss of consciousness or amnesia. Finally, early acute levels of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist were associated with the number of days to symptom recovery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain injury and inflammatory proteins show promise as objective diagnostic biomarkers for sport‐related concussion, and inflammatory markers may provide prognostic value. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: The Neural Dynamics of Individual Differences in Episodic Autobiographical Memory</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The ability to mentally travel to specific events from one’s past, dubbed episodic autobiographical memory (E-AM), contributes to adaptive functioning. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying its typical interindividual variation remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we capitalize on existing evidence that successful performance on E-AM tasks draws on the ability to visualize past episodes and reinstate their unique spatiotemporal context. Hence, here, we test whether features of the brain’s functional architecture relevant to perceptual versus conceptual processes shape individual differences in both self-rated E-AM and laboratory-based episodic memory (EM) for random visual scene sequences (visual EM). We propose that superior subjective E-AM and visual EM are associated with greater similarity in static neural organization patterns, potentially indicating greater efficiency in switching, between rest and mental states relevant to encoding perceptual information. Complementarily, we postulate that impoverished subjective E-AM and visual EM are linked to dynamic brain organization patterns implying a predisposition towards semanticizing novel perceptual information. Analyses were conducted on resting state and task-based fMRI data from 329 participants (160 women) in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) who completed visual and verbal EM assessments, and an independent gender diverse sample (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 59) who self-rated their E-AM. Interindividual differences in subjective E-AM were linked to the same neural mechanisms underlying visual, but not verbal, EM, in general agreement with the hypothesized static and dynamic brain organization patterns. Our results suggest that higher E-AM entails more efficient processing of temporally extended information sequences, whereas lower E-AM entails more efficient semantic or gist-based processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>More often than not, action potentials fail to trigger neurotransmitter release. And even when neurotransmitter is released, the resulting change in synaptic conductance is highly variable. Given the energetic cost of generating and propagating action potentials, and the importance of information transmission across synapses, this seems both wasteful and inefficient. However, synaptic noise arising from variable transmission can improve, in certain restricted conditions, information transmission.</description>

	<description>Bartolo and Averbeck show that primates infer changes in reward contingencies, consistent with Bayesian inference strategies, incorporating knowledge about task structure to quickly adjust their behavior. Posterior probability estimates correlate with neural ensemble activity in prefrontal cortex, suggesting that the brain implements Bayesian-like mechanisms for state inference.</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Chemospecific Deficits in Taste Sensitivity Following Bilateral or Right Hemispheric Gustatory Cortex Lesions in Rats.&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0833c403-68d2-4456-a2b5-e965abc8ed96/cne24928-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a taste signal detection task with a specialized gustometer, we found that extensive lesions bilaterally in the rat gustatory cortex (BGCX), or in the right GC (not shown), impair taste sensitivity (significant shift of EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) for NaCl but not for maltodextrin (Maltrin) or citric acid relative the sham‐operated rats (SHAM).  In addition to suggesting some degree of laterality of function in GC with respect to NaCl detection, these findings add to growing evidence suggesting that gustatory sites outside of GC can maintain normal taste sensitivity for select stimuli.  



&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our prior studies showed bilateral gustatory cortex (GC) lesions significantly impair taste sensitivity to salts (NaCl and KCl) and quinine (“bitter”) but not to sucrose (“sweet”). The range of qualitative tastants tested here has been extended in a theoretically relevant way to include the maltodextrin, Maltrin, a preferred stimulus by rats thought to represent a unique taste quality, and the “sour” stimulus citric acid; NaCl was also included as a positive control. Male rats (Sprague‐Dawley) with histologically confirmed neurotoxin‐induced bilateral (BGCX, n=13), or right (LGCX, n=13) or left (RGCX, n=9) unilateral GC lesions and sham‐operated controls (SHAM, n=16) were trained to discriminate a tastant from water in an operant two‐response detection task. A mapping system was used to determine placement, size, and symmetry (when bilateral) of the lesion. BGCX significantly impaired taste sensitivity to NaCl, as expected, but not to Maltrin or citric acid, emulating our prior results with sucrose. However, in the case of citric acid, there was some disruption in performance at higher concentrations. Interestingly, RGCX, but not LGCX, also significantly impaired taste sensitivity, but only to NaCl, suggesting some degree of lateralized function. Taken together with our prior findings, extensive bilateral lesions in GC do not disrupt basic taste signal detection to all taste stimuli uniformly. Moreover, GC lesions do not preclude the ability of rats to learn and perform the task, clearly demonstrating that, in its absence, other brain regions are able to maintain sensory‐discriminative taste processing, albeit with attenuated sensitivity for select stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: High-dimensional mediation analysis in survival models</title>

Mediation analysis with high-dimensional DNA methylation markers is important in identifying epigenetic pathways between environmental exposures and health outcomes. There have been some methodology developments of mediation analysis with high-dimensional mediators. However, high-dimensional mediation analysis methods for time-to-event outcome data are still yet to be developed. To address these challenges, we propose a new high-dimensional mediation analysis procedure for survival models by incorporating sure independent screening and minimax concave penalty techniques for variable selection, with the Sobel and the joint method for significance test of indirect effect. The simulation studies show good performance in identifying correct biomarkers, false discovery rate control, and minimum estimation bias of the proposed procedure. We also apply this approach to study the causal pathway from smoking to overall survival among lung cancer patients potentially mediated by 365,307 DNA methylations in the TCGA lung cancer cohort. Mediation analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model estimates that patients who have serious smoking history increase the risk of lung cancer through methylation markers including cg21926276, cg27042065, and cg26387355 with significant hazard ratios of 1.2497(95%CI: 1.1121, 1.4045), 1.0920(95%CI: 1.0170, 1.1726), and 1.1489(95%CI: 1.0518, 1.2550), respectively. The three methylation sites locate in the three genes which have been showed to be associated with lung cancer event or overall survival. However, the three CpG sites (cg21926276, cg27042065 and cg26387355) have not been reported, which are newly identified as the potential novel epigenetic markers linking smoking and survival of lung cancer patients. Collectively, the proposed high-dimensional mediation analysis procedure has good performance in mediator selection and indirect effect estimation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tK75AlvMauI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) comprise over 90% of cells in the striatum. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; MSNs display coherent burst firing cell assembly activity patterns, even though isolated MSNs do not burst fire intrinsically. This activity is important for the learning and execution of action sequences and is characteristically dysregulated in Huntington’s Disease (HD). However, how dysregulation is caused by the various neural pathologies affecting MSNs in HD is unknown. Previous modeling work using simple cell models has shown that cell assembly activity patterns can emerge as a result of MSN inhibitory network interactions. Here, by directly estimating MSN network model parameters from single unit spiking data, we show that a network composed of much more physiologically detailed MSNs provides an excellent quantitative fit to wild type (WT) mouse spiking data, but only when network parameters are appropriate for the striatum. We find the WT MSN network is situated in a regime close to a transition from stable to strongly fluctuating network dynamics. This regime facilitates the generation of low-dimensional slowly varying coherent activity patterns and confers high sensitivity to variations in cortical driving. By re-estimating the model on HD spiking data we discover network parameter modifications are consistent across three very different types of HD mutant mouse models (YAC128, Q175, R6/2). In striking agreement with the known pathophysiology we find feedforward excitatory drive is reduced in HD compared to WT mice, while recurrent inhibition also shows phenotype dependency. We show that these modifications shift the HD MSN network to a sub-optimal regime where higher dimensional incoherent rapidly fluctuating activity predominates. Our results provide insight into a diverse range of experimental findings in HD, including cognitive and motor symptoms, and may suggest new avenues for treatment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Te8nacmED6U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The main neuronal population of the striatum are GABAergic medium spiny neurons. Calbindin is preferentially expressed in medium spiny neurons involved in the indirect pathway. The perinatal asphyxia (PA) group showed a significant decrease in calbindin neurons and a paradoxical increase in neurons estimated by NeuN staining. Moreover, Calretinin+ cells, a specific subpopulation of GABAergic neurons, showed an increase caused by perinatal asphyxia. Deep hypothermia reversed most of these alterations probably by protecting calbindin neurons.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Region‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐specific expression of Na,K‐ATPase alpha and beta subunit isoforms in the mouse brain</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Region‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐specific expression of Na,K‐ATPase alpha and beta subunit isoforms in the mouse brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cd293a00-25fd-47b7-a05f-c21a2818d998/cne24924-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na,K‐ATPase comprises α (&lt;i&gt;Atp1a&lt;/i&gt;), β (&lt;i&gt;Atp1b&lt;/i&gt;), and FXYD subunits, and each subunit has isoforms. &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization for α and β subunit isoforms revealed regional‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐specific expression of the isoforms in the mouse brain. The photograph shows &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; (red) and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; (green) expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (stained with DAPI, blue).


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na,K‐ATPase is a ubiquitous molecule contributing to the asymmetrical distribution of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions across the plasma membrane and maintenance of the membrane potential, a prerequisite of neuronal activity. Na,K‐ATPase comprises three subunits (α, β, and FXYD). The α subunit has four isoforms in mice, with three of them (α1, α2, and α3) expressed in the brain. However, the functional and biological significances of the different brain isoforms remain to be fully elucidated. Recent studies have revealed the association of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;, a gene encoding α3 subunit, with neurological disorders. To map the cellular distributions of the α subunit isoforms and their coexpression patterns, we evaluated the mRNA expression of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Atp1a2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; by &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization in the mouse brain. &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; were expressed in neurons, whereas &lt;i&gt;Atp1a2&lt;/i&gt; was almost exclusively expressed in glial cells. Most neurons coexpressed &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;, with highly heterogeneous expression levels across the brain regions and neuronal subtypes. We identified parvalbumin‐expressing GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus, somatosensory cortex, and retrosplenial cortex as an example of a neuronal subtype expressing low &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and high &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;. The expression of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b&lt;/i&gt; isoforms was also heterogeneous across brain regions and cellular subtypes. The parvalbumin‐expressing neurons expressed a high level of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b1&lt;/i&gt; and a low level of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1b3&lt;/i&gt;. These findings provide basic information on the region‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐dependent expression of Na,K‐ATPase α and β subunit isoforms, as well as a rationale for the selective involvement of neurons expressing high levels of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; in neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eNeuro: Differential Effects of Nasal Inflammation and Odor Deprivation on Layer-Specific Degeneration of the Mouse Olfactory Bulb</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Harmful environmental agents cause nasal inflammation, and chronic nasal inflammation induces a loss of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and reversible atrophy of the olfactory bulb (OB). Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying this inflammation-induced OB atrophy by histologically and biochemically comparing the OB changes in mouse models of nasal inflammation and odor deprivation. In addition, we examined whether odor stimulation is necessary for OB recovery from atrophy. One group of adult male C57BL/6 mice was administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) unilaterally for 10 weeks to induce nasal inflammation (control animals received saline), and a second group received unilateral naris closures (NCs) for 10 weeks of odor deprivation. The OBs atrophied in both models, but odor deprivation shrank the glomerular, external plexiform, mitral, and granule cell layers (GCLs), whereas the olfactory nerve, glomerular, and external plexiform layers (EPLs) atrophied as a result of nasal inflammation. Additionally, nasal inflammation, but not odor deprivation, caused neuroinflammation in the OB, inducing glial activation and elevated expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and TNFα. After 10 weeks of nasal inflammation, mice were housed for another 10 weeks with no additional treatment or with unilateral NC. Nasal inflammation and glial activation subsided in both groups, but glomerular and EPLs recovered only in those with no additional treatment. Our findings demonstrate that nasal inflammation and odor deprivation differentially induce layer-specific degeneration in the OB, that loss of OSN activity rather than neuroinflammation is a major cause of inflammation-induced OB atrophy, and that odor stimulation is required for OB recovery from atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Localized Calcium Signaling and the Control of Coupling at Cx36 Gap Junctions</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A variety of electrical synapses are capable of activity-dependent plasticity, including both activity-dependent potentiation and activity-dependent depression. In several types of neurons, activity-dependent electrical synapse plasticity depends on changes in the local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; environment. To enable study of local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling that regulates plasticity, we developed a GCaMP Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; biosensor fused to the electrical synapse protein Connexin 36 (Cx36). Cx36-GCaMP transfected into mammalian cell cultures formed gap junctions at cell-cell boundaries and supported Neurobiotin tracer coupling that was regulated by protein kinase A signaling in the same way as Cx36. Cx36-GCaMP gap junctions robustly reported local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increases in response to addition of a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ionophore with increases in fluorescence that recovered during washout. Recovery was strongly dependent on Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exchange activity. In cells transfected with NMDA receptor subunits, Cx36-GCaMP revealed transient and concentration-dependent increases in local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; on brief application of glutamate. In HeLa cells, glutamate application increased Cx36-GCaMP tracer coupling through a mechanism that depended in part on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity. This potentiation of coupling did not require exogenous expression of glutamate receptors, but could be accomplished by endogenously expressed glutamate receptors with pharmacological characteristics reminiscent of NMDA and kainate receptors. Analysis of RNA Sequencing data from HeLa cells confirmed expression of NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2C, and NR3B. In summary, Cx36-GCaMP is an effective tool to measure changes in the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; microenvironment around Cx36 gap junctions. Furthermore, HeLa cells can serve as a model system to study glutamate receptor-driven potentiation of electrical synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The intercollicular region, which lies between the inferior and superior colliculi in the midbrain, contains neurons that respond to auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli. Golgi studies have been used to parse this region into three distinct nuclei: the intercollicular tegmentum (ICt), the rostral pole of the inferior colliculus (ICrp), and the nucleus of the brachium of the IC (NBIC). Few reports have focused on these nuclei, especially the ICt and the ICrp, possibly due to lack of a marker that distinguishes these areas and is compatible with modern methods. Here, we show that staining for GABAergic cells (magenta) and perineuronal nets (green) differentiates these intercollicular nuclei in guinea pigs.

Here, we found that staining for GABAergic cells and perineuronal nets differentiates these intercollicular nuclei in guinea pigs. Further, we found that the proportions of four subtypes of GABAergic cells differentiate intercollicular nuclei from each other and from adjacent inferior collicular subdivisions. Our results support earlier studies that suggest distinct morphology and functions for intercollicular nuclei, and provide staining methods that differentiate intercollicular nuclei and are compatible with most modern techniques. We hope that this will help future studies to further characterize the intercollicular region.&lt;/p&gt;

To adequately assess the biophysical mechanisms governing intrinsic brain activity, a detailed characterization of the dynamical features of functional networks is needed from the experimental side to constrain theoretical models. In this work, we use an open-source fMRI dataset from 100 healthy participants from the Human Connectome Project and analyze whole-brain activity using Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA), which serves to characterize brain activity at each time point by its whole-brain BOLD phase-locking pattern. Clustering these BOLD phase-locking patterns into a set of k states, we demonstrate that the cluster centroids closely overlap with reference functional subsystems. Borrowing tools from dynamical systems theory, we characterize spontaneous brain activity in the form of trajectories within the state space, calculating the Fractional Occupancy and the Dwell Times of each state, as well as the Transition Probabilities between states. Finally, we demonstrate that within-subject reliability is maximized when including the high frequency components of the BOLD signal (&amp;gt;0.1 Hz), indicating the existence of individual fingerprints in dynamical patterns evolving at least as fast as the temporal resolution of acquisition (here TR = 0.72 s). Our results reinforce the mechanistic scenario that resting-state networks are the expression of erratic excursions from a baseline synchronous steady state into weakly-stable partially-synchronized states – which we term ghost attractors. To better understand the rules governing the transitions between ghost attractors, we use methods from dynamical systems theory, giving insights into high-order mechanisms underlying brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to form memories in the brain is needed for daily functions, and its impairment is associated with human mental disorders. Evidence indicates that long-term memory (LTM)-related processes such as its consolidation, extinction and forgetting involve changes of synaptic efficacy produced by alterations in neural transmission and morphology. Modulation of the morphology and number of dendritic spines has been proposed to contribute to changes in neuronal transmission mediating such LTM-related processes. Rac GTPase activity is regulated by synaptic activation and it can affect spine morphology by controlling actin-regulatory proteins. Recent evidence shows that changes in Rac GTPase activity affect memory consolidation, extinction, erasure and forgetting and can affect spine morphology in brain areas that mediate these behaviors. Altered Rac GTPase activity is associated with abnormal spine morphology and brain disorders. By affecting Rac GTPase activity we can further understand the roles of spine morphogenesis in memory. Moreover, manipulation of Rac GTPase activity may serve as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of memory-related brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Transgenic Cross-Referencing of Inhibitory and Excitatory Interneuron Populations to Dissect Neuronal Heterogeneity in the Dorsal Horn</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The superficial dorsal horn (SDH, LI-II) of the spinal cord receives and processes multimodal sensory information from skin, muscle, joints, and viscera then relay it to the brain. Neurons within the SDH fall into two broad categories, projection neurons and interneurons. The later can be further subdivided into excitatory and inhibitory types. Traditionally, interneurons within the SDH have been divided into overlapping groups according to their neurochemical, morphological and electrophysiological properties. Recent clustering analyses, based on molecular transcript profiles of cells and nuclei, have predicted many more functional groups of interneurons than expected using traditional approaches. In this study, we used electrophysiological and morphological data obtained from genetically-identified excitatory (vGLUT2) and inhibitory (vGAT) interneurons in transgenic mice to cluster cells into groups sharing common characteristics and subsequently determined how many clusters can be assigned by combinations of these properties. Consistent with previous reports, we show differences exist between excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in terms of their excitability, nature of the ongoing excitatory drive, action potential (AP) properties, sub-threshold current kinetics, and morphology. The resulting clusters based on statistical and unbiased assortment of these data fell well short of the numbers of molecularly predicted clusters. There was no clear characteristic that in isolation defined a population, rather multiple variables were needed to predict cluster membership. Importantly though, our analysis highlighted the appropriateness of using transgenic lines as tools to functionally subdivide both excitatory and inhibitory interneuron populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Sleep State Modulates Resting-State Functional Connectivity in Neonates</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The spontaneous cerebral activity that gives rise to resting-state networks (RSNs) has been extensively studied in infants in recent years. However, the influence of sleep state on the presence of observable RSNs has yet to be formally investigated in the infant population, despite evidence that sleep modulates resting-state functional connectivity in adults. This effect could be extremely important, as most infant neuroimaging studies rely on the neonate to remain asleep throughout data acquisition. In this study, we combine functional near-infrared spectroscopy with electroencephalography to simultaneously monitor sleep state and investigate RSNs in a cohort of healthy term born neonates. During active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) our newborn neonates show functional connectivity patterns spatially consistent with previously reported RSN structures. Our three independent functional connectivity analyses revealed stronger interhemispheric connectivity during AS than during QS. In turn, within hemisphere short-range functional connectivity seems to be enhanced during QS. These findings underline the importance of sleep state monitoring in the investigation of RSNs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Evidence for Structural and Functional Alterations of Frontal-Executive and Corticolimbic Circuits in Late-Life Depression and Relationship to Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia: A Systematic Review</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Depression is a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease and Related Dementia (ADRD). We conducted a systematic review between 2008 and October 2018, to evaluate the evidence for a conceptual mechanistic model linking depression and ADRD, focusing on frontal-executive and corticolimbic circuits. We focused on two neuroimaging modalities: diffusion-weighted imaging measuring white matter tract disruptions and resting-state functional MRI measuring alterations in network dynamics in late-life depression (LLD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and LLD+MCI vs. healthy control (HC) individuals. Our data synthesis revealed that in some but not all studies, impairment of both frontal-executive and corticolimbic circuits, as well as impairment of global brain topology was present in LLD, MCI, and LLD+MCI vs. HC groups. Further, posterior midline regions (posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus) appeared to have the most structural and functional alterations in all patient groups. Future cohort and longitudinal studies are required to address the heterogeneity of findings, and to clarify which subgroups of people with LLD are at highest risk for developing MCI and ADRD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Visual Feedback Modulates Aftereffects and Electrophysiological Markers of Prism Adaptation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00138</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Prism adaptation (PA) is both a model for visuomotor learning and a promising treatment for visuospatial neglect after stroke. The task involves reaching for targets while prism glasses horizontally displace the visual field. Adaptation is hypothesized to occur through two processes: strategic recalibration, a rapid self-correction of pointing errors; and spatial realignment, a more gradual adjustment of visuomotor reference frames that produce prism aftereffects (i.e., reaching errors upon glasses removal in the direction opposite to the visual shift). While aftereffects can ameliorate neglect, not all patients respond to PA, and the neural mechanisms underlying successful adaptation are unclear. We investigated the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the P300 event-related potential (ERP) components as candidate markers of strategic recalibration and spatial realignment, respectively. Healthy young adults wore prism glasses and performed memory-guided reaching toward vertical-line targets. ERPs were recorded in response to three different between-subject error feedback conditions at screen-touch: view of hand and target (Experiment 1), view of hand only (Experiment 2), or view of lines to mark target and hand position (view of hand occluded; Experiment 3). Conditions involving a direct view of the hand-produced stronger aftereffects than indirect hand feedback, and also evoked a P300 that decreased in amplitude as adaptation proceeded. Conversely, the FRN was only seen in conditions involving target feedback, even when aftereffects were smaller. Since conditions producing stronger aftereffects were associated with a phase-sensitive P300, this component may index a “context-updating” realignment process critical for strong aftereffects, whereas the FRN may reflect an error monitoring process related to strategic recalibration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Training on an Appetitive Trace-Conditioning Task Increases Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis and the Expression of Arc, Erk and CREB Proteins in the Dorsal Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00089</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) plays an essential role in hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation. Increased neurogenesis enhances learning, whereas its ablation causes memory impairment. In contrast, few reports suggest that neurogenesis reduces after learning. Although the interest in exploring the role of adult neurogenesis in learning has been growing, the evidence is still limited. The role of the trace- and delay-appetitive-conditioning on AHN and its underlying mechanism are not known. The consolidation of trace-conditioned memory requires the hippocampus, but delay-conditioning does not. Moreover, the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and ventral hippocampus (VH) may have a differential role in these two conditioning paradigms. Here, we have investigated the changes in: (A) hippocampal cell proliferation and their progression towards neuronal lineage; and (B) expression of Arc, Erk1, Erk2, and CREB proteins in the DH and VH after trace- and delay-conditioning in the rat. The number of newly generated cells significantly increased in the trace-conditioned but did not change in the delay-conditioned animals compared to the control group. Similarly, the expression of Arc protein significantly increased in the DH but not in the VH after trace-conditioning. Nonetheless, it remains unaltered in the delay-conditioned group. The expression of pErk1, pErk2, and pCREB also increased in the DH after trace-conditioning. Whereas, the expression of only pErk1 pErk2 and pCREB proteins increased in the VH after delay-conditioning. Our results suggest that appetitive trace-conditioning enhances AHN. The increased DH neuronal activation and pErk1, pErk2, and pCREB in the DH may be playing an essential role in learning-induced cell-proliferation after appetitive trace-conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Intracellular Trafficking Mechanisms of Synaptic Dysfunction in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory loss. Although AD neuropathological hallmarks are extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular tau tangles, the best correlate of disease progression is synapse loss. What causes synapse loss has been the focus of several researchers in the AD field. Synapses become dysfunctional before plaques and tangles form. Studies based on early-onset familial AD (eFAD) models have supported that synaptic transmission is depressed by β-amyloid (Aβ) triggered mechanisms. Since eFAD is rare, affecting only 1% of patients, research has shifted to the study of the most common late-onset AD (LOAD). Intracellular trafficking has emerged as one of the pathways of LOAD genes. Few studies have assessed the impact of trafficking LOAD genes on synapse dysfunction. Since endocytic traffic is essential for synaptic function, we reviewed Aβ-dependent and independent mechanisms of the earliest synaptic dysfunction in AD. We have focused on the role of intraneuronal and secreted Aβ oligomers, highlighting the dysfunction of endocytic trafficking as an Aβ-dependent mechanism of synapse dysfunction in AD. Here, we reviewed the LOAD trafficking genes APOE4, ABCA7, BIN1, CD2AP, PICALM, EPH1A, and SORL1, for which there is a synaptic link. We conclude that in eFAD and LOAD, the earliest synaptic dysfunctions are characterized by disruptions of the presynaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis and of postsynaptic glutamate receptor endocytosis. While in eFAD synapse dysfunction seems to be triggered by Aβ, in LOAD, there might be a direct synaptic disruption by LOAD trafficking genes. To identify promising therapeutic targets and biomarkers of the earliest synaptic dysfunction in AD, it will be necessary to join efforts in further dissecting the mechanisms used by Aβ and by LOAD genes to disrupt synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Resveratrol Derivatives as Potential Treatments for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive loss of neurons in different regions of the nervous system. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the two most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, and the symptoms associated with these pathologies are closely related to the regions that are most affected by the process of neurodegeneration. Despite their high prevalence, currently, there is no cure or disease-modifying drugs for the treatment of these conditions. In the last decades, due to the need for the development of new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, several authors have investigated the neuroprotective actions of naturally occurring molecules, such as resveratrol. Resveratrol is a stilbene found in several plants, including grapes, blueberries, raspberries, and peanuts. Studies have shown that resveratrol presents neuroprotective actions in experimental models of AD and PD, however, its clinical application is limited due to its rapid metabolism and low bioavailability. In this context, studies have proposed that structural changes in the resveratrol molecule, including glycosylation, alkylation, halogenation, hydroxylation, methylation, and prenylation could lead to the development of derivatives with enhanced bioavailability and pharmacological activity. Therefore, this review article aims to discuss how resveratrol derivatives could represent viable molecules in the search for new drugs for the treatment of AD and PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Unlike in the healthy mammalian retina, macrophages in retinal degenerative states are not solely comprised of microglia but may include monocyte-derived recruits. Recent studies have applied transgenics, lineage-tracing, and transcriptomics to help decipher the distinct roles of these two cell types in the disease settings of inherited retinal degenerations and age-related macular degeneration. Literature discussed here focuses on the ectopic presence of both macrophage types in the extracellular site surrounding the outer aspect of photoreceptor cells (i.e., the subretinal space), which is crucially involved in the pathobiology.</description>

The activation process of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been extensively studied, both experimentally and computationally. In particular, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have proven useful in exploring GPCR conformational space. The typical behaviour of class A GPCRs, when subjected to unbiased MD simulations from their crystallized inactive state, is to fluctuate between inactive and intermediate(s) conformations, even with bound agonist. Fully active conformation(s) are rarely stabilized unless a G protein is also bound. Despite several crystal structures of the adenosine A2a receptor (A2aR) having been resolved in complex with co-crystallized agonists and G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; protein, its agonist-mediated activation process is still not completely understood. In order to thoroughly examine the conformational landscape of A2aR activation, we performed unbiased microsecond-length MD simulations in quadruplicate, starting from the inactive conformation either in apo or with bound agonists: endogenous adenosine or synthetic NECA, embedded in two homogeneous phospholipid membranes: 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoglycerol (DOPG) or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (DOPC). In DOPC with bound adenosine or NECA, we observe transition to an intermediate receptor conformation consistent with the known adenosine-bound crystal state. In apo state in DOPG, two different intermediate conformations are obtained. One is similar to that observed with bound adenosine in DOPC, while the other is closer to the active state but not yet fully active. Exclusively, in DOPG with bound adenosine or NECA, we reproducibly identify receptor conformations with fully active features, which are able to dock G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; protein. These different receptor conformations can be attributed to the action/absence of agonist and phospholipid-mediated allosteric effects on the intracellular side of the receptor.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NukOdQKdP7w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Metabolism plays an essential role in cell fate decisions. However, the methods used for metabolic characterization and for finding potential metabolic regulators are still based on characterizing cellular metabolic steady-state which is dependent on the extracellular environment. In this work, we hypothesized that the response dynamics of intracellular metabolic pools to extracellular stimuli is controlled in a cell type-specific manner. We applied principles of process dynamics and control to human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) and human neural stem cells (hNSC) subjected to a sudden extracellular glutamine step. The fold-changes of steady-states and the transient profiles of metabolic pools revealed that dynamic responses were reproducible and cell type-specific. Importantly, many amino acids had conserved dynamics and readjusted their steady state concentration in response to the increased glutamine influx. Overall, we propose a novel methodology for systematic metabolic characterization and identification of potential metabolic regulators.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Vf2lqiKUr80&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The metabolic responses of bacteria to dynamic extracellular conditions drives not only the behavior of single species, but also entire communities of microbes. Over the last decade, genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions have assisted in our appreciation of important metabolic determinants of bacterial physiology. These network models have been a powerful force in understanding the metabolic capacity that species may utilize in order to succeed in an environment. Increasingly, an understanding of context-specific metabolism is critical for elucidating metabolic drivers of larger phenotypes and disease. However, previous approaches to use network models in concert with omics data to better characterize experimental systems have met challenges due to assumptions necessary by the various integration platforms or due to large input data requirements. With these challenges in mind, we developed RIPTiDe (Reaction Inclusion by Parsimony and Transcript Distribution) which uses both transcriptomic abundances and parsimony of overall flux to identify the most cost-effective usage of metabolism that also best reflects the cell’s investments into transcription. Additionally, in biological samples where it is difficult to quantify specific growth conditions, it becomes critical to develop methods that require lower amounts of user intervention in order to generate accurate metabolic predictions. Utilizing a metabolic network reconstruction for the model organism &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; str. K-12 substr. MG1655 (iJO1366), we found that RIPTiDe correctly identifies context-specific metabolic pathway activity without supervision or knowledge of specific media conditions. We also assessed the application of RIPTiDe to &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; metatranscriptomic data where &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; was present at high abundances, and found that our approach also effectively predicts metabolic behaviors of host-associated bacteria. In the setting of human health, understanding metabolic changes within bacteria in environments where growth substrate availability is difficult to quantify can have large downstream impacts on our ability to elucidate molecular drivers of disease-associated dysbiosis across the microbiota. Our results indicate that RIPTiDe may have potential to provide understanding of context-specific metabolism of bacteria within complex communities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O_WMeLH3KF0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

As biodiversity loss continues to accelerate, there is a critical need for education and biomonitoring across the globe. Portable technologies allow for in situ molecular biodiversity monitoring that has been historically out of reach for many researchers in habitat nations. In the realm of education, portable tools such as DNA sequencers facilitate in situ hands-on training in real-time sequencing and interpretation techniques. Here, we provide step-by-step protocols as a blueprint for a terrestrial conservation genetics field training program that uses low-cost, portable devices to conduct genomics-based training directly in biodiverse habitat countries.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/5UHGG07zPE8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Encouragement of students across all communities through scientific outreach programs is critical to engaging the next generation, exciting young minds to pursue careers in science and medicine. Herein, we present a uniquely structured and widely influential science outreach program. Founded in 2005, the Duke Chemistry Outreach (DCO) employs a pedagogical approach to outreach that aims to teach its audience a new scientific concept, while instilling a pure enjoyment of science. DCO has performed 583 events reaching over 70,000 participants throughout 2,270 hours, with the majority of events in Durham, the surrounding North Carolinian communities, and across 8 other states. The flexibility and diversity of this outreach program creates a framework amendable for others to adopt in both secondary and higher education settings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qXtW92bkbuE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro: Proteasomal-Mediated Degradation of AKAP150 Accompanies AMPAR Endocytosis during cLTD</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The number and function of synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) tightly regulates excitatory synaptic transmission. Current evidence suggests that AMPARs are inserted into the postsynaptic membrane during long-term potentiation (LTP) and are removed from the membrane during long-term depression (LTD). Dephosphorylation of GluA1 at Ser-845 and enhanced endocytosis are critical events in the modulation of LTD. Moreover, changes in scaffold proteins from the postsynaptic density (PSD) could be also related to AMPAR regulation in LTD. In the present study we analyzed the effect of chemical LTD (cLTD) on A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP)150 and AMPARs levels in mouse-cultured neurons. We show that cLTD induces AKAP150 protein degradation via proteasome, coinciding with GluA1 dephosphorylation at Ser-845 and endocytosis of GluA1-containing AMPARs. Pharmacological inhibition of proteasome activity, but not phosphatase calcineurin (CaN), reverted cLTD-induced AKAP150 protein degradation. Importantly, AKAP150 silencing induced dephosphorylation of GluA1 Ser-845 and GluA1-AMPARs endocytosis while AKAP150 overexpression blocked cLTD-mediated GluA1-AMPARs endocytosis. Our results provide direct evidence that cLTD-induced AKAP150 degradation by the proteasome contributes to synaptic AMPARs endocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Circulating MicroRNAs as Diagnostic Biomarkers for Motor Neuron Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00354</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Motor neuron disease (MND) is a kind of neurodegenerative disease that selectively invades spinal cord anterior horn cells, brainstem motor neurons, cortical pyramidal cells and the pyramidal tract. The main clinical features are the symptoms and signs of impaired upper and lower motor neurons, manifested as muscle weakness, atrophy and pyramidal tract signs. Histopathology has shown the disappearance of pyramidal cells in the motor cortex, loss of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and brainstem, and degeneration of the corticospinal tract. Due to the lack of effective treatment methods, the prognosis is generally poor, so it is of great significance to confirm the diagnosis early by various means. However, the current diagnosis of MND mainly relies on the combination of clinical manifestations and neurophysiological examinations, lacking effective means of early diagnosis. Circulating microRNA (CmiRNA) is a kind of stable miRNA molecule in serum, plasma and other body fluids, which has the characteristics of distinct differential expression, sensitive detection and convenient sample collection. As a possible new biomarker of MND, CmiRNA can not only reveal the pathophysiological process of MND, but also monitor disease progression and response to drug therapy. With the development of miRNA detection technology, more and more CmiRNAs as biomarkers with potential diagnostic value have been investigated. In this review, we explored the possibility of circulating samples as different sources of biomarkers for the diagnosis of MND, analyzing the progress of CmiRNA detection techniques, and presenting potential diagnostic MND biomarkers that have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Genetic Association Between Alzheimer’s Disease Risk Variant of the PICALM Gene and EEG Functional Connectivity in Non-demented Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified and validated the association of the PICALM genotype with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The PICALM rs3851179 A allele is thought to have a protective effect, whereas the G allele appears to confer risk for AD. The influence of the PICALM genotype on brain functional connectivity in non-demented subjects remains largely unknown. We examined the association of the PICALM rs3851179 genotype with the characteristics of lagged linear connectivity (LLC) of resting EEG sources in 104 non-demented adults younger than 60 years of age. The EEG analysis was performed using exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) freeware (Pascual-Marqui et al., 2011). We found that the carriers of the A PICALM allele (PICALM AA and AG genotypes) had higher widespread interhemispheric LLC of alpha sources compared to the carriers of the GG PICALM allele. An exploratory correlation analysis showed a moderate positive association between the alpha LLC interhemispheric characteristics and the corpus callosum size and between the alpha interhemispheric LLC characteristics and the Luria word memory scores. These results suggest that the PICALM rs3851179 A allele provides protection against cognitive decline by facilitating neurophysiological reserve capacities in non-demented adults. In contrast, lower functional connectivity in carriers of the AD risk variant, PICALM GG, suggests early functional alterations in alpha rhythm networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Pushing the Limits of EEG: Estimation of Large-Scale Functional Brain Networks and Their Dynamics Validated by Simultaneous fMRI</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00323</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the technique of choice for detecting large-scale functional brain networks and to investigate their dynamics. Because fMRI measures brain activity indirectly, electroencephalography (EEG) has been recently considered a feasible tool for detecting such networks, particularly the resting-state networks (RSNs). However, a truly unbiased validation of such claims is still missing, which can only be accomplished by using simultaneously acquired EEG and fMRI data, due to the spontaneous nature of the activity underlying the RSNs. Additionally, EEG is still poorly explored for the purpose of mapping task-specific networks, and no studies so far have been focused on investigating networks’ dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) with EEG. Here, we started by validating RSNs derived from the continuous reconstruction of EEG sources by directly comparing them with those derived from simultaneous fMRI data of 10 healthy participants, and obtaining an average overlap (quantified by the Dice coefficient) of 0.4. We also showed the ability of EEG to map the facial expressions processing network (FEPN), highlighting regions near the posterior superior temporal sulcus, where the FEPN is anchored. Then, we measured the dFC using EEG for the first time in this context, estimated dFC brain states using dictionary learning, and compared such states with those obtained from the fMRI. We found a statistically significant match between fMRI and EEG dFC states, and determined the existence of two matched dFC states which contribution over time was associated with the brain activity at the FEPN, showing that the dynamics of FEPN can be captured by both fMRI and EEG. Our results push the limits of EEG toward being used as a brain imaging tool, while supporting the growing literature on EEG correlates of (dynamic) functional connectivity measured with fMRI, and providing novel insights into the coupling mechanisms underlying the two imaging techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Downregulation of eEF1A/EFT3-4 Enhances Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration After 6-OHDA Exposure in C. elegans Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the aggregation of α-synuclein protein and selective death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Although the molecular pathogenesis of PD is not completely understood, a recent study has reported that eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) declined in the PD-affected brain. Therefore, the roles of eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 in the prevention of DA neuronal cell death in PD are aimed to be investigated. Herein, by using Caenorhabditis elegans as a PD model, we investigated the role of eft-3/eft-4, the worm homolog of eEF1A1/eEF1A2, on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced DA neuron degeneration. Our results demonstrated that the expressions of eft-3 and eft-4 were decreased in the 6-OHDA-induced worms. RNA interference (RNAi) of eft-3 and eft-4 resulted in dramatic exacerbation of DA neurodegeneration induced by 6-OHDA, as well as aggravated the food-sensing behavior, ethanol avoidance, and decreased lifespan when compared with only 6-OHDA-induced worms. Moreover, downregulation of eft-3/4 in 6-OHDA-induced worms suppressed the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes, including PI3K/age-1, PDK-1/pdk-1, mTOR/let-363, and AKT-1,2/akt-1,2, promoting the expression of apoptotic genes such as BH3/egl-1 and Caspase-9/ced-3. Collectively, these findings indicate that eEF1A plays an important role in the 6-OHDA-induced neurodegeneration through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and that eEF1A isoforms may be a novel and effective pro-survival factor in protective DA neurons against toxin-induced neuronal death.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Music Form but Not Music Experience Modulates Motor Cortical Activity in Response to Novel Music</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;External cues, such as music, improve movement performance in persons with Parkinson’s disease. However, research examining the motor cortical mechanisms by which this occurs is lacking. Research using electroencephalography in healthy young adults has revealed that moving to music can modulate motor cortical activity. Moreover, motor cortical activity is further influenced by music experience. It remains unknown whether these effects extend to corticomotor excitability. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to determine the effects of novel music on corticomotor excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a pilot study of healthy young adults. A secondary aim of this study was to determine the influence of music experience on corticomotor excitability. We hypothesized that corticomotor excitability will change during music conditions, and that it will differ in those with formal music training. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous using single-pulse TMS in three conditions: (1) No Music, (2) Music Condition I, and (3) Music Condition II. Both pieces were set to novel MIDI piano instrumentation and part-writing conventions typical of early nineteenth-century Western classical practices. Results revealed Music Condition II (i.e., more relaxing music) compared to rest increased MEP amplitude (i.e., corticomotor excitability). Music Condition II as compared to Music Condition I (i.e., more activating music) reduced MEP variability (i.e., corticomotor variability). Finally, years of formal music training did not significantly influence corticomotor excitability while listening to music. Overall, results revealed that unfamiliar music modulates motor cortical excitability but is dependent upon the form of music and possibly music preference. These results will be used to inform planned studies in healthy older adults and people with Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Measuring Efficiency of Semi-automated Brain Tumor Segmentation by Simulating User Interaction</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, radiologists have crudely quantified tumor extent by measuring the longest and shortest dimension by dragging a cursor between opposite boundary points across a single image rather than full segmentation of the volumetric extent. For algorithmic-based volumetric segmentation, the degree of radiologist experiential involvement varies from confirming a fully automated segmentation, to making a single drag on an image to initiate semi-automated segmentation, to making multiple drags and clicks on multiple images during interactive segmentation. An experiment was designed to test an algorithm that allows various levels of interaction. Given the ground-truth of the BraTS training data, which delimits the brain tumors of 285 patients on multi-spectral MR, a computer simulation mimicked the process that a radiologist would follow to perform segmentation with real-time interaction. Clicks and drags were placed only where needed in response to the deviation between real-time segmentation results and assumed radiologist's goal, as provided by the ground-truth. Results of accuracy for various levels of interaction are presented along with estimated elapsed time, in order to measure efficiency. Average total elapsed time, including loading the study through confirming 3D contours, was 46 s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Attention is the important ability to flexibly control limited computational resources. It has been studied in conjunction with many other topics in neuroscience and psychology including awareness, vigilance, saliency, executive control, and learning. It has also recently been applied in several domains in machine learning. The relationship between the study of biological attention and its use as a tool to enhance artificial neural networks is not always clear. This review starts by providing an overview of how attention is conceptualized in the neuroscience and psychology literature. It then covers several use cases of attention in machine learning, indicating their biological counterparts where they exist. Finally, the ways in which artificial attention can be further inspired by biology for the production of complex and integrative systems is explored.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: A Computational Theory for the Emergence of Grammatical Categories in Cortical Dynamics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A general agreement in psycholinguistics claims that syntax and meaning are unified precisely and very quickly during online sentence processing. Although several theories have advanced arguments regarding the neurocomputational bases of this phenomenon, we argue that these theories could potentially benefit by including neurophysiological data concerning cortical dynamics constraints in brain tissue. In addition, some theories promote the integration of complex optimization methods in neural tissue. In this paper we attempt to fill these gaps introducing a computational model inspired in the dynamics of cortical tissue. In our modeling approach, proximal afferent dendrites produce stochastic cellular activations, while distal dendritic branches–on the other hand–contribute independently to somatic depolarization by means of dendritic spikes, and finally, prediction failures produce massive firing events preventing formation of sparse distributed representations. The model presented in this paper combines semantic and coarse-grained syntactic constraints for each word in a sentence context until grammatically related word function discrimination emerges spontaneously by the sole correlation of lexical information from different sources without applying complex optimization methods. By means of support vector machine techniques, we show that the sparse activation features returned by our approach are well suited—bootstrapping from the features returned by Word Embedding mechanisms—to accomplish grammatical function classification of individual words in a sentence. In this way we develop a biologically guided computational explanation for linguistically relevant unification processes in cortex which connects psycholinguistics to neurobiological accounts of language. We also claim that the computational hypotheses established in this research could foster future work on biologically-inspired learning algorithms for natural language processing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Perivascular Unit: This Must Be the Place. The Anatomical Crossroad Between the Immune, Vascular and Nervous System</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most neurological disorders seemingly have heterogenous pathogenesis, with overlapping contribution of neuronal, immune and vascular mechanisms of brain injury. The perivascular space in the brain represents a crossroad where those mechanisms interact, as well as a key anatomical component of the recently discovered glymphatic pathway, which is considered to play a crucial role in the clearance of brain waste linked to neurodegenerative diseases. The pathological interplay between neuronal, immune and vascular factors can create an environment that promotes self-perpetration of mechanisms of brain injury across different neurological diseases, including those that are primarily thought of as neurodegenerative, neuroinflammatory or cerebrovascular. Changes of the perivascular space can be monitored in humans in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the context of glymphatic clearance, MRI-visible enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) are considered to reflect glymphatic stasis secondary to the perivascular accumulation of brain debris, although they may also represent an adaptive mechanism of the glymphatic system to clear them. EPVS are also established correlates of dementia and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and are considered to reflect brain inflammatory activity. In this review, we describe the “perivascular unit” as a key anatomical and functional substrate for the interaction between neuronal, immune and vascular mechanisms of brain injury, which are shared across different neurological diseases. We will describe the main anatomical, physiological and pathological features of the perivascular unit, highlight potential substrates for the interplay between different noxae and summarize MRI studies of EPVS in cerebrovascular, neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are key events in signal transduction since they affect protein function by regulating their abundance and/or activity. PTMs involve the covalent attachment of functional groups to specific amino acids. Since they tend to be generally reversible, PTMs serve as regulators of signal transduction pathways. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major signaling proteins that undergo multiple types of PTMs. In this Review, we focus on the opioid receptors, members of GPCR family A, and highlight recent advances in the field that have underscored the importance of PTMs in the functional regulation of these receptors.</description>

	<description>Recent studies on the effects of sleep deprivation on synaptic plasticity have yielded discrepant results. Sleep deprivation studies using novelty exposure as a means to keep animals awake suggests that sleep (compared with wake) leads to widespread reductions in net synaptic strength. By contrast, sleep deprivation studies using approaches avoiding novelty-induced arousal (i.e., gentle handling) suggest that sleep can promote synaptic growth and strengthening. How can these discrepant findings be reconciled? Here, we discuss how varying methodologies for the experimental disruption of sleep (with differential introduction of novel experiences) could fundamentally alter the experimental outcome with regard to synaptic plasticity.</description>

	<description>Calorie-rich diets induce hyperphagia and promote obesity. Here, Jais et al. report that short-term high-fat-diet (HFD) feeding in mice activates prepronociceptin (PNOC)-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC). They characterize PNOCARC neurons as a novel ARC neuron population activated upon palatable food consumption to promote hyperphagia.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Dysregulated biodynamics in metabolic attractor systems precede the emergence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</title>

Evolutionarily conserved mechanisms maintain homeostasis of essential elements, and are believed to be highly time-variant. However, current approaches measure elemental biomarkers at a few discrete time-points, ignoring complex higher-order dynamical features. To study dynamical properties of elemental homeostasis, we apply laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to tooth samples to generate 500 temporally sequential measurements of elemental concentrations from birth to 10 years. We applied dynamical system and Information Theory-based analyses to reveal the longest-known attractor system in mammalian biology underlying the metabolism of nutrient elements, and identify distinct and consistent transitions between stable and unstable states throughout development. Extending these dynamical features to disease prediction, we find that attractor topography of nutrient metabolism is altered in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as early as childhood, suggesting these pathways are involved in disease risk. Mechanistic analysis was undertaken in a transgenic mouse model of ALS, where we find similar marked disruptions in elemental attractor systems as in humans. Our results demonstrate the application of a phenomological analysis of dynamical systems underlying elemental metabolism, and emphasize the utility of these measures in characterizing risk of disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c5YPoxjUguA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Nimodipine reduces dysfunction and demyelination in models of multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25749?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25749?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment of relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) has not advanced beyond steroid use, which reduces acute loss of function, but has little effect on residual disability. Acute loss of function in an MS model (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; EAE) is partly due to CNS hypoxia, and function can promptly improve upon breathing oxygen. Here we investigate the cause of the hypoxia and whether it is due to a deficit in oxygen supply arising from impaired vascular perfusion. We also explore whether the CNS‐selective vasodilating agent, nimodipine, may provide a therapy to restore function, and protect from demyelination in two MS models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of methods have been employed to measure basic cardiovascular physiology, spinal oxygenation, mitochondrial function and tissue perfusion in EAE.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report that the tissue hypoxia in EAE is associated with a profound hypoperfusion of the inflamed spinal cord. Treatment with nimodipine restores spinal oxygenation and can rapidly improve function. Nimodipine therapy also reduces demyelination in both EAE, and a model of the early MS lesion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss of function in EAE, and demyelination in EAE and the model early MS lesion, appear to be due, at least in part, to tissue hypoxia due to local spinal hypoperfusion. Therapy to improve blood flow not only protects neurological function, but also reduces demyelination. We conclude that nimodipine could be repurposed to offer substantial clinical benefit in MS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eNeuro: Development of Perineuronal Nets during Ontogeny Correlates with Sensorimotor Vocal Learning in Canaries</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0361-19.2020?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0361-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Songbirds are a powerful model to study vocal learning given that aspects of the underlying behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms are analogous in many ways to mechanisms involved in speech learning. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) represent one of the mechanisms controlling the closing of sensitive periods for vocal learning in the songbird brain. In zebra finches, PNN develop around parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons in selected song control nuclei during ontogeny and their development is delayed if juveniles are deprived of a tutor. However, song learning in zebra finches takes place during a relatively short period of development, and it is difficult to determine whether PNN development correlates with the end of the sensory or the sensorimotor learning period. Canaries have a longer period of sensorimotor vocal learning, spanning over their first year of life so that it should be easier to test whether PNN development correlates with the end of sensory or sensorimotor vocal learning. Here, we quantified PNN around PV-interneurons in the brain of male canaries from hatching until the first breeding season and analyzed in parallel the development of their song. PNN development around PV-interneurons specifically took place and their number reached its maximum around the end of the sensorimotor learning stage, well after the end of sensory vocal learning, and correlated with song development. This suggests that PNN are specifically involved in the termination of the sensitive period for sensorimotor vocal learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Antiepileptic Drug Teratogenicity and De Novo Genetic Variation Load</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25724?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25724?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms by which antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) cause birth defects (BDs) are unknown. Data suggest that AED‐induced BDs may result from a genome‐wide increase of de novo variants in the embryo, a mechanism that we investigated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole exome sequencing data from child–parent trios were interrogated for de novo single‐nucleotide variants/indels (dnSNVs/indels) and de novo copy number variants (dnCNVs). Generalized linear models were applied to assess de novo variant burdens in children exposed prenatally to AEDs (AED‐exposed children) versus children without BDs not exposed prenatally to AEDs (AED‐unexposed unaffected children), and AED‐exposed children with BDs versus those without BDs, adjusting for confounders. Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical data.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty‐seven child–parent trios were included: 10 with AED‐exposed children with BDs, 46 with AED‐exposed unaffected children, and 11 with AED‐unexposed unaffected children. The dnSNV/indel burden did not differ between AED‐exposed children and AED‐unexposed unaffected children (median dnSNV/indel number/child [range] = 3 [0–7] vs 3 [1–5], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.50). Among AED‐exposed children, there were no significant differences between those with BDs and those unaffected. Likely deleterious dnSNVs/indels were detected in 9 of 67 (13%) children, none of whom had BDs. The proportion of cases harboring likely deleterious dnSNVs/indels did not differ significantly between AED‐unexposed and AED‐exposed children. The dnCNV burden was not associated with AED exposure or birth outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study indicates that prenatal AED exposure does not increase the burden of de novo variants, and that this mechanism is not a major contributor to AED‐induced BDs. These results can be incorporated in routine patient counseling. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Techniques for Obtaining High-quality Recordings in Electrocochleography</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00018</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00018</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There are several technical challenges to obtaining high-quality recordings of cochlear potentials in human electrocochleography (ECochG). These challenges include electrical artifacts from devices such as acoustic transducers, biological artifacts from excessive myogenic and electroencephalographic potentials, and issues associated with the placement of a tympanic membrane (TM) electrode on the eardrum. This article presents approaches for dealing with these challenges for ECochG measurement using a TM electrode. Emphasis is placed on eliminating stimulus artifact, optimizing the placement of the electrode, and comparing a custom-made electrode with a commercially-available electrode. This comparison revealed that the custom-made electrode results in greater subject comfort, superior ease of placing the electrode on the eardrum, and larger compound action potential (CAP) amplitudes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Lysophospholipids and Their G-Coupled Protein Signaling in Alzheimer’s Disease: From Physiological Performance to Pathological Impairment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00058</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00058</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Lysophospholipids (LPLs) are bioactive signaling lipids that are generated from phospholipase-mediated hydrolyzation of membrane phospholipids (PLs) and sphingolipids (SLs). Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are two of the best-characterized LPLs which mediate a variety of cellular physiological responses via specific G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) mediated signaling pathways. Considerable evidence now demonstrates the crucial role of LPA and S1P in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Dysfunction of LPA and S1P metabolism can lead to aberrant accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuroinflammation and ultimately neuronal death. Summarizing LPA and S1P signaling profile may aid in profound health and pathological processes. In the current review, we will introduce the metabolism as well as the physiological roles of LPA and S1P in maintaining the normal functions of the nervous system. Given these pivotal functions, we will further discuss the role of dysregulation of LPA and S1P in promoting AD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Circulating Exosomal miRNA as Diagnostic Biomarkers of Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00053</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00053</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a group of diseases caused by chronic and progressive degeneration of neural tissue. The main pathological manifestations are neuronal degeneration and loss in the brain and/or spinal cord. Common NDDs include Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), Huntington disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The complicated pathological characteristics and different clinical manifestations of NDDs result in a lack of sensitive and efficient diagnostic methods. In addition, no sensitive biomarkers are available to monitor the course of NDDs, predict their prognosis, and monitor the therapeutic response. Despite extensive research in recent years, analysis of amyloid β (Aβ) and α-synuclein has failed to effectively improve NDD diagnosis. Although recent studies have indicated circulating miRNAs as promising diagnostic biomarkers of NDDs, the miRNA in the peripheral circulation is susceptible to interference by other components, making circulating miRNA results less consistent. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles with a diameter of approximately 30–100 nm that transport proteins, lipids, mRNA, and miRNA. Because recent studies have shown that exosomes have a double-membrane structure that can resist ribonuclease in the blood, giving exosomal miRNA high stability and making them resistant to degradation, they may become an ideal biomarker of circulating fluids. In this review, we discuss the applicability of circulating exosomal miRNAs as biomarkers, highlight the technical aspects of exosomal miRNA analysis, and review studies that have used circulating exosomal miRNAs as candidate diagnostic biomarkers of NDDs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Activated Protein C Attenuates Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis Progression by Enhancing Vascular Integrity and Suppressing Microglial Activation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00333</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00333</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Activated protein C (APC), a serine protease with antithrombotic effects, protects in animal models of ischemic stroke by suppressing inflammation and enhancing vascular integrity, angiogenesis, neurogenesis and neuroprotection. A small number of animal studies suggest it might also have therapeutic potential in multiple sclerosis (MS), though results have been mixed. Based on these conflicting data, the goals of this study were to clarify the therapeutic potential of APC in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS and to determine mechanistically how APC mediates this protective effect.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The protective potential of APC was examined in a chronic progressive model of EAE. Vascular breakdown, tight junction protein expression and vascular expression of fibronectin and α5β1 integrin as well as vascularity and glial activation were analyzed using immunofluorescence (IF) of spinal cord sections taken from mice with established EAE. The direct influence of APC on microglial activation was evaluated in vitro by a combination of morphology and MMP-9 expression.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;APC attenuated the progression of EAE, and this was strongly associated at the histopathological level with reduced levels of leukocyte infiltration and concomitant demyelination. Further analysis revealed that APC reduced vascular breakdown which was associated with maintained endothelial expression of the tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). In addition, APC suppressed microglial activation in this EAE model and in vitro studies revealed that APC strongly inhibited microglial activation at both the morphological level and by the expression of the pro-inflammatory protease MMP-9.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings build on the work of others in demonstrating strong therapeutic potential for APC in the treatment of inflammatory demyelinating disease and suggest that enhancement of vascular integrity and suppression of microglial activation may be important mediators of this protection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Retinal alterations have recently been associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Rhodopsin is a G-protein coupled receptor found in the rod cells of the retina. As a biomarker associated with retinal thinning and degeneration, it bears potential in the early detection and monitoring of several neurodegenerative diseases. In this review article, we summarize the findings of correlations between rhodopsin and several neurodegenerative disorders as well as the potential of a novel technique, cSLO, in the quantification of rhodopsin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Mapping the cytoarchitecture of the whole brain can reveal the organizational logic of neural systems. However, this remains a significant challenge, especially for gyrencephalic brains with a large volume. Here we propose an integrated pipeline for generating a cytoarchitectonic atlas with single-cell resolution of the whole brain. To analyze a large-volume brain, we used a modified en-bloc Nissl staining protocol to achieve uniform staining of large-scale brain specimens from ferret (Mustela putorius furo). By combining whole-brain imaging and big data processing, we established strategies for parsing cytoarchitectural information at a voxel resolution of 0.33 μm × 0.33 μm × 1 μm and terabyte-scale data analysis. Using the cytoarchitectonic datasets for adult ferret brain, we identified giant pyramidal neurons in ferret brains and provide the first report of their morphological diversity, neurochemical phenotype, and distribution patterns in the whole brain in three dimensions. This pipeline will facilitate studies on the organization and development of the mammalian brains, from that of rodents to the gyrencephalic brains of ferret and even primates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Constrained ICA-EMD Model for Group Level fMRI Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Independent component analysis (ICA), being a data-driven method, has been shown to be a powerful tool for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis. One drawback of this multivariate approach is that it is not, in general, compatible with the analysis of group data. Various techniques have been proposed to overcome this limitation of ICA. In this paper, a novel ICA-based workflow for extracting resting-state networks from fMRI group studies is proposed. An empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is used, in a data-driven manner, to generate reference signals that can be incorporated into a constrained version of ICA (cICA), thereby eliminating the inherent ambiguities of ICA. The results of the proposed workflow are then compared to those obtained by a widely used group ICA approach for fMRI analysis. In this study, we demonstrate that intrinsic modes, extracted by EMD, are suitable to serve as references for cICA. This approach yields typical resting-state patterns that are consistent over subjects. By introducing these reference signals into the ICA, our processing pipeline yields comparable activity patterns across subjects in a mathematically transparent manner. Our approach provides a user-friendly tool to adjust the trade-off between a high similarity across subjects and preserving individual subject features of the independent components.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cue Valence Influences the Effects of Cue Uncertainty on ERP Responses to Emotional Events</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00140</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Individuals often predict consequences, particularly emotional consequences, according to emotional or non-emotional signals conveyed by environmental cues (i.e., emotional and non-emotional cues, respectively). Some of these cues signify the consequences with certainty (i.e., certain cues), whereas others do not (i.e., uncertain cues). Several event-related potential (ERP) studies regarding non-emotional cues have suggested that the effects of cue uncertainty on attention to emotional events occur in both perception and evaluation processes. However, due to the limitations of previous studies, it is unclear what the effects of cue uncertainty would be in an emotional cue condition. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the effects of cue uncertainty are affected by cue valence (i.e., emotional and non-emotional cues). To address these questions, we asked participants to view cues and then to view emotional (positive or negative) pictures. The cues either did or did not indicate the emotional content of the picture. In the emotional cue condition, happy and fearful faces were used as certain cues indicating upcoming positive and negative pictures, respectively, and neutral faces were used as uncertain cues. In the non-emotional cue condition, scrambled faces outlined in red and blue indicated upcoming positive and negative pictures, respectively, and scrambled faces outlined in green served as uncertain cues. The results showed that for negative pictures, ERP responses in a time range between 60 and 1,000 ms were shifted to a more negative direction in a certain condition than in the uncertain condition when the cues were emotional. However, the effect was the reverse for positive pictures. This effect of cue uncertainty was similar in the non-emotional cue—negative condition. In contrast, there was no effect of cue uncertainty in the non-emotional cue—positive condition. Therefore, the findings indicate that cue uncertainty modulates attention toward emotional events when the events are signified by emotional cues. The findings may also suggest that cue valence modulates the effects of cue uncertainty on attention to emotional events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Processing Mechanism of Mental Calculation Based on Cerebral Oscillatory Changes: A Comparison Between Abacus Experts and Novices</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00137</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00137</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Abacus experts could mentally calculate fast some mathematical operations using multi-digit numbers. The temporal dynamics of abacus mental calculation are still unknown although some behavioral and neuroimaging studies have suggested a visuospatial and visuomotor neural process during abacus mental calculation. Therefore, this contribution aims to clarify the significant similarities and the differences between experts and novices by investigating calculation-induced neuromagnetic responses based on cerebral oscillatory changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twelve to 13 healthy abacus experts and 17 non-experts participated in two experimental paradigms using non-invasive neuromagnetic measurements. In experiments 1 and 2, the spatial distribution of oscillatory changes presented mental calculations and temporal frequency profiles during addition while examining multiplication tasks. The MEG data were analyzed using synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) with an adaptive beamformer to calculate the group average of the spatial distribution of oscillatory changes and their temporal frequency profiles in source-level analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Using a group average of the spatial distribution of oscillatory changes, we observed some common brain activities in both right-handed abacus experts and non-experts. In non-experts, we detected the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral Intraparietal sulcus (IPS); whereas in experts, detected the bilateral parieto-occipital sulcus (POS), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and left sensorimotor areas mainly. Based on the findings generated, we could propose calculation processing models for both abacus experts and non- experts conveniently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The proposed model of calculation processing in abacus experts and novices revealed that the novices could calculate logically depending on numerical processing in the left IPS. In contrast, abacus experts are utilizing spatial processing using a memorized imaginary abacus, which distributed over the bilateral hemispheres in the IFG and sensorimotor areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Processing False Beliefs in Preschool Children and Adults: Developing a Set of Custom Tasks to Test the Theory of Mind in Neuroimaging and Behavioral Research</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The theory of mind (ToM) is the ability to attribute mental states to others and is extremely important for social functioning. It has been widely examined in both behavioral and neuroimaging research, usually with the use of the many versions of the false-belief (FB) task. However, there is still not enough evidence from studies on the neurodevelopmental mechanisms of ToM mostly because of methodological limitations: lack of selectivity, mismatch of experimental and control tasks, and focusing on participants older than 6 years old. In the current study, we attempted to develop a computerized tool for ToM assessment suitable for both behavioral and neuriomaging testing in preschoolers. We designed a version of the classic change-of-location task with custom visuals and three fine-tuned conditions: FB, true-belief, and no-belief (NB). The usability of the task for further application in neurodevelopmental research was tested with three methods: first, behaviorally, with the use of a touch screen on a group of 75 children, followed by a functional MRI (fMRI) study on 13 adults, and a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) study on 19 preschool children. In line with our expectations, on the behavioral level, our task elicited the all-or-none performance in preschoolers. There was also a progression of performance with age in the FB condition. On the neural level, we observed the activation of structures involved in the ToM brain network in response to our task in both adults and children. The results therefore suggest that our task can be a useful tool for studying ToM development and its neural underpinnings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain-Based Binary Communication Using Spatiotemporal Features of fNIRS Responses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00113</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;“Locked-in” patients lose their ability to communicate naturally due to motor system dysfunction. Brain-computer interfacing offers a solution for their inability to communicate by enabling motor-independent communication. Straightforward and convenient in-session communication is essential in clinical environments. The present study introduces a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based binary communication paradigm that requires limited preparation time and merely nine optodes. Eighteen healthy participants performed two mental imagery tasks, mental drawing and spatial navigation, to answer yes/no questions during one of two auditorily cued time windows. Each of the six questions was answered five times, resulting in five trials per answer. This communication paradigm thus combines both spatial (two different mental imagery tasks, here mental drawing for “yes” and spatial navigation for “no”) and temporal (distinct time windows for encoding a “yes” and “no” answer) fNIRS signal features for information encoding. Participants’ answers were decoded in simulated real-time using general linear model analysis. Joint analysis of all five encoding trials resulted in an average accuracy of 66.67 and 58.33% using the oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin signal respectively. For half of the participants, an accuracy of 83.33% or higher was reached using either the HbO signal or the HbR signal. For four participants, effective communication with 100% accuracy was achieved using either the HbO or HbR signal. An explorative analysis investigated the differentiability of the two mental tasks based solely on spatial fNIRS signal features. Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) group single-trial accuracies of 58.33% (using 20 training trials per task) and 60.56% (using 40 training trials per task) could be obtained. Combining the five trials per run using a majority voting approach heightened these MVPA accuracies to 62.04 and 75%. Additionally, an fNIRS suitability questionnaire capturing participants’ physical features was administered to explore its predictive value for evaluating general data quality. Obtained questionnaire scores correlated significantly (r = -0.499) with the signal-to-noise of the raw light intensities. While more work is needed to further increase decoding accuracy, this study shows the potential of answer encoding using spatiotemporal fNIRS signal features or spatial fNIRS signal features only.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Pregabalin as a Pain Therapeutic: Beyond Calcium Channels</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00083</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00083</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Initially developed to generate new treatments for epilepsy, gabapentin, and pregabalin (“gabapentinoids”) were engineered to mimic the action of GABA and to modulate GABA metabolism. Rather than their intended pharmacological action on GABA neurotransmission, instead, they exhibit a high affinity for the α2δ-1 and α2δ-2 subunits of voltage-activated calcium channels, wherein binding of gabapentinoids inhibits cellular calcium influx and attenuates neurotransmission. Despite a lack of activity on GABA levels, gabapentin and pregabalin are effective at suppressing seizures and subsequently approved as a new class of antiepileptic therapy for partial-onset epilepsy. Through the same hypothesized molecular mechanism and by controlling neuronal hyperexcitability, gabapentinoids demonstrate clear efficacy in pain management, which has arguably been their most extensively prescribed application to date. In this review, we focus on pregabalin as a second-generation gabapentinoid widely employed in the treatment of a variety of pain conditions. We also discuss the wider functional roles of α2δ subunits and the contributions that pregabalin might play in affecting physiological and pathophysiological processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Role of BDNF on Neural Plasticity in Depression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00082</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00082</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Using behavioral, pharmacological, and molecular methods, lots of studies reveal that depression is closely related to the abnormal neural plasticity processes occurring in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system such as the hippocampus and amygdala. Meanwhile, functions of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the other neurotrophins in the pathogenesis of depression are well known. The maladaptive neuroplastic in depression may be related to alterations in the levels of neurotrophic factors, which play a central role in plasticity. Enhancement of neurotrophic factors signaling has great potential in therapy for depression. This review highlights the relevance of neurotrophic factors mediated neural plasticity and pathophysiology of depression. These studies reviewed here may suggest new possible targets for antidepressant drugs such as neurotrophins, their receptors, and relevant signaling pathways, and agents facilitating the activation of gene expression and increasing the transcription of neurotrophic factors in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: How Human Is Human Connectional Neuroanatomy?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The structure of the human brain has been studied extensively. Despite all the knowledge accrued, direct information about connections, from origin to termination, in the human brain is extremely limited. Yet there is a widespread misperception that human connectional neuroanatomy is well-established and validated. In this article, we consider what is known directly about human structural and connectional neuroanatomy. Information on neuroanatomical connections in the human brain is derived largely from studies in non-human experimental models in which the entire connectional pathway, including origins, course, and terminations, is directly visualized. Techniques to examine structural connectivity in the human brain are progressing rapidly; nevertheless, our present understanding of such connectivity is limited largely to data derived from homological comparisons, particularly with non-human primates. We take the position that an in-depth and more precise understanding of human connectional neuroanatomy will be obtained by a systematic application of this homological approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this review article, we will describe the recent advances made towards understanding the molecular and cell biological mechanisms of electrical synapse formation. New evidence indicates that electrical synapses, which are gap junctions between neurons, can have complex molecular compositions including protein asymmetries across joined cells, diverse morphological arrangements, and overlooked similarities with other junctions, all of which indicate new potential roles in neurodevelopmental disease. Aquatic organisms, and in particular the vertebrate zebrafish, have proven to be excellent models for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of electrical synapse formation. Zebrafish will serve as our main exemplar throughout this review and will be compared with other model organisms. We highlight the known cell biological processes that build neuronal gap junctions and compare these with the assemblies of adherens junctions, tight junctions, non-neuronal gap junctions, and chemical synapses to explore the unknown frontiers remaining in our understanding of the critical and ubiquitous electrical synapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Serum Magnesium and Cognitive Function Among Qatari Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00101</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00101</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Previous studies found that low blood magnesium increases the risk of several diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes, and hypertension. These ailments are associated with declined cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: We aimed to examine the association between serum magnesium and cognitive function among Qatari adults. In addition, we assessed the interaction relation between low serum magnesium, hypertension, and diabetes in relation to cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Data from 1,000 Qatari participants aged ≥20 years old who participated in the Qatar Biobank (QBB) Study were analyzed. Serum magnesium was measured by an automated calorimetric method and suboptimal magnesium was characterized by &amp;lt;0.85 mmol/l. Cognitive function was determined by measuring the mean reaction time (MRT) based on a computer-based, self-administered test. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the relation between serum magnesium concentrations and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The prevalence of suboptimal magnesium was 57.1%. Across the four quartiles of serum magnesium from the lowest to the highest, the regression coefficients (95% CI) for MRT were 0 (reference), −17.8, −18.3, and −31.9 (95% CI 2.4–3.1; p for trend 0.05). The presence of hypertension and diabetes significantly increased the MRT. Women with suboptimal magnesium and hypertension had the highest MRT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The prevalence of suboptimal magnesium is high in Qatar. There was a direct association between serum magnesium and cognitive function. Low magnesium concentrations were associated with a longer MRT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: A New Rat Model of Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion Resulting in Early-Stage Vascular Cognitive Impairment</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Currently, most models of vascular cognitive impairment are established by occluding the carotid arteries uni- or bilaterally to reduce the cerebral blood flow mimicking chronic cerebral hypoxia. Due to the sudden blood flow interruption, a gradual narrowing of the carotid artery cannot be completely imitated. This paper aims to establish a bilateral carotid stenosis model with mild cognitive dysfunction and mild white matter changes to simulate patients with vascular predementia.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Aged Wistar rats (18 months old) underwent either bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) or occlusion (BCAO) surgery or a sham operation (control group). The cerebral blood flow in the frontal cortex was measured using Doppler flowmetry. Thirty days after surgery, cognitive function impairments were determined with the Morris water maze; cerebral magnetic resonance imaging was performed to detect changes in fractional anisotropy to assess white matter injuries, and histological studies were performed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The aged rats in the BCAS group showed a more gradual cerebral blood flow reduction and a lower mortality rate (11%) compared to rats in the BCAO group. The water maze test revealed a more marginal impairment affecting spatial learning and memory in rats with BCAS than in rats with BCAO. Diffusion tensor imaging detected white matter injuries in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of BCAS rats. Particularly, a small portion of nerve fibers of the lateral somatosensory cortex was significantly different between rats of the BCAO and BCAS groups. In the BCAS group, the microscopic structure of the hippocampal CA1 region changed slightly after 30 days and sustained a slight mitochondrial crista crack. Fluorescence staining indicated that the number of GFAP-positive cells was increased in rat brains of the BCAS group, and this phenomenon was even more pronounced in the BCAO group. The hnRNPA2/B1 and GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R-α1 expression levels were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of rats with BCAS compared to those of controls.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Severe bilateral carotid stenosis induced mild cognitive dysfunction and slight structural changes in the brains of aged rats. Thus, a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion model was successfully established.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hypertension is recognized as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease, but the causal link remains undetermined. Although astrocytes and microglia play an important role in maintaining the neurovascular unit, astrocytes and microglia have been understudied in comorbid models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease. In this study, male transgenic Fischer 344 rats (TgAPP21) overexpressing a pathogenic human amyloid precursor protein received 8 weeks of Angiotensin II infusion to increase blood pressure, and the rats were evaluated for astrocytosis, microgliosis, and cognitive function. A linear relationship between astrocytosis and blood pressure was observed in the corpus callosum and cingulum of wildtype rats, with hypertensive wildtype rats matching the elevated baseline astrocytosis seen in normotensive transgenic rats. In contrast, hypertensive transgenic rats did not demonstrate a further increase of astrocytosis, suggesting a deficient response. Angiotensin II infusion did not affect activation of microglia, which were elevated in the white matter and hippocampus of transgenic rats. Angiotensin II infusion did impair both wildtype and transgenic rats’ executive functions in the Morris Water Maze. These results present important implications for the interaction between hypertension and pathogenic human amyloid precursor protein expression, as Angiotensin II infusion produced cognitive impairments in both genotypes, but transgenic rats were additionally impaired in developing a normal astrocytic response to elevated blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>A number of prenatal experiences are associated with adverse outcomes after birth, ranging from cardiovascular problems to psychiatric disease. Prenatal stress is associated with neurodevelopmental alterations that persist after birth and manifest at the behavioral level, for example, increased fearfulness, and at the physiological one, that is, brain structural and functional changes. Understanding the mechanisms that drive these lasting effects may help in preventing long-term negative outcomes of prenatal stress.</description>

	<description>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a largely heritable, multistage prenatal disorder that impacts a child’s ability to perceive and react to social information. Most ASD risk genes are expressed prenatally in many ASD-relevant brain regions and fall into two categories: broadly expressed regulatory genes that are expressed in the brain and other organs, and brain-specific genes. In trimesters one to three (Epoch-1), one set of broadly expressed (the majority) and brain-specific risk genes disrupts cell proliferation, neurogenesis, migration, and cell fate, while in trimester three and early postnatally (Epoch-2) another set (the majority being brain specific) disrupts neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and the ‘wiring’ of the cortex.</description>

Historically, the majority of statistical association methods have been designed assuming availability of SNP-level information. However, modern genetic and sequencing data present new challenges to access and sharing of genotype-phenotype datasets, including cost of management, difficulties in consolidation of records across research groups, etc. These issues make methods based on SNP-level summary statistics particularly appealing. The most common form of combining statistics is a sum of SNP-level squared scores, possibly weighted, as in burden tests for rare variants. The overall significance of the resulting statistic is evaluated using its distribution under the null hypothesis. Here, we demonstrate that this basic approach can be substantially improved by decorrelating scores prior to their addition, resulting in remarkable power gains in situations that are most commonly encountered in practice; namely, under heterogeneity of effect sizes and diversity between pairwise LD. In these situations, the power of the traditional test, based on the added squared scores, quickly reaches a ceiling, as the number of variants increases. Thus, the traditional approach does not benefit from information potentially contained in any additional SNPs, while our decorrelation by orthogonal transformation (DOT) method yields steady gain in power. We present theoretical and computational analyses of both approaches, and reveal causes behind sometimes dramatic difference in their respective powers. We showcase DOT by analyzing breast cancer and cleft lip data, in which our method strengthened levels of previously reported associations and implied the possibility of multiple new alleles that jointly confer disease risk.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tWoupzt8V7I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: ScalaFlux: A scalable approach to quantify fluxes in metabolic subnetworks</title>

&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-metabolic flux analysis (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-MFA) allows metabolic fluxes to be quantified in living organisms and is a major tool in biotechnology and systems biology. Current &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-MFA approaches model label propagation starting from the extracellular &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeled nutrient(s), which limits their applicability to the analysis of pathways close to this metabolic entry point. Here, we propose a new approach to quantify fluxes through any metabolic subnetwork of interest by modeling label propagation directly from the metabolic precursor(s) of this subnetwork. The flux calculations are thus purely based on information from within the subnetwork of interest, and no additional knowledge about the surrounding network (such as atom transitions in upstream reactions or the labeling of the extracellular nutrient) is required. This approach, termed ScalaFlux for SCALAble metabolic FLUX analysis, can be scaled up from individual reactions to pathways to sets of pathways. ScalaFlux has several benefits compared with current &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-MFA approaches: greater network coverage, lower data requirements, independence from cell physiology, robustness to gaps in data and network information, better computational efficiency, applicability to rich media, and enhanced flux identifiability. We validated ScalaFlux using a theoretical network and simulated data. We also used the approach to quantify fluxes through the prenyl pyrophosphate pathway of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; mutants engineered to produce phytoene, using a dataset for which fluxes could not be calculated using existing approaches. A broad range of metabolic systems can be targeted with minimal cost and effort, making ScalaFlux a valuable tool for the analysis of metabolic fluxes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i5lyyQXk8Fc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A molecular odorant transduction model and the complexity of spatio-temporal encoding in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; antenna</title>

Over the past two decades, substantial amount of work has been conducted to characterize different odorant receptors, neuroanatomy and odorant response properties of the early olfactory system of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. Yet many odorant receptors remain only partially characterized, and the odorant transduction process and the axon hillock spiking mechanism of the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) have yet to be fully determined. Identity and concentration, two key characteristics of the space of odorants, are encoded by the odorant transduction process. Detailed molecular models of the odorant transduction process are, however, scarce for fruit flies. To address these challenges we advance a comprehensive model of fruit fly OSNs as a cascade consisting of an odorant transduction process (OTP) and a biophysical spike generator (BSG). We model odorant identity and concentration using an odorant-receptor binding rate tensor, modulated by the odorant concentration profile, and an odorant-receptor dissociation rate tensor, and quantitatively describe the mechanics of the molecular ligand binding/dissociation of the OTP. We model the BSG as a Connor-Stevens point neuron. The resulting spatio-temporal encoding model of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; antenna provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the neural code of both odorant identity and odorant concentration and advances the state-of-the-art in a number of ways. First, it quantifies on the molecular level the spatio-temporal level of complexity of the transformation taking place in the antennae. The concentration-dependent spatio-temporal code at the output of the antenna circuits determines the level of complexity of olfactory processing in the downstream neuropils, such as odorant recognition and olfactory associative learning. Second, the model is biologically validated using multiple electrophysiological recordings. Third, the model demonstrates that the currently available data for odorant-receptor responses only enable the estimation of the affinity of the odorant-receptor pairs. The odorant-dissociation rate is only available for a few odorant-receptor pairs. Finally, our model calls for new experiments for massively identifying the odorant-receptor dissociation rates of relevance to flies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FlzLSYrp04s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Small lesions of the dorsal or ventral hippocampus subregions are associated with distinct impairments in working memory and reference memory retrieval, and combining them attenuates the acquisition rate of spatial reference memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23207?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of the hippocampus in spatial learning is well established, but the precise relative contributions by the dorsal (septal) and ventral (temporal) subregions remain unresolved. One debate revolves around the extent to which the ventral hippocampus contributes to spatial navigation and learning. Here, separate small subtotal lesions of dorsal hippocampus or ventral hippocampus alone (destroying 18.9 and 28.5% of total hippocampal volume, respectively) spared reference memory acquisition in the water maze. By contrast, combining the two subtotal lesions significantly reduced the rate of acquisition across days. This constitutes evidence for synergistic integration between dorsal and ventral hippocampus in mice. Evidence that ventral hippocampus contributes to spatial/navigation learning also emerged early on during the retention probe test as search preference was reduced in mice with ventral lesions alone or combined lesions. The small ventral lesions also led to anxiolysis in the elevated plus maze and over‐generalization of the conditioned freezing response to a neutral context. Similar effects of comparable magnitudes were seen in mice with combined lesions, suggesting that they were largely due to the small ventral damage. By contrast, small dorsal lesions were uniquely associated with a severe spatial working memory deficit in the water maze. Taken together, both dorsal and ventral poles of the hippocampus contribute to efficient spatial navigation in mice: While the integrity of dorsal hippocampus is necessary for spatial working memory, the acquisition and retrieval of spatial reference memory are modulated by the ventral hippocampus. Although the impairments following ventral damage (alone or in combination with dorsal damage) were less substantial, a wider spectrum of spatial learning, including context conditioning, was implicated. Our results encourage the search for integrative mechanism between dorsal and ventral hippocampus in spatial learning. Candidate neural substrates may include dorsoventral longitudinal connections and reciprocal modulation via overlapping polysynaptic networks beyond hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Longitudinal assessment of multiple sclerosis with the brain‐age paradigm</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the natural course of MS, the brain is exposed to ageing as well as disease effects. Brain ageing can be modelled statistically; the so‐called ‘brain‐age’ paradigm. Here, we evaluated whether brain‐predicted age difference (brain‐PAD) was sensitive to the presence of MS, clinical progression and future outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a longitudinal, multi‐centre sample of 3,565 MRI scans, in 1,204 MS and clinically‐isolated syndrome (CIS) patients and 150 healthy controls (mean follow‐up time: patients 3.41 years, healthy controls 1.97 years), we measured ‘brain‐predicted age’ using T1‐weighted MRI. We compared brain‐PAD between MS and CIS patients and healthy controls, and between disease subtypes. Relationships between brain‐PAD and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) were explored.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MS patients had markedly higher brain‐PAD than healthy controls (mean brain‐PAD +10.3 years [95% CI 8.5, 12.1] versus 4.3 years [−2.1, 6.4], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The highest brain‐PADs were in secondary‐progressive MS (+19.4 years [17.1, 21.9]). Brain‐PAD at study entry predicted time‐to‐disability progression (hazard ratio 1.02 [1.01, 1.03], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001); though normalised brain volume was a stronger predictor. Greater annualised brain‐PAD increases were associated with greater annualised EDSS score (r = 0.26, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain‐age paradigm is sensitive to MS‐related atrophy and clinical progression. A higher brain‐PAD at baseline was associated with more rapid disability progression and the rate of change in brain‐PAD related to worsening disability. Potentially, ‘brain‐age’ could be used as a prognostic biomarker in early‐stage MS, to track disease progression or stratify patients for clinical trial enrolment.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Hippocampus: Cardiorespiratory fitness predicts effective connectivity between the hippocampus and default mode network nodes in young adults</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodent and human studies examining the relationship between aerobic exercise, brain structure, and brain function indicate that the hippocampus (HC), a brain region critical for episodic memory, demonstrates striking plasticity in response to exercise. Beyond the hippocampal memory system, human studies also indicate that aerobic exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are associated with individual differences in large‐scale brain networks responsible for broad cognitive domains. Examining network activity in large‐scale resting‐state brain networks may provide a link connecting the observed relationships between aerobic exercise, hippocampal plasticity, and cognitive enhancement within broad cognitive domains. Previously, CRF has been associated with increased functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN), specifically in older adults. However, how CRF relates to the magnitude and directionality of connectivity, or effective connectivity, between the HC and other DMN nodes remains unknown. We used resting‐state fMRI and conditional Granger causality analysis (CGCA) to test the hypothesis that CRF positively predicts effective connectivity between the HC and other DMN nodes in healthy young adults. Twenty‐six participants (ages 18–35 years) underwent a treadmill test to determine CRF by estimating its primary determinant, maximal oxygen uptake (V&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2max&lt;/sub&gt;), and a 10‐min resting‐state fMRI scan to examine DMN effective connectivity. We identified the DMN using group independent component analysis and examined effective connectivity between nodes using CGCA. Linear regression analyses demonstrated that CRF significantly predicts causal influence from the HC to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and lateral temporal cortex and to the HC from the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. The observed relationship between CRF and hippocampal effective connectivity provides a link between the rodent literature, which demonstrates a relationship between aerobic exercise and hippocampal plasticity, and the human literature, which demonstrates a relationship between aerobic exercise and CRF and the enhancement of broad cognitive domains including, but not limited to, memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Hippocampal gamma rhythms during Y‐maze navigation in the juvenile rat</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neurobiology of postnatal hippocampal development in rodents is receiving increased attention as a means to address neurodevelopmental questions and to better understand the neural code(s) for spatial navigation in adulthood. We previously showed that spontaneous alternation (SA) in a Y‐maze, which emerges at the end of the third postnatal week, was related to changes in fast glutamatergic synaptic transmission. In adults, oscillations in the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) (i.e., theta, 4–12 Hz; slow gamma, 25–55 Hz; and fast gamma, 65–100 Hz) have been shown to coordinate the activity of spatially tuned cell types in the hippocampus during route planning and execution. Other investigators have shown that theta activity matures during the first month of life. However, relationships between developmental alterations in gamma oscillations and cognitive function have not been investigated in juveniles, and the impact of developmental changes in excitatory synaptic transmission on network activity remains unclear. We implanted rats at postnatal day 14 to record LFPs from the synaptic layer of area CA1 during Y‐maze exploration at postnatal Days 18, 19, 23, and 24. The positive allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors, CX614, or vehicle was administered prior to each test. We found that slow gamma peak frequency, but not peak power, remained constant across this age range. Fast gamma event rate increased with increasing age, while peak frequency decreased. AMPA receptor modulation impacted slow and fast gamma differently at different ages. Furthermore, gamma events showed relationships with novelty and movement speed that differed based on gamma sub‐band (slow vs. fast). These results support the presence of environmentally‐driven gamma oscillations in hippocampal network activity prior to the end of the third postnatal week of development. Differential refinement of slow and fast gamma occurring across the subsequent week supports involvement in the emergence of spatial navigation ability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Improving fitness increases dentate gyrus/CA3 volume in the hippocampal head and enhances memory in young adults</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converging evidence suggests a relationship between aerobic exercise and hippocampal neuroplasticity that interactively impacts hippocampally dependent memory. The majority of human studies have focused on the potential for exercise to reduce brain atrophy and attenuate cognitive decline in older adults, whereas animal studies often center on exercise‐induced neurogenesis and hippocampal plasticity in the dentate gyrus (DG) of young adult animals. In the present study, initially sedentary young adults (18–35 years) participated in a moderate‐intensity randomized controlled exercise intervention trial (&lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt;; NCT02057354) for a duration of 12 weeks. The aims of the study were to investigate the relationship between change in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as determined by estimated 
&lt;sub&gt;MAX&lt;/sub&gt;, hippocampally dependent mnemonic discrimination, and change in hippocampal subfield volume. Results show that improving CRF after exercise training is associated with an increased volume in the left DG/CA3 subregion in young adults. Consistent with previous studies that found exercise‐induced increases in anterior hippocampus in older adults, this result was specific to the hippocampal head, or most anterior portion, of the subregion. Our results also demonstrate a positive relationship between change in CRF and change in corrected accuracy for trials requiring the highest level of discrimination on a putative behavioral pattern separation task. This relationship was observed in individuals who were initially lower‐fit, suggesting that individuals who show greater improvement in their CRF may receive greater cognitive benefit. This work extends animal models by providing evidence for exercise‐induced neuroplasticity specific to the neurogenic zone of the human hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene and protein expressions are key determinants of cellular function. Neurons are the building blocks of brain circuits, yet the relationship between their molecular identity and the spatial distribution of their dendritic inputs and axonal outputs remains incompletely understood. The open‐source knowledge base &lt;a href=&quot;http://hippocampome.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;Hippocampome.org&lt;/a&gt; amasses such transcriptomic data from the scientific literature for morphologically defined neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation: dentate gyrus, CA3, CA2, CA1, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. Positive, negative, or mixed expression reports were initially obtained from published articles directly connecting molecular evidence to neurons with known axonal and dendritic patterns across hippocampal layers. Here, we supplement this information by collating, formalizing, and leveraging relational expression inferences that link a gene or protein expression or lack thereof to that of another molecule or to an anatomical location. With these additional interpretations, we freely release online a comprehensive human‐ and machine‐readable molecular profile for more than 100 neuron types in &lt;a href=&quot;http://hippocampome.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;Hippocampome.org&lt;/a&gt;. Analysis of these data ascertains the ability to distinguish unequivocally most neuron types in each of the major subdivisions of the hippocampus based on currently known biochemical markers. Moreover, grouping neuron types by expression similarity reveals eight superfamilies characterized by a few defining molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Meta‐analytic and functional connectivity evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging for an anterior to posterior gradient of function along the hippocampal axis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23164?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is considerable evidence from non‐human animal studies that the anterior and posterior regions of the hippocampus have different anatomical connections and support different behavioural functions. Although there are some recent human studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that have addressed this idea directly in the memory and spatial processing domains and provided support for it, there has been no broader meta‐analysis of the fMRI literature to determine if there is consistent evidence for functional dissociations in anterior and posterior hippocampus across all of the different cognitive domains in which the hippocampus participates. The purpose of this review is to address this gap in our knowledge using three approaches. One approach involved PubMed searches to identify relevant fMRI papers reporting hippocampal activation during episodic encoding and retrieval, semantic retrieval, working memory, spatial navigation, simulation/scene construction, transitive inference, and social cognition tasks. The second was to use a large meta‐analytic database (neurosynth) to find text terms and coactivation maps associated with the anterior and posterior hippocampal regions identified in the literature search. The third approach was to contrast the resting‐state functional connectivity of the anterior and posterior hippocampal regions using a publicly available database that includes a large sample of adults. These three approaches provided converging evidence that not only are cognitive processes differently distributed along the hippocampal axis, but there also are distinct areas coactivated and functionally connected with the anterior and posterior segments. This anterior/posterior distinction involving multiple cognitive domains is consistent with the animal literature and provides strong support from fMRI for the idea of functional dissociations across the long axis of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Functional responses of the hippocampus to hyperexcitability depend on directed, neuron‐specific KCNQ2 K+ channel plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23163?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M‐type (KCNQ2/3) K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels play dominant roles in regulation of active and passive neuronal discharge properties such as resting membrane potential, spike‐frequency adaptation, and hyper‐excitatory states. However, plasticity of M‐channel expression and function in nongenetic forms of epileptogenesis are still not well understood. Using transgenic mice with an EGFP reporter to detect expression maps of KCNQ2 mRNA, we assayed hyperexcitability‐induced alterations in KCNQ2 transcription across subregions of the hippocampus. Pilocarpine and pentylenetetrazol chemoconvulsant models of seizure induction were used, and brain tissue examined 48 hr later. We observed increases in KCNQ2 mRNA in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons after chemoconvulsant‐induced hyperexcitability at 48 hr, but no significant change was observed in dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells. Using chromogenic in situ hybridization assays, changes to KCNQ3 transcription were not detected after hyper‐excitation challenge, but the results for KCNQ2 paralleled those using the KCNQ2‐mRNA reporter mice. In mice 7 days after pilocarpine challenge, levels of KCNQ2 mRNA were similar in all regions to those from control mice. In brain‐slice electrophysiology recordings, CA1 pyramidal neurons demonstrated increased M‐current amplitudes 48 hr after hyperexcitability; however, there were no significant changes to DG granule cell M‐current amplitude. Traumatic brain injury induced significantly greater KCNQ2 expression in the hippocampal hemisphere that was ipsilateral to the trauma. In vivo, after a secondary challenge with subconvulsant dose of pentylenetetrazole, control mice were susceptible to tonic–clonic seizures, whereas mice administered the M‐channel opener retigabine were protected from such seizures. This study demonstrates that increased excitatory activity promotes KCNQ2 upregulation in the hippocampus in a cell‐type specific manner. Such novel ion channel expressional plasticity may serve as a compensatory mechanism after a hyperexcitable event, at least in the short term. The upregulation described could be potentially leveraged in anticonvulsant enhancement of KCNQ2 channels as therapeutic target for preventing onset of epileptogenic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;A key goal in hippocampal research is to understand how neuronal activity is generated and organized across hippocampal subregions to enable memory formation and retrieval. Neuronal activity in CA2 is regulated by spatial and social investigation as well as by novelty (Mankin et al., 2015; Alexander et al., 2016), and CA2 activity controls population oscillatory activity in the slow  and ripple ranges within hippocampus (Kay et al., 2016; Oliva et al., 2016; Boehringer et al., 2017; Alexander et al., 2018). CA2 neurons are also required for social recognition memory (Stevenson and Caldwell, 2012; Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014; Smith et al., 2016). Because CA1 exhibits layer-specific organization (Scheffer-Teixeira et al., 2012; Lasztóczi and Klausberger, 2014, 2016) reflective of its inputs (Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2012; Schomburg et al., 2014), and because CA2 activity controls CA1 slow  (Alexander et al., 2018), we hypothesized that silencing CA2 would affect CA1 slow  in a layer-specific manner during investigation of a novel social stimulus. While recording from CA1, we leveraged molecular tools to selectively target and inhibit CA2 pyramidal cells using inhibitory DREADDs while subject mice investigated novel animals or objects. We found that CA2 inhibition reduced slow  power during investigation of a novel animal and fast  power during both novel object and animal investigation in a manner reflective of the CA2 axonal projection zones within CA1. Our results suggest that CA2 contributes to CA1 slow and fast  oscillations in a stimulus-specific manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Profilin 1 knockdown prevents ischemic brain damage by promoting M2 microglial polarization associated with the RhoA/ROCK pathway</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Profilin 1 knockdown prevents ischemic brain damage by promoting M2 microglial polarization associated with the RhoA/ROCK pathway&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b2ab45aa-2226-4039-8934-88a7a89bfa09/jnr24607-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential molecular mechanism by which pfn1 regulates microglia polarization and hypoxia/ischemia injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microglial polarization to the anti‐inflammatory M2 phenotype is essential in resolving neuroinflammation, making it a promising therapeutic strategy for stroke intervention. The actin cytoskeleton is known to be important for the physiological functions of microglia, including migration and phagocytosis. Profilin 1 (PFN1), an actin‐binding protein, is involved in the dynamic transformation and reorganization of actin. However, the role of PFN1 in microglial polarization and ischemia/reperfusion injury is unclear. The role of PFN1 on microglial polarization was examined &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; in BV2 microglial cells subjected to oxygen‐glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGDR) and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in male mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Knockdown of PFN1 inhibited M1 microglial polarization and promoted M2 microglia polarization 48 hr after OGDR stimulation in BV2 cells and 7 days after MCAO‐induced injury in male mice. RhoA/ROCK pathway was involved in the regulation of PFN1 during microglial polarization. Knockdown of PFN1 also significantly attenuated brain infarcts and edema, improved cerebral blood flow and neurological deficits in MCAO‐injured mice. Inhibition of PFN1 effectively protected the brain against ischemia/reperfusion injuries by promoting M2 microglial polarization &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Differences in behavior between surface and cave Astyanax mexicanus may be mediated by changes in catecholamine signaling</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Differences in behavior between surface and cave Astyanax mexicanus may be mediated by changes in catecholamine signaling&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cc6edc0e-e859-4aa6-991b-77893c0a3b6c/cne24923-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teleost fish &lt;i&gt;Astyanax mexicanus&lt;/i&gt; is extant in an ancestral surface form (right) and derived cave forms (left). Adaptation to life in nutrient poor caves without predation increased exploratory foraging behaviors and decreased aversion to potential predatory cues in the cavefishes. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry revealed larger catecholaminergic neurons in regions of the cave &lt;i&gt;Astyanax&lt;/i&gt; brain that may mediate these changes in behavior.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Astyanax mexicanus&lt;/i&gt; is a teleost fish that is in the process of allopatric speciation. Ancestral &lt;i&gt;Astyanax&lt;/i&gt; are found in surface rivers and derived blind forms are found in cave systems. Adaptation to life in nutrient poor caves without predation includes the evolution of enhanced food seeking behaviors and loss of defensive responses. These behavioral adaptations may be mediated by changes in catecholaminergic control systems in the brain. We examined the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase, a conserved precursor for the synthesis of the catecholamines dopamine and noradrenaline, in the brains of surface and cave &lt;i&gt;Astyanax&lt;/i&gt; using immunohistochemistry. We found differences in tyrosine hydroxylase staining in regions that are associated with non‐visual sensory perception, motor control, endocrine release, and attention. These differences included significant increases in the diameters of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive soma in cave &lt;i&gt;Astyanax&lt;/i&gt; in the olfactory bulb, basal telencephalon, preoptic nuclei, ventral thalamus, posterior tuberculum, and locus coeruleus. These increases in modulation by dopamine and noradrenaline likely indicate changes in behavioral control that underlie adaptations to the cave environment.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Polygenic Multiple Sclerosis Risk and Population‐Based Childhood Brain Imaging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25717?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25717?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease with a substantial genetic component and immune‐mediated neurodegeneration. Patients with MS show structural brain differences relative to individuals without MS, including smaller regional volumes and alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure. Whether genetic risk for MS is associated with brain structure during early neurodevelopment remains unclear. In this study, we explore the association between MS polygenic risk scores (PRS) and brain imaging outcomes from a large, population‐based pediatric sample to gain insight into the underlying neurobiology of MS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 8‐ to 12‐year‐old genotyped participants from the Generation R Study in whom T1‐weighted volumetric (n = 1,136) and/or diffusion tensor imaging (n = 1,088) had been collected. PRS for MS were calculated based on a large genome‐wide association study of MS (n = 41,505) and were regressed on regional volumes, global and tract‐specific fractional anisotropy (FA), and global mean diffusivity using linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No associations were observed for the regional volumes. We observed a positive association between the MS PRS and global FA (β = 0.098, standard error [SE] = 0.030, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 1.08 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;). Tract‐specific analyses showed higher FA and lower radial diffusivity in several tracts. We replicated our findings in an independent sample of children (n = 186) who were scanned in an earlier phase (global FA; β = 0.189, SE = 0.072, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 9.40 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to show that greater genetic predisposition for MS is associated with higher global brain WM FA at an early age in the general population. Our results suggest a preadolescent time window within neurodevelopment in which MS risk variants act upon the brain. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:774–787&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neurophysiological Signatures of Motor Impairment in Patients with Rett Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25712?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25712?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X‐linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic mutations in the &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt; gene. Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at the cortical level. We aimed to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in vivo synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy control patients, and 11 healthy controls, we applied paired‐pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the excitation index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS‐theta burst stimulation was used to probe long‐term potentiation (LTP)‐like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the excitation index (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short‐interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intracortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long‐interval intracortical inhibition (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). LTP‐like plasticity in M1 was abolished (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008) and scaled with motor disability (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMS is a method that can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the progression of motor deficit and response to treatment. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:763–773&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Robust Markers and Sample Sizes for Multicenter Trials of Huntington Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25709?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25709?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identification of sensitive biomarkers is essential to validate therapeutics for Huntington disease (HD). We directly compare structural imaging markers across the largest collective imaging HD dataset to identify a set of imaging markers robust to multicenter variation and to derive upper estimates on sample sizes for clinical trials in HD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used 1 postprocessing pipeline to retrospectively analyze T1‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 624 participants at 3 time points, from the PREDICT‐HD, TRACK‐HD, and IMAGE‐HD studies. We used mixed effects models to adjust regional brain volumes for covariates, calculate effect sizes, and simulate possible treatment effects in disease‐affected anatomical regions. We used our model to estimate the statistical power of possible treatment effects for anatomical regions and clinical markers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a set of common anatomical regions that have similarly large standardized effect sizes (&amp;gt;0.5) between healthy control and premanifest HD (PreHD) groups. These included subcortical, white matter, and cortical regions and nonventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We also observed a consistent spatial distribution of effect size by region across the whole brain. We found that multicenter studies were necessary to capture treatment effect variance; for a 20% treatment effect, power of &amp;gt;80% was achieved for the caudate (n = 661), pallidum (n = 687), and nonventricular CSF (n = 939), and, crucially, these imaging markers provided greater power than standard clinical markers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide the first cross‐study validation of structural imaging markers in HD, supporting the use of these measurements as endpoints for both observational studies and clinical trials. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:751–762&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Expanding use of immune‐checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) underscores the importance of accurate diagnosis and timely management of neurological immune‐related adverse events (irAE‐N). We evaluate the real‐world frequency, phenotypes, co‐occurring immune‐related adverse events (irAEs), and long‐term outcomes of severe, grade III to V irAE‐N at a tertiary care center over 6 years. We analyze how our experience supports published literature and professional society guidelines. We also discuss these data with regard to common clinical scenarios, such as combination therapy, ICI rechallenge and risk of relapse of irAE‐N, and corticosteroid taper, which are not specifically addressed by current guidelines and/or have limited data. Recommendations for management and future irAE‐N reporting are outlined. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:659–669&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dopaminergic Depletion, β‐Amyloid Burden, and Cognition in Lewy Body Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25707?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25707?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aimed to determine the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion, cerebral β‐amyloid deposition, and cognitive dysfunction in Lewy body disease (LBD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cross‐sectional study recruited 48 LBD patients (30 with dementia, 18 with mild cognitive impairment) and 15 control subjects from a university‐based hospital. We measured the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) activity and regional β‐amyloid burden using &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐(3‐[&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fluoropropyl)‐2β‐carbon ethoxy‐3β‐(4‐iodophenyl) nortropane (FP‐CIT) positron emission tomography (PET) and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐florbetaben (FBB) PET, respectively. The relationship between striatal FP‐CIT uptake, regional cortical FBB uptake, and cognitive function scores was evaluated using path analyses. We also investigated the effects of striatal FP‐CIT uptake and cortical FBB uptake on the interval between motor symptom and dementia onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced striatal FP‐CIT uptake was associated with increased FBB uptake in the posterior cortical regions, most prominently in the occipital cortices. Reduced FP‐CIT uptake in the anterior putamen was associated with visuospatial dysfunction with mediation of increased occipital FBB uptake. Reduced FP‐CIT uptake in the posterior putamen and an increased parietal FBB uptake were independently associated with memory dysfunction. Reduced striatal FP‐CIT uptake was associated with attention, language, and frontal/executive dysfunction, independent of amyloid deposition. Increased FBB uptake, especially in the parietal cortex, was associated with earlier onset of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that occipital β‐amyloid deposition may contribute to the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion and visuospatial dysfunction in LBD patients. Although the effects of reduced DAT activity are more prominent than those of β‐amyloid burden on cognitive dysfunction, the latter affects the onset of cognitive dysfunction. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:739–750&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Connectome‐Based Propagation Model in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25706?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25706?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continue to rely on survival or functional scales as endpoints, despite the emergence of quantitative biomarkers. Neuroimaging‐based biomarkers in ALS have been shown to detect ALS‐associated pathology in vivo, although anatomical patterns of disease spread are poorly characterized. The objective of this study is to simulate disease propagation using network analyses of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to predict disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using brain networks of ALS patients (n = 208) and matched controls across longitudinal time points, network‐based statistics unraveled progressive network degeneration originating from the motor cortex and expanding in a spatiotemporal manner. We applied a computational model to the MRI scan of patients to simulate this progressive network degeneration. Simulated aggregation levels at the group and individual level were validated with empirical impairment observed at later time points of white matter and clinical decline using both internal and external datasets.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observe that computer‐simulated aggregation levels mimic true disease patterns in ALS patients. Simulated patterns of involvement across cortical areas show significant overlap with the patterns of empirically impaired brain regions on later scans, at both group and individual levels. These findings are validated using an external longitudinal dataset of 30 patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results are in accordance with established pathological staging systems and may have implications for patient stratification in future clinical trials. Our results demonstrate the utility of computational models in ALS to predict disease progression and underscore their potential as a prognostic biomarker. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:725–738&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for multiple sclerosis diagnostics but is conventionally not specific to demyelination. Myelin imaging is often hampered by long scanning times, complex postprocessing, or lack of clinical approval. This study aimed to assess the specificity, robustness, and clinical value of Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging, a new myelin imaging technique based on time‐efficient simultaneous T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; relaxometry and proton density mapping in multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid myelin imaging was applied using 3T MRI ex vivo in 3 multiple sclerosis brain samples and in vivo in a prospective cohort of 71 multiple sclerosis patients and 21 age/sex‐matched healthy controls, with scan–rescan repeatability in a subcohort. Disability in patients was assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test at baseline and 2‐year follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid myelin imaging correlated with myelin‐related stains (proteolipid protein immunostaining and Luxol fast blue) and demonstrated good precision. Multiple sclerosis patients had, relative to controls, lower normalized whole‐brain and normal‐appearing white matter myelin fractions, which correlated with baseline cognitive and physical disability. Longitudinally, these myelin fractions correlated with follow‐up physical disability, even with correction for baseline disability.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging provides robust myelin quantification that detects diffuse demyelination in normal‐appearing tissue in multiple sclerosis, which is associated with both cognitive and clinical disability. Because the technique is fast, with automatic postprocessing and US Food and Drug Administration/CE clinical approval, it can be a clinically feasible biomarker that may be suitable to monitor myelin dynamics and evaluate treatments aiming at remyelination. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:710–724&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sleep Deprivation Affects Tau Phosphorylation in Human Cerebrospinal Fluid</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25702?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tau hyperphosphorylation is an early step in tau‐mediated neurodegeneration and is associated with intracellular aggregation of tau as neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss, and eventual cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer disease. Sleep loss increases the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of amyloid‐β and tau. Using mass spectrometry, we measured tau and phosphorylated tau concentrations in serial samples of cerebrospinal fluid collected from participants who were sleep‐deprived, treated with sodium oxybate, or allowed to sleep normally. We found that sleep loss affected phosphorylated tau differently depending on the modified site. These findings suggest a mechanism for sleep loss to increase risk of Alzheimer disease. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:700–709&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Cancer Risk for Fingolimod, Natalizumab, and Rituximab in Multiple Sclerosis Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25701?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25701?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel, highly effective disease‐modifying therapies have revolutionized multiple sclerosis (MS) care. However, evidence from large comparative studies on important safety outcomes, such as cancer, is still lacking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this nationwide register‐based cohort study, we linked data from the Swedish MS register to the Swedish Cancer Register and other national health care and census registers. We included 4,187 first‐ever initiations of rituximab, 1,620 of fingolimod, and 1,670 of natalizumab in 6,136 MS patients matched for age, sex, and location to 37,801 non‐MS general population subjects. Primary outcome was time to first invasive cancer.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 78 invasive cancers among treated patients: rituximab 33 (incidence rate [IR] per 10,000 person‐years = 34.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 23.7–48.3), fingolimod 28 (IR = 44.0, 95% CI = 29.2–63.5), and natalizumab 17 (IR = 26.0, 95% CI = 15.1–41.6). The general population IR was 31.0 (95% CI = 27.8–34.4). Adjusting for baseline characteristics, we found no difference in risk of invasive cancer between rituximab, natalizumab, and the general population but a possibly higher risk with fingolimod compared to the general population (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.53, 95% CI = 0.98–2.38) and rituximab (HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.00–2.84).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this first large comparative study of 3 highly effective MS disease‐modifying therapies, no increased risk of invasive cancer was seen with rituximab and natalizumab, compared to the general population. However, there was a borderline‐significant increased risk with fingolimod, compared to both the general population and rituximab. It was not possible to attribute this increased risk to any specific type of cancer, and further studies are warranted to validate these findings. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:688–699&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: N‐Methyl‐D‐Aspartate Receptor Antibodies in Autoimmune Encephalopathy Alter Oligodendrocyte Function</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25699?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25699?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibodies against neuronal N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis alter neuronal synaptic function and plasticity, but the effects on other cells of the nervous system are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (preabsorbed or not with GluN1) and a human NMDAR‐specific monoclonal antibody (SSM5) derived from plasma cells of a patient, along the corresponding controls, were used in the studies. To evaluate the activity of oligodendrocyte NMDARs and α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in vitro after exposure to patients' CSF antibodies or SSM5, we used a functional assay based on cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging. Expression of the glucose transporter (GLUT1) in oligodendrocytes was assessed by immunocytochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NMDAR agonist responses were robustly reduced after preincubation of oligodendrocytes with patients' CSF or SSM5 but remained largely unaltered with the corresponding controls. These effects were NMDAR specific, as patients' CSF did not alter responses to AMPA receptor agonists and was abrogated by preabsorption of CSF with HEK cells expressing GluN1 subunit. Patients' CSF also reduced oligodendrocyte expression of glucose transporter GLUT1 induced by NMDAR activity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibodies from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis specifically alter the function of NMDARs in oligodendrocytes, causing a decrease of expression of GLUT1. Considering that normal GLUT1 expression in oligodendrocytes and myelin is needed to metabolically support axonal function, the findings suggest a link between antibody‐mediated dysfunction of NMDARs in oligodendrocytes and the white matter alterations reported in patients with this disorder. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2020;87:670–676&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of thalamic pathology in multiple sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25743?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25743?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thalamic atrophy is among the earliest brain changes detected in patients with MS and the degree of thalamic atrophy is a strong predictor of disability progression. The causes of thalamic atrophy are not fully understood. We investigate the contributions of thalamic demyelinated lesions, thalamic neuronal loss, and cerebral white matter lesions to thalamic volume.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used postmortem &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; MRI's of 95 subjects with MS to correlate thalamic lesion volumes with global MRI metrics. We histologically characterized thalamic demyelination patterns and compared neuronal loss and neuritic pathology in the thalami with the extremes of volume.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grossly apparent thalamic discolorations in cm‐thick brain slices were T2/FLAIR hyperintense, T1‐hypointense, and appeared as perivascular demyelinated lesions with dystrophic neurons/axons. Subependymal demyelinated lesions with axonal loss and microglial/macrophage activation were also observed. The 12 subjects with the least thalamic volume had a 17.6% reduction of median neuronal density in the dorsomedial/ventrolateral and pulvinar nuclei compared with the 14 subjects with the greatest thalamic volume (p = 0.03). After correcting for age, disease duration, sex and T2 lesion volume, neither total (p = 0.20), ovoid (p = 0.31), or subependymal (p = 0.44) MRI thalamic lesion volumes correlated with thalamic volume. Thalamic volume correlated with cerebral T2 lesion volume (Spearman's rho = −0.65, p &amp;lt; 0.001; p &amp;lt; 0.0001 after correcting for age, disease duration, and sex).&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Faster Cortical Thinning and Surface Area Loss in Presymptomatic and Symptomatic C9orf72 Repeat Expansion Adult Carriers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25748?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25748?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; expansion is the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We examined aging trajectories of cortical thickness (CTh) and surface area in &lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; expansion adult carriers compared to healthy controls to characterize preclinical cerebral changes leading to symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data were obtained from the Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative. T1‐weighted MRI scans were processed with CIVET 2.1 to extract vertex‐wide CTh and CSA. Symptomatic and presymptomatic subjects were compared to age‐matched controls using mixed‐effects models, controlling for demographic variables. Aging trajectories were compared between carriers and non‐carriers by testing the ‘age by genetic status’ interaction. False‐discovery rate corrections were applied to all vertex‐wide analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample included 640 scans from 386 subjects, including 54 symptomatic &lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; carriers (72.2% behavioral variant FTD), 83 asymptomatic carriers and 249 controls (age range 18–86). Symptomatic carriers showed fairly symmetric reduction in CTh/CSA in most of the frontal lobes, in addition to large temporo‐parietal areas. Presymptomatic subjects had reduced CTh/CSA in more restricted areas of the medial fronto‐parietal lobes, in addition to scattered lateral fronto‐parieto‐temporal areas. These differences were explained by faster cortical thinning linearly throughout adulthood in a similar anatomical distribution, with differences emerging in the early 30s. CSA reduction was also faster in mutation carriers predominantly in the ventro‐frontal regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; mutation carriers have faster cortical thinning and surface loss throughout adulthood in regions that show atrophy in symptomatic subjects. This suggests that the pathogenic effects of the mutation lead to structural cerebral changes decades prior to symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Brain Microvascular Pericytes in Vascular Cognitive Impairment and Dementia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00080</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00080</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Pericytes are unique, multi-functional mural cells localized at the abluminal side of the perivascular space in microvessels. Originally discovered in 19th century, pericytes had drawn less attention until decades ago mainly due to lack of specific markers. Recently, however, a growing body of evidence has revealed that pericytes play various important roles: development and maintenance of blood–brain barrier (BBB), regulation of the neurovascular system (e.g., vascular stability, vessel formation, cerebral blood flow, etc.), trafficking of inflammatory cells, clearance of toxic waste products from the brain, and acquisition of stem cell-like properties. In the neurovascular unit, pericytes perform these functions through coordinated crosstalk with neighboring cells including endothelial, glial, and neuronal cells. Dysfunction of pericytes contribute to a wide variety of diseases that lead to cognitive impairments such as cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), acute stroke, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and other neurological disorders. For instance, in SVDs, pericyte degeneration leads to microvessel instability and demyelination while in stroke, pericyte constriction after ischemia causes a no-reflow phenomenon in brain capillaries. In AD, which shares some common risk factors with vascular dementia, reduction in pericyte coverage and subsequent microvascular impairments are observed in association with white matter attenuation and contribute to impaired cognition. Pericyte loss causes BBB-breakdown, which stagnates amyloid β clearance and the leakage of neurotoxic molecules into the brain parenchyma. In this review, we first summarize the characteristics of brain microvessel pericytes, and their roles in the central nervous system. Then, we focus on how dysfunctional pericytes contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment including cerebral ‘small vessel’ and ‘large vessel’ diseases, as well as AD. Finally, we discuss therapeutic implications for these disorders by targeting pericytes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease but currently has no effective treatment. Growing evidence suggests that proteome homeostasis underlies ALS pathogenesis. Protein production, trafficking, and degradation all shape the proteome. We present a hypothesis that proposes all genetic lesions associated with ALS (including in mRNA-binding proteins) cause widespread imbalance to an already metastable proteome. The impact of such dysfunction is felt across the entire proteome and is not restricted to a small subset of proteins.</description>

	<description>Steinberg et al. investigate how connections between the central amygdala and the lateral substantia nigra contribute to emotional behaviors. They find that amygdalonigral neurons are activated by salient stimuli and participate in appetitive and aversive learning via connections with nigral GABA and dopamine neurons.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Improving the coverage of credible sets in Bayesian genetic fine-mapping</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna Hutchinson, Hope Watson, Chris Wallace&lt;/p&gt;

Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of loci associated with human diseases. Bayesian genetic fine-mapping studies aim to identify the specific causal variants within GWAS loci responsible for each association, reporting credible sets of plausible causal variants, which are interpreted as containing the causal variant with some “coverage probability”. Here, we use simulations to demonstrate that the coverage probabilities are over-conservative in most fine-mapping situations. We show that this is because fine-mapping data sets are not randomly selected from amongst all causal variants, but from amongst causal variants with larger effect sizes. We present a method to re-estimate the coverage of credible sets using rapid simulations based on the observed, or estimated, SNP correlation structure, we call this the “adjusted coverage estimate”. This is extended to find “adjusted credible sets”, which are the smallest set of variants such that their adjusted coverage estimate meets the target coverage. We use our method to improve the resolution of a fine-mapping study of type 1 diabetes. We found that in 27 out of 39 associated genomic regions our method could reduce the number of potentially causal variants to consider for follow-up, and found that none of the 95% or 99% credible sets required the inclusion of more variants—a pattern matched in simulations of well powered GWAS. Crucially, our method requires only GWAS summary statistics and remains accurate when SNP correlations are estimated from a large reference panel. Using our method to improve the resolution of fine-mapping studies will enable more efficient expenditure of resources in the follow-up process of annotating the variants in the credible set to determine the implicated genes and pathways in human diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZTeJWkGsGCg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Enhanced production of heterologous proteins by a synthetic microbial community: Conditions and trade-offs</title>

Synthetic microbial consortia have been increasingly utilized in biotechnology and experimental evidence shows that suitably engineered consortia can outperform individual species in the synthesis of valuable products. Despite significant achievements, though, a quantitative understanding of the conditions that make this possible, and of the trade-offs due to the concurrent growth of multiple species, is still limited. In this work, we contribute to filling this gap by the investigation of a known prototypical synthetic consortium. A first &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; strain, producing a heterologous protein, is sided by a second &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; strain engineered to scavenge toxic byproducts, thus favoring the growth of the producer at the expense of diverting part of the resources to the growth of the cleaner. The simplicity of the consortium is ideal to perform an in depth-analysis and draw conclusions of more general interest. We develop a coarse-grained mathematical model that quantitatively accounts for literature data from different key growth phenotypes. Based on this, assuming growth in chemostat, we first investigate the conditions enabling stable coexistence of both strains and the effect of the metabolic load due to heterologous protein production. In these conditions, we establish when and to what extent the consortium outperforms the producer alone in terms of productivity. Finally, we show in chemostat as well as in a fed-batch scenario that gain in productivity comes at the price of a reduced yield, reflecting at the level of the consortium resource allocation trade-offs that are well-known for individual species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yUpRNtkUMDo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Widefield calcium imaging enables recording of large-scale neural activity across the mouse dorsal cortex. In order to examine the relationship of these neural signals to the resulting behavior, it is critical to demix the recordings into meaningful spatial and temporal components that can be mapped onto well-defined brain regions. However, no current tools satisfactorily extract the activity of the different brain regions in individual mice in a data-driven manner, while taking into account mouse-specific and preparation-specific differences. Here, we introduce Localized semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (LocaNMF), a method that efficiently decomposes widefield video data and allows us to directly compare activity across multiple mice by outputting mouse-specific localized functional regions that are significantly more interpretable than more traditional decomposition techniques. Moreover, it provides a natural subspace to directly compare correlation maps and neural dynamics across different behaviors, mice, and experimental conditions, and enables identification of task- and movement-related brain regions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CDkfhRwyf0Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Generalizing to generalize: Humans flexibly switch between compositional and conjunctive structures during reinforcement learning</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas T. Franklin, Michael J. Frank&lt;/p&gt;

Humans routinely face novel environments in which they have to generalize in order to act adaptively. However, doing so involves the non-trivial challenge of deciding which aspects of a task domain to generalize. While it is sometimes appropriate to simply re-use a learned behavior, often adaptive generalization entails recombining distinct components of knowledge acquired across multiple contexts. Theoretical work has suggested a computational trade-off in which it can be more or less useful to learn and generalize aspects of task structure jointly or compositionally, depending on previous task statistics, but it is unknown whether humans modulate their generalization strategy accordingly. Here we develop a series of navigation tasks that separately manipulate the statistics of goal values (“what to do”) and state transitions (“how to do it”) across contexts and assess whether human subjects generalize these task components separately or conjunctively. We find that human generalization is sensitive to the statistics of the previously experienced task domain, favoring compositional or conjunctive generalization when the task statistics are indicative of such structures, and a mixture of the two when they are more ambiguous. These results support a normative “meta-generalization” account and suggests that people not only generalize previous task components but also generalize the statistical structure most likely to support generalization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jkWq3zlKQgI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A mathematical model describing the localization and spread of influenza A virus infection within the human respiratory tract</title>

Within the human respiratory tract (HRT), virus diffuses through the periciliary fluid (PCF) bathing the epithelium. But virus also undergoes advection: as the mucus layer sitting atop the PCF is pushed along by the ciliated cell’s beating cilia, the PCF and its virus content are also pushed along, upwards towards the nose and mouth. While many mathematical models (MMs) have described the course of influenza A virus (IAV) infections in vivo, none have considered the impact of both diffusion and advection on the kinetics and localization of the infection. The MM herein represents the HRT as a one-dimensional track extending from the nose down towards the lower HRT, wherein stationary cells interact with IAV which moves within (diffusion) and along with (advection) the PCF. Diffusion was found to be negligible in the presence of advection which effectively sweeps away IAV, preventing infection from disseminating below the depth at which virus first deposits. Higher virus production rates (10-fold) are required at higher advection speeds (40 μm/s) to maintain equivalent infection severity and timing. Because virus is entrained upwards, upper parts of the HRT see more virus than lower parts. As such, infection peaks and resolves faster in the upper than in the lower HRT, making it appear as though infection progresses from the upper towards the lower HRT, as reported in mice. When the spatial MM is expanded to include cellular regeneration and an immune response, it reproduces tissue damage levels reported in patients. It also captures the kinetics of seasonal and avian IAV infections, via parameter changes consistent with reported differences between these strains, enabling comparison of their treatment with antivirals. This new MM offers a convenient and unique platform from which to study the localization and spread of respiratory viral infections within the HRT.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e50KlDmALV0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Microscopy image analysis is a major bottleneck in quantification of single-cell microscopy data, typically requiring human oversight and curation, which limit both accuracy and throughput. To address this, we developed a deep learning-based image analysis pipeline that performs segmentation, tracking, and lineage reconstruction. Our analysis focuses on time-lapse movies of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; cells trapped in a &quot;mother machine&quot; microfluidic device, a scalable platform for long-term single-cell analysis that is widely used in the field. While deep learning has been applied to cell segmentation problems before, our approach is fundamentally innovative in that it also uses machine learning to perform cell tracking and lineage reconstruction. With this framework we are able to get high fidelity results (1% error rate), without human intervention. Further, the algorithm is fast, with complete analysis of a typical frame containing ~150 cells taking &amp;lt;700msec. The framework is not constrained to a particular experimental set up and has the potential to generalize to time-lapse images of other organisms or different experimental configurations. These advances open the door to a myriad of applications including real-time tracking of gene expression and high throughput analysis of strain libraries at single-cell resolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yhxcQeuqnCk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Nervous systems exploit regularities in the sensory environment to predict sensory input, adjust behavior, and thereby maximize fitness. Entrainment of neural oscillations allows retaining temporal regularities of sensory information, a prerequisite for prediction. Entrainment has been extensively described at the frequencies of periodic inputs most commonly present in visual and auditory landscapes (e.g., &amp;gt;0.5 Hz). An open question is whether neural entrainment also occurs for regularities at much longer timescales. Here, we exploited the fact that the temporal dynamics of thermal stimuli in natural environment can unfold very slowly. We show that ultralow-frequency neural oscillations preserved a long-lasting trace of sensory information through neural entrainment to periodic thermo-nociceptive input as low as 0.1 Hz. Importantly, revealing the functional significance of this phenomenon, both power and phase of the entrainment predicted individual pain sensitivity. In contrast, periodic auditory input at the same ultralow frequency did not entrain ultralow-frequency oscillations. These results demonstrate that a functionally significant neural entrainment can occur at temporal scales far longer than those commonly explored. The non-supramodal nature of our results suggests that ultralow-frequency entrainment might be tuned to the temporal scale of the statistical regularities characteristic of different sensory modalities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KKPxATUxu5Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pre‐mortem Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Diagnoses in Professional Football</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25747?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25747?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American‐style football (ASF) has gained attention because of possible links between repetitive head injury and neurodegenerative diseases. While post‐mortem pathologic changes consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) have been reported in ASF players, there are currently no established pre‐mortem diagnostic criteria for CTE. Nevertheless, presented with symptoms of cognitive impairment, clinicians treating former players may be inclined to suggest CTE without a thorough exploration of comorbid factors that demonstrate similar clinical phenotypes to putative CTE.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey of 3,913 former ASF players aged 24 to 89 who responded by March 2019.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being a post‐mortem diagnosis, 108 players (2.8%) self‐reported clinician‐diagnosed CTE. The percentage of players under age 60 reporting a CTE diagnosis was 2.3%, versus 3.7% in participants age 60 or older. Comorbidities in participants self‐reporting CTE were significantly more common, including sleep apnea, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, indicators of past or current depression, hypertension, prescription pain medication use, heart conditions and low testosterone when compared to non‐CTE respondents. Patterns of reporting for obesity, hypertension, heart conditions or hypercholesterolemia differed between older and younger participants. Cognitive impairment symptoms were significantly higher in participants self‐reporting CTE.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some former professional football players have been clinically diagnosed with CTE, a post‐mortem condition. Comorbidities that can affect cognition were associated with CTE diagnoses in both older and younger players. While underlying neuropathology cannot be ruled out, treatable conditions should be explored in former athletes demonstrating CTE‐linked clinical phenotypes or symptoms as a means of improving cognitive health in these patients.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There has not been a major change in how neuroscientists approach stereotaxic methods in decades. Here, we present a new stereotaxic method that provides an alternative approach to a traditional u-frame stereotaxic device and reduces costs, surgical time, and aids repeatability. The RatHat brain implantation system is a 3D-printable stereotaxic device for rats that is fabricated prior to surgery and fits to the shape of the skull. RatHat builds are directly implanted into the brain without the need for head-leveling or coordinate-mapping during surgery. The RatHat can be used in conjunction with the traditional u-frame stereotaxic device, but does not require the use of a micromanipulator for successful implantations. Each RatHat contains several primary components including the implant for mounting intracranial components, the surgical stencil for targeting drill sites, and the protective cap for preventing damage from impacts and debris. Each component serves a unique function and can be used together or separately. We demonstrate the feasibility of the RatHat in four different proof-of-principle experiments: (1) a three-pole cannula apparatus, (2) an optrode-electrode assembly, (3) a fixed-electrode array, and (4) a tetrode hyperdrive. Implants were successful, durable, and long-lasting (up to nine months). RatHat print files are easily created, can be modified in computer aided design (CAD) software for a variety of applications, and are easily shared, contributing to open science goals and replications. The RatHat has been adapted to multiple experimental paradigms in our lab and should be a useful new way to conduct stereotaxic implant surgeries in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic development in progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) has been hampered by a lack of reliable biomarkers to monitor neurodegeneration. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)‐derived retinal measures have been proposed as promising biomarkers to fulfill this role. However, it is unclear if retinal atrophy persists in PMS, exceeds normal aging, or can be distinguished from relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;178 RRMS, 186 PMS, and 66 control participants were followed with serial OCT for a median follow‐up of 3.7 years.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimated proportion of peri‐papillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) and macular ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thinning in MS attributable to normal aging increased from 42.7% and 16.7% respectively at age 25 years, to 83.7% and 81.1% at age 65 years. However, independent of age, PMS was associated with faster pRNFL (−0.34 ± 0.09%/year; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and GCIPL (−0.27 ± 0.07%/year; p &amp;lt; 0.001) thinning, as compared to RRMS. In both MS and controls, higher baseline age was associated with faster inner (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thinning. INL and ONL thinning were independently faster in PMS, as compared to controls (INL:‐0.09 ± 0.04%/year, p = 0.03; ONL:‐0.12 ± 0.06%/year, p = 0.04), and RRMS (INL:‐0.10 ± 0.04%/year, p = 0.01; ONL:‐0.13 ± 0.05%/year, p = 0.01), while they were similar in RRMS and controls. Unlike RRMS, disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) did not impact rates of retinal layer atrophy in PMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PMS is associated with faster retinal atrophy independent of age. INL and ONL measures may be novel biomarkers of neurodegeneration in PMS, that appear to be unaffected by conventional DMTs. The effects of aging on rates of retinal layer atrophy should be considered in clinical trials incorporating OCT outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this invited review, we argue for the need to determine whether appetitive and aversive behaviors, be they goal‐directed or habitual, share overlapping neural circuitry. To motivate our argument, we first summarize what is currently known about the neural circuits governing aversive and appetitive behaviors by focusing first on the three hypothesized phases of avoidance learning, and then on goal‐directed and habitual reward seeking. We then provide several reasons to believe that the neural circuits of appetitive and aversive instrumental behaviors are not completely overlapping. We next discuss an experimental strategy to determine the extent of overlap based on a new computational framework that improves the identification of goal‐directed and habitual actions regardless of valence. Finally, we discuss recent work in obsessive‐compulsive disorder that uses this computational framework to determine whether patients perform appetitive and aversive versions of the same task using the same behavioral strategies and neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Frontotemporal dementia: correlations between psychiatric symptoms and pathology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25739?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pathology of frontotemporal dementia, termed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), is characterized by distinct molecular classes of aggregated proteins, the most common being TDP‐43, tau, and FUS. With a few exceptions, it is currently not possible to predict the underlying pathology based on the clinical syndrome. In this study, we set out to investigate the relationship between pathological and clinical presentation at single symptom level, including neuropsychiatric features.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence or absence of symptoms from the current clinical guidelines, together with neuropsychiatric features such as hallucinations and delusions, were scored and compared across pathological groups in a cohort of 150 brain donors.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our cohort consisted of 68.6% FTLD donors (35.3% TDP‐43, 28% tau, and 5.3% FUS) and 31.3% non‐FTLD donors with a clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia and a different pathological substrate such as Alzheimer's disease (23%). The presence of hyperorality points to FTLD rather than non‐FTLD pathology (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Within the FTLD group, hallucinations in the initial years of the disease were related to TDP‐43 pathology (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), including but not limited to &lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; repeat expansion carriers. The presence of perseverative or compulsive behavior was more common in the TDP‐B and TDP‐C histotypes (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that neuropsychiatric features are common in FTLD and form an important indicator of underlying pathology. In order to allow better inclusion of patients in targeted molecular trials, the routine evaluation of patients with frontotemporal dementia should include the presence and nature of neuropsychiatric symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Hippocampal interictal spikes during sleep impact long‐term memory consolidation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25744?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25744?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non rapid eye movement sleep is supposed to play a key role in long‐term memory consolidation transferring information from hippocampus to neocortex. However, sleep also activates epileptic activities in medial temporal regions. This study investigated whether interictal hippocampal spikes during sleep would impair long‐term memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prospectively measured visual and verbal memory performance in 20 patients with epilepsy investigated with stereoelectroencephalography at immediate, 30‐min and 1‐week delays, and studied the correlations between interictal hippocampal spike frequency during waking and the first cycle of non‐rapid eye movement sleep and memory performance, taking into account the number of seizures occurring during the consolidation period and other possible confounding factors such as age and epilepsy duration.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retention of verbal memory over 1 week was negatively correlated with hippocampal spike frequency during sleep, whereas no significant correlation was found with hippocampal interictal spikes during waking. No significant result was found for visual memory. Regression tree analysis showed that the number of seizures was the first factor that impaired the verbal memory retention between 30min and 1 week. When the number of seizures was below 5, spike frequency during sleep higher than 13/min was associated with impaired memory retention over 1‐week.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results show that activation of interictal spikes in hippocampus during sleep and seizures specifically impair long‐term memory consolidation. We hypothesize that hippocampal interictal spikes during sleep interrupt hippocampal‐neocortical transfer of information.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Three‐dimensional atlas of thoracic ganglia in the praying mantis, Tenodera aridifolia</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Three‐dimensional atlas of thoracic ganglia in the praying mantis, Tenodera aridifolia&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/08632a31-47fd-409d-8fe4-98f314db65ad/cne24841-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The praying mantis is a good model for the study of motor control. In insects, thoracic ganglia (TG) play an important role in motor control. We generated a three‐dimensional atlas of prothoracic, mesothoracic, and metathoracic ganglia in the praying mantis (&lt;i&gt;Tenodera aridifolia&lt;/i&gt;). We visualized neuropil areas by immunostaining whole‐mount TG with an anti‐synapsin antibody. Then, a three‐dimensional atlas was reconstructed from standardized images of the TG. The standard TG are available at the Comparative Neuroscience Platform website and can be used as a common reference map to combine the anatomical data obtained from different individuals.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The praying mantis is a good model for the study of motor control, especially for investigating the transformation from sensory signals into motor commands. In insects, thoracic ganglia (TG) play an important role in motor control. To understand the functional organization of TG, an atlas is useful. However, except for the fruitfly, no three‐dimensional atlas of TG has not been reported for insects. In this study, we generated a three‐dimensional atlas of prothoracic, mesothoracic, and metathoracic ganglia in the praying mantis (&lt;i&gt;Tenodera aridifolia&lt;/i&gt;). First, we observed serial sections of the prothoracic ganglion stained with hematoxylin and eosin to identify longitudinal tracts and transverse commissures. We then visualized neuropil areas by immunostaining whole‐mount TG with an anti‐synapsin antibody. Before labeling each neuropil area, standardization using the iterative shape averaging method was applied to images to make neuropil contours distinct. Neuropil areas in TG were defined based on their shape and relative position to tracts and commissures. Finally, a three‐dimensional atlas was reconstructed from standardized images of the TG. The standard TG are available at the Comparative Neuroscience Platform website (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cns.neuroinf.jp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;cns.neuroinf.jp&lt;/a&gt;/modules/xoonips/detail.php?item_id=11946) and can be used as a common reference map to combine the anatomical data obtained from different individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
