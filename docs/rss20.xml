	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Correlates of Semantic Prediction and Resolution in Sentence Processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4848?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Most brain-imaging studies of language comprehension focus on activity following meaningful stimuli. Testing adult human participants with high-density EEG, we show that, already before the presentation of a critical word, context-induced semantic predictions are reflected by a neurophysiological index, which we therefore call the semantic readiness potential (SRP). The SRP precedes critical words if a previous sentence context constrains the upcoming semantic content (high-constraint contexts), but not in unpredictable (low-constraint) contexts. Specific semantic predictions were indexed by SRP sources within the motor system—in dorsolateral hand motor areas for expected hand-related words (e.g., &quot;write&quot;), but in ventral motor cortex for face-related words (&quot;talk&quot;). Compared with affirmative sentences, negated ones led to medial prefrontal and more widespread motor source activation, the latter being consistent with predictive semantic computation of alternatives to the negated expected concept. Predictive processing of semantic alternatives in negated sentences is further supported by a negative-going event-related potential at ~400 ms (N400), which showed the typical enhancement to semantically incongruent sentence endings only in high-constraint affirmative contexts, but not to high-constraint negated ones. These brain dynamics reveal the interplay between semantic prediction and resolution (match vs error) processing in sentence understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Most neuroscientists agree on the eminent importance of predictive mechanisms for understanding basic as well as higher brain functions. This contrasts with a sparseness of brain measures that directly reflects specific aspects of prediction, as they are relevant in the processing of language and thought. Here we show that when critical words are strongly expected in their sentence context, a predictive brain response reflects meaning features of these anticipated symbols already before they appear. The granularity of the semantic predictions was so fine grained that the cortical sources in sensorimotor and medial prefrontal cortex even distinguished between predicted face- or hand-related action words (e.g., the words &quot;lick&quot; or &quot;pick&quot;) and between affirmative and negated sentence meanings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Fluid Intelligence Predicts Novel Rule Implementation in a Distributed Frontoparietal Control Network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4841?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fluid intelligence has been associated with a distributed cognitive control or multiple-demand (MD) network, comprising regions of lateral frontal, insular, dorsomedial frontal, and parietal cortex. Human fluid intelligence is also intimately linked to task complexity, and the process of solving complex problems in a sequence of simpler, more focused parts. Here, a complex target detection task included multiple independent rules, applied one at a time in successive task epochs. Although only one rule was applied at a time, increasing task complexity (i.e., the number of rules) impaired performance in participants of lower fluid intelligence. Accompanying this loss of performance was reduced response to rule-critical events across the distributed MD network. The results link fluid intelligence and MD function to a process of attentional focus on the successive parts of complex behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Fluid intelligence is intimately linked to the ability to structure complex problems in a sequence of simpler, more focused parts. We examine the basis for this link in the functions of a distributed frontoparietal or multiple-demand (MD) network. With increased task complexity, participants of lower fluid intelligence showed reduced responses to task-critical events. Reduced responses in the MD system were accompanied by impaired behavioral performance. Low fluid intelligence is linked to poor foregrounding of task-critical information across a distributed MD system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nonsinusoidal Beta Oscillations Reflect Cortical Pathophysiology in Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4830?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4830?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Oscillations in neural activity play a critical role in neural computation and communication. There is intriguing new evidence that the nonsinusoidal features of the oscillatory waveforms may inform underlying physiological and pathophysiological characteristics. Time-domain waveform analysis approaches stand in contrast to traditional Fourier-based methods, which alter or destroy subtle waveform features. Recently, it has been shown that the waveform features of oscillatory beta (13–30 Hz) events, a prominent motor cortical oscillation, may reflect near-synchronous excitatory synaptic inputs onto cortical pyramidal neurons. Here we analyze data from invasive human primary motor cortex (M1) recordings from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) implanted with a deep brain stimulator (DBS) to test the hypothesis that the beta waveform becomes less sharp with DBS, suggesting that M1 input synchrony may be decreased. We find that, in PD, M1 beta oscillations have sharp, asymmetric, nonsinusoidal features, specifically asymmetries in the ratio between the sharpness of the beta peaks compared with the troughs. This waveform feature is nearly perfectly correlated with beta-high gamma phase-amplitude coupling (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.94), a neural index previously shown to track PD-related motor deficit. Our results suggest that the pathophysiological beta generator is altered by DBS, smoothing out the beta waveform. This has implications not only for the interpretation of the physiological mechanism by which DBS reduces PD-related motor symptoms, but more broadly for our analytic toolkit in general. That is, the often-overlooked time-domain features of oscillatory waveforms may carry critical physiological information about neural processes and dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To better understand the neural basis of cognition and disease, we need to understand how groups of neurons interact to communicate with one another. For example, there is evidence that parkinsonian bradykinesia and rigidity may arise from an oversynchronization of afferents to the motor cortex, and that these symptoms are treatable using deep brain stimulation. Here we show that the waveform shape of beta (13–30 Hz) oscillations, which may reflect input synchrony onto the cortex, is altered by deep brain stimulation. This suggests that mechanistic inferences regarding physiological and pathophysiological neural communication may be made from the temporal dynamics of oscillatory waveform shape.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Disconnection of the Perirhinal and Postrhinal Cortices Impairs Recognition of Objects in Context But Not Contextual Fear Conditioning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4819?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4819?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The perirhinal cortex (PER) is known to process object information, whereas the rodent postrhinal cortex (POR), homolog to the parahippocampal cortex in primates, is thought to process spatial information. A number of studies, however, provide evidence that both areas are involved in processing contextual information. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the rat POR relies on object information received from the PER to form complex representations of context. Using three fear-conditioning (FC) paradigms (signaled, unsignaled, and renewal) and two context-guided object recognition tasks (with 3D and 2D objects), we examined the effects of crossed excitotoxic lesions to the POR and the contralateral PER. Performance of rats with crossed lesions was compared with that of rats with ipsilateral POR plus PER lesions and sham-operated rats. We found that rats with contralateral PER–POR lesions were impaired in object–context recognition but not in contextual FC. Therefore, interaction between the POR and PER is necessary for context-guided exploratory behavior but not for associating fear with context. Our results provide evidence for the hypothesis that the POR relies on object and pattern information from the PER to encode representations of context. The association of fear with a context, however, may be supported by alternate cortical and/or subcortical pathways when PER–POR interaction is not available. Our results suggest that contextual FC may represent a special case of context-guided behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Representations of context are important for perception, memory, decision making, and other cognitive processes. Moreover, there is extensive evidence that the use of contextual representations to guide appropriate behavior is disrupted in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders including developmental disorders, schizophrenia, affective disorders, and Alzheimer's disease. Many of these disorders are accompanied by changes in parahippocampal and hippocampal structures. Understanding how context is represented in the brain and how parahippocampal structures are involved will enhance our understanding and treatment of the cognitive and behavioral symptoms associated with neurological disorders and neuropsychiatric disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Active Avoidance: Neural Mechanisms and Attenuation of Pavlovian Conditioned Responding</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4808?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4808?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Patients with anxiety disorders often experience a relapse in symptoms after exposure therapy. Similarly, threat responses acquired during Pavlovian threat conditioning often return after extinction learning. Accordingly, there is a need for alternative methods to persistently reduce threat responding. Studies in rodents have suggested that exercising behavioral control over an aversive stimulus can persistently diminish threat responses, and that these effects are mediated by the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and striatum. In this fMRI study, we attempted to translate these findings to humans. Subjects first underwent threat conditioning. We then contrasted two forms of safety learning: active avoidance, in which participants could prevent the shock through an action, and yoked extinction, with shock presentation matched to the active condition, but without instrumental control. The following day, we assessed subjects' threat responses (measured by skin conductance) to the conditioned stimuli without shock. Subjects next underwent threat conditioning with novel stimuli. Yoked extinction subjects showed an increase in conditioned response to stimuli from the previous day, but the active avoidance group did not. Additionally, active avoidance subjects showed reduced conditioned responding during novel threat conditioning, but the extinction group did not. We observed between-group differences in striatal BOLD responses to shock omission in Avoidance/Extinction. These findings suggest a differential role for the striatum in human active avoidance versus extinction learning, and indicate that active avoidance may be more effective than extinction in persistently diminishing threat responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Extinguished threat responses often reemerge with time, highlighting the importance of identifying more enduring means of attenuation. We compared the effects of active avoidance learning and yoked extinction on threat responses in humans and contrasted the neural circuitry engaged by these two processes. Subjects who learned to prevent a shock through an action maintained low threat responses after safety learning and showed attenuated threat conditioning with novel stimuli, in contrast to those who underwent yoked extinction. The results suggest that experiences of active control over threat engage the striatum and promote a shift from expression of innate defensive responses toward more adaptive behavioral responses to threatening stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Perineurial Glial Plasticity and the Role of TGF-{beta} in the Development of the Blood-Nerve Barrier</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4790?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Precisely orchestrated interactions between spinal motor axons and their ensheathing glia are vital for forming and maintaining functional spinal motor nerves. Following perturbations to peripheral myelinating glial cells, centrally derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) ectopically exit the spinal cord and myelinate peripheral nerves in myelin with CNS characteristics. However, whether remaining peripheral ensheathing glia, such as perineurial glia, properly encase the motor nerve despite this change in glial cell and myelin composition, remains unknown. Using zebrafish mutants in which OPCs migrate out of the spinal cord and myelinate peripheral motor axons, we assayed perineurial glial development, maturation, and response to injury. Surprisingly, in the presence of OPCs, perineurial glia exited the CNS normally. However, aspects of their development, response to injury, and function were altered compared with wildtype larvae. In an effort to better understand the plasticity of perineurial glia in response to myelin perturbations, we identified transforming growth factor-β1 as a partial mediator of perineurial glial development. Together, these results demonstrate the incredible plasticity of perineurial glia in the presence of myelin perturbations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Peripheral neuropathies can result from damage or dysregulation of the insulating myelin sheath surrounding spinal motor axons, causing pain, inefficient nerve conduction, and the ectopic migration of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), the resident myelinating glial cell of the CNS, into the periphery. How perineurial glia, the ensheathing cells that form the protective blood–nerve barrier, are impacted by this myelin composition change is unknown. Here, we report that certain aspects of perineurial glial development and injury responses are mostly unaffected in the presence of ectopic OPCs. However, perineurial glial function is disrupted along nerves containing centrally derived myelin, demonstrating that, although perineurial glial cells display plasticity despite myelin perturbations, the blood–nerve barrier is compromised in the presence of ectopic OPCs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Odorant Sensory Input Modulates DNA Secondary Structure Formation and Heterogeneous Ribonucleoprotein Recruitment on the Tyrosine Hydroxylase and Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase 1 Promoters in the Olfactory Bulb</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adaptation of neural circuits to changes in sensory input can modify several cellular processes within neurons, including neurotransmitter biosynthesis levels. For a subset of olfactory bulb interneurons, activity-dependent changes in GABA are reflected by corresponding changes in &lt;i&gt;Glutamate decarboxylase 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Gad1&lt;/i&gt;) expression levels. Mechanisms regulating &lt;i&gt;Gad1&lt;/i&gt; promoter activity are poorly understood, but here we show that a conserved G:C-rich region in the mouse &lt;i&gt;Gad1&lt;/i&gt; proximal promoter region both recruits heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) that facilitate transcription and forms single-stranded DNA secondary structures associated with transcriptional repression. This promoter architecture and function is shared with &lt;i&gt;Tyrosine hydroxylase&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Th&lt;/i&gt;), which is also modulated by odorant-dependent activity in the olfactory bulb. This study shows that the balance between DNA secondary structure formation and hnRNP binding on the mouse &lt;i&gt;Th&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gad1&lt;/i&gt; promoters in the olfactory bulb is responsive to changes in odorant-dependent sensory input. These findings reveal that &lt;i&gt;Th&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gad1&lt;/i&gt; share a novel transcription regulatory mechanism that facilitates sensory input-dependent regulation of dopamine and GABA expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Adaptation of neural circuits to changes in sensory input can modify several cellular processes within neurons, including neurotransmitter biosynthesis levels. This study shows that transcription of genes encoding rate-limiting enzymes for GABA and dopamine biosynthesis (&lt;i&gt;Gad1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Th&lt;/i&gt;, respectively) in the mammalian olfactory bulb is regulated by G:C-rich regions that both recruit heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) to facilitate transcription and form single-stranded DNA secondary structures associated with repression. hnRNP binding and formation of DNA secondary structure on the &lt;i&gt;Th&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gad1&lt;/i&gt; promoters are mutually exclusive, and odorant sensory input levels regulate the balance between these regulatory features. These findings reveal that &lt;i&gt;Th&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gad1&lt;/i&gt; share a transcription regulatory mechanism that facilitates odorant-dependent regulation of dopamine and GABA expression levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Concurrent tACS-fMRI Reveals Causal Influence of Power Synchronized Neural Activity on Resting State fMRI Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4766?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4766?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is commonly used to study the brain's intrinsic neural coupling, which reveals specific spatiotemporal patterns in the form of resting state networks (RSNs). It has been hypothesized that slow rs-fMRI oscillations (&amp;lt;0.1 Hz) are driven by underlying electrophysiological rhythms that typically occur at much faster timescales (&amp;gt;5 Hz); however, causal evidence for this relationship is currently lacking. Here we measured rs-fMRI in humans while applying transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to entrain brain rhythms in left and right sensorimotor cortices. The two driving tACS signals were tailored to the individual's α rhythm (8–12 Hz) and fluctuated in amplitude according to a 1 Hz power envelope. We entrained the left versus right hemisphere in accordance to two different coupling modes where either α oscillations were synchronized between hemispheres (phase-synchronized tACS) or the slower oscillating power envelopes (power-synchronized tACS). Power-synchronized tACS significantly increased rs-fMRI connectivity within the stimulated RSN compared with phase-synchronized or no tACS. This effect outlasted the stimulation period and tended to be more effective in individuals who exhibited a naturally weak interhemispheric coupling. Using this novel approach, our data provide causal evidence that synchronized power fluctuations contribute to the formation of fMRI-based RSNs. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the brain's intrinsic coupling at rest can be selectively modulated by choosing appropriate tACS signals, which could lead to new interventions for patients with altered rs-fMRI connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has become an important tool to estimate brain connectivity. However, relatively little is known about how slow hemodynamic oscillations measured with fMRI relate to electrophysiological processes. It was suggested that slowly fluctuating power envelopes of electrophysiological signals synchronize across brain areas and that the topography of this activity is spatially correlated to resting state networks derived from rs-fMRI. Here we take a novel approach to address this problem and establish a causal link between the power fluctuations of electrophysiological signals and rs-fMRI via a new neuromodulation paradigm, which exploits these power synchronization mechanisms. These novel mechanistic insights bridge different scientific domains and are of broad interest to researchers in the fields of Medical Imaging, Neuroscience, Physiology, and Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Movement Rate Is Encoded and Influenced by Widespread, Coherent Activity of Cerebellar Molecular Layer Interneurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4751?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4751?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Inhibition from molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) is thought to play an important role in cerebellar function by sharpening the precision of Purkinje cell spike output. Yet the coding features of MLIs during behavior are poorly understood. To study MLI activity, we used &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging in head-fixed mice during the performance of a rhythmic motor behavior, licking during water consumption. MLIs were robustly active during lick-related movement across a lobule-specific region of the cerebellum showing high temporal correspondence within their population. Average MLI Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity strongly correlated with movement rate but not to the intentional, or unexpected, adjustment of lick position or to sensory feedback that varied with task condition. Chemogenetic suppression of MLI output reduced lick rate and altered tongue movements, indicating that activity of these interneurons not only encodes temporal aspects of movement kinematics but also influences motor outcome pointing to an integral role in online control of rhythmic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The cerebellum helps fine-tune coordinated motor actions via signaling from projection neurons called Purkinje cells. Molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) provide powerful inhibition onto Purkinje cells, but little is understood about how this inhibitory circuit is engaged during behavior or what type of information is transmitted through these neurons. Our work establishes that MLIs in the lateral cerebellum are broadly activated during movement with calcium activity corresponding to movement rate. We also show that suppression of MLI output slows and disorganizes the precise movement pattern. Therefore, MLIs are an important circuit element in the cerebellum allowing for accurate motor control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Correlates of Perceptual Orientation Biases in Human Primary Visual Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4744?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4744?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Vision can be considered as a process of probabilistic inference. In a Bayesian framework, perceptual estimates from sensory information are combined with prior knowledge, with a stronger influence of the prior when the sensory evidence is less certain. Here, we explored the behavioral and neural consequences of manipulating stimulus certainty in the context of orientation processing. First, we asked participants to judge whether a stimulus was oriented closer to vertical or the clockwise primary oblique (45°) for two stimulus types (spatially filtered noise textures and sinusoidal gratings) and three manipulations of certainty (orientation bandwidth, contrast, and duration). We found that participants consistently had a bias toward reporting orientation as closer to 45° during conditions of high certainty and that this bias was reduced when sensory evidence was less certain. Second, we measured event-related fMRI BOLD responses in human primary visual cortex (V1) and manipulated certainty via stimulus contrast (100% vs 3%). We then trained a multivariate classifier on the pattern of responses in V1 to cardinal and primary oblique orientations. We found that the classifier showed a bias toward classifying orientation as oblique at high contrast but categorized a wider range of orientations as cardinal for low-contrast stimuli. Orientation classification based on data from V1 thus paralleled the perceptual biases revealed through the behavioral experiments. This pattern of bias cannot be explained simply by a prior for cardinal orientations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our perception of the world around us is biased through prior expectations rather than necessarily reflecting the true state of our environment. Here, we investigate biases in the visual processing of spatial orientation to understand how prior expectations and current sensory information interact to generate a percept. By degrading visual input in various ways, we are able to quantify the extent to which prior experience affects both perceptual judgments and neural responses in the human visual system. We observe systematic biases in the perception of orientation that correlate with the pattern of activity in the primary visual cortex of the human brain. These results indicate that prior expectations influence neural processing right from the earliest stage of the cortical hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The accurate estimation of age using methylation data has proved a useful and heritable biomarker, with acceleration in epigenetic age predicting a number of age-related phenotypes. Measures of white matter integrity in the brain are also heritable and highly sensitive to both normal and pathological aging processes across adulthood. We consider the phenotypic and genetic interrelationships between epigenetic age acceleration and white matter integrity in humans. Our goal was to investigate processes that underlie interindividual variability in age-related changes in the brain. Using blood taken from a Mexican-American extended pedigree sample (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 628; age = 23.28–93.11 years), epigenetic age was estimated using the method developed by Horvath (2013). For &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 376 individuals, diffusion tensor imaging scans were also available. The interrelationship between epigenetic age acceleration and global white matter integrity was investigated with variance decomposition methods. To test for neuroanatomical specificity, 16 specific tracts were additionally considered. We observed negative phenotypic correlations between epigenetic age acceleration and global white matter tract integrity (&lt;sub&gt;pheno&lt;/sub&gt; = –0.119, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.028), with evidence of shared genetic (&lt;sub&gt;gene&lt;/sub&gt; = –0.463, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013) but not environmental influences. Negative phenotypic and genetic correlations with age acceleration were also seen for a number of specific white matter tracts, along with additional negative phenotypic correlations between granulocyte abundance and white matter integrity. These findings (i.e., increased acceleration in epigenetic age in peripheral blood correlates with reduced white matter integrity in the brain and shares common genetic influences) provide a window into the neurobiology of aging processes within the brain and a potential biomarker of normal and pathological brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Epigenetic measures can be used to predict age with a high degree of accuracy and so capture acceleration in biological age, relative to chronological age. The white matter tracts within the brain are also highly sensitive to aging processes. We show that increased biological aging (measured using epigenetic data from blood samples) is correlated with reduced integrity of white matter tracts within the human brain (measured using diffusion tensor imaging) with data from a large sample of Mexican-American families. Given the family design of the sample, we are also able to demonstrate that epigenetic aging and white matter tract integrity also share common genetic influences. Therefore, epigenetic age may be a potential, and accessible, biomarker of brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Strength and Diversity of Inhibitory Signaling Differentiates Primate Anterior Cingulate from Lateral Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4717?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of the primate play distinctive roles in the mediation of complex cognitive tasks. Compared with the LPFC, integration of information by the ACC can span longer timescales and requires stronger engagement of inhibitory processes. Here, we reveal the synaptic mechanism likely to underlie these differences using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; patch-clamp recordings of synaptic events and multiscale imaging of synaptic markers in rhesus monkeys. Although excitatory synaptic signaling does not differ, the level of synaptic inhibition is much higher in ACC than LPFC layer 3 pyramidal neurons, with a significantly higher frequency (~6&lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt;) and longer duration of inhibitory synaptic currents. The number of inhibitory synapses and the ratio of cholecystokinin to parvalbumin-positive inhibitory inputs are also significantly higher in ACC compared with LPFC neurons. Therefore, inhibition is functionally and structurally more robust and diverse in ACC than in LPFC, resulting in a lower excitatory: inhibitory ratio and a greater dynamic range for signal integration and network oscillation by the ACC. These differences in inhibitory circuitry likely underlie the distinctive network dynamics in ACC and LPC during normal and pathological brain states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) play temporally distinct roles during the execution of cognitive tasks (rapid working memory during ongoing tasks and long-term memory to guide future action, respectively). Compared with LPFC-mediated tasks, ACC-mediated tasks can span longer timescales and require stronger engagement of inhibition. This study shows that inhibitory signaling is much more robust and diverse in the ACC than in the LPFC. Therefore, there is a lower excitatory: inhibitory synaptic ratio and a greater dynamic range for signal integration and oscillatory behavior in the ACC. These significant differences in inhibitory synaptic transmission form an important basis for the differential timing of cognitive processing by the LPFC and ACC in normal and pathological brain states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Domain Selectivity in the Parahippocampal Gyrus Is Predicted by the Same Structural Connectivity Patterns in Blind and Sighted Individuals</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4705?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human ventral occipital temporal cortex contains clusters of neurons that show domain-preferring responses during visual perception. Recent studies have reported that some of these clusters show surprisingly similar domain selectivity in congenitally blind participants performing nonvisual tasks. An important open question is whether these functional similarities are driven by similar innate connections in blind and sighted groups. Here we addressed this question focusing on the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), a region that is selective for large objects and scenes. Based on the assumption that patterns of long-range connectivity shape local computation, we examined whether domain selectivity in PHG is driven by similar structural connectivity patterns in the two populations. Multiple regression models were built to predict the selectivity of PHG voxels for large human-made objects from white matter (WM) connectivity patterns in both groups. These models were then tested using independent data from participants with similar visual experience (two sighted groups) and using data from participants with different visual experience (blind and sighted groups). Strikingly, the WM-based predictions between blind and sighted groups were as successful as predictions between two independent sighted groups. That is, the functional selectivity for large objects of a PHG voxel in a blind participant could be accurately predicted by its WM pattern using the connection-to-function model built from the sighted group data, and vice versa. Regions that significantly predicted PHG selectivity were located in temporal and frontal cortices in both sighted and blind populations. These results show that the large-scale network driving domain selectivity in PHG is independent of vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent studies have reported intriguingly similar domain selectivity in sighted and congenitally blind individuals in regions within the ventral visual cortex. To examine whether these similarities originate from similar innate connectional roots, we investigated whether the domain selectivity in one population could be predicted by the structural connectivity pattern of the other. We found that the selectivity for large objects of a PHG voxel in a blind participant could be predicted by its structural connectivity pattern using the connection-to-function model built from the sighted group data, and vice versa. These results reveal that the structural connectivity underlying domain selectivity in the PHG is independent of visual experience, providing evidence for nonvisual representations in this region.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: ST2/IL-33-Dependent Microglial Response Limits Acute Ischemic Brain Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4692?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;ST2, a member of the interleukin (IL) 1 receptor family, and its ligand IL-33 play critical roles in immune regulation and inflammatory responses. This study explores the roles of endogenous IL-33/ST2 signaling in ischemic brain injury and elucidates the underlying mechanisms of action. The expression of IL-33 rapidly increased in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes after 60 min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). ST2 receptor deficiency exacerbated brain infarction 3 d after tMCAO as well as distal permanent MCAO. ST2 deficiency also aggravated neurological deficits up to 7 d after tMCAO. Conversely, intracerebroventricular infusions of IL-33 after tMCAO attenuated brain infarction. Flow cytometry analyses demonstrated high levels of ST2 expression on microglia, and this expression was dramatically enhanced after tMCAO. The absence of ST2 enhanced the expression of M1 polarization markers on microglia/macrophages, and impaired the expression of M2 polarization markers after tMCAO. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies on various types of cultures and coculture systems confirmed that IL-33/ST2 signaling potentiated expression of &lt;i&gt;IL-10&lt;/i&gt; and other M2 genes in primary microglia. The activation of ST2 on microglia led to a protective phenotype that enhanced neuronal survival against oxygen glucose deprivation. Further &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies revealed that IL-33-activated microglia released IL-10, and that this was critical for their neuroprotective effects. Similarly, intracerebroventricular infusions of IL-33 into &lt;i&gt;IL-10&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice failed to provide neuroprotection against tMCAO &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These results shed new light on the IL-33/ST2 axis as an immune regulatory mechanism that serves as a natural brake on the progression of ischemic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This is the first study to identify the function of interleukin (IL) 33/ST2 signaling in poststroke microglial responses and neuroprotection against ischemia. Using two models of ischemic stroke, we demonstrate here that ST2 deficiency shifted microglia/macrophages toward a M1-like phenotype, thereby expanding brain infarcts and exacerbating long-term behavioral deficits after stroke. Using stroke models and various &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; culture and coculture systems, we further characterized a previously undefined mechanism whereby IL-33/ST2 engagement stimulates the production of IL-10 from microglia, which, in turn, enhances neuronal survival upon ischemic challenge. These results shed light on endogenous IL-33/ST2 signaling as a potential immune regulatory mechanism that serves to promote beneficial microglial responses and mitigate ischemic brain injury after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Densin-180 Controls the Trafficking and Signaling of L-Type Voltage-Gated Cav1.2 Ca2+ Channels at Excitatory Synapses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4679?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4679?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Voltage-gated Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 (L-type) Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels regulate neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory. Densin-180 (densin) is an excitatory synaptic protein that promotes Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent facilitation of voltage-gated Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels in transfected cells. Mice lacking densin (densin KO) exhibit defects in synaptic plasticity, spatial memory, and increased anxiety-related behaviors—phenotypes that more closely match those in mice lacking Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 than Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3. Therefore, we investigated the functional impact of densin on Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2. We report that densin is an essential regulator of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 in neurons, but has distinct modulatory effects compared with its regulation of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3. Densin binds to the N-terminal domain of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2, but not that of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.3, and increases Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 currents in transfected cells and in neurons. In transfected cells, densin accelerates the forward trafficking of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 channels without affecting their endocytosis. Consistent with a role for densin in increasing the number of postsynaptic Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 channels, overexpression of densin increases the clustering of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 in dendrites of hippocampal neurons in culture. Compared with wild-type mice, the cell surface levels of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 in the brain, as well as Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 current density and signaling to the nucleus, are reduced in neurons from densin KO mice. We conclude that densin is an essential regulator of neuronal Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1 channels and ensures efficient Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling at excitatory synapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The number and localization of voltage-gated Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels are crucial determinants of neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. We report that the protein densin-180 is highly enriched at excitatory synapses in the brain and enhances the cell surface trafficking and postsynaptic localization of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels in neurons. This interaction promotes coupling of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 channels to activity-dependent gene transcription. Our results reveal a mechanism that may contribute to the roles of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 in regulating cognition and mood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Active Dentate Granule Cells Encode Experience to Promote the Addition of Adult-Born Hippocampal Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4661?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/18/4661?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The continuous addition of new dentate granule cells (DGCs), which is regulated exquisitely by brain activity, renders the hippocampus plastic. However, how neural circuits encode experiences to affect the addition of adult-born neurons remains unknown. Here, we used endoscopic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging to track the real-time activity of individual DGCs in freely behaving mice. For the first time, we found that active DGCs responded to a novel experience by increasing their Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; event frequency preferentially. This elevated activity, which we found to be associated with object exploration, returned to baseline by 1 h in the same environment, but could be dishabituated via introduction to a novel environment. To transition seamlessly between environments, we next established a freely controllable virtual reality system for unrestrained mice. We again observed increased firing of active neurons in a virtual enriched environment. Interestingly, multiple novel virtual experiences increased the number of newborn neurons accumulatively compared with a single experience. Finally, optogenetic silencing of existing DGCs during novel environmental exploration perturbed experience-induced neuronal addition. Our study shows that the adult brain conveys novel, enriched experiences to increase the addition of adult-born hippocampal neurons by increasing the firing of active DGCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Adult brains are constantly reshaping themselves from synapses to circuits as we encounter novel experiences from moment to moment. Importantly, this reshaping includes the addition of newborn hippocampal neurons. However, it remains largely unknown how our circuits encode experience-induced brain activity to govern the addition of new hippocampal neurons. By coupling &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging of dentate granule neurons with a novel, unrestrained virtual reality system for rodents, we discovered that a new experience increased firing of active dentate granule neurons rapidly and robustly. Exploration in multiple novel virtual environments, compared with a single environment, promoted dentate activation and enhanced the addition of new hippocampal neurons accumulatively. Finally, silencing this activation optogenetically during novel experiences perturbed experience-induced neuronal addition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Central and peripheral vision for scene recognition: A neurocomputational modeling exploration. (arXiv:1705.00816v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00816</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00816</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;What are the roles of central and peripheral vision in human scene
recognition? Larson and Loschky (2009) showed that peripheral vision
contributes more than central vision in obtaining maximum scene recognition
accuracy. However, central vision is more efficient for scene recognition than
peripheral, based on the amount of visual area needed for accurate recognition.
In this study, we model and explain the results of Larson and Loschky (2009)
using a neurocomputational modeling approach. We show that the advantage of
peripheral vision in scene recognition, as well as the efficiency advantage for
central vision, can be replicated using state-of-the-art deep neural network
models. In addition, we propose and provide support for the hypothesis that the
peripheral advantage comes from the inherent usefulness of peripheral features.
This result is consistent with data presented by Thibaut, Tran, Szaffarczyk,
and Boucart (2014), who showed that patients with central vision loss can still
categorize natural scenes efficiently. Furthermore, by using a deep
mixture-of-experts model (&quot;The Deep Model,&quot; or TDM) that receives central and
peripheral visual information on separate channels simultaneously, we show that
the peripheral advantage emerges naturally in the learning process: When
trained to categorize scenes, the model weights the peripheral pathway more
than the central pathway. As we have seen in our previous modeling work,
learning creates a transform that spreads different scene categories into
different regions in representational space. Finally, we visualize the features
for the two pathways, and find that different preferences for scene categories
emerge for the two pathways during the training process.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Proposal for an Electron-Transfer Mechanism of Avian Magnetoreception. (arXiv:1705.00735v1 [physics.bio-ph])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00735</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00735</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In spite of many years of research, the mechanism of avian magnetoreception
remains a mystery due to its seemingly insurmountable intricacies. Recently Xie
and colleagues proposed that IscA1 can act as a protein biocompass due to the
measured intrinsic ferromagneticity, and thus named it MagR. However, Meister's
calculations showed that the interaction energy of the magnetic moment of IscA1
with Earth's magnetic field is five magnitudes smaller than thermal fluctuation
at room temperature. The other long-proposed compass protein is cryptochrome
(Cry) with a mechanism of forming singlet-triplet radical pairs. However, this
sensory mechanism still has no inferable information transmission routes. We
propose a magnetoreception mechanism involving both the Cry and IscA1 proteins,
through which photoinduced electrons are transported to redox-regulated ion
channels to provoke neuronal responses. The structural features of the
Cry-IscA1 complex that make it suitable for long-range electron transfer are
discussed and how the magnetic effect leads to neuronal activity is described.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Measuring multivariate redundant information with pointwise common change in surprisal. (arXiv:1602.05063v2 [cs.IT] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05063</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05063</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The problem of how to properly quantify redundant information is an open
question that has been the subject of much recent research. Redundant
information refers to information about a target variable S that is common to
two or more predictor variables Xi. It can be thought of as quantifying
overlapping information content or similarities in the representation of S
between the Xi. We present a new measure of redundancy which measures the
common change in surprisal shared between variables at the local or pointwise
level. We provide a game-theoretic operational definition of unique
information, and use this to derive constraints which are used to obtain a
maximum entropy distribution. Redundancy is then calculated from this maximum
entropy distribution by counting only those local co-information terms which
admit an unambiguous interpretation as redundant information. We show how this
redundancy measure can be used within the framework of the Partial Information
Decomposition (PID) to give an intuitive decomposition of the multivariate
mutual information into redundant, unique and synergistic contributions. We
compare our new measure to existing approaches over a range of example systems,
including continuous Gaussian variables. Matlab code for the measure is
provided, including all considered examples.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the septum of the
telencephalon in man was studied in 15 human brains using the acetylthiocholine
method. Highest activity of AChE was found in the nucleus of the diagonal band
and nucleus accumbens, and lowest in the Lateral nucleus. Comparison of
histochemical results with cellular structure and wi.th the course of fibers
showed absence in man of some of the nuclei described in animals such as the
anterior medial nucleus, triangular nucleus, and marked reduction of the
septo-hippocampal nucleus and fimbriate nucleus. Areas of the septum showing
AChE activity were divided into an anterior and posterior system. The
applicability to man of some neurophysiologic findings in animals is discussed.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The present study reports interesting findings in regard to emotional arousal
based activities while listening to two Hindustani classical ragas of contrast
emotion. EEG data was taken on 5 naive listeners while they listened to two
ragas Bahar and Mia ki Malhar which are conventionally known to portray
contrast emotions. The EEG data were analyzed with the help of two robust non
linear tools viz. Adaptive Fractal Analysis (AFA) and Detrended Fluctuation
Analysis (DFA). A comparative study of the Hurst Exponents obtained from the
two methods have been shown which shows that DFA provides more rigorous results
compared to AFA when it comes to the scaling analysis of biosignal data. The
results and implications have been discussed in detail.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although creativity is encouraged in the abstract it is often discouraged in
educational and workplace settings. Using an agent-based model of cultural
evolution, we investigated the idea that tempering the novelty-generating
effects of creativity with the novelty-preserving effects of imitation is
beneficial for society. In Experiment One we systematically introduced
individual differences in creativity, and observed a trade-off between the
ratio of creators to imitators, and how creative the creators were. Excess
creativity was detrimental because creators invested in unproven ideas at the
expense of propagating proven ones. Experiment Two tested the hypothesis that
society as a whole benefits if individuals adjust how creative they are in
accordance with their creative success. When effective creators created more,
and ineffective creators created less (social regulation), the agents
segregated into creators and imitators, and the mean fitness of outputs was
temporarily higher. We hypothesized that the temporary nature of the effect was
due to a ceiling on output fitness. In Experiment Three we made the space of
possible outputs open-ended by giving agents the capacity to chain simple
outputs into arbitrarily complex ones such that fitter outputs were always
possible. With the capacity for chained outputs, the effect of social
regulation could indeed be maintained indefinitely. The results are discussed
in light of empirical data.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a logical proof that computing machines, and by extension physical
systems, can never be certain if they possess conscious awareness. This implies
that human consciousness is associated with a violation of energy conservation.
We examine the significance that a particular interpretation of quantum
mechanics, known as single mind Q (Barrett 1999), might have for the detection
of such a violation. Finally we apply single mind Q to the problem of free will
as it arises in some celebrated experiments by the neurophysiologist Benjamin
Libet.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although brain circuits presumably carry out useful perceptual algorithms,
few instances of derived biological methods have been found to compete
favorably against algorithms that have been engineered for specific
applications. We forward a novel analysis of function of cortico-striatal
loops, which constitute more than 80% of the human brain, thus likely
underlying a broad range of cognitive functions. We describe a family of
operations performed by the derived method, including a nonstandard method for
supervised classification, which may underlie some forms of
cortically-dependent associative learning. The novel supervised classifier is
compared against widely-used algorithms for classification, including support
vector machines (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor methods, achieving corresponding
classification rates --- at a fraction of the time and space costs. This
represents an instance of a biologically-derived algorithm comparing favorably
against widely used machine learning methods on well-studied tasks.

	<description>Electroencephalography (EEG) allows recording of cortical activity at high temporal resolution. EEG recordings can be summarised along different dimensions using network-level quantitative measures, e.g. channel-to-channel correlation, or band power distributions across channels. These reveal network patterns that unfold over a range of different time scales and can be tracked dynamically. Here we describe the dynamics of network-state transitions in EEG recordings of spontaneous brain activity in normally developing infants and infants with severe early infantile epileptic encephalopathies (n=8, age: 1-8 months). We describe differences in measures of EEG dynamics derived from band power, and correlation-based summaries of network-wide brain activity. We further show that EEGs from different patient groups and controls can be distinguished based on a small set of the novel quantitative measures introduced here, which describe dynamic network state switching. Quantitative measures related to the smoothness of switching from one correlation pattern to another show the largest differences between groups. These findings reveal that the early epileptic encephalopathies are associated with characteristic dynamic features at the network level. Quantitative network-based analyses like the one presented here may in future inform the clinical use of quantitative EEG for diagnosis.</description>

	<description>N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are expressed widely throughout the human cortex. Yet disturbances in NMDAR transmission - as implicated in patients with schizophrenia or pharmacologically induced - can cause a regionally specific set of electrophysiological effects. Here, we present a double-blind placebo-controlled study of the effects of the NMDAR blocker ketamine in human volunteers. We employ a marker of auditory learning and putative synaptic plasticity - the mismatch negativity - in a roving auditory oddball paradigm. Using recent advances in Bayesian modelling of group effects in dynamic causal modelling, we fit biophysically plausible network models of the auditory processing hierarchy to whole-scalp evoked response potential recordings. This allowed us to identify the regionally specific effects of ketamine in a distributed network of interacting cortical sources. Under placebo, our analysis replicated previous findings regarding the effects of stimulus repetition and deviance on connectivity within the auditory hierarchy. Crucially, we show that the effect of ketamine is best explained as a selective change in intrinsic inhibition, with a pronounced ketamine-induced reduction of inhibitory interneuron connectivity in frontal sources. These results are consistent with findings from invasive recordings in animal models exposed to NMDAR blockers, and provide evidence that inhibitory-interneuron specific NMDAR dysfunction may be sufficient to explain electrophysiological abnormalities of sensory learning induced by ketamine in human subjects.</description>

	<description>Tissue-specific reverse engineering of transcriptional networks has led to groundbreaking discoveries uncovering underlying regulators of cellular networks in various diseases. However, whether these approaches can be applied to complex psychiatric diseases is largely explored, partly due to the general lack of appropriate cellular models for mental disorders. In this study, using a recently published high quality RNA-seq data on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 307 Schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and 245 controls, we deconvoluted the transcriptional network aiming at the identification of master regulators mediating expression of a large body of genes. Together with an independent RNA-seq data on cultured primary neuronal cells derived from olfactory neuroepithelium from a cohort of 143 SCZ cases and 112 controls, we identified five candidate master regulators (MRs), including TCF4, NR1H2, HDAC9, ZNF10, and ZNF436. TCF4 was previously identified as a SCZ susceptibility gene, but its regulatory subnetworks had been elusive. Other genes have not been convincingly associated with SCZ in previous studies. Additional analysis of predicted transcription factor binding site, ChIP-Seq data and ATAC-Seq data confirmed many predicted regulatory targets by the identified MRs. Our study uncovered a few candidate master regulators for SCZ that affects a collection of genes, and these master regulators may serve as therapeutic targets for intervention.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks: A Better Model Of Biological Object Recognition Under Occlusion</title>

	<description>Feedforward neural networks provide the dominant model of how the brain performs visual object recognition. However, these networks lack the lateral and feedback connections, and the resulting recurrent neuronal dynamics, of the ventral visual pathway in the human and nonhuman primate brain. Here we investigate recurrent convolutional neural networks with bottom-up (B), lateral (L), and top-down (T) connections. Combining these types of connections yields four architectures (B, BT, BL, and BLT), which we systematically test and compare. We hypothesized that recurrent dynamics might improve recognition performance in the challenging scenario of partial occlusion. We introduce two novel occluded object recognition tasks to test the efficacy of the models, digit clutter (where multiple target digits occlude one another) and digit debris (where target digits are occluded by digit fragments). We find that recurrent neural networks outperform feedforward control models (approximately matched in parametric complexity) at recognising objects, both in the absence of occlusion and in all occlusion conditions. Recurrent neural networks are not only more neurobiologically plausible in their architecture; their dynamics also afford superior task performance. This work shows that computer vision can benefit from using recurrent convolutional architectures and suggests that the ubiquitous recurrent connections in biological brains are essential for task performance.</description>

	<description>Patients with brain lesions provide a unique opportunity to understand the functioning of the human mind. However, brain lesions, even when focal, have local and remote effects impacting functionally and structurally connected circuits. Here we deliver for the first time a set of complementary solutions to measure the consequences of a given lesion upon the affected circuits. Our methods were applied to 37 patients with a focal brain lesion, revealing a large set of disconnected brain regions, which significantly impacted category fluency performance. These regions corresponded to areas that are classically considered as functionally engaged in verbal fluency and categorization tasks. These areas were organized into large functional networks, including the left ventral fronto-parietal network, whose cortical thickness proportionally decreased with performance on category fluency. Hence, the methods presented here reveal the remote effects of brain lesions, provide for the identification of the affected networks, and strengthen understanding of their relationship with cognitive and behavioural measures.</description>

	<description>Percepts and words can be decoded from largely distributed neural activity measures. The existence of widespread representations might, however, conflict with the fundamental notions of hierarchical processing and efficient coding. Using fMRI and MEG during syllable identification, we first show that sensory and decisional activity co-localize to a restricted part of the posterior superior temporal cortex. Next, using intracortical recordings we demonstrate that early and focal neural activity in this region distinguishes correct from incorrect decisions and can be machine-decoded to classify syllables. Crucially, significant machine-decoding was possible from neuronal activity sampled across widespread regions, despite weak or absent sensory or decision-related responses. These findings show that a complex behavior like speech sound categorization relies on an efficient readout of focal neural activity, while distributed activity, although decodable by machine-learning, reflects collateral processes of sensory perception and decision.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Hebbian Learning in a Random Network Captures Selectivity Properties of Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/133025v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Complex cognitive behaviors, such as context-switching and rule-following, are thought to be supported by prefrontal cortex (PFC). Neural activity in PFC must thus be specialized to specific tasks while retaining flexibility. Nonlinear 'mixed' selectivity is an important neurophysiological trait for enabling complex and context-dependent behaviors. Here we investigate (1) the extent to which PFC exhibits computationally-relevant properties such as mixed selectivity and (2) how such properties could arise via circuit mechanisms. We show that PFC cells recorded during a complex task show a moderate level of specialization and structure that is not replicated by a model wherein cells receive random feedforward inputs. While random connectivity can be effective at generating mixed selectivity, the data shows significantly more mixed selectivity than predicted by a model with otherwise matched parameters. A simple Hebbian learning rule applied to the random connectivity, however, increases mixed selectivity and allows the model to match the data more accurately. To explain how learning achieves this, we provide analysis along with a clear geometric interpretation of the impact of learning on selectivity. After learning, the model also matches the data on measures of noise, response density, clustering, and the distribution of selectivities. Of two styles of Hebbian learning tested, the simpler and more biologically plausible option better matches the data. These modeling results give intuition about how neural properties important for cognition can arise in a circuit and make clear experimental predictions regarding how various measures of selectivity would evolve during animal training.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A unified internal model theory to resolve the paradox of active versus passive self-motion sensation</title>

	<description>Brainstem and cerebellar neurons implement an internal model to accurately estimate self-motion during externally-generated ( passive) movements. However, these neurons show reduced responses during self-generated ( active) movements, indicating that the brain computes the predicted sensory consequences of motor commands in order to cancel sensory signals. Remarkably, the computational processes underlying sensory prediction during active motion and their relationship to internal model computations established during passive movements remain unknown. Here we construct a Kalman filter that incorporates motor commands into a previously-established model of optimal passive self-motion estimation. We find that the simulated sensory error and feedback signals match experimentally measured neuronal response during active and passive head and trunk rotations and translations. We conclude that a single internal model of head motion can process motor commands and sensory afferent signals optimally, and we describe how previously identified neural responses in the brainstem and cerebellum may represent distinct nodes in these computations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Extracting Saccades From Eye Movements Triggered By Reflex Blinks</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/132605v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The trigeminal blink reflex can be evoked by delivering an air puff to the eye. If timed appropriately, e.g., during motor preparation, the small, loopy blink-related eye movement (BREM) associated with eyelid closure disinhibits the saccadic system and reduces the reaction time of planned eye movements. The BREM and intended eye movement overlap temporally, thus a mathematical formulation is required to objectively extract saccade features - onset time and velocity profile - from the combined movement. While it has been assumed that the interactions are nonlinear, we show that blink-triggered movements can be modeled as a linear combination of a typical BREM and a normal saccade, crucially, with an imposed delay between the two components. Saccades reconstructed with this approach are largely similar to control movements in their temporal and spatial profiles. Furthermore, activity profiles of saccade-related bursts in superior colliculus neurons for the recovered saccades closely match those for normal saccades. Thus, blink perturbations, if properly accounted for, offer a non-invasive tool to probe the behavioral and neural signatures of sensory-to-motor transformations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Population Temporal Structure Supplements The Rate Code During Sensorimotor Transformations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/132514v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/132514v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>In order to successfully interact with the environment the brain must funnel down the sensory inputs it receives to specific movements at specific times. Such sensory-to-motor transformations are critically mediated by neurons in premotor brain networks whose evolving activities represent sensory, cognitive, and movement-related information1-3. However, this multiplexing poses a conundrum - how does a decoder know precisely when to initiate a movement if such neurons are also active at times other than when a movement occurs (e.g., in response to sensory stimulation)? Extant models of movement generation that rely on firing rate, including rise-to-threshold4, inhibitory gating5, and dynamical switches at the population level6,7, leave certain explanatory gaps unfilled. Here, we propose a novel hypothesis: movement is triggered not only by an increase in firing rate, but critically by a reliable temporal pattern in the population response. We show that in brain regions involved in orienting eye movements - the superior colliculus (SC) and the frontal eye fields (FEF) - the temporal dynamics between neurons during visually-driven activity is different from that during pre-movement activation. Specifically, using a measure that captures the fidelity of the population code - here called temporal stability - we show that the temporal structure fluctuates in the visual response but remains stable during the pre-movement response, thus distinguishing incoming sensory input from motor output. This is an important attribute because SC and FEF &quot;visuomovement&quot; neurons project directly to the brainstem8,9 which houses the controller for gaze shifts, and any increase in the incoming drive is poised to trigger a (potentially undesirable) gaze shift. We also demonstrate that a simple firing rate-based network with synaptic facilitation can distinguish between stable and fluctuating population codes, suggesting a putative mechanism for interpreting temporal structure. These findings offer an alternative perspective on the relationship between spatial attention and motor preparation10,11 by situating the correlates of movement initiation in the temporal features of activity in shared neural substrates. They also suggest a need to look beyond the instantaneous rate code and consider the effects of short-term population history on neuronal communication and its effects on behaviour.</description>

Multi-regional sequencing provides new opportunities to investigate genetic heterogeneity within or between common tumors from an evolutionary perspective. Several state-of-the-art methods have been proposed for reconstructing cancer evolutionary trees based on multi-regional sequencing data to develop models of cancer evolution. However, there have been few studies on comparisons of a set of cancer evolutionary trees. We propose a clustering method (phyC) for cancer evolutionary trees, in which sub-groups of the trees are identified based on topology and edge length attributes. For interpretation, we also propose a method for evaluating the sub-clonal diversity of trees in the clusters, which provides insight into the acceleration of sub-clonal expansion. Simulation showed that the proposed method can detect true clusters with sufficient accuracy. Application of the method to actual multi-regional sequencing data of clear cell renal carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer allowed for the detection of clusters related to cancer type or phenotype. phyC is implemented with R(≥3.2.2) and is available from https://github.com/ymatts/phyC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4SZEZkHIn9o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Slow diffusive dynamics in a chaotic balanced neural network</title>

It has been proposed that neural noise in the cortex arises from chaotic dynamics in the balanced state: in this model of cortical dynamics, the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to each neuron approximately cancel, and activity is driven by fluctuations of the synaptic inputs around their mean. It remains unclear whether neural networks in the balanced state can perform tasks that are highly sensitive to noise, such as storage of continuous parameters in working memory, while also accounting for the irregular behavior of single neurons. Here we show that continuous parameter working memory can be maintained in the balanced state, in a neural circuit with a simple network architecture. We show analytically that in the limit of an infinite network, the dynamics generated by this architecture are characterized by a continuous set of steady balanced states, allowing for the indefinite storage of a continuous parameter. In finite networks, we show that the chaotic noise drives diffusive motion along the approximate attractor, which gradually degrades the stored memory. We analyze the dynamics and show that the slow diffusive motion induces slowly decaying temporal cross correlations in the activity, which differ substantially from those previously described in the balanced state. We calculate the diffusivity, and show that it is inversely proportional to the system size. For large enough (but realistic) neural population sizes, and with suitable tuning of the network connections, the proposed balanced network can sustain continuous parameter values in memory over time scales larger by several orders of magnitude than the single neuron time scale.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dmVRgyMxy0k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) add a further layer of complexity to the proteome and regulate a wide range of cellular protein functions. With the increasing number of known PTM sites, it becomes imperative to understand their functional interplays. In this study, we proposed a novel analytical strategy to explore functional relationships between PTM sites by testing their tendency to be modified together (co-occurrence) under the same condition, and applied it to proteome-wide human phosphorylation data collected under 88 different laboratory or physiological conditions. Co-occurring phosphorylation occurs significantly more frequently than randomly expected and include many known examples of cross-talk or functional connections. Such pairs, either within the same phosphoprotein or between interacting partners, are more likely to be in sequence or structural proximity, be phosphorylated by the same kinases, participate in similar biological processes, and show residue co-evolution across vertebrates. In addition, we also found that their co-occurrence states tend to be conserved in orthologous phosphosites in the mouse proteome. Together, our results support that the co-occurring phosphorylation are functionally associated. Comparison with existing methods further suggests that co-occurrence analysis can be a useful complement to uncover novel functional associations between PTM sites.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e4mrR2lHnOw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Using a DNA polymerase to record intracellular calcium levels has been proposed as a novel neural recording technique, promising massive-scale, single-cell resolution monitoring of large portions of the brain. This technique relies on local storage of neural activity in strands of DNA, followed by offline analysis of that DNA. In simple implementations of this scheme, the time when each nucleotide was written cannot be determined directly by &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt; DNA sequencing; the timing data must be estimated instead. Here, we use a Dynamic Time Warping-based algorithm to perform this estimation, exploiting correlations between neural activity and observed experimental variables to translate DNA-based signals to an estimate of neural activity over time. This algorithm improves the parallelizability of traditional Dynamic Time Warping, allowing several-fold increases in computation speed. The algorithm also provides a solution to several critical problems with the molecular recording paradigm: determining recording start times and coping with DNA polymerase pausing. The algorithm can generally locate DNA-based records to within &amp;lt;10% of a recording window, allowing for the estimation of unobserved incorporation times and latent neural tunings. We apply our technique to an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; motor control neuroscience experiment, using the algorithm to estimate both timings of DNA-based data and the directional tuning of motor cortical cells during a center-out reaching task. We also use this algorithm to explore the impact of polymerase characteristics on system performance, determining the precision of a molecular recorder as a function of its kinetic and error-generating properties. We find useful ranges of properties for DNA polymerase-based recorders, providing guidance for future protein engineering attempts. This work demonstrates a useful general extension to dynamic alignment algorithms, as well as direct applications of that extension toward the development of molecular recorders, providing a necessary stepping stone for future biological work.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tGLlsv46H7c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The right tool for the right question --- beyond the encoding versus decoding dichotomy. (arXiv:1704.08851v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08851</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There are two major questions that neuroimaging studies attempt to answer:
First, how are sensory stimuli represented in the brain (which we term the
stimulus-based setting)? And, second, how does the brain generate cognition
(termed the response-based setting)? There has been a lively debate in the
neuroimaging community whether encoding and decoding models can provide
insights into these questions. In this commentary, we construct two simple and
analytically tractable examples to demonstrate that while an encoding model
analysis helps with the former, neither model is appropriate to satisfactorily
answer the latter question. Consequently, we argue that if we want to
understand how the brain generates cognition, we need to move beyond the
encoding versus decoding dichotomy and instead discuss and develop tools that
are specifically tailored to our endeavour.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02703</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Experimental records of active bundle motility are used to demonstrate the
presence of a low-dimensional chaotic attractor in hair cell dynamics.
Dimensionality tests from dynamic systems theory are applied to estimate the
number of independent variables sufficient for modeling the hair cell response.
Poincare maps are constructed to observe a quasiperiodic transition from chaos
to order with increasing amplitudes of mechanical forcing. The onset of this
transition is accompanied by a reduction of Kolmogorov entropy in the system
and an increase in mutual information between the stimulus and the hair bundle,
indicative of signal detection. A simple theoretical model is used to describe
the observed chaotic dynamics. The model exhibits an enhancement of sensitivity
to weak stimuli when the system is poised in the chaotic regime. We propose
that chaos may play a role in the hair cell's ability to detect low-amplitude
sounds.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Morphine selectively promotes glutamate release from glutamatergic terminals of projection neurons from medial prefrontal cortex to dopamine neurons of ventral tegmental area</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/133090v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/133090v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Recently, we found that morphine promoted presynaptic glutamate release of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which constituted the main mechanism for morphine-induced increase in VTA-DA neuron firing and related behaviors (Chen et al., 2015). However, what source of presynaptic glutamate release of DA neurons in the VTA is promoted by morphine remains unknown. To address this question, we used optogenetic strategy to selectively activate glutamatergic inputs from different projection neurons and then observed the effect of morphine on them. The result shows that morphine promotes glutamate release from glutamatergic terminals of projection neurons from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to VTA DA neurons, but has no effect on that from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) or the lateral hypothalamus (LH) to VTA DA neurons, and the inhibition of glutamatergic projection neurons from the mPFC to the VTA significantly reduces morphine-induced increase in locomotor activity of mice.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Long-Lasting Contribution Of Dopamine In The Nucleus Accumbens Core, But Not Dorsal Lateral Striatum, To Sign-Tracking</title>

	<description>The attribution of incentive salience to reward-paired cues is dependent on dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core. These dopamine signals conform to traditional reward-prediction error signals and have been shown to diminish with time. Here we examined if the diminishing dopamine signal in the nucleus accumbens core has functional implications for the expression of sign-tracking, a Pavlovian conditioned response indicative of the attribution of incentive salience to reward-paired cues. Food-restricted male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained in a Pavlovian paradigm in which an insertable lever predicted delivery of food reward in a nearby food cup. After 7 or 14 training sessions, rats received infusions of saline, the dopamine antagonist flupenthixol (100 mM), or the GABA agonists baclofen and muscimol (0.5 mM baclofen/0.05 mM muscimol) into the nucleus accumbens core or the dorsal lateral striatum. Dopamine antagonism within the nucleus accumbens core attenuated sign-tracking, whereas reversible inactivation did not affect sign-tracking but increased non-specific food cup checking behaviors. Neither drug in the dorsal lateral striatum affected sign-tracking behavior. Critically, extended training did not alter these effects. Though extended experience with an incentive stimulus may reduce cue-evoked dopamine in the nucleus accumbens core, this does not alter the function of dopamine in this region to promote Pavlovian cue approach nor result in the recruitment of dorsal lateral striatal systems for this behavior. These data support the notion that dopamine within the mesoaccumbal system, but not the nigrostriatal system, contributes critically to incentive motivational processes independent of the length of training.</description>

	<description>Alzheimer disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The World Health Organization predicted that the world population with AD will rise to about 75 million by 2030. Therefore, AD and other forms of dementia create a non-curable disease population, and a socioeconomic burden in world societies. It is imperative to diagnose AD and other neurodegenerative diseases at their early stage. Consequently, to develop a blood-based biomarker is important so that the remedial or disease-altering therapeutical intervention for AD patients would be available at early stage of the disease. We have identified an easy, feasible, cost-effective, and less invasive assay method that measures a cellular protein that may be a potential biomarker candidate for the neurodegenerative diseases; platelet phosphorylated Transactive Response DNA Binding Protein 43 (pTDP-43). This protein recently gained an attention that can be served for monitoring the development of at least two neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., AD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS). We have identified an assay platform and generated some preliminary data may suggest that the platelet TDP-43 that were increased (&amp;lt;65%) in post-mortem AD brain regions and similar trends were also observed in AD patient platelet. In this study, we propose that platelet phosphorylated form of TDP-43 could be used as a potential surrogate biomarker that is easy to measure, reproducible, sensitive, and cost effective for screening the patients with some early clinical signs of AD and can be used to monitor disease prognosis.</description>

	<description>If the brain abstractly represents probability distributions as knowledge, then the modality of a decision, e.g. movement vs perception, should not matter. If on the other hand, learned representations are policies, they may be specific to the task where learning takes place. Here, we test this by asking if a learned spatial prior generalizes from a sensorimotor estimation task to a two-alternative-forced choice (2-Afc) perceptual comparison task. A model and simulation-based analysis revealed that while subjects learn the experimentally-imposed prior distribution in the sensorimotor estimation task, measured priors are consistently broader than expected in the 2-Afc task. That the prior does not fully generalize suggests that sensorimotor priors strongly resemble policies. In disagreement with standard Bayesian thought, the modality of the decision has a strong influence on the implied prior distributions.</description>

	<description>Our 2015 paper (Richiardi et al., 2015), showed that transcriptional similarity of gene expression level is higher than expected by chance within functional brain networks (defined by functional magnetic resonance imaging), a relationship that is driven by around 140 genes. These results were replicated in vivo in adolescents, where we showed that SNPs of these genes where associated above chance with in-vivo fMRI connectivity, and in the mouse, where mouse orthologs of our genes showed above- chance association with meso-scale axonal connectivity. This paper has received a commentary on biorXiv (Pantazatos and Li, 2016), making several claims about our results and methods, mainly pointing out that Euclidean distance explains our results ( ...high within-network SF is entirely attributable to proximity and is unrelated to functional brain networks...). Here we address these claims and their weaknesses, and show that our original results stand, contrary to the claims made in the commentary.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: In Utero Diffusion Tensor Imaging Of The Fetal Brain: A Reproducibility Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/132704v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/132704v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Our purpose was to evaluate the within-subject reproducibility of in utero diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics and the visibility of major white matter structures. Images for 30 fetuses (20-33. postmenstrual weeks, normal neurodevelopment: 6 cases, cerebral pathology: 24 cases) were acquired on 1.5T or 3.0T MRI. DTI with 15 diffusion-weighting directions was repeated three times for each case, TR/TE: 2200/63 ms, voxel size: 1*1 mm, slice thickness: 3-5 mm, b-factor: 700 s/mm2. Reproducibility was evaluated from structure detectability, variability of DTI measures using the coefficient of variation (CV), image correlation and structural similarity across repeated scans for six selected structures. The effect of age, scanner type, presence of pathology was determined using Wilcoxon rank sum test. White matter structures were detectable in the following percentage of fetuses in at least two of the three repeated scans: corpus callosum genu 76%, splenium 64%, internal capsule, posterior limb 60%, brainstem fibers 40% and temporooccipital association pathways 60%. The mean CV of DTI metrics ranged between 3% and 14.6% and we measured higher reproducibility in fetuses with normal brain development. Head motion was negatively correlated with reproducibility, this effect was partially ameliorated by motion-correction algorithm using image registration. Structures on 3.0 T had higher variability both with- and without motion correction. Fetal DTI is reproducible for projection and commissural bundles during mid-gestation, however, in 16-30% of the cases, data were corrupted by artifacts, resulting in impaired detection of white matter structures. To achieve robust results for the quantitative analysis of diffusivity and anisotropy values, fetal-specific image processing is recommended and repeated DTI is needed to ensure the detectability of fiber pathways.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Identification Of Cellular-Activity Dynamics Across Large Tissue Volumes In The Mammalian Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/132688v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/132688v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Tracking the coordinated activity of cellular events through volumes of intact tissue is a major challenge in biology that has inspired significant technological innovation. Yet scanless measurement of the high-speed activity of individual neurons across three dimensions in scattering mammalian tissue remains an open problem. Here we develop and validate a computational imaging approach (SWIFT) that integrates high-dimensional, structured statistics with light field microscopy to allow the synchronous acquisition of single-neuron resolution activity throughout intact tissue volumes as fast as a camera can capture images (currently up to 100 Hz at full camera resolution), attaining rates needed to keep pace with emerging fast calcium and voltage sensors. We demonstrate that this large field-of-view, single-snapshot volume acquisition method -- which requires only a simple and inexpensive modification to a standard fluorescence microscope -- enables scanless capture of coordinated activity patterns throughout mammalian neural volumes. Further, the volumetric nature of SWIFT also allows fast in vivo imaging, motion correction, and cell identification throughout curved subcortical structures like the dorsal hippocampus, where cellular-resolution dynamics spanning hippocampal subfields can be simultaneously observed during a virtual context learning task in a behaving animal. SWIFT's ability to rapidly and easily record from volumes of many cells across layers opens the door to widespread identification of dynamical motifs and timing dependencies among coordinated cell assemblies during adaptive, modulated, or maladaptive physiological processes in neural systems.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Perceptual Expectations Do Not Modulate Image Repetition Effects As Measured By Event-Related Potentials</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/132621v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Repeated stimulus presentation leads to complex changes in cortical neuron response properties, commonly known as repetition suppression or stimulus-specific adaptation. Circuit-based models of repetition suppression provide a framework for investigating patterns of repetition effects that propagate through cortical hierarchies. To further develop such models it is critical to determine whether (and if so, when) repetition effects are modulated by top-down influences, such as those related to perceptual expectation. We investigated this by presenting pairs of repeated and alternating face images, and orthogonally manipulating expectations regarding the likelihood of stimulus repetition. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from n=39 healthy adults, to map the spatiotemporal progression of stimulus repetition and expectation effects, and interactions between these factors, using mass univariate analyses. We also tested whether the ability to predict unrepeated (compared to repeated) face identities could influence the magnitude of observed repetition effects, by presenting separate blocks with predictable and unpredictable alternating faces. Multiple repetition and expectation effects were identified between 99-800ms from stimulus onset, which did not statistically interact at any point. Repetition effects in blocks with predictable alternating faces were smaller than in unpredictable alternating face blocks between 117-179ms and 506-652ms, and larger between 246-428ms. ERP repetition effects appear not to be modulated by perceptual expectations, supporting separate mechanisms for repetition and expectation suppression. However, previous studies that aimed to test for repetition effects, in which the repeated (but not unrepeated) stimulus was predictable, are likely to have conflated repetition and stimulus predictability effects.</description>

	<description>We demonstrate a holographic system for simultaneous three-dimensional (3D) two-photon stimulation and imaging of neural activity in the mouse neocortex in vivo with cellular resolution. Dual two-photon excitation paths are implemented with independent 3D targeting for calcium imaging and precision optogenetics. We validate the usefulness of the microscope by photoactivating local pools of interneurons in awake mice visual cortex in 3D, which suppress the nearby pyramidal neurons' response to visual stimuli.</description>

	<description>We have developed a oblique version of the light sheet microscope to do volumetric imaging of the whole brains at high spatial resolution. Tissue clearing using aqueous techniques reduces the structural rigidity of the brain, To overcome this, we developed a gelatin based re-embedding procedure that makes the brain rigid enough to be sectioned. A few examples of whole brain volumetric images are shown using the oblique light sheet tomography.</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Evolution of moments and correlations in non-renewal escape-time processes. (arXiv:1704.08669v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08669</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The theoretical description of non-renewal stochastic systems is a challenge.
Analytical results are often not available or can only be obtained under strong
conditions, limiting their applicability. Also, numerical results have mostly
been obtained by ad-hoc Monte--Carlo simulations, which are usually
computationally expensive when a high degree of accuracy is needed. To gain
quantitative insight into these systems under general conditions, we here
introduce a numerical iterated first-passage time approach based on solving the
time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) to describe the statistics of
non-renewal stochastic systems. We illustrate the approach using
spike-triggered neuronal adaptation in the leaky and perfect integrate-and-fire
model, respectively. The transition to stationarity of first-passage time
moments and their sequential correlations occur on a non-trivial timescale that
depends on all system parameters. Surprisingly this is so for both single
exponential and scale-free power-law adaptation. The method works beyond the
small noise and timescale separation approximations. It shows excellent
agreement with direct Monte Carlo simulations, which allows for the computation
of transient and stationary distributions. We compare different methods to
compute the evolution of the moments and serial correlation coefficients (SCC),
and discuss the challenge of reliably computing the SCC which we find to be
very sensitive to numerical inaccuracies for both the leaky and perfect
integrate-and-fire models. In conclusion, our methods provide a general picture
of non-renewal dynamics in a wide range of stochastic systems exhibiting short
and long-range correlations.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The analysis of observed time series from nonlinear systems is usually done
by making a time-delay reconstruction to unfold the dynamics on a
multi-dimensional state space. An important aspect of the analysis is the
choice of the correct embedding dimension. The conventional procedure used for
this is either the method of false nearest neighbors or the saturation of some
invariant measure, such as, correlation dimension. Here we examine this issue
from a complex network perspective and propose a recurrence network based
measure to determine the acceptable minimum embedding dimension to be used for
such analysis. The measure proposed here is based on the well known
Kullback-Leibler divergence commonly used in information theory. We show that
the measure is simple and direct to compute and give accurate result for short
time series. To show the significance of the measure in the analysis of
practical data, we present the analysis of two EEG signals as examples.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: How the connectivity structure of neuronal networks influences responses to oscillatory stimuli. (arXiv:1704.08372v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08372</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Propagation of oscillatory signals through the cortex and coherence is shaped
by the connectivity structure of neuronal circuits. This study systematically
investigates the network and stimulus properties that shape network responses.
The results show how input to a cortical column model of the primary visual
cortex excites dynamical modes determined by the laminar pattern. Stimulating
the inhibitory neurons in the upper layer reproduces experimentally observed
resonances at gamma frequency whose origin can be traced back to two anatomical
sub-circuits. We develop this result systematically: Initially, we highlight
the effect of stimulus amplitude and filter properties of the neurons on their
response to oscillatory stimuli. Subsequently, we analyze the amplification of
oscillatory stimuli by the effective network structure. We demonstrate that the
amplification of stimuli, as well as their visibility in different populations,
can be explained by specific network patterns. Inspired by experimental results
we ask whether the anatomical origin of oscillations can be inferred by
applying oscillatory stimuli. We find that different network motifs can
generate similar responses to oscillatory input, showing that resonances in the
network response cannot, straightforwardly, be assigned to the motifs they
emerge from. Applying the analysis to a spiking model of a cortical column, we
characterize how the dynamic mode structure, which is induced by the laminar
connectivity, processes external input. In particular, we show that a stimulus
applied to specific populations typically elicits responses of several
interacting modes. The resulting network response is therefore composed of a
multitude of contributions and can therefore neither be assigned to a single
mode nor do the observed resonances necessarily coincide with the intrinsic
resonances of the circuit.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08306</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Information in neural networks is represented as weighted connections, or
synapses, between neurons. This poses a problem as the primary computational
bottleneck for neural networks is the vector-matrix multiply when inputs are
multiplied by the neural network weights. Conventional processing architectures
are not well suited for simulating neural networks, often requiring large
amounts of energy and time. Additionally, synapses in biological neural
networks are not binary connections, but exhibit a nonlinear response function
as neurotransmitters are emitted and diffuse between neurons. Inspired by
neuroscience principles, we present a digital neuromorphic architecture, the
Spiking Temporal Processing Unit (STPU), capable of modeling arbitrary complex
synaptic response functions without requiring additional hardware components.
We consider the paradigm of spiking neurons with temporally coded information
as opposed to non-spiking rate coded neurons used in most neural networks. In
this paradigm we examine liquid state machines applied to speech recognition
and show how a liquid state machine with temporal dynamics maps onto the
STPU-demonstrating the flexibility and efficiency of the STPU for instantiating
neural algorithms.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Continuous parameter working memory in a balanced chaotic neural network. (arXiv:1508.06944v4 [cond-mat.dis-nn] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06944</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06944</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been proposed that neural noise in the cortex arises from chaotic
dynamics in the balanced state: in this model of cortical dynamics, the
excitatory and inhibitory inputs to each neuron approximately cancel, and
activity is driven by fluctuations of the synaptic inputs around their mean. It
remains unclear whether neural networks in the balanced state can perform tasks
that are highly sensitive to noise, such as storage of continuous parameters in
working memory, while also accounting for the irregular behavior of single
neurons. Here we show that continuous parameter working memory can be
maintained in the balanced state, in a neural circuit with a simple network
architecture. We show analytically that in the limit of an infinite network,
the dynamics generated by this architecture are characterized by a continuous
set of steady balanced states, allowing for the indefinite storage of a
continuous parameter. In finite networks, we show that the chaotic noise drives
diffusive motion along the approximate attractor, which gradually degrades the
stored memory. We analyze the dynamics and show that the slow diffusive motion
induces slowly decaying temporal cross correlations in the activity, which
differ substantially from those previously described in the balanced state. We
calculate the diffusivity, and show that it is inversely proportional to the
system size. For large enough (but realistic) neural population sizes, and with
suitable tuning of the network connections, the proposed balanced network can
sustain continuous parameter values in memory over time scales larger by
several orders of magnitude than the single neuron time scale.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: When do correlations increase with firing rates in recurrent networks?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005506</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea K. Barreiro, Cheng Ly&lt;/p&gt;

A central question in neuroscience is to understand how noisy firing patterns are used to transmit information. Because neural spiking is noisy, spiking patterns are often quantified via pairwise correlations, or the probability that two cells will spike coincidentally, above and beyond their baseline firing rate. One observation frequently made in experiments, is that correlations can increase systematically with firing rate. Theoretical studies have determined that stimulus-dependent correlations that increase with firing rate can have beneficial effects on information coding; however, we still have an incomplete understanding of what circuit mechanisms do, or do not, produce this correlation-firing rate relationship. Here, we studied the relationship between pairwise correlations and firing rates in recurrently coupled excitatory-inhibitory spiking networks with conductance-based synapses. We found that with stronger excitatory coupling, a positive relationship emerged between pairwise correlations and firing rates. To explain these findings, we used linear response theory to predict the full correlation matrix and to decompose correlations in terms of graph motifs. We then used this decomposition to explain why covariation of correlations with firing rate—a relationship previously explained in feedforward networks driven by correlated input—emerges in some recurrent networks but not in others. Furthermore, when correlations covary with firing rate, this relationship is reflected in low-rank structure in the correlation matrix.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ikUdtITg91g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Two species with similar resource requirements respond in a characteristic way to variations in their habitat—their abundances rise and fall in concert. We use this idea to learn how bacterial populations in the microbiota respond to habitat conditions that vary from person-to-person across the human population. Our mathematical framework shows that habitat fluctuations are sufficient for explaining intra-bodysite correlations in relative species abundances from the Human Microbiome Project. We explicitly show that the relative abundances of closely related species are positively correlated and can be predicted from taxonomic relationships. We identify a small set of functional pathways related to metabolism and maintenance of the cell wall that form the basis of a common resource sharing niche space of the human microbiota.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Wh_9v15ULkA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Personalized glucose forecasting for type 2 diabetes using data assimilation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005232</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/9dbozlTIYLE/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by David J. Albers, Matthew Levine, Bruce Gluckman, Henry Ginsberg, George Hripcsak, Lena Mamykina&lt;/p&gt;

Type 2 diabetes leads to premature death and reduced quality of life for 8% of Americans. Nutrition management is critical to maintaining glycemic control, yet it is difficult to achieve due to the high individual differences in glycemic response to nutrition. Anticipating glycemic impact of different meals can be challenging not only for individuals with diabetes, but also for expert diabetes educators. Personalized computational models that can accurately forecast an impact of a given meal on an individual’s blood glucose levels can serve as the engine for a new generation of decision support tools for individuals with diabetes. However, to be useful in practice, these computational engines need to generate accurate forecasts based on limited datasets consistent with typical self-monitoring practices of individuals with type 2 diabetes. This paper uses three forecasting machines: (i) data assimilation, a technique borrowed from atmospheric physics and engineering that uses Bayesian modeling to infuse data with human knowledge represented in a mechanistic model, to generate real-time, personalized, adaptable glucose forecasts; (ii) model averaging of data assimilation output; and (iii) dynamical Gaussian process model regression. The proposed data assimilation machine, the primary focus of the paper, uses a modified dual unscented Kalman filter to estimate states and parameters, personalizing the mechanistic models. Model selection is used to make a personalized model selection for the individual and their measurement characteristics. The data assimilation forecasts are empirically evaluated against actual postprandial glucose measurements captured by individuals with type 2 diabetes, and against predictions generated by experienced diabetes educators after reviewing a set of historical nutritional records and glucose measurements for the same individual. The evaluation suggests that the data assimilation forecasts compare well with specific glucose measurements and match or exceed in accuracy expert forecasts. We conclude by examining ways to present predictions as forecast-derived range quantities and evaluate the comparative advantages of these ranges.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9dbozlTIYLE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Probabilistic Synapses. (arXiv:1410.1029v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1029</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1029</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning, especially rapid learning, is critical for survival. However,
learning is hard: a large number of synaptic weights must be set based on
noisy, often ambiguous, sensory information. In such a high-noise regime,
keeping track of probability distributions over weights - not just point
estimates - is the optimal strategy. Here we hypothesize that synapses take
that optimal strategy: they do not store just the mean weight; they also store
their degree of uncertainty - in essence, they put error bars on the weights.
They then use that uncertainty to adjust their learning rates, with higher
uncertainty resulting in higher learning rates. We also make a second,
independent, hypothesis: synapses communicate their uncertainty by linking it
to variability, with more uncertainty leading to more variability. More
concretely, the value of a synaptic weight at a given time is a sample from its
probability distribution. These two hypotheses cast synaptic plasticity as a
problem of Bayesian inference, and thus provide a normative view of learning.
They are consistent with known learning rules, offer an explanation for the
large variability in the size of post-synaptic potentials, and make several
falsifiable experimental predictions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Patterns of interval correlations in neural oscillators with adaptation. (arXiv:1303.1018v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1018</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1018</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural firing is often subject to negative feedback by adaptation currents.
These currents can induce strong correlations among the time intervals between
spikes. Here we study analytically the interval correlations of a broad class
of noisy neural oscillators with spike-triggered adaptation of arbitrary
strength and time scale. Our weak-noise theory provides a general relation
between the correlations and the phase-response curve (PRC) of the oscillator,
proves anti-correlations between neighboring intervals for adapting neurons
with type I PRC and identifies a single order parameter that determines the
qualitative pattern of correlations. Monotonically decaying or oscillating
correlation structures can be related to qualitatively different voltage traces
after spiking, which can be explained by the phase plane geometry. At high
firing rates, the long-term variability of the spike train associated with the
cumulative interval correlations becomes small, independent of model details.
Our results are verified by comparison with stochastic simulations of the
exponential, leaky, and generalized integrate-and-fire models with adaptation.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesion-deficit association studies are important as they can reveal brain regions essential for specific functions, but sometimes appear to yield conflicting results. We aimed to show how pitfalls of lesions studies can be avoided, and converging results obtained, illustrating from studies of the role of posterior superior temporal gyrus in auditory word comprehension. We review published lesion studies on auditory comprehension and present new data from both acute and chronic stroke that address weaknesses in some previous studies. Results demonstrate how convergence of positive results from diverse lesion studies provides strong evidence for the role of a particular region in a given behavior.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present an error-controlled mesh refinement procedure for needle insertion
simulation and apply it to the simulation of electrode implantation for deep
brain stimulation, including brain shift. Our approach enables to control the
error in the computation of the displacement and stress fields around the
needle tip and needle shaft by suitably refining the mesh, whilst maintaining a
coarser mesh in other parts of the domain. We demonstrate through academic and
practical examples that our approach increases the accuracy of the displacement
and stress fields around the needle without increasing the computational
expense. This enables real-time simulations. The proposed methodology has
direct implications to increase the accuracy and control the computational
expense of the simulation of percutaneous procedures such as biopsy,
brachytherapy, regional anesthesia, or cryotherapy and can be essential to the
development of robotic guidance.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Consistency of Regions of Interest as nodes of functional brain networks measured by fMRI. (arXiv:1704.07635v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The functional network approach, where fMRI BOLD time series are mapped to
networks depicting functional relationships between brain areas, has opened new
insights into the function of the human brain. In this approach, the choice of
network nodes is of crucial importance. One option is to consider fMRI voxels
as nodes. This results in a large number of nodes, making network analysis and
interpretation of results challenging. A common alternative is to use
pre-defined clusters of anatomically close voxels, Regions of Interest (ROIs).
This approach assumes that voxels within ROIs are functionally similar. Because
these two approaches result in different network structures, it is crucial to
understand what happens to network connectivity when moving from the voxel
level to the ROI level. We show that the consistency of ROIs, defined as the
mean Pearson correlation coefficient between the time series of their voxels,
varies widely in resting-state experimental data. Therefore the assumption of
similar voxel dynamics within each ROI does not generally hold. Further, the
time series of low-consistency ROIs may be highly correlated, resulting in
spurious links in ROI-level networks. Based on these results, we recommend that
averaging BOLD signals over anatomically defined ROIs should be carefully
considered.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Sharing deep generative representation for perceived image reconstruction from human brain activity. (arXiv:1704.07575v1 [cs.AI])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Decoding human brain activities via functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) has gained increasing attention in recent years. While encouraging
results have been reported in brain states classification tasks, reconstructing
the details of human visual experience still remains difficult. Two main
challenges that hinder the development of effective models are the perplexing
fMRI measurement noise and the high dimensionality of limited data instances.
Existing methods generally suffer from one or both of these issues and yield
dissatisfactory results. In this paper, we tackle this problem by casting the
reconstruction of visual stimulus as the Bayesian inference of missing view in
a multiview latent variable model. Sharing a common latent representation, our
joint generative model of external stimulus and brain response is not only
&quot;deep&quot; in extracting nonlinear features from visual images, but also powerful
in capturing correlations among voxel activities of fMRI recordings. The
nonlinearity and deep structure endow our model with strong representation
ability, while the correlations of voxel activities are critical for
suppressing noise and improving prediction. We devise an efficient variational
Bayesian method to infer the latent variables and the model parameters. To
further improve the reconstruction accuracy, the latent representations of
testing instances are enforced to be close to that of their neighbours from the
training set via posterior regularization. Experiments on three fMRI recording
datasets demonstrate that our approach can more accurately reconstruct visual
stimuli.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Involvement of the cerebellum in Parkinson's disease and Dementia with Lewy bodies</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patient brains with Parkinson's disease or Dementia with Lewy bodies show aggregation of alpha-synuclein in pre-cerebellar brainstem structures. Furthermore, patients exhibit resting tremor, unstable gait and impaired balance which may be associated with cerebellar dysfunction. Therefore, we screened the cerebella of 12 patients with alpha-synucleinopathies for neuropathological changes. Cerebellar nuclei and neighboring white matter displayed numerous aggregates, while lobules were mildly affected. Cerebellar aggregation pathology may suggest a prion-like spread originating from affected precerebellar structures and the high homogeneity between patients with Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease shows that both diseases likely belong to the same neuropathological spectrum.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To assess prognostic factors for a second clinical attack and a first disability worsening event in pediatric clinically isolated syndrome (pCIS) suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: A cohort of 770 pCIS patients was followed-up for at least 10 years. Cox proportional hazard models and RECursive Partitioning and AMalgamation (RECPAM) tree-regression were used to analyze data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: In pCIS, female sex and a multifocal onset were risk factors for a second clinical attack (HR, 95% CI: 1.28, 1.06-1.55; 1.42, 1.10-1.84, respectively), whereas disease modifying drugs (DMDs) exposure reduced this risk (HR, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.60-0.95). After pediatric onset MS (POMS) diagnosis, age at onset younger than 15 years and DMDs exposure decreased the risk of a first EDSS worsening event (HR, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.42-0.83; 0.75, 0.71-0.80, respectively), whereas the occurrence of relapse/s increased this risk (HR, 95% CI: 5.08, 3.46-7.46).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;An exploratory RECPAM analysis highlighted a significant higher incidence of a first EDSS worsening event in patients with multifocal or isolated spinal-cord or optic neuritis involvement at onset in comparison to those with an isolated supratentorial or brainstem syndrome. A Cox regression model including RECPAM classes confirmed DMDs exposure as the most protective factor against EDSS worsening events and relapses as the most important risk factor for attaining EDSS worsening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: This work represents an important step forward in identifying predictors of unfavorable course in pCIS and POMS and supports a protective effect of early DMDs treatment in preventing MS development and disability accumulation in this population.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report 5 cases of acute heart failure (AHF) related to multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses. AHF was inaugural in 3 patients, always preceded or accompanied by signs of brainstem dysfunction; it was severe, requiring intensive care management. Echocardiography showed left ventricular hypokinesis. No other cause of AHF has been found. All patients showed a new medullary lesion on brain MRI. All had rapid and complete recovery of ventricular function after intravenous corticosteroids. We concluded to a takotsubo phenomenon. Physicians should be aware of rare cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in MS relapses. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt; To assess the associations of blood biomarkers of carbohydrate, lipid and apolipoprotein metabolisms with the future risk of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt; In the Apolipoprotein-related MOrtality RISk (AMORIS) study, we enrolled 636,132 men and women during 1985-1996 in Stockholm, Sweden with measurements of serum glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). Serum LDL-C and HDL-C were either directly measured or calculated from total cholesterol, triglycerides and apoA-I. The cohort was followed until end of 2011. We used Cox models and mixed-effects models to first estimate the associations between these biomarkers and ALS incidence, and secondly to assess the changes of these biomarkers during the 20 years before ALS diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt; One-unit increase of LDL-C (HR=1.14, 95%CI=1.02-1.27), apoB (HR=1.68, 95%CI=1.17-2.42) and apoB/apoA-I ratio (HR=1.90, 95%CI=1.29-2.78) was associated with a higher incidence of ALS. High glucose level (≥6.11 mmol/L) was associated with a lower incidence (HR=0.62, 95%CI=0.42-0.93), whereas high LDL-C/HDL-C (≥3.50; HR=1.50, 95%CI 1.15-1.96) and high apoB/apoA-I (≥0.90 for men, ≥0.8 for women; HR=1.41, 95%CI 1.04-1.90) ratios were associated with a higher incidence. During the 10 years before diagnosis, ALS patients had increasing levels of LDL-C, HDL-C, apoB and apoA-I, whereas gradually decreasing levels of LDL-C/HDL-C and apoB/apoA-I ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt; Alterations in the carbohydrate, lipid and apolipoprotein metabolisms are associated with ALS risk and may serve as prodromal symptoms decades before ALS diagnosis. The imbalance between apoB and apoA-I as well as between LDL-C and HDL-C may be an etiologic mechanism for ALS and needs to be further studied. This article is protected by copyright.

The rapid development of sequencing technology has led to an explosive accumulation of genomic sequence data. Clustering is often the first step to perform in sequence analy- sis, and hierarchical clustering is one of the most commonly used approaches for this purpose. However, it is currently computationally expensive to perform hierarchical clustering of extremely large sequence datasets due to its quadratic time and space complexities. In this paper we developed a new algorithm called ESPRIT-Forest for parallel hierarchical clustering of sequences. The algorithm achieves subquadratic time and space complexity and maintains a high clustering accuracy comparable to the standard method. The basic idea is to organize sequences into a pseudo-metric based partitioning tree for sub-linear time searching of nearest neighbors, and then use a new multiple-pair merging criterion to construct clusters in parallel using multiple threads. The new algorithm was tested on the human microbiome project (HMP) dataset, currently one of the largest published microbial 16S rRNA sequence dataset. Our experiment demonstrated that with the power of parallel computing it is now compu- tationally feasible to perform hierarchical clustering analysis of tens of millions of sequences. The software is available at http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/∼yijunsun/lab/ESPRIT-Forest.html.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XwEkEilwZL0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The formation and stability of synapses are key questions in neuroscience. Post-synaptic domains have been classically conceived as resulting from local insertion and turnover of proteins at the synapse. However, insertion is likely to occur outside the post-synaptic domains and advances in single-molecule imaging have shown that proteins diffuse in the plane of the membrane prior to their accumulation at synapses. We quantitatively investigated this scenario using computer simulations and mathematical analysis, taking for definiteness the specific case of inhibitory synapse components, i.e., the glycine receptors (GlyR) and the associated gephyrin scaffolding protein. The observed domain sizes of scaffold clusters can be explained by a dynamic balance between the aggregation of gephyrin proteins diffusing while bound to GlyR and their turnover at the neuron membrane. We also predict the existence of extrasynaptic clusters with a characteristic size distribution that significantly contribute to the size fluctuations of synaptic domains. New super-resolution data for gephyrin proteins established the existence of extrasynaptic clusters the sizes of which are consistent with the model predictions in a range of model parameters. At a general level, our results highlight aggregation with removal as a non-equilibrium phase separation which produces structures of tunable size.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-0Vh2Pl2bgo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Representational models: A common framework for understanding encoding, pattern-component, and representational-similarity analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005508</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jörn Diedrichsen, Nikolaus Kriegeskorte&lt;/p&gt;

Representational models specify how activity patterns in populations of neurons (or, more generally, in multivariate brain-activity measurements) relate to sensory stimuli, motor responses, or cognitive processes. In an experimental context, representational models can be defined as hypotheses about the distribution of activity profiles across experimental conditions. Currently, three different methods are being used to test such hypotheses: encoding analysis, pattern component modeling (PCM), and representational similarity analysis (RSA). Here we develop a common mathematical framework for understanding the relationship of these three methods, which share one core commonality: all three evaluate the second moment of the distribution of activity profiles, which determines the representational geometry, and thus how well any feature can be decoded from population activity. Using simulated data for three different experimental designs, we compare the power of the methods to adjudicate between competing representational models. PCM implements a likelihood-ratio test and therefore provides the most powerful test if its assumptions hold. However, the other two approaches—when conducted appropriately—can perform similarly. In encoding analysis, the linear model needs to be appropriately regularized, which effectively imposes a prior on the activity profiles. With such a prior, an encoding model specifies a well-defined distribution of activity profiles. In RSA, the unequal variances and statistical dependencies of the dissimilarity estimates need to be taken into account to reach near-optimal power in inference. The three methods render different aspects of the information explicit (e.g. single-response tuning in encoding analysis and population-response representational dissimilarity in RSA) and have specific advantages in terms of computational demands, ease of use, and extensibility. The three methods are properly construed as complementary components of a single data-analytical toolkit for understanding neural representations on the basis of multivariate brain-activity data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/D1EUTvjXL8w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Predicting explorative motor learning using decision-making and motor noise</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiuli Chen, Kieran Mohr, Joseph M. Galea&lt;/p&gt;

A fundamental problem faced by humans is learning to select motor actions based on noisy sensory information and incomplete knowledge of the world. Recently, a number of authors have asked whether this type of motor learning problem might be very similar to a range of higher-level decision-making problems. If so, participant behaviour on a high-level decision-making task could be predictive of their performance during a motor learning task. To investigate this question, we studied performance during an explorative motor learning task and a decision-making task which had a similar underlying structure with the exception that it was not subject to motor (execution) noise. We also collected an independent measurement of each participant’s level of motor noise. Our analysis showed that explorative motor learning and decision-making could be modelled as the (approximately) optimal solution to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process bounded by noisy neural information processing. The model was able to predict participant performance in motor learning by using parameters estimated from the decision-making task and the separate motor noise measurement. This suggests that explorative motor learning can be formalised as a sequential decision-making process that is adjusted for motor noise, and raises interesting questions regarding the neural origin of explorative motor learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pwLVQOklUD0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Francesca Mastrogiuseppe, Srdjan Ostojic&lt;/p&gt;

Recurrent networks of non-linear units display a variety of dynamical regimes depending on the structure of their synaptic connectivity. A particularly remarkable phenomenon is the appearance of strongly fluctuating, chaotic activity in networks of deterministic, but randomly connected rate units. How this type of intrinsically generated fluctuations appears in more realistic networks of spiking neurons has been a long standing question. To ease the comparison between rate and spiking networks, recent works investigated the dynamical regimes of randomly-connected rate networks with segregated excitatory and inhibitory populations, and firing rates constrained to be positive. These works derived general dynamical mean field (DMF) equations describing the fluctuating dynamics, but solved these equations only in the case of purely inhibitory networks. Using a simplified excitatory-inhibitory architecture in which DMF equations are more easily tractable, here we show that the presence of excitation qualitatively modifies the fluctuating activity compared to purely inhibitory networks. In presence of excitation, intrinsically generated fluctuations induce a strong increase in mean firing rates, a phenomenon that is much weaker in purely inhibitory networks. Excitation moreover induces two different fluctuating regimes: for moderate overall coupling, recurrent inhibition is sufficient to stabilize fluctuations; for strong coupling, firing rates are stabilized solely by the upper bound imposed on activity, even if inhibition is stronger than excitation. These results extend to more general network architectures, and to rate networks receiving noisy inputs mimicking spiking activity. Finally, we show that signatures of the second dynamical regime appear in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DbZz07hx9B4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pathogenic role of anti–signal recognition protein and anti–3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase antibodies in necrotizing myopathies: Myofiber atrophy and impairment of muscle regeneration in necrotizing autoimmune myopathies</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24902-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathies (IMNM) may be associated with either anti–signal recognition protein (SRP) or anti–3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) antibodies (Abs), and the titer of these Abs is correlated with disease activity. We investigated whether anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR Abs could be involved in muscle damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24902-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle biopsies of patients were analyzed for atrophy and regeneration by measuring fiber size and by performing immunostaining of neonatal myosin heavy chain. To further understand the role of the Abs in the pathology, we performed muscle cell coculture with the Abs. Atrophy and regeneration were evaluated based on the myotube surface area as well as gene and cytokine profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24902-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In muscle biopsies of patients with anti-SRP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and anti-HMGCR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Abs, a large number of small fibers corresponding to both atrophic and regenerating fibers were observed. In vitro, anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR Abs induced muscle fiber atrophy and increased the transcription of &lt;em&gt;MAFbx&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;TRIM63&lt;/em&gt;. In addition, the muscle fiber atrophy was associated with high levels of inflammatory cytokines: tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-6, and reactive oxygen species. In the presence of anti-SRP or anti-HMGCR Abs, mechanisms involved in muscle regeneration were also impaired due to a defect of myoblast fusion. This defect was associated with a decreased production of IL-4 and IL-13. The addition of IL-4 and/or IL-13 totally rescued fusion capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24902-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data show that molecular mechanisms of atrophy and regeneration are affected and contribute to loss of muscle function occurring in IMNM. This emphasizes the potential interest of targeted therapies addressing these mechanisms. Ann Neurol 2017;81:538–548&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The neurology of acutely failing respiratory mechanics</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forces involved in breathing—which effectively pull in air—are the diaphragmatic, intercostal, spine, and neck muscles. Equally important is the bulbar musculature maintaining the architecture of a patent airway conduit and abdominal wall and internal intercostal muscles providing cough. Acute injury along a neural trajectory from brainstem to muscle will impair the coordinated interaction between these muscle groups. Acutely failing respiratory mechanics can be caused by central and peripheral lesions. In central lesions, the key lesion is in the nucleus ambiguus innervating the dilator muscles of the soft palate, pharynx, and larynx, but abnormal respiratory mechanics rarely coincide with abnormalities of the respiratory pattern generator. In peripheral lesions, diaphragmatic weakness is a main element, but in many neuromuscular disorders mechanical upper airway obstruction from oropharyngeal weakness contributes equally to an increased respiratory load. The neurology of breathing involves changes in respiratory drive, rhythm, mechanics, and dynamics. This review focuses on the fundamentals of abnormal respiratory mechanics in acute neurologic conditions, bedside judgment, interpretation of additional laboratory tests, and initial stabilization, with practical solutions provided. Many of these respiratory signs are relevant to neurologists, who in acute situations may see these patients first. Ann Neurol 2017;81:485–494&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24907-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neonatal white matter injury (NWMI) is a lesion found in preterm infants that can lead to cerebral palsy. Although antagonists of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, such as Noggin, promote oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) production after hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury, the downstream functional targets are poorly understood. The basic helix-loop-helix protein, oligodendrocyte transcription factor 1 (Olig1), promotes oligodendrocyte (OL) development and is essential during remyelination in adult mice. Here, we investigated whether &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt; function is required downstream of BMP antagonism for response to injury in the neonatal brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24907-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used wild-type and &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt;-null mice subjected to neonatal stroke and postnatal neural progenitor cultures, and we analyzed Olig1 expression in human postmortem samples from neonates that suffered HI encephalopathy (HIE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24907-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt;-null neonatal mice showed significant hypomyelination after moderate neonatal stroke. Surprisingly, damaged white matter tracts in &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt;-null mice lacked Olig2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; OPCs, and instead proliferating neuronal precursors and GABAergic interneurons were present. We demonstrate that Noggin-induced OPC production requires &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt; function. In postnatal neural progenitors, Noggin governs production of OLs versus interneurons through &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt;-mediated repression of &lt;em&gt;Dlx1/2&lt;/em&gt; transcription factors. Additionally, we observed that Olig1 and the BMP signaling effector, phosphorylated SMADs (Sma- and Mad-related proteins) 1, 5, and 8, were elevated in the subventricular zone of human infants with HIE compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24907-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that &lt;em&gt;Olig1&lt;/em&gt; has a critical function in regulation of postnatal neural progenitor cell production in response to Noggin.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Exhaustive search of linear information encoding protein-peptide recognition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005499</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Abdellali Kelil, Benjamin Dubreuil, Emmanuel D. Levy, Stephen W. Michnick&lt;/p&gt;

High-throughput &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; methods have been extensively applied to identify linear information that encodes peptide recognition. However, these methods are limited in number of peptides, sequence variation, and length of peptides that can be explored, and often produce solutions that are not found in the cell. Despite the large number of methods developed to attempt addressing these issues, the exhaustive search of linear information encoding protein-peptide recognition has been so far physically unfeasible. Here, we describe a strategy, called DALEL, for the exhaustive search of linear sequence information encoded in proteins that bind to a common partner. We applied DALEL to explore binding specificity of SH3 domains in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. Using only the polypeptide sequences of SH3 domain binding proteins, we succeeded in identifying the majority of known SH3 binding sites previously discovered either &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, we discovered a number of sites with both non-canonical sequences and distinct properties that may serve ancillary roles in peptide recognition. We compared DALEL to a variety of state-of-the-art algorithms in the blind identification of known binding sites of the human Grb2 SH3 domain. We also benchmarked DALEL on curated biological motifs derived from the ELM database to evaluate the effect of increasing/decreasing the enrichment of the motifs. Our strategy can be applied in conjunction with experimental data of proteins interacting with a common partner to identify binding sites among them. Yet, our strategy can also be applied to any group of proteins of interest to identify enriched linear motifs or to exhaustively explore the space of linear information. Finally, we have developed a webserver located at http://michnick.bcm.umontreal.ca/dalel, offering user-friendly interface and providing different scenarios utilizing DALEL.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dW2RiuWYhoY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A dynamic genetic-hormonal regulatory network model explains multiple cellular behaviors of the root apical meristem of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thalian&lt;/i&gt;</title>

The study of the concerted action of hormones and transcription factors is fundamental to understand cell differentiation and pattern formation during organ development. The root apical meristem of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; is a useful model to address this. It has a stem cell niche near its tip conformed of a quiescent organizer and stem or initial cells around it, then a proliferation domain followed by a transition domain, where cells diminish division rate before transiting to the elongation zone; here, cells grow anisotropically prior to their final differentiation towards the plant base. A minimal model of the gene regulatory network that underlies cell-fate specification and patterning at the root stem cell niche was proposed before. In this study, we update and couple such network with both the auxin and cytokinin hormone signaling pathways to address how they collectively give rise to attractors that correspond to the genetic and hormonal activity profiles that are characteristic of different cell types along &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thaliana&lt;/i&gt; root apical meristem. We used a Boolean model of the genetic-hormonal regulatory network to integrate known and predicted regulatory interactions into alternative models. Our analyses show that, after adding some putative missing interactions, the model includes the necessary and sufficient components and regulatory interactions to recover attractors characteristic of the root cell types, including the auxin and cytokinin activity profiles that correlate with different cellular behaviors along the root apical meristem. Furthermore, the model predicts the existence of activity configurations that could correspond to the transition domain. The model also provides a possible explanation for apparently paradoxical cellular behaviors in the root meristem. For example, how auxin may induce and at the same time inhibit WOX5 expression. According to the model proposed here the hormonal regulation of WOX5 might depend on the cell type. Our results illustrate how non-linear multi-stable qualitative network models can aid at understanding how transcriptional regulators and hormonal signaling pathways are dynamically coupled and may underlie both the acquisition of cell fate and the emergence of hormonal activity profiles that arise during complex organ development.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8EgFpp_IOhQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Oncodomains: A protein domain-centric framework for analyzing rare variants in tumor samples</title>

The fight against cancer is hindered by its highly heterogeneous nature. Genome-wide sequencing studies have shown that individual malignancies contain many mutations that range from those commonly found in tumor genomes to rare somatic variants present only in a small fraction of lesions. Such rare somatic variants dominate the landscape of genomic mutations in cancer, yet efforts to correlate somatic mutations found in one or few individuals with functional roles have been largely unsuccessful. Traditional methods for identifying somatic variants that drive cancer are ‘gene-centric’ in that they consider only somatic variants within a particular gene and make no comparison to other similar genes in the same family that may play a similar role in cancer. In this work, we present oncodomain hotspots, a new ‘domain-centric’ method for identifying clusters of somatic mutations across entire gene families using protein domain models. Our analysis confirms that our approach creates a framework for leveraging structural and functional information encapsulated by protein domains into the analysis of somatic variants in cancer, enabling the assessment of even rare somatic variants by comparison to similar genes. Our results reveal a vast landscape of somatic variants that act at the level of domain families altering pathways known to be involved with cancer such as protein phosphorylation, signaling, gene regulation, and cell metabolism. Due to oncodomain hotspots’ unique ability to assess rare variants, we expect our method to become an important tool for the analysis of sequenced tumor genomes, complementing existing methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3F8cY6IbcVU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Cheminformatics-aided discovery of small-molecule Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) dual inhibitors of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and Receptor Activator of NF-κB Ligand (RANKL)</title>

We present an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; drug discovery pipeline developed and applied for the identification and virtual screening of small-molecule Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) compounds that act as dual inhibitors of TNF and RANKL through the trimerization interface. The cheminformatics part of the pipeline was developed by combining structure–based with ligand–based modeling using the largest available set of known TNF inhibitors in the literature (2481 small molecules). To facilitate virtual screening, the consensus predictive model was made freely available at: http://enalos.insilicotox.com/TNFPubChem/. We thus generated a priority list of nine small molecules as candidates for direct TNF function inhibition. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; evaluation of these compounds led to the selection of two small molecules that act as potent direct inhibitors of TNF function, with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values comparable to those of a previously-described direct inhibitor (SPD304), but with significantly reduced toxicity. These molecules were also identified as RANKL inhibitors and validated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; with respect to this second functionality. Direct binding of the two compounds was confirmed both for TNF and RANKL, as well as their ability to inhibit the biologically-active trimer forms. Molecular dynamics calculations were also carried out for the two small molecules in each protein to offer additional insight into the interactions that govern TNF and RANKL complex formation. To our knowledge, these compounds, namely T8 and T23, constitute the second and third published examples of dual small-molecule direct function inhibitors of TNF and RANKL, and could serve as lead compounds for the development of novel treatments for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rEIehantWPU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Neural population equations such as neural mass or field models are widely used to study brain activity on a large scale. However, the relation of these models to the properties of single neurons is unclear. Here we derive an equation for several interacting populations at the mesoscopic scale starting from a microscopic model of randomly connected generalized integrate-and-fire neuron models. Each population consists of 50–2000 neurons of the same type but different populations account for different neuron types. The stochastic population equations that we find reveal how spike-history effects in single-neuron dynamics such as refractoriness and adaptation interact with finite-size fluctuations on the population level. Efficient integration of the stochastic mesoscopic equations reproduces the statistical behavior of the population activities obtained from microscopic simulations of a full spiking neural network model. The theory describes nonlinear emergent dynamics such as finite-size-induced stochastic transitions in multistable networks and synchronization in balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The mesoscopic equations are employed to rapidly integrate a model of a cortical microcircuit consisting of eight neuron types, which allows us to predict spontaneous population activities as well as evoked responses to thalamic input. Our theory establishes a general framework for modeling finite-size neural population dynamics based on single cell and synapse parameters and offers an efficient approach to analyzing cortical circuits and computations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qqiGo_2jYDE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Robust information propagation through noisy neural circuits</title>

Sensory neurons give highly variable responses to stimulation, which can limit the amount of stimulus information available to downstream circuits. Much work has investigated the factors that affect the amount of information encoded in these population responses, leading to insights about the role of covariability among neurons, tuning curve shape, etc. However, the informativeness of neural responses is not the only relevant feature of population codes; of potentially equal importance is how robustly that information propagates to downstream structures. For instance, to quantify the retina’s performance, one must consider not only the informativeness of the optic nerve responses, but also the amount of information that survives the spike-generating nonlinearity and noise corruption in the next stage of processing, the lateral geniculate nucleus. Our study identifies the set of covariance structures for the upstream cells that optimize the ability of information to propagate through noisy, nonlinear circuits. Within this optimal family are covariances with “differential correlations”, which are known to reduce the information encoded in neural population activities. Thus, covariance structures that maximize information in neural population codes, and those that maximize the ability of this information to propagate, can be very different. Moreover, redundancy is neither necessary nor sufficient to make population codes robust against corruption by noise: redundant codes can be very fragile, and synergistic codes can—in some cases—optimize robustness against noise.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-OtN3PGmSPM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Erroneous energy-generating cycles in published genome scale metabolic networks: Identification and removal</title>

Energy metabolism is central to cellular biology. Thus, genome-scale models of heterotrophic unicellular species must account appropriately for the utilization of external nutrients to synthesize energy metabolites such as ATP. However, metabolic models designed for flux-balance analysis (FBA) may contain thermodynamically impossible energy-generating cycles: without nutrient consumption, these models are still capable of charging energy metabolites (such as ADP→ATP or NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;→NADPH). Here, we show that energy-generating cycles occur in over 85% of metabolic models without extensive manual curation, such as those contained in the ModelSEED and MetaNetX databases; in contrast, such cycles are rare in the manually curated models of the BiGG database. Energy generating cycles may represent model errors, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;., erroneous assumptions on reaction reversibilities. Alternatively, part of the cycle may be thermodynamically feasible in one environment, while the remainder is thermodynamically feasible in another environment; as standard FBA does not account for thermodynamics, combining these into an FBA model allows erroneous energy generation. The presence of energy-generating cycles typically inflates maximal biomass production rates by 25%, and may lead to biases in evolutionary simulations. We present efficient computational methods (i) to identify energy generating cycles, using FBA, and (ii) to identify minimal sets of model changes that eliminate them, using a variant of the GlobalFit algorithm.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SEq20qtdmn4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Humans exhibit socially contagious behaviours, including contagious itching, but studying the underlying mechanisms has been difficult. Yu et al. found that they could socially transmit scratching to mice by allowing them to watch mice with chronic itch. The observer mice showed upregulated neuronal activity &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Pharmacoresistant seizures and cytotoxic cerebral edema are serious complications of ischemic and traumatic brain injury. Intraneuronal Cl− concentration ([Cl−]i) regulation impacts on both cell volume homeostasis and Cl−-permeable GABAA receptor-dependent membrane excitability. Understanding the pleiotropic molecular determinants of neuronal [Cl−]i − cytoplasmic impermeant anions, polyanionic extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins, and plasmalemmal Cl− transporters − could help the identification of novel anticonvulsive and neuroprotective targets.</description>

	<description>We sleep almost one-third of our lives and sleep plays an important role in critical brain functions like memory formation and consolidation. The role of sleep in cerebellar processing, however, constitutes an enigma in the field of neuroscience; we know little about cerebellar sleep-physiology, cerebro–cerebellar interactions during sleep, or the contributions of sleep to cerebellum-dependent memory consolidation. Likewise, we do not understand why cerebellar malfunction can lead to changes in the sleep–wake cycle and sleep disorders.</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Global Exosome Transcriptome Profiling Reveals Biomarkers for Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24931</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Accumulating evidence supports a role for exosomes in immune regulation. In this study, we investigated the total circulating exosome transcriptome in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients (RRMS) and healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to define the global RNA profile of serum exosomes in 19 RRMS patients (9 in relapse, 10 in remission) and 10 HC. We analyzed 5 million reads and over 50,000 transcripts per sample, including a detailed analysis of microRNA (miRNA) differentially expressed in RRMS. The discovery set data were validated by quantification using digital quantitative PCR with an independent cohort of 63 RRMS patients (33 in relapse, 30 in remission) and 32 HC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Exosomal RNA NGS revealed that of 15 different classes of transcripts detected 4 circulating exosomal sequences within the miRNA category were differentially expressed in RRMS patients vs HC: hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-196b-5p, hsa-miR-301a-3p and hsa-miR-532-5p. Serum exosomal expression of these miRNA was significantly decreased during relapse in RRMS. These miRNA were also decreased in patients with a gadolinium enhancement on brain magnetic resonance imaging. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; secretion of these miRNA by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also significantly impaired in RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These data show that circulating exosomes have a distinct RNA profile in RRMS. Since putative targets for these miRNA include the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and the cell cycle regulator aryl hydrocarbon receptor the data suggest a disturbed cell-to-cell communication in this disease. Thus exosomal miRNA might represent a useful biomarker to distinguish MS relapse. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The immune response of the human brain to abdominal surgery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24909</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24909</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgery launches a systemic inflammatory reaction that reaches the brain and associates with immune activation and cognitive decline. Although preclinical studies have in part described this systemic-to-brain signaling pathway, we lack information on how these changes appear in humans. This study examines the short- and long-term impact of abdominal surgery on the human brain immune system by positron emission tomography (PET) in relation to blood immune reactivity, plasma inflammatory biomarkers, and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight males undergoing prostatectomy under general anesthesia were included. Prior to surgery (baseline), at postoperative days 3 to 4, and after 3 months, patients were examined using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 brain PET imaging to assess brain immune cell activation. Concurrently, systemic inflammatory biomarkers, ex vivo blood tests on immunoreactivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and cognitive function were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients showed a global downregulation of gray matter [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 binding of 26 ± 26% (mean ± standard deviation) at 3 to 4 days postoperatively compared to baseline (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.023), recovering or even increasing after 3 months. LPS-induced release of the proinflammatory marker tumor necrosis factor-α in blood displayed a reduction (41 ± 39%) on the 3rd to 4th postoperative day, corresponding to changes in [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 distribution volume. Change in Stroop Color-Word Test performance between postoperative days 3 to 4 and 3 months correlated to change in [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 binding (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.027).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana24909-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study translates preclinical data on changes in the brain immune system after surgery to humans, and suggests an interplay between the human brain and the inflammatory response of the peripheral innate immune system. These findings may be related to postsurgical impairments of cognitive function. Ann Neurol 2017;81:572–582&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Focused ultrasound as a novel strategy for Alzheimer's disease therapeutics</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24933</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of advances in the pathology, genetics and imaging of Alzheimer's disease (AD), there remain no effective treatments that significantly alter its natural history. Several late phase clinical trials, focused largely on amyloid beta metabolism and clearance, have unfortunately demonstrated no significant benefit in early AD patients. Recent work investigating blood-brain barrier opening using focused ultrasound in transgenic animal models has shown that repeated ultrasound administration coupled with microbubble-containing contrast can reduce plaque burden and reverse memory deficits. While the mechanisms underlying plaque clearance are under investigation, this image-guided, noninvasive technique appears promising. This article describes the rationale and underlying principles of focused ultrasound as applied to Alzheimer's disease and suggests that based on promising pre-clinical results, this technology, whether alone or in conjunction with targeted therapies, can be of potential benefit.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Are midsagittal tissue bridges predictive of outcome after cervical spinal cord injury?</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;T2-weighted scans provided data on the extent and dynamics of neuronal tissue damage and midsagittal tissue bridges at the epicenter of traumatic cervical spinal cord lesions in 24 subacute tetraplegic patients. At one month post-injury, smaller lesion area and midsagittal tissue bridges identified those patients with lower extremity evoked potentials and better clinical recovery. Wider midsagittal tissue bridges and smaller lesions at one month post-injury were associated with neurological and functional recovery at 1 year follow-up. Neuroimaging biomarkers of lesion area and midsagittal tissue bridges are potential outcome predictors and patient stratifiers in both subacute and chronic clinical trials.

&lt;p&gt;Authors: Ulman Lindenberger, Elisabeth Wenger &amp;amp; Martin Lövdén&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have been told that 'brain training' will make them not only better at playing certain games but smarter in general. However, evidence indicates that brain plasticity is specific to the acquired skill. The search for neural mechanisms of transfer of training-induced benefits needs to build on this evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proper construction of neural circuits requires the generation of diverse cell types, their distribution to defined regions, and their specific and appropriate wiring. A major objective in neurobiology has been to understand the molecular determinants that link neural birth to terminal specification and functional &lt;/p&gt;

	<description>Memories of experiences are stored in the cerebral cortex. Sleep is critical for the consolidation of hippocampal memory of wake experiences into the neocortex. Understanding representations of neural codes of hippocampal–neocortical networks during sleep would reveal important circuit mechanisms in memory consolidation and provide novel insights into memory and dreams. Although sleep-associated ensemble spike activity has been investigated, identifying the content of memory in sleep remains challenging.</description>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Dominik R. Bach &amp;amp; Peter Dayan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature and neural implementation of emotions is the subject of vigorous debate. Here, we use Bayesian decision theory to address key complexities in this field and conceptualize emotions in terms of their relationship to survival-relevant behavioural choices. Decision theory indicates which behaviours are optimal &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors: Ulrike C. Müller, Thomas Deller &amp;amp; Martin Korte&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid precursor protein (APP) gives rise to the amyloid-β peptide and thus has a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. By contrast, the physiological functions of APP and the closely related APP-like proteins (APLPs) remain less well understood. Studying these physiological functions has &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal place cells are traditionally thought to represent locations where animals currently are or predict where they are headed. However, new results reveal that place cells also represent distant places that are actively avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>A growing body of work is investigating the use of mental maps during decision-making. Here we discuss how decision-making organizes experiences according to an internal model of the current task, thereby structuring memory. Likewise, we consider how the structure of mental maps contributes to decision-making.</description>

	<description>Early sensory cortex is typically investigated in response to sensory stimulation, masking the contribution of internal signals. Recently, van Kerkoerle and colleagues reported that attention and memory signals segregate from sensory signals within specific layers of primary visual cortex, providing insight into the role of internal signals in sensory processing.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules of the Immunoglobulin Superfamily Regulate Synapse Formation, Maintenance, and Function</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30032-2?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30032-2?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules are among the most abundant proteins in vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. Prominent family members are the neural cell adhesion molecules NCAM and L1, which were the first to be shown to be essential not only in development but also in synaptic function and as key regulators of synapse formation, synaptic activity, plasticity, and synaptic vesicle recycling at distinct developmental and activity stages. In addition to interacting with each other, adhesion molecules interact with ion channels and cytokine and neurotransmitter receptors.</description>
