State-of-the-art light-sheet and confocal microscopes allow recording of entire embryos in 3D and over time (3D+t) for many hours. Fluorescently labeled structures can be segmented and tracked automatically in these terabyte-scale 3D+t images, resulting in thousands of cell migration trajectories that provide detailed insights to large-scale tissue reorganization at the cellular level. Here we present EmbryoMiner, a new interactive open-source framework suitable for in-depth analyses and comparisons of entire embryos, including an extensive set of trajectory features. Starting at the whole-embryo level, the framework can be used to iteratively focus on a region of interest within the embryo, to investigate and test specific trajectory-based hypotheses and to extract quantitative features from the isolated trajectories. Thus, the new framework provides a valuable new way to quantitatively compare corresponding anatomical regions in different embryos that were manually selected based on biological prior knowledge. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 3D+t light-sheet microscopy images of zebrafish embryos, showcasing potential user applications that can be performed using the new framework.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fPwmNSZz3xw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Humans are remarkably adept at generalizing knowledge between experiences in a way that can be difficult for computers. Often, this entails generalizing constituent pieces of experiences that do not fully overlap, but nonetheless share useful similarities with, previously acquired knowledge. However, it is often unclear how knowledge gained in one context should generalize to another. Previous computational models and data suggest that rather than learning about each individual context, humans build latent abstract structures and learn to link these structures to arbitrary contexts, facilitating generalization. In these models, task structures that are more popular across contexts are more likely to be revisited in new contexts. However, these models can only re-use policies as a whole and are unable to transfer knowledge about the transition structure of the environment even if only the goal has changed (or vice-versa). This contrasts with ecological settings, where some aspects of task structure, such as the transition function, will be shared between context separately from other aspects, such as the reward function. Here, we develop a novel non-parametric Bayesian agent that forms independent latent clusters for transition and reward functions, affording separable transfer of their constituent parts across contexts. We show that the relative performance of this agent compared to an agent that jointly clusters reward and transition functions depends environmental task statistics: the mutual information between transition and reward functions and the stochasticity of the observations. We formalize our analysis through an information theoretic account of the priors, and propose a meta learning agent that dynamically arbitrates between strategies across task domains to optimize a statistical tradeoff.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X_ZyVI2ySQ4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Decision making improves sperm chemotaxis in the presence of noise</title>

To navigate their surroundings, cells rely on sensory input that is corrupted by noise. In cells performing chemotaxis, such noise arises from the stochastic binding of signalling molecules at low chemoattractant concentrations. We reveal a fundamental relationship between the speed of chemotactic steering and the strength of directional fluctuations that result from the amplification of noise in a chemical input signal. This relation implies a trade-off between steering that is slow and reliable, and steering that is fast but less reliable. We show that dynamic switching between these two modes of steering can substantially increase the probability to find a target, such as an egg to be found by sperm cells. This decision making confers no advantage in the absence of noise, but is beneficial when chemical signals are detectable, yet characterized by low signal-to-noise ratios. The latter applies at intermediate distances from a target, where signalling molecules are diluted, thus defining a ‘noise zone’ that cells have to cross. Our results explain decision making observed in recent experiments on sea urchin sperm chemotaxis. More generally, our theory demonstrates how decision making enables chemotactic agents to cope with high levels of noise in gradient sensing by dynamically adjusting the persistence length of a biased random walk.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0k29V7Enzbw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Numerous problems encountered in computational biology can be formulated as optimization problems. In this context, optimization of drug release characteristics or dosing schedules for anticancer agents has become a prominent area not only for the development of new drugs, but also for established drugs. However, in complex systems, optimization of drug exposure is not a trivial task and cannot be efficiently addressed through trial-error simulation exercises. Finding a solution to those problems is a challenging task which requires more advanced strategies like optimal control theory. In this work, we perform an optimal control analysis on a previously developed computational model for the testosterone effects of Triptorelin in prostate cancer patients with the goal of finding optimal drug-release characteristics. We demonstrate how numerical control optimization of non-linear models can be used to find better therapeutic approaches in order to improve the final outcome of the patients.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8wx1FdaORT0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Post-stroke Intranasal (+)-Naloxone Delivery Reduces Microglial Activation and Improves Behavioral Recovery from Ischemic Injury</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of disability, and effective therapeutic strategies are needed to promote complete recovery. Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in stroke pathophysiology, and there is limited understanding of how it affects recovery. The aim of this study was to characterize the spatiotemporal expression profile of microglial activation and whether dampening microglial/macrophage activation post-stroke facilitates the recovery. For dampening microglial/macrophage activation, we chose intranasal administration of naloxone, a drug that is already in clinical use for opioid overdose and is known to decrease microglia/macrophage activation. We characterized the temporal progression of microglia/macrophage activation following cortical ischemic injury in rat and found the peak activation in cortex 7 d post-stroke. Unexpectedly, there was a chronic expression of phagocytic cells in the thalamus associated with neuronal loss. (+)-Naloxone, an enantiomer that reduces microglial activation without antagonizing opioid receptors, was administered intranasally starting 1 d post-stroke and continuing for 7 d. (+)-Naloxone treatment decreased microglia/macrophage activation in the striatum and thalamus, promoted behavioral recovery during the 14-d monitoring period, and reduced neuronal death in the lesioned cortex and ipsilateral thalamus. Our results are the first to show that post-stroke intranasal (+)-naloxone administration promotes short-term functional recovery and reduces microglia/macrophage activation. Therefore, (+)-naloxone is a promising drug for the treatment of ischemic stroke, and further studies should be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Filter-Based Phase Shifts Distort Neuronal Timing Information</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Filters are widely used for the modulation, typically attenuation, of amplitudes of different frequencies within neurophysiological signals. Filters, however, also induce changes in the phases of different frequencies whose amplitude is unmodulated. These phase shifts cause time lags in the filtered signals, leading to a disruption of the timing information between different frequencies within the same signal and between different signals. The emerging time lags can be either constant in the case of linear phase (LP) filters or vary as a function of the frequency in the more common case of non-LP (NLP) filters. Since filters are used ubiquitously online in the early stages of data acquisition, the vast majority of neurophysiological signals thus suffer from distortion of the timing information even prior to their sampling. This distortion is often exacerbated by further multiple offline filtering stages of the sampled signal. The distortion of timing information may cause misinterpretation of the results and lead to erroneous conclusions. Here we present a variety of typical examples of filter-induced phase distortions and discuss the evaluation and restoration of the timing information underlying the original signal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: BC RNA Mislocalization in the Fragile X Premutation</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Fragile X premutation disorder is caused by CGG triplet repeat expansions in the 5' untranslated region of FMR1 mRNA. The question of how expanded CGG repeats cause disease is a subject of continuing debate. Our work indicates that CGG-repeat structures compete with regulatory BC1 RNA for access to RNA transport factor hnRNP A2. As a result, BC1 RNA is mislocalized in vivo, as its synapto-dendritic presence is severely diminished in brains of CGG-repeat knock-in animals (a premutation mouse model). Lack of BC1 RNA is known to cause seizure activity and cognitive dysfunction. Our working hypothesis thus predicted that absence, or significantly reduced presence, of BC1 RNA in synapto-dendritic domains of premutation animal neurons would engender cognate phenotypic alterations. Testing this prediction, we established epileptogenic susceptibility and cognitive impairments as major phenotypic abnormalities of CGG premutation mice. In CA3 hippocampal neurons of such animals, synaptic release of glutamate elicits neuronal hyperexcitability in the form of group I metabotropic glutamate receptor–dependent prolonged epileptiform discharges. CGG-repeat knock-in animals are susceptible to sound-induced seizures and are cognitively impaired as revealed in the Attentional Set Shift Task. These phenotypic disturbances occur in young-adult premutation animals, indicating that a neurodevelopmental deficit is an early-initial manifestation of the disorder. The data are consistent with the notion that RNA mislocalization can contribute to pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The cellular environment of the CNS is non-permissive for growth and regeneration. In the retina, transplantation of stem cells has been limited by inefficient survival and integration into existing circuits. In November 2016, as part of the National Eye Institute’s Audacious Goals Initiative (AGI), a diverse collection of investigators gathered for a workshop devoted to articulating the gaps in knowledge, barriers to progress, and ideas for new approaches to understanding cellular environments within the retina and how these environments may be manipulated. In doing so, the group identified the areas of (1) retinal and optic nerve glia, (2) microglia and inflammation, and the (3) extracellular matrix (ECM) and retinal vasculature as key to advancing our understanding and manipulation of the retinal microenvironments. We summarize here the findings of the workshop for the broader scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Nucleus Accumbens Microcircuit Underlying D2-MSN-Driven Increase in Motivation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0386-18.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays a central role in reinforcement and motivation. Around 95% of the NAc neurons are medium spiny neurons (MSNs), divided into those expressing dopamine receptor D1 (D1R) or dopamine receptor D2 (D2R). Optogenetic activation of D2-MSNs increased motivation, whereas inhibition of these neurons produced the opposite effect. Yet, it is still unclear how activation of D2-MSNs affects other local neurons/interneurons or input terminals, and how this contributes for motivation enhancement. To answer this question, in this work we combined optogenetic modulation of D2-MSNs with &lt;i&gt;in loco&lt;/i&gt; pharmacological delivery of specific neurotransmitter antagonists in rats. First, we showed that optogenetic activation of D2-MSNs increases motivation in a progressive ratio task. We demonstrated that this behavioural effect relies on cholinergic-dependent modulation of dopaminergic signalling of ventral tegmental area (VTA) terminals, which requires D1R and D2R signalling in the NAc. D2-MSN optogenetic activation decreased ventral pallidum (VP) activity, reducing the inhibitory tone to VTA, leading to increased dopaminergic activity. Importantly, optogenetic activation of D2-MSN terminals in the VP was sufficient to recapitulate the motivation enhancement. In summary, our data suggests that optogenetic stimulation of NAc D2-MSNs indirectly modulates VTA dopaminergic activity, contributing for increased motivation. Moreover, both types of dopamine receptors signalling in the NAc are required in order to produce the positive behavioural effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key brain region of the reward system and is crucial for motivation. We showed that activation of NAc D2-expressing neurons enhances motivation by modulating VTA dopaminergic activity via ventral pallidum inhibition. The behavioural effect was dependent on local cholinergic-dependent dopamine release by VTA terminals that required D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in the NAc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: August 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Ngang Heok   Tang, Yishi   Jin&lt;br /&gt; Development of a neuron critically depends on the organization of its cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Molecular-level functional magnetic resonance imaging (molecular fMRI) is a new technology that can help bridge these scales by mapping defined microscopic phenomena over large, optically inaccessible regions of the living brain. In this review, we explain how MRI-detectable imaging probes can be used to sensitize noninvasive imaging to mechanistically significant components of neural processing. We discuss how a combination of innovative probe design, advanced imaging methods, and strategies for brain delivery can make molecular fMRI an increasingly successful approach for spatiotemporally resolved studies of diverse neural phenomena, perhaps eventually in people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Although clinically different, they share similar molecular features: the accumulation of one or two proteins in abnormal conformations inside or outside neurons. Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment. Inhibition of a protein phosphatase terminating the unfolded protein response will be discussed as a strategy to protect from diseases associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

To be effective, these systems must be able to simultaneously record and stimulate neural activity, a task made difficult by persistent stimulation artifacts that distort and obscure underlying biomarkers. To enable simultaneous stimulation and recording, several techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve artifact-preventing system configurations, resilient recording front-ends, and back-end signal processing for removing recorded artifacts. Co-designing and integrating these artifact cancellation techniques will be key to enabling neuromodulation systems to stimulate and record at the same time. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for these techniques and their role in achieving artifact-free neuromodulation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

With the development of sensitive genetically encoded calcium indicators, this has extended to the whole-brain imaging of neural activity with cellular resolution. This technique has been used to study brain-wide population dynamics accompanying sensory processing and sensorimotor transformations, and has spurred the development of innovative closed-loop behavioral paradigms in which stimulus–response relationships can be studied. More recently, microscopes have been developed that allow whole-brain calcium imaging in freely swimming and behaving larvae. In this review, we highlight the technologies underlying whole-brain functional imaging in zebrafish, provide examples of the sensory and motor processes that have been studied with this technique, and discuss the need to merge data from whole-brain functional imaging studies with neurochemical and anatomical information to develop holistic models of functional neural circuits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Thanks to the development and optimization of various genetically encoded sensors, we are approaching the stage in which a few key neurotransmitters/neuromodulators can be imaged with high cell specificity and good signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we summarize recent progress regarding these sensors, focusing on their design principles, properties, potential applications, and current limitations. We also highlight the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) scaffold as a promising platform that may enable the scalable development of the next generation of sensors, enabling the rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of a large repertoire of neurotransmitters/neuromodulators in vivo at cellular or even subcellular resolution. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;165&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817301915-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Nicholas A   Steinmetz, Christof   Koch, Kenneth D   Harris, Matteo   Carandini&lt;br /&gt; Electrophysiological methods are the gold standard in neuroscience because they reveal the activity of individual neurons at high temporal resolution and in arbitrary brain locations. Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide ∼1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Miao   He, Z Josh   Huang&lt;br /&gt; Understanding brain circuit organization and function requires systematic dissection of its cellular components. With vast cell number and diversity, mammalian nervous systems present a daunting challenge for achieving specific and comprehensive cell type access—prerequisite to circuit analysis. Genetic approaches in the mouse have relied on germline engineering to access marker-defined cell populations. Combinatorial strategies that engage marker intersection, anatomy and projection pattern (e.g. antero-grade and retro-grade viral vectors), and developmental lineage substantially increase the specificity of cell type targeting. While increasing number of mouse cell types are becoming experimentally accessible, comprehensive coverage requires larger coordinated efforts with strategic infrastructural and fiscal planning. CRISPR-based genome editing may enable cell type access in other species, but issues of time, cost and ethics remain, especially for primates. Novel approaches that bypass the germline, such as somatic cell engineering and cell surface-based gene delivery, may reduce the barrier of genetic access to mammalian cell types. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: June 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): I-Wen   Chen, Eirini   Papagiakoumou, Valentina   Emiliani&lt;br /&gt; Optogenetics neuronal targeting combined with single-photon wide-field illumination has already proved its enormous potential in neuroscience, enabling the optical control of entire neuronal networks and disentangling their role in the control of specific behaviors. However, establishing how a single or a sub-set of neurons controls a specific behavior, or how functionally identical neurons are connected in a particular task, or yet how behaviors can be modified in real-time by the complex wiring diagram of neuronal connections requires more sophisticated approaches enabling to drive neuronal circuits activity with single-cell precision and millisecond temporal resolution. This has motivated on one side the development of flexible optical methods for two-photon (2P) optogenetic activation using either, or a hybrid of two approaches: scanning and parallel illumination. On the other side, it has stimulated the engineering of new opsins with modified spectral characteristics, channel kinetics and spatial distribution of expression, offering the necessary flexibility of choosing the appropriate opsin for each application. The need for optical manipulation of multiple targets with millisecond temporal resolution has imposed three-dimension (3D) parallel holographic illumination as the technique of choice for optical control of neuronal circuits organized in 3D. Today 3D parallel illumination exists in several complementary variants, each with a different degree of simplicity, light uniformity, temporal precision and axial resolution. In parallel, the possibility to reach hundreds of targets in 3D volumes has prompted the development of low-repetition rate amplified laser sources enabling high peak power, while keeping low average power for stimulating each cell. All together those progresses open the way for a precise optical manipulation of neuronal circuits with unprecedented precision and flexibility. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;245&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302477-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;249&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: August 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Kelsey A   Herrmann, Heather T   Broihier&lt;br /&gt; Although retrograde neurotrophin signaling has provided an immensely influential paradigm for understanding growth factor signaling in the nervous system, recent studies indicate that growth factors also signal via cell-autonomous, or autocrine, mechanisms. Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<description>Publication date: August 2018&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51&lt;br /&gt;     Author(s): Natali L   Chanaday, Ege T   Kavalali&lt;br /&gt; Presynaptic nerve terminals release neurotransmitter synchronously, asynchronously or spontaneously. During synchronous neurotransmission release is precisely coupled to action potentials, in contrast, asynchronous release events show only loose temporal coupling to presynaptic activity whereas spontaneous neurotransmission occurs independent of presynaptic activity. The mechanisms that give rise to this diversity in neurotransmitter release modes are poorly understood. Recent studies have described several presynaptic molecular pathways controlling synaptic vesicle pool segregation and recycling, which in turn may dictate distinct modes of neurotransmitter release. In this article, we review this recent work regarding neurotransmitter release modes and their relationship to synaptic vesicle pool dynamics as well as the molecular machinery that establishes synaptic vesicle pool identity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Clamping and Synchronization in the strongly coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo model. (arXiv:1804.06758v1 [math.AP])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06758</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06758</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigate the dynamics of a limit of interacting FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons
in the regime of large interaction coefficients. We consider the dynamics
described by a mean-field model given by a nonlinear evolution partial
differential equation representing the probability distribution of one given
neuron in a large network. The case of weak connectivity previously studied
displays a unique stationary solution. Here, we consider the case of strong
connectivities, and exhibit the presence of complex, non-necessarily stationary
behaviors. To this end, using Hopf-Cole transformation, we demonstrate that the
solutions exponentially concentrate around a singular Dirac measure as the
connectivity parameter diverges, centered at the zeros of a time-dependent
continuous function. We next characterize the points at which the measure
concentrates, and exhibit a particular solution corresponding to a Dirac
measure at a time satisfy an ordinary differential equation identical to the
original FitzHugh-Nagumo system. Classically, this solution may feature
multiple stable fixed points or periodic orbits, respectively corresponding to
a clumping of the whole system at rest, or a synchronization of cells on a
periodic solution. We illustrate these results with numerical simulations of
neural networks with a relatively modest number of neurons and finite coupling
strength, and show that away from the bifurcations of the limit system, the
asymptotic equation recovers the main properties of more realistic networks.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Functional connectivity alterations in Parkinson\'s disease during the stop-signal task</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/304584v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Although deficits in response inhibition are common in Parkinsons disease (PD), studies on their neural correlates are relatively scarce. In our previous study, medication-naive PD patients showed, among others, lower activation of the inhibition-related bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) compared with healthy controls while performing the stop-signal task. Here we report on a follow-up study in the same cohort. Fourteen medicated PD patients and 16 healthy controls performed the same stop-signal task during MRI; 3.1 +/- 1.0 years after our previous study. During that time, all PD patients had started to use dopaminergic medication. We analyzed task-related functional activity and connectivity in the bilateral IFG and anterior insula, brain regions that are important response inhibition. Task-related functional connectivity was analyzed with generalized psychophysiological interaction. PD patients were significantly slower on response initiation (GO reaction time) and response inhibition (stop-signal reaction time) than healthy controls. There were no between-group differences in functional activity. On the other hand, functional connectivity of the IFG and anterior insula was significantly lower in PD compared with healthy controls. Mainly the inferior parietal lobule and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were less connected with these seed regions. These results show that early-stage medicated PD patients show lower task-related functional connectivity but not activity of brain regions that are important for response inhibition; the IFG and anterior insula. We tentatively speculate that the use of dopaminergic medication upheld task-related activity but not connectivity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Tinnitus development is associated with synaptopathy of inner hair cells in Mongolian gerbils</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/304576v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/304576v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Human hearing loss is often accompanied by comorbidities like tinnitus. This perception of phantom sounds without external stimulation is affecting up to 15% of the adult population and can lead to psychological disorders like depression. Animal studies in rodents could show that tinnitus may not only be a result of hearing loss due to cochlear hair cell damage but can also be a consequence of synaptopathy at the inner hair cells already induced by moderate sound traumata (hidden hearing loss). In this study we investigate the synaptopathy previously shown in mice in our animal model, the Mongolian gerbil, and relate it to behavioral signs of tinnitus in this species. Tinnitus was induced by a mild monaural acoustic trauma leading to a monaural noise induced hearing loss in the animals quantified by auditory brainstem response audiometry. Behavioral signs of tinnitus percepts were detected by measurement of pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response in a gap-noise paradigm in about two-thirds of the animals. 14 days after trauma the cochleae of traumatized and non-traumatized ears were isolated and inner hair cell synapses were counted within several spectral regions of the cochlea. In the here presented preliminary data inner hair cell synaptopathy was only found in animals with behavioral signs of tinnitus, independent of type of hearing loss. On the other hand, animals with apparent hearing loss but without behavioral signs of tinnitus showed a reduction in amplitudes of auditory brainstem response waves I/II (cochlear nerve and dorsal cochlear nucleus) but no significant changes in the number of synapses at the inner hair cells. We conclude - in line with the literature - that hearing loss is caused by damage to the inner and / or outer hair cells but that the development of tinnitus, at least in our animal model is closely linked to synaptopathy at the inner hair cells.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Unilateral movement preparation causes task-specific modulation of TMS responses in the passive, opposite limb.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/304410v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/304410v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Corticospinal excitability is modulated for muscles on both sides of the body during unilateral movement preparation. For the effector, there is a progressive increase in excitability, and a shift in direction of muscle twitches evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) toward the impending movement. By contrast, the directional characteristics of excitability changes in the opposite (passive) limb have not been fully characterized. Here we assessed how preparation of voluntary forces towards four spatially distinct visual targets with the left wrist alters muscle twitches and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by TMS of left motor cortex. MEPs were facilitated significantly more in muscles homologous to agonist rather than antagonist muscles in the active limb, from 120 ms prior to voluntary EMG onset. Thus, unilateral motor preparation has a directionally-specific influence on pathways projecting to the opposite limb that corresponds to the active muscles rather than the direction of movement in space. The directions of TMS-evoked twitches also deviated toward the impending force direction of the active limb, according to muscle-based coordinates, following the onset of voluntary EMG. The data indicate that preparation of a unilateral movement increases task-dependent excitability in ipsilateral motor cortex, or its downstream projections, that reflect the forces applied by the active limb in an intrinsic (body-centered), rather than an extrinsic (world-centered), coordinate system. The results suggest that ipsilateral motor cortical activity prior to unilateral action reflects the state of the active limb, rather than subliminal motor planning for the passive limb.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Bayesian reconstruction of transmission within outbreaks using genomic variants</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006117</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicola De Maio, Colin J. Worby, Daniel J. Wilson, Nicole Stoesser&lt;/p&gt;

Pathogen genome sequencing can reveal details of transmission histories and is a powerful tool in the fight against infectious disease. In particular, within-host pathogen genomic variants identified through heterozygous nucleotide base calls are a potential source of information to identify linked cases and infer direction and time of transmission. However, using such data effectively to model disease transmission presents a number of challenges, including differentiating genuine variants from those observed due to sequencing error, as well as the specification of a realistic model for within-host pathogen population dynamics. Here we propose a new Bayesian approach to transmission inference, BadTrIP (BAyesian epiDemiological TRansmission Inference from Polymorphisms), that explicitly models evolution of pathogen populations in an outbreak, transmission (including transmission bottlenecks), and sequencing error. BadTrIP enables the inference of host-to-host transmission from pathogen sequencing data and epidemiological data. By assuming that genomic variants are unlinked, our method does not require the computationally intensive and unreliable reconstruction of individual haplotypes. Using simulations we show that BadTrIP is robust in most scenarios and can accurately infer transmission events by efficiently combining information from genetic and epidemiological sources; thanks to its realistic model of pathogen evolution and the inclusion of epidemiological data, BadTrIP is also more accurate than existing approaches. BadTrIP is distributed as an open source package (https://bitbucket.org/nicofmay/badtrip) for the phylogenetic software BEAST2. We apply our method to reconstruct transmission history at the early stages of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, showcasing the power of within-host genomic variants to reconstruct transmission events.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rbi3PORvpr0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Viruses and bacteria are critical components of the human microbiome and play important roles in health and disease. Most previous work has relied on studying bacteria and viruses independently, thereby reducing them to two separate communities. Such approaches are unable to capture how these microbial communities interact, such as through processes that maintain community robustness or allow phage-host populations to co-evolve. We implemented a network-based analytical approach to describe phage-bacteria network diversity throughout the human body. We built these community networks using a machine learning algorithm to predict which phages could infect which bacteria in a given microbiome. Our algorithm was applied to paired viral and bacterial metagenomic sequence sets from three previously published human cohorts. We organized the predicted interactions into networks that allowed us to evaluate phage-bacteria connectedness across the human body. We observed evidence that gut and skin network structures were person-specific and not conserved among cohabitating family members. High-fat diets appeared to be associated with less connected networks. Network structure differed between skin sites, with those exposed to the external environment being less connected and likely more susceptible to network degradation by microbial extinction events. This study quantified and contrasted the diversity of virome-microbiome networks across the human body and illustrated how environmental factors may influence phage-bacteria interactive dynamics. This work provides a baseline for future studies to better understand system perturbations, such as disease states, through ecological networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_YNV8fo1dhc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The annotation of small molecules is one of the most challenging and important steps in untargeted mass spectrometry analysis, as most of our biological interpretations rely on structural annotations. Molecular networking has emerged as a structured way to organize and mine data from untargeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments and has been widely applied to propagate annotations. However, propagation is done through manual inspection of MS/MS spectra connected in the spectral networks and is only possible when a reference library spectrum is available. One of the alternative approaches used to annotate an unknown fragmentation mass spectrum is through the use of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions. One of the challenges of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; annotation is the uncertainty around the correct structure among the predicted candidate lists. Here we show how molecular networking can be used to improve the accuracy of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions through propagation of structural annotations, even when there is no match to a MS/MS spectrum in spectral libraries. This is accomplished through creating a network consensus of re-ranked structural candidates using the molecular network topology and structural similarity to improve &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; annotations. The Network Annotation Propagation (NAP) tool is accessible through the GNPS web-platform https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-theoretical.jsp.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/47QEVW0Mj6Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Following the loss of a sensory modality, such as deafness or blindness, crossmodal plasticity is commonly identified in regions of the cerebrum that normally process the deprived modality. It has been hypothesized that significant changes in the patterns of cortical afferent and efferent projections may underlie these functional crossmodal changes. However, studies of thalamocortical and corticocortical connections have refuted this hypothesis, instead revealing a profound resilience of cortical afferent projections following deafness and blindness. This report is the first study of cortical outputs following sensory deprivation, characterizing cortical projections to the superior colliculus in mature cats (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 5, 3 female) with perinatal-onset deafness. The superior colliculus was exposed to a retrograde pathway tracer, and subsequently labeled cells throughout the cerebrum were identified and quantified. Overall, the percentage of cortical projections arising from auditory cortex was substantially increased, not decreased, in early-deaf cats compared with intact animals. Furthermore, the distribution of labeled cortical neurons was no longer localized to a particular cortical subregion of auditory cortex but dispersed across auditory cortical regions. Collectively, these results demonstrate that, although patterns of cortical afferents are stable following perinatal deafness, the patterns of cortical efferents to the superior colliculus are highly mutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When a sense is lost, the remaining senses are functionally enhanced through compensatory crossmodal plasticity. In deafness, brain regions that normally process sound contribute to enhanced visual and somatosensory perception. We demonstrate that hearing loss alters connectivity between sensory cortex and the superior colliculus, a midbrain region that integrates sensory representations to guide orientation behavior. Contrasting expectation, the proportion of projections from auditory cortex increased in deaf animals compared with normal hearing, with a broad distribution across auditory fields. This is the first description of changes in cortical efferents following sensory loss and provides support for models predicting an inability to form a coherent, multisensory percept of the environment following periods of abnormal development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Primary Traumatic Axonopathy in Mice Subjected to Impact Acceleration: A Reappraisal of Pathology and Mechanisms with High-Resolution Anatomical Methods</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic axonal injury (TAI) is a common neuropathology in traumatic brain injury and is featured by primary injury to axons. Here, we generated TAI with impact acceleration of the head in male &lt;i&gt;Thy1-eYFP-H&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice in which specific populations of neurons and their axons are labeled with yellow fluorescent protein. This model results in axonal lesions in multiple axonal tracts along with blood–brain barrier disruption and neuroinflammation. The corticospinal tract, a prototypical long tract, is severely affected and is the focus of this study. Using optimized CLARITY at single-axon resolution, we visualized the entire corticospinal tract volume from the pons to the cervical spinal cord in 3D and counted the total number of axonal lesions and their progression over time. Our results divulged the presence of progressive traumatic axonopathy that was maximal at the pyramidal decussation. The perikarya of injured corticospinal neurons atrophied, but there was no evidence of neuronal cell death. We also used CLARITY at single-axon resolution to explore the role of the NMNAT2-SARM1 axonal self-destruction pathway in traumatic axonopathy. When we interfered with this pathway by genetically ablating SARM1 or by pharmacological strategies designed to increase levels of Nicotinamide (Nam), a feedback inhibitor of SARM1, we found a significant reduction in the number of axonal lesions early after injury. Our findings show that high-resolution neuroanatomical strategies reveal important features of TAI with biological implications, especially the progressive axonopathic nature of TAI and the role of the NMNAT2-SARM1 pathway in the early stages of axonopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the first systematic application of novel high-resolution neuroanatomical tools in neuropathology, we combined CLARITY with 2-photon microscopy, optimized for detection of single axonal lesions, to reconstruct the injured mouse brainstem in a model of traumatic axonal injury (TAI) that is a common pathology associated with traumatic brain injury. The 3D reconstruction of the corticospinal tract at single-axon resolution allowed for a more advanced level of qualitative and quantitative understanding of TAI. Using this model, we showed that TAI is an axonopathy with a prominent role of the NMNAT2-SARM1 molecular pathway, that is also implicated in peripheral neuropathy. Our results indicate that high-resolution anatomical models of TAI afford a level of detail and sensitivity that is ideal for testing novel molecular and biomechanical hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visual Mismatch and Predictive Coding: A Computational Single-Trial ERP Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/16/4020?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Predictive coding (PC) posits that the brain uses a generative model to infer the environmental causes of its sensory data and uses precision-weighted prediction errors (pwPEs) to continuously update this model. While supported by much circumstantial evidence, experimental tests grounded in formal trial-by-trial predictions are rare. One partial exception is event-related potential (ERP) studies of the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN), where computational models have found signatures of pwPEs and related model-updating processes. Here, we tested this hypothesis in the visual domain, examining possible links between visual mismatch responses and pwPEs. We used a novel visual &quot;roving standard&quot; paradigm to elicit mismatch responses in humans (of both sexes) by unexpected changes in either color or emotional expression of faces. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we simulated pwPE trajectories of a Bayes-optimal observer and used these to conduct a comprehensive trial-by-trial analysis across the time &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; sensor space. We found significant modulation of brain activity by both color and emotion pwPEs. The scalp distribution and timing of these single-trial pwPE responses were in agreement with visual mismatch responses obtained by traditional averaging and subtraction (deviant-minus-standard) approaches. Finally, we compared the Bayesian model to a more classical change model of MMN. Model comparison revealed that trial-wise pwPEs explained the observed mismatch responses better than categorical change detection. Our results suggest that visual mismatch responses reflect trial-wise pwPEs, as postulated by PC. These findings go beyond classical ERP analyses of visual mismatch and illustrate the utility of computational analyses for studying automatic perceptual processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Human perception is thought to rely on a predictive model of the environment that is updated via precision-weighted prediction errors (pwPEs) when events violate expectations. This &quot;predictive coding&quot; view is supported by studies of the auditory mismatch negativity brain potential. However, it is less well known whether visual perception of mismatch relies on similar processes. Here we combined computational modeling and electroencephalography to test whether visual mismatch responses reflected trial-by-trial pwPEs. Applying a Bayesian model to series of face stimuli that violated expectations about color or emotional expression, we found significant modulation of brain activity by both color and emotion pwPEs. A categorical change detection model performed less convincingly. Our findings support the predictive coding interpretation of visual mismatch responses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: HIPK2-Mediated Transcriptional Control of NMDA Receptor Subunit Expression Regulates Neuronal Survival and Cell Death</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;NMDA receptors are critical for neuronal communication. Dysfunction in NMDA receptors has been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases. While it is well recognized that the composition of NMDA receptors undergoes a GluN2B-to-GluN2A switch in early postnatal life, the mechanism regulating this switch remains unclear. Using transcriptomic and functional analyses in brain tissues from male and female &lt;i&gt;Hipk2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hipk2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, we showed that the HIPK2-JNK–c-Jun pathway is important in suppressing the transcription of &lt;i&gt;Grin2a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Grin2c&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes the GluN2A and GluN2C subunits of the NMDA receptors, respectively. Loss of HIPK2 leads to a significant decrease in JNK–c-Jun signaling, which in turn derepresses the transcription of &lt;i&gt;Grin2a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Grin2c&lt;/i&gt; mRNA and upregulates GluN2A and GluN2C protein levels. These changes result in a significant increase of GluN2A/GluN2B ratio in synapse and mitochondria, a persistent activation of the ERK-CREB pathway and the upregulation of synaptic activity-regulated genes, which collectively contribute to the resistance of &lt;i&gt;Hipk2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; neurons to cell death induced by mitochondrial toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We identify HIPK2-JNK–c-Jun signaling as a key mechanism that regulates the transcription of NMDA receptor subunits GluN2A and GluN2C &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Our results provide insights into a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism that control the switch of NMDA receptor subunits in early postnatal brain development. Furthermore, we provide evidence that changes in the ratio of NMDA subunits GluN2A/GluN2B can also be detected in the synapse and mitochondria, which contributes to a persistent activation of the prosurvival ERK-CREB pathway and its downstream target genes. Collectively, these changes protect HIPK2 deficient neurons from mitochondrial toxins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cholinergic Modulation of Frontoparietal Cortical Network Dynamics Supporting Supramodal Attention</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/16/3988?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A critical function of attention is to support a state of readiness to enhance stimulus detection, independent of stimulus modality. The nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) is the major source of the neurochemical acetylcholine (ACh) for frontoparietal cortical networks thought to support attention. We examined a potential supramodal role of ACh in a frontoparietal cortical attentional network supporting target detection. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) in the prelimbic frontal cortex (PFC) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) to assess whether ACh contributed to a state of readiness to alert rats to an impending presentation of visual or olfactory targets in one of five locations. Twenty male Long–Evans rats underwent training and then lesions of the NBM using the selective cholinergic immunotoxin 192 IgG-saporin (0.3 μg/μl; ACh-NBM-lesion) to reduce cholinergic afferentation of the cortical mantle. Postsurgery, ACh-NBM-lesioned rats had less correct responses and more omissions than sham-lesioned rats, which changed parametrically as we increased the attentional demands of the task with decreased target duration. This parametric deficit was found equally for both sensory targets. Accurate detection of visual and olfactory targets was associated specifically with increased LFP coherence, in the beta range, between the PFC and PPC, and with increased beta power in the PPC before the target's appearance in sham-lesioned rats. Readiness-associated changes in brain activity and visual and olfactory target detection were attenuated in the ACh-NBM-lesioned group. Accordingly, ACh may support supramodal attention via modulating activity in a frontoparietal cortical network, orchestrating a state of readiness to enhance target detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We examined whether the neurochemical acetylcholine (ACh) contributes to a state of readiness for target detection, by engaging frontoparietal cortical attentional networks independent of modality. We show that ACh supported alerting attention to an impending presentation of either visual or olfactory targets. Using local field potentials, enhanced stimulus detection was associated with an anticipatory increase in power in the beta oscillation range before the target's appearance within the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) as well as increased synchrony, also in beta, between the prefrontal cortex and PPC. These readiness-associated changes in brain activity and behavior were attenuated in rats with reduced cortical ACh. Thus, ACh may act, in a supramodal manner, to prepare frontoparietal cortical attentional networks for target detection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Variations in Ca2+ Influx Can Alter Chelator-Based Estimates of Ca2+ Channel-Synaptic Vesicle Coupling Distance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/16/3971?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The timing and probability of synaptic vesicle fusion from presynaptic terminals is governed by the distance between voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (VGCCs) and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensors for exocytosis. This VGCC-sensor coupling distance can be determined from the fractional block of vesicular release by exogenous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; chelators, which depends on biophysical factors that have not been thoroughly explored. Using numerical simulations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; reaction and diffusion, as well as vesicular release, we examined the contributions of conductance, density, and open duration of VGCCs, and the influence of endogenous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; buffers on the inhibition of exocytosis by EGTA. We found that estimates of coupling distance are critically influenced by the duration and amplitude of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx at active zones, but relatively insensitive to variations of mobile endogenous buffer. High concentrations of EGTA strongly inhibit vesicular release in close proximity (20-30 nm) to VGCCs if the flux duration is brief, but have little influence for longer flux durations that saturate the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor. Therefore, the diversity in presynaptic action potential duration is sufficient to alter EGTA inhibition, resulting in errors potentially as large as 300% if Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry durations are not considered when estimating VGCC–sensor coupling distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANT STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The coupling distance between voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensors for exocytosis critically determines the timing and probability of neurotransmitter release. Perfusion of presynaptic terminals with the exogenous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; chelator EGTA has been widely used for both qualitative and quantitative estimates of this distance. However, other presynaptic terminal parameters such as the amplitude and duration of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry can also influence EGTA inhibition of exocytosis, thus confounding conclusions based on EGTA alone. Here, we performed reaction–diffusion simulations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-driven synaptic vesicle fusion, which delineate the critical parameters influencing an accurate prediction of coupling distance. Our study provides guidelines for characterizing and understanding how variability in coupling distance across chemical synapses could be estimated accurately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Robust Visual Responses and Normal Retinotopy in Primate Lateral Geniculate Nucleus following Long-term Lesions of Striate Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/16/3955?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/16/3955?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Lesions of striate cortex (V1) trigger massive retrograde degeneration of neurons in the LGN. In primates, these lesions also lead to scotomas, within which conscious vision is abolished. Mediation of residual visual capacity within these regions (blindsight) has been traditionally attributed to an indirect visual pathway to the extrastriate cortex, which involves the superior colliculus and pulvinar complex. However, recent studies have suggested that preservation of the LGN is critical for behavioral evidence of blindsight, raising the question of what type of visual information is channeled by remaining neurons in this structure. A possible contribution of LGN neurons to blindsight is predicated on two conditions: that the neurons that survive degeneration remain visually responsive, and that their receptive fields continue to represent the region of the visual field inside the scotoma. We tested these conditions in male and female marmoset monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/i&gt;) with partial V1 lesions at three developmental stages (early postnatal life, young adulthood, old age), followed by long recovery periods. In all cases, recordings from the degenerated LGN revealed neurons with well-formed receptive fields throughout the scotoma. The responses were consistent and robust, and followed the expected eye dominance and retinotopy observed in the normal LGN. The responses had short latencies and preceded those of neurons recorded in the extrastriate middle temporal area. These findings suggest that the pathway that links LGN neurons to the extrastriate cortex is physiologically viable and can support residual vision in animals with V1 lesions incurred at various ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Patients with a lesion of the primary visual cortex (V1) can retain certain visually mediated behaviors, particularly if the lesion occurs early in life. This phenomenon (&quot;blindsight&quot;) not only sheds light on the nature of consciousness, but also has implications for studies of brain circuitry, development, and plasticity. However, the pathways that mediate blindsight have been the subject of debate. Recent studies suggest that projections from the LGN might be critical, but this finding is puzzling given that the lesions causes severe cell death in the LGN. Here we demonstrate in monkeys that the surviving LGN neurons retain a remarkable level of visual function and could therefore be the source of the visual information that supports blindsight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Gain-of-Function Mutation in the {alpha}9 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Alters Medial Olivocochlear Efferent Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/16/3939?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/16/3939?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gain control of the auditory system operates at multiple levels. Cholinergic medial olivocochlear (MOC) fibers originate in the brainstem and make synaptic contacts at the base of the outer hair cells (OHCs), the final targets of several feedback loops from the periphery and higher-processing centers. Efferent activation inhibits OHC active amplification within the mammalian cochlea, through the activation of a calcium-permeable α9α10 ionotropic cholinergic nicotinic receptor (nAChR), functionally coupled to calcium activated SK2 potassium channels. Correct operation of this feedback requires careful matching of acoustic input with the strength of cochlear inhibition (Galambos, 1956; Wiederhold and Kiang, 1970; Gifford and Guinan, 1987), which is driven by the rate of MOC activity and short-term facilitation at the MOC–OHC synapse (Ballestero et al., 2011; Katz and Elgoyhen, 2014). The present work shows (in mice of either sex) that a mutation in the α9α10 nAChR with increased duration of channel gating (Taranda et al., 2009) greatly elongates hair cell-evoked IPSCs and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. Interestingly, MOC–OHC synapses of &lt;i&gt;L9&lt;/i&gt;'&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; mice presented reduced quantum content and increased presynaptic facilitation. These phenotypic changes lead to enhanced and sustained synaptic responses and OHC hyperpolarization upon high-frequency stimulation of MOC terminals. At the cochlear physiology level these changes were matched by a longer time course of efferent MOC suppression. This indicates that the properties of the MOC–OHC synapse directly determine the efficacy of the MOC feedback to the cochlea being a main player in the &quot;gain control&quot; of the auditory periphery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Plasticity can involve reciprocal signaling across chemical synapses. An opportunity to study this phenomenon occurs in the mammalian cochlea whose sensitivity is regulated by efferent olivocochlear neurons. These release acetylcholine to inhibit sensory hair cells. A point mutation in the hair cell's acetylcholine receptor that leads to increased gating of the receptor greatly elongates IPSCs. Interestingly, efferent terminals from mutant mice present a reduced resting release probability. However, upon high-frequency stimulation transmitter release facilitates strongly to produce stronger and far longer-lasting inhibition of cochlear function. Thus, central neuronal feedback on cochlear hair cells provides an opportunity to define plasticity mechanisms in cholinergic synapses other than the highly studied neuromuscular junction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Convergent Spinal Circuits Facilitating Human Wrist Flexors</title>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/16/3929?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Noninvasive assessment of spinal circuitry in humans is limited, especially for Ib pathways in the upper limb. We developed a protocol in which we evoke the H-reflex in flexor carpi radialis (FCR) by median nerve stimulation and condition it with electrical stimulation above motor threshold over the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscle belly. Eighteen healthy adults (8 male, 10 female) took part in the study. There was a clear reflex facilitation at a 30 ms interstimulus interval (ISI) and suppression at a 70 ms ISI, which was highly consistent across subjects. We investigated the following two hypotheses of the possible source of the facilitation: (1) ECR Ib afferents from Golgi tendon organs, activated by the twitch following ECR stimulation; and (2) FCR afferents, from spindles and/or Golgi tendon organs, activated by the wrist extension movement that follows ECR stimulation. Several human and monkey experiments indicated a role for both of these sets of afferents. Our results provide evidence for a spinal circuit in which flexor motoneurons receive convergent excitatory input from flexor afferents as well as from extensor Ib afferents; this circuit can be straightforwardly assessed noninvasively in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we described a novel spinal circuit, which is easy to assess noninvasively in humans. Understanding this circuit in more detail could be beneficial for the design of clinical tests in neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Effects of Aging on Cortical Neural Dynamics and Local Sleep Homeostasis in Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/16/3911?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/16/3911?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Healthy aging is associated with marked effects on sleep, including its daily amount and architecture, as well as the specific EEG oscillations. Neither the neurophysiological underpinnings nor the biological significance of these changes are understood, and crucially the question remains whether aging is associated with reduced sleep need or a diminished capacity to generate sufficient sleep. Here we tested the hypothesis that aging may affect local cortical networks, disrupting the capacity to generate and sustain sleep oscillations, and with it the local homeostatic response to sleep loss. We performed chronic recordings of cortical neural activity and local field potentials from the motor cortex in young and older male C57BL/6J mice, during spontaneous waking and sleep, as well as during sleep after sleep deprivation. In older animals, we observed an increase in the incidence of non-rapid eye movement sleep local field potential slow waves and their associated neuronal silent (OFF) periods, whereas the overall pattern of state-dependent cortical neuronal firing was generally similar between ages. Furthermore, we observed that the response to sleep deprivation at the level of local cortical network activity was not affected by aging. Our data thus suggest that the local cortical neural dynamics and local sleep homeostatic mechanisms, at least in the motor cortex, are not impaired during healthy senescence in mice. This indicates that powerful protective or compensatory mechanisms may exist to maintain neuronal function stable across the life span, counteracting global changes in sleep amount and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The biological significance of age-dependent changes in sleep is unknown but may reflect either a diminished sleep need or a reduced capacity to generate deep sleep stages. As aging has been linked to profound disruptions in cortical sleep oscillations and because sleep need is reflected in specific patterns of cortical activity, we performed chronic electrophysiological recordings of cortical neural activity during waking, sleep, and after sleep deprivation from young and older mice. We found that all main hallmarks of cortical activity during spontaneous sleep and recovery sleep after sleep deprivation were largely intact in older mice, suggesting that the well-described age-related changes in global sleep are unlikely to arise from a disruption of local network dynamics within the neocortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Kainate Receptors Inhibit Glutamate Release Via Mobilization of Endocannabinoids in Striatal Direct Pathway Spiny Projection Neurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/16/3901?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/16/3901?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Kainate receptors are members of the glutamate receptor family that function by both generating ionotropic currents through an integral ion channel pore and coupling to downstream metabotropic signaling pathways. They are highly expressed in the striatum, yet their roles in regulating striatal synapses are not known. Using mice of both sexes, we demonstrate that GluK2-containing kainate receptors expressed in direct pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs) inhibit glutamate release at corticostriatal synapses in the dorsolateral striatum. This inhibition requires postsynaptic kainate-receptor-mediated mobilization of a retrograde endocannabinoid (eCB) signal and activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors. This pathway can be activated during repetitive 25 Hz trains of synaptic stimulation, causing short-term depression of corticostriatal synapses. This is the first study to demonstrate a role for kainate receptors in regulating eCB-mediated plasticity at the corticostriatal synapse and demonstrates an important role for these receptors in regulating basal ganglia circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The &lt;i&gt;GRIK2&lt;/i&gt; gene, encoding the GluK2 subunit of the kainate receptor, has been linked to several neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Perseverative behaviors associated with OCD are known to result from pathophysiological changes in the striatum and kainate receptor knock-out mice have striatal-dependent phenotypes. However, the role of kainate receptors in striatal synapses is not known. We demonstrate that GluK2-containing kainate receptors regulate corticostriatal synapses by mobilizing endocannabinoids from direct pathway spiny projection neurons. Synaptic activation of GluK2 receptors during trains of synaptic input causes short-term synaptic depression, demonstrating a novel role for these receptors in regulating striatal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microdeletion of a region in chromosome 16p11.2 increases susceptibility to autism. Although this region contains exons of 29 genes, disrupting only a small segment of the region, which spans five genes, is sufficient to cause autistic traits. One candidate gene in this critical segment is &lt;i&gt;MVP&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes for the major vault protein (MVP) that has been implicated in regulation of cellular transport mechanisms. MVP expression levels in &lt;i&gt;MVP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice closely phenocopy those of 16p11.2 mutant mice, suggesting that &lt;i&gt;MVP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice may serve as a model of MVP function in 16p11.2 microdeletion. Here we show that MVP regulates the homeostatic component of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in primary visual cortex. &lt;i&gt;MVP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice of both sexes show impairment in strengthening of open-eye responses after several days of monocular deprivation (MD), whereas closed-eye responses are weakened as normal, resulting in reduced overall OD plasticity. The frequency of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in pyramidal neurons is decreased in &lt;i&gt;MVP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice after extended MD, suggesting a reduction of functional synapses. Correspondingly, upregulation of surface GluA1 AMPA receptors is reduced in &lt;i&gt;MVP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice after extended MD, and is accompanied by altered expression of STAT1 and phosphorylated ERK, which have been previously implicated in OD plasticity. Normalization of STAT1 levels by introducing STAT1 shRNA rescues surface GluA1 and open-eye responses, implicating STAT1 as a downstream effector of MVP. These findings demonstrate a specific role for MVP as a key molecule influencing the homeostatic component of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, and potentially the corresponding phenotypes of 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Major vault protein (MVP), a candidate gene in 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome, has been implicated in the regulation of several cellular processes including transport mechanisms and scaffold signaling. However, its role in brain function and plasticity remains unknown. In this study, we identified MVP as an important regulator of the homeostatic component of experience-dependent plasticity, via regulation of STAT1 and ERK signaling. This study helps reveal a new mechanism for an autism-related gene in brain function, and suggests a broader role for neuro-immune interactions in circuit level plasticity. Importantly, our findings might explain specific components of the pathophysiology of 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Fractone Bulbs Derive from Ependymal Cells and Their Laminin Composition Influence the Stem Cell Niche in the Subventricular Zone</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/16/3880?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fractones are extracellular matrix structures in the neural stem cell niche of the subventricular zone (SVZ), where they appear as round deposits named bulbs or thin branching lines called stems. Their cellular origin and what determines their localization at this site is poorly studied, and it remains unclear whether they influence neural stem and progenitor cell formation, proliferation, and/or maintenance. To address these questions, we analyzed whole-mount preparations of the lateral ventricle of male and female mice by confocal microscopy using different extracellular matrix and cell markers. We found that bulbs are rarely connected to stems and that they contain laminin α5 and α2 chains, respectively. Fractone bulbs were profusely distributed throughout the SVZ and appeared associated with the center of pinwheels, a critical site for adult neurogenesis. We demonstrate that bulbs appear at the apical membrane of ependymal cells at the end of the first week after birth. The use of transgenic mice lacking laminin α5 gene expression (&lt;i&gt;Lama5&lt;/i&gt;) in endothelium and in FoxJ1-expressing ependymal cells revealed ependymal cells as the source of laminin α5-containing fractone bulbs. Deletion of laminin α5 from ependymal cells correlated with a 60% increase in cell proliferation, as determined by phospho-histone H3 staining, and with a selective reduction in the number of slow-dividing cells. These results indicate that fractones are a key component of the SVZ and suggest that laminin α5 modulates the physiology of the neural stem cell niche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our work unveils key aspects of fractones, extracellular matrix structures that are present in the SVZ that still lack a comprehensive characterization. We show that fractones extensively interact with neural stem cells, whereas some of them are located precisely at pinwheel centers, which are hotspots for adult neurogenesis. Our results also demonstrate that fractones increase in size during aging and that their interactions with neural stem and progenitor cells become more complex in old mice. Last, we show that fractone bulbs are produced by ependymal cells and that their laminin content regulates neural stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Transcriptional events leading to outgrowth of neuronal axons have been intensively studied, but the role of translational regulation in this process is not well understood. Here we use translatome analyses by ribosome pull-down and protein synthesis characterization by metabolic isotopic labeling to study nerve injury and axon outgrowth proteomes in rodent dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and sensory neurons. We identify over 1600 gene products that are primarily translationally regulated in DRG neurons after nerve injury, many of which contain a 5’UTR CERT motif, implicating the translation initiation factor Eif4e in the injury response. We further identified approximately 200 proteins that undergo robust de novo synthesis in the initial stages of axon growth. ApoE is one of the highly synthesized proteins in neurons, and its receptor binding inhibition or knockout affects axon outgrowth. These findings provide a resource for future analyses of the role of translational regulation in neuronal injury responses and axon extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Translatome analyses are used to identify a large cohort of genes that are primarily translationally regulated after nerve injury. Many of these contain a 5'UTR CERT motif, suggesting that the translation initiation factor Eif4e may be involved in the injury response. A number of gene products are robustly synthesized in growing axons. The findings suggest that translational events regulate the neuronal injury response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Neuro-Cognitive Effects of Acute Tyrosine Administration on Reactive and Proactive Response Inhibition in Healthy Older Adults</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0035-17.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The aging brain is characterized by altered dopamine signaling. The amino acid tyrosine, a catecholamine precursor, is known to improve cognitive performance in young adults, especially during high environmental demands. Tyrosine administration might also affect catecholamine transmission in the aging brain, thereby improving cognitive functioning. In healthy older adults, impairments have been demonstrated in two forms of response inhibition: reactive inhibition (outright stopping) and proactive inhibition (anticipatory response slowing) under high information load. However, no study has directly compared the effects of a catecholamine precursor on reactive and load-dependent proactive inhibition. In this study we explored the effects of tyrosine on reactive and proactive response inhibition and signal in dopaminergically innervated fronto-striatal regions. Depending on age, tyrosine might lead to beneficial or detrimental neurocognitive effects. We aimed to address these hypotheses in 24 healthy older human adults (aged 61-72 years) using fMRI in a double blind, counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, within-subject design. Across the group, tyrosine did not alter reactive or proactive inhibition behaviorally, but did increase fronto-parietal proactive inhibition-related activation. When taking age into account, tyrosine affected proactive inhibition both behaviorally and neurally. Specifically, increasing age was associated with a greater detrimental effect of tyrosine compared with placebo on proactive slowing. Moreover, with increasing age, tyrosine decreased fronto-striatal and parietal proactive signal, which correlated positively with tyrosine’s effects on proactive slowing. Concluding, tyrosine negatively affected proactive response slowing and associated fronto-striatal activation in an age-dependent manner, highlighting the importance of catecholamines, perhaps particularly dopamine, for proactive response inhibition in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Healthy aging comes with altered dopamine functioning and is associated with reduced performance on cognitive control tasks, such as response inhibition. However, it is yet unclear whether reactive or proactive response inhibition is modulated by dopamine. We addressed this question by administering the catecholamine precursor tyrosine in a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized intervention study. Tyrosine decreased proactive response slowing, not reactive stopping, as a function of increasing age. Concurrently, proactive fronto-striatal and parietal BOLD signal decreased after tyrosine with increasing age. These findings, especially in striatum, demonstrate that proactive, rather than reactive response inhibition, is dopamine dependent. Moreover, tyrosine’s effect on brain and cognition became detrimental with increasing age, questioning the cognitive enhancing potential of tyrosine in healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Drive and measurement electrode patterns for electrode impedance tomography (EIT) imaging of neural activity in peripheral nerve. (arXiv:1804.05994v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05994</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05994</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To establish the performance of several drive and measurement
patterns in EIT imaging of neural activity in peripheral nerve, which involves
large impedance change in the nerve's anisotropic length axis. Approach: Eight
drive and measurement electrode patterns are compared using a finite element
(FE) four cylindrical shell model of a peripheral nerve and a 32 channel
dual-ring nerve cuff. The central layer of the FE model contains impedance
changes representative of neural activity of -0.3 in the length axis and -8.8 x
10-4 in the radial axis. Four of the electrode patterns generate longitudinal
drive current, which runs perpendicular to the anisotropic axis. Main results:
Transverse current patterns produce higher resolution than longitudinal
patterns but are also more susceptible to noise and errors, and exhibit poorer
sensitivity to impedance changes in central sample locations. Three of the four
longitudinal current patterns considered can reconstruct fascicle level
impedance changes with up to 0.2 mV noise and error, which corresponds to
between -5.5 and +0.18 dB of the normalised signal standard deviation. Reducing
the spacing between the two electrode rings in all longitudinal current
patterns reduced the signal to error ratio across all depth locations of the
sample. Significance: Electrode patterns which target the large impedance
change in the anisotropic length axis can provide improved robustness against
noise and errors, which is a critical step towards real time EIT imaging of
neural activity in peripheral nerve.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Appropriate kernels for Divisive Normalization explained by Wilson-Cowan equations. (arXiv:1804.05964v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05964</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05964</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The interaction between wavelet-like sensors in Divisive Normalization is
classically described through Gaussian kernels that decay with spatial
distance, angular distance and frequency distance. However, simultaneous
explanation of (a) distortion perception in natural image databases and (b)
contrast perception of artificial stimuli requires very specific modifications
in classical Divisive Normalization. First, the wavelet response has to be
high-pass filtered before the Gaussian interaction is applied. Then, distinct
weights per subband are also required after the Gaussian interaction. In
summary, the classical Gaussian kernel has to be left- and right-multiplied by
two extra diagonal matrices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper we provide a lower-level justification for this specific
empirical modification required in the Gaussian kernel of Divisive
Normalization. Here we assume that the psychophysical behavior described by
Divisive Normalization comes from neural interactions following the
Wilson-Cowan equations. In particular, we identify the Divisive Normalization
response with the stationary regime of a Wilson-Cowan model. From this
identification we derive an expression for the Divisive Normalization kernel in
terms of the interaction kernel of the Wilson-Cowan equations. It turns out
that the Wilson-Cowan kernel is left- and-right multiplied by diagonal matrices
with high-pass structure. In conclusion, symmetric Gaussian inhibitory
relations between wavelet-like sensors wired in the lower-level Wilson-Cowan
model lead to the appropriate non-symmetric kernel that has to be empirically
included in Divisive Normalization to explain a wider range of phenomena.

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We investigated, in 445 healthy adults whose Heschl’s gyrus (HG) gyrification patterns had been previously identified, how an in vivo MRI marker of intracortical myelination of HG and the planum temporale (PT) varied as a function of HG gyrification pattern and, in cases of duplication, of anatomical characteristics of the second HG (H2). By measuring the MRI T1/T2 ratio in regions of interest covering the first HG (H1), H2 in cases of common stem (H2CSD), or complete posterior duplication (H2CPD) and the PT, we showed that H1 had the highest T1/T2 values, while the PT had the lowest. The major impact of duplication was a decrease in both H1 and PT T1/T2 values in cases of left CPD. Concerning H2, the right and left T1/T2 values of right H2CSD were closer to those of H1, and those of left H2CPD were closer to those of PT. After adjusting for verbal skills, rhyming performance was not associated with T1/T2 values in left regions, but it decreased with increasing right PT T1/T2 values. These results reveal the existence of hemispheric differences in H2 myelination and underline the importance of neuroimaging markers of intracortical myelination for investigating brain structure–function relationships.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Mature granule cells are poorly excitable neurons that were recently shown to fire action potentials, preferentially in bursts. It is believed that the particularly pronounced short-term facilitation of mossy fiber synapses makes granule cell bursting a very effective means of properly transferring information to CA3. However, the mechanism underlying the unique bursting behavior of mature granule cells is currently unknown. Here, we show that Cav3.2 T-type channels at the axon initial segment are responsible for burst firing of mature granule cells in rats and mice. Accordingly, Cav3.2 knockout mice fire tonic spikes and exhibit impaired bursting, synaptic plasticity and dentate-to-CA3 communication. The data show that Cav3.2 channels are strong modulators of bursting and can be considered a critical molecular switch that enables effective information transfer from mature granule cells to the CA3 pyramids.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

In addition, it directly influences neural development, although its role in the forming forebrain is less well elucidated. It was recently suggested that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Vegfa&lt;/span&gt; may influence the development of GABAergic interneurons, inhibitory cells with crucial signaling roles in cortical neuronal circuits. However, the mechanism by which it affects interneuron development remains unknown. Here we investigated the developmental processes by which &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Vegfa&lt;/span&gt; may influence cortical interneuron development by analyzing transgenic mice that ubiquitously express the Vegfa120 isoform to perturb its signaling gradient. We found that interneurons reach the dorsal cortex at mid phases of corticogenesis despite an aberrant vascular network. Instead, endothelial ablation of Vegfa alters cortical interneuron numbers, their intracortical distribution and spatial proximity to blood vessels. We show for the first time that vascular-secreted guidance factors promote early-migrating interneurons in the intact forebrain in vivo and identify a novel role for vascular-Vegfa in this process.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Constitutive Inactivation of the PRRT2 Gene Alters Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity and Promotes Network Hyperexcitability in Hippocampal Neurons</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Mutations in PRoline-Rich Transmembrane protein 2 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;PRRT2&lt;/span&gt;) underlie a group of paroxysmal disorders including epilepsy, kinesigenic dyskinesia and migraine. Most of the mutations lead to impaired PRRT2 expression and/or function, emphasizing the pathogenic role of the PRRT2 deficiency. In this work, we investigated the phenotype of primary hippocampal neurons obtained from mouse embryos in which the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;PRRT2&lt;/span&gt; gene was constitutively inactivated. Although PRRT2 is expressed by both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, its deletion decreases the number of excitatory synapses without significantly affecting the number of inhibitory synapses or the nerve terminal ultrastructure. Analysis of synaptic function in primary PRRT2 knockout excitatory neurons by live imaging and electrophysiology showed slowdown of the kinetics of exocytosis, weakened spontaneous and evoked synaptic transmission and markedly increased facilitation. Inhibitory neurons showed strengthening of basal synaptic transmission, accompanied by faster depression. At the network level these complex synaptic effects resulted in a state of heightened spontaneous and evoked activity that was associated with increased excitability of excitatory neurons in both PRRT2 knockout primary cultures and acute hippocampal slices. The data indicate the existence of network instability/hyperexcitability as the possible basis of the paroxysmal phenotypes associated with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;PRRT2&lt;/span&gt; mutations.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Relationships Between Tau and Glucose Metabolism Reflect Alzheimer’s Disease Pathology in Cognitively Normal Older Adults</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Tau is associated with hypometabolism in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. In normal aging, the association between tau and glucose metabolism is not fully characterized. We used [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F] AV-1451, [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F] Fluorodeoxyglucose, and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C] Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) PET to measure associations between tau and glucose metabolism in cognitively normal older adults (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 49). Participants were divided into amyloid-negative (PiB–, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 28) and amyloid-positive (PiB+, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 21) groups to determine effects of amyloid-β. We assessed both local and across-brain regional tau–glucose metabolism associations separately in PiB–/PiB+ groups using correlation matrices and sparse canonical correlations. Relationships between tau and glucose metabolism differed by amyloid status, and were primarily spatially distinct. In PiB– subjects, tau was associated with broad regions of increased glucose metabolism. In PiB+ subjects, medial temporal lobe tau was associated with widespread hypometabolism, while tau outside of the medial temporal lobe was associated with decreased and increased glucose metabolism. We further found that regions with earlier tau spread were associated with stronger negative correlations with glucose metabolism. Our findings indicate that in normal aging, low levels of tau are associated with a phase of increased metabolism, while high levels of tau in the presence of amyloid-β are associated with hypometabolism at downstream sites.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cross-Task Contributions of Frontobasal Ganglia Circuitry in Response Inhibition and Conflict-Induced Slowing</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Why are we so slow in choosing the lesser of 2 evils? We considered whether such slowing relates to uncertainty about the value of these options, which arises from the tendency to avoid them during learning, and whether such slowing relates to frontosubthalamic inhibitory control mechanisms. In total, 49 participants performed a reinforcement-learning task and a stop-signal task while fMRI was recorded. A reinforcement-learning model was used to quantify learning strategies. Individual differences in lose–lose slowing related to information uncertainty due to sampling, and independently, to less efficient response inhibition in the stop-signal task. Neuroimaging analysis revealed an analogous dissociation: subthalamic nucleus (STN) BOLD activity related to variability in stopping latencies, whereas weaker frontosubthalamic connectivity related to slowing and information sampling. Across tasks, fast inhibitors increased STN activity for successfully canceled responses in the stop task, but decreased activity for lose–lose choices. These data support the notion that fronto-STN communication implements a rapid but transient brake on response execution, and that slowing due to decision uncertainty could result from an inefficient release of this “hold your horses” mechanism.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Mapping Cortical Laminar Structure in the 3D BigBrain</title>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy074/4975486?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Histological sections offer high spatial resolution to examine laminar architecture of the human cerebral cortex; however, they are restricted by being 2D, hence only regions with sufficiently optimal cutting planes can be analyzed. Conversely, noninvasive neuroimaging approaches are whole brain but have relatively low resolution. Consequently, correct 3D cross-cortical patterns of laminar architecture have never been mapped in histological sections. We developed an automated technique to identify and analyze laminar structure within the high-resolution 3D histological BigBrain. We extracted white matter and pial surfaces, from which we derived histologically verified surfaces at the layer I/II boundary and within layer IV. Layer IV depth was strongly predicted by cortical curvature but varied between areas. This fully automated 3D laminar analysis is an important requirement for bridging high-resolution 2D cytoarchitecture and in vivo 3D neuroimaging. It lays the foundation for in-depth, whole-brain analyses of cortical layering.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Ventromedial Prefrontal Volume in Adolescence Predicts Hyperactive/Inattentive Symptoms in Adulthood</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Youths with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptomatology often exhibit residual inattention and/or hyperactivity in adulthood; however, this is not true for all individuals. We recently reported that dimensional, multi-informant ratings of hyperactive/inattentive symptoms are associated with ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) structure. Herein, we investigate the degree to which vmPFC structure during adolescence predicts hyperactive/inattentive symptomatology at 5-year follow-up. Structural equation modeling was used to test the extent to which adolescent vmPFC volume predicts hyperactive/inattentive symptomatology 5 years later in early adulthood. 1104 participants (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt; = 14.52 years, standard deviation = 0.42; 583 females) possessed hyperactive/inattentive symptom data at 5-year follow-up, as well as quality controlled neuroimaging data and complete psychometric data at baseline. Self-reports of hyperactive/inattentive symptomatology were obtained during adolescence and at 5-year follow-up using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). At baseline and 5-year follow-up, a hyperactive/inattentive latent variable was derived from items on the SDQ. Baseline vmPFC volume predicted adult hyperactive/inattentive symptomatology (standardized coefficient = −0.274, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) while controlling for baseline hyperactive/inattentive symptomatology. These results are the first to reveal relations between adolescent brain structure and adult hyperactive/inattentive symptomatology, and suggest that early structural development of the vmPFC may be consequential for the subsequent expression of hyperactive/inattentive symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Transcription Factor LHX1 Regulates the Survival and Directed Migration of POA-derived Cortical Interneurons</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy063</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The delicate balance of excitation and inhibition is crucial for proper function of the cerebral cortex, relying on the accurate number and subtype composition of inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric (GABA)-expressing interneurons. Various intrinsic and extrinsic factors precisely orchestrate their multifaceted development including the long-range migration from the basal telencephalon to cortical targets as well as interneuron survival throughout the developmental period. Particularly expressed guidance receptors were described to channel the migration of cortical interneurons deriving from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and the preoptic area (POA) along distinct routes. Hence, unveiling the regulatory genetic networks controlling subtype-specific gene expression profiles is key to understand interneuron-specific developmental programs and to reveal causes for associated disorders. In contrast to MGE-derived interneurons, little is known about the transcriptional networks in interneurons born in the POA. Here, we provide first evidence for the LIM-homeobox transcription factor LHX1 as a crucial key player in the post-mitotic development of POA-derived cortical interneurons. By transcriptional regulation of related genes, LHX1 modulates their survival as well as the subtype-specific expression of guidance receptors of the Eph/ephrin family, thereby affecting directional migration and layer distribution in the adult cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neurocognitive Profiles of Older Adults with Working-Memory Dysfunction</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Individuals differ in how they perceive, remember, and think. There is evidence for the existence of distinct subgroups that differ in cognitive performance within the older population. However, it is less clear how individual differences in cognition in old age are linked to differences in brain-based measures. We used latent-profile analysis on n-back working-memory (WM) performance to identify subgroups in a large sample of older adults (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 181; age = 64–68 years). Our analysis identified one larger normal subgroup with higher performance (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 113; 63%), and a second smaller subgroup (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 55; 31%) with lower performance. The low-performing subgroup showed weaker load-dependent BOLD modulation and lower connectivity within the fronto-parietal network (FPN) as well as between FPN and striatum during n-back, along with lower FPN connectivity at rest. This group also exhibited lower FPN structural integrity, lower frontal dopamine D2 binding potential, inferior performance on offline WM tests, and a trend-level genetic predisposition for lower dopamine-system efficiency. By contrast, this group exhibited relatively intact episodic memory and associated brain measures (i.e., hippocampal volume, structural, and functional connectivity within the default-mode network). Collectively, these data provide converging evidence for the existence of a group of older adults with impaired WM functioning characterized by reduced cortico-striatal coupling and aberrant cortico-cortical integrity within FPN.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cocaine Decreases Spontaneous Neuronal Activity and Increases Low-Frequency Neuronal and Hemodynamic Cortical Oscillations</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) in hemodynamics assessed by fMRI reflect synchronized neuronal activities and are the basis for mapping brain function and its disruption by drugs and disease. Here we assess if cocaine disrupts coupling between neuronal and vascular LFOs by simultaneously measuring cortical field potentials (FP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) regarding their LFOs (0–1 Hz) spectral bandwidths in the somatosensory cortex of naïve and chronic cocaine-exposed rats at baseline and during cocaine intoxication. While across all conditions the dominant oscillation frequencies for FP and CBF LFOs were ~0.1 Hz, the bandwidth of FP LFOs was about 4.8 ± 0.67 times broader than that of CBF LFOs. Acute cocaine depressed high-frequency FP events but increased the relative intensity of neuronal and hemodynamic LFOs, an effect that was markedly accentuated in magnitude and duration in chronic cocaine-exposed animals. Neuronal LFOs were correlated with CBF LFOs in control animals but not in chronically cocaine-exposed animals, which suggests neurovascular uncoupling. The marked increases in neuronal LFOs with chronic cocaine, which we interpret to reflect increases in neuronal synchronization in the LFOs, and the uncoupling of hemodynamics with resting neuronal activities could contribute to brain dysfunction in cocaine abusers and confound the interpretation of fMRI studies.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Duality of Function: Activation for Meaningless Nonwords and Semantic Codes in the Same Brain Areas</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy053</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy053/4975480?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Studies of the neural substrates of semantic (word meaning) processing have typically focused on semantic manipulations, with less consideration for potential differences in difficulty across conditions. While the idea that particular brain regions can support multiple functions is widely accepted, studies of specific cognitive domains rarely test for co-location with other functions. Here we start with standard univariate analyses comparing words to meaningless nonwords, replicating our recent finding that this contrast can activate task-positive regions for words, and default-mode regions in the putative semantic network for nonwords, pointing to difficulty effects. Critically, this was followed up with a multivariate analysis to test whether the same areas activated for meaningless nonwords contained semantic information sufficient to distinguish high- from low-imageability words. Indeed, this classification was performed reliably better than chance at 75% accuracy. This is compatible with two non-exclusive interpretations. Numerous areas in the default-mode network are task-negative in the sense of activating for less demanding conditions, and the same areas contain information supporting semantic cognition. Therefore, while areas of the default mode network have been hypothesized to support semantic cognition, we offer evidence that these areas can respond to both domain-general difficulty effects, and to specific aspects of semantics.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Foxg1 Regulates the Postnatal Development of Cortical Interneurons</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Abnormalities in cortical interneurons are closely associated with neurological diseases. Most patients with Foxg1 syndrome experience seizures, suggesting a possible role of Foxg1 in the cortical interneuron development. Here, by conditional deletion of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt;, which was achieved by crossing &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;fl/fl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gad2-Cre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;ER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; line, we found the postnatal distributions of somatostatin-, calretinin-, and neuropeptide Y-positive interneurons in the cortex were impaired. Further investigations revealed an enhanced dendritic complexity and decreased migration capacity of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt;-deficient interneurons, accompanied by remarkable downregulation of Dlx1 and CXCR4. Overexpression of Dlx1 or knock down its downstream Pak3 rescued the differentiation detects, demonstrated that Foxg1 functioned upstream of Dlx1-Pak3 signal pathway to regulate the postnatal development of cortical interneurons. Due to the imbalanced neural circuit, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; mutants showed increased seizure susceptibility. These findings will improve our understanding of the postnatal development of interneurons and help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying seizure in patients carrying &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; mutations.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Somatotopic Mapping of the Developing Sensorimotor Cortex in the Preterm Human Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy050</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy050/4975478?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In the mature mammalian brain, the primary somatosensory and motor cortices are known to be spatially organized such that neural activity relating to specific body parts can be somatopically mapped onto an anatomical “homunculus”. This organization creates an internal body representation which is fundamental for precise motor control, spatial awareness and social interaction. Although it is unknown when this organization develops in humans, animal studies suggest that it may emerge even before the time of normal birth. We therefore characterized the somatotopic organization of the primary sensorimotor cortices using functional MRI and a set of custom-made robotic tools in 35 healthy preterm infants aged from 31 + 6 to 36 + 3 weeks postmenstrual age. Functional responses induced by somatosensory stimulation of the wrists, ankles, and mouth had a distinct spatial organization as seen in the characteristic mature homunculus map. In comparison to the ankle, activation related to wrist stimulation was significantly larger and more commonly involved additional areas including the supplementary motor area and ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex. These results are in keeping with early intrinsic determination of a somatotopic map within the primary sensorimotor cortices. This may explain why acquired brain injury in this region during the preterm period cannot be compensated for by cortical reorganization and therefore can lead to long-lasting motor and sensory impairment.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Functional Segregation of the Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus: Evidence From Coactivation-Based Parcellation</title>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy049/4975477?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Previous studies helped unraveling the functional architecture of the human cerebral cortex. However, a comprehensive functional segregation of right lateral prefrontal cortex is missing. Here, we delineated cortical clusters in right area 44 and 45 based on their task-constrained whole-brain activation patterns across neuroimaging experiments obtained from a large database. We identified 5 clusters that differed with respect to their coactivation patterns, which were consistent with resting-state functional connectivity patterns of an independent dataset. Two clusters in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) were functionally associated with action inhibition and execution, while two anterior clusters were related to reasoning and social cognitive processes. A fifth cluster was associated with spatial attention. Strikingly, the functional organization of the right IFG can thus be characterized by a posterior-to-anterior axis with action-related functions on the posterior and cognition-related functions on the anterior end. We observed further subdivisions along a dorsal-to-ventral axis in posterior IFG between action execution and inhibition, and in anterior IFG between reasoning and social cognition. The different clusters were integrated in distinct large-scale networks for various cognitive processes. These results provide evidence for a general organization of cognitive processes along axes spanning from more automatic to more complex cognitive processes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Distinct Roles for the Cerebellum, Angular Gyrus, and Middle Temporal Gyrus in Action–Feedback Monitoring</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy048</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy048/4975476?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Action–feedback monitoring is essential to ensure meaningful interactions with the external world. This process involves generating efference copy-based sensory predictions and comparing these with the actual action-feedback. As neural correlates of comparator processes, previous fMRI studies have provided heterogeneous results, including the cerebellum, angular and middle temporal gyrus. However, these studies usually comprised only self-generated actions. Therefore, they might have induced not only action-based prediction errors, but also general sensory mismatch errors. Here, we aimed to disentangle these processes using a custom-made fMRI-compatible movement device, generating active and passive hand movements with identical sensory feedback. Online visual feedback of the hand was presented with a variable delay. Participants had to judge whether the feedback was delayed. Activity in the right cerebellum correlated more positively with delay in active than in passive trials. Interestingly, we also observed activation in the angular and middle temporal gyri, but across both active and passive conditions. This suggests that the cerebellum is a comparator area specific to voluntary action, whereas angular and middle temporal gyri seem to detect more general intersensory conflict. Correlations with behavior and cerebellar activity nevertheless suggest involvement of these temporoparietal areas in processing and awareness of temporal discrepancies in action-feedback monitoring.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a set of complex neurodevelopmental disorders for which there is currently no targeted therapeutic approach. It is thought that alterations of genes regulating migration and synapse formation during development affect neural circuit formation and result in aberrant connectivity within distinct circuits that underlie abnormal behaviors. However, it is unknown whether deviant developmental trajectories are circuit-specific for a given autism risk-gene. We used MRI to probe changes in functional and structural connectivity from childhood to adulthood in Fragile-X (Fmr1&lt;sup&gt;−/y&lt;/sup&gt;) and contactin-associated (CNTNAP2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) knockout mice. Young Fmr1&lt;sup&gt;−/y&lt;/sup&gt; mice (30 days postnatal) presented with a robust hypoconnectivity phenotype in corticocortico and corticostriatal circuits in areas associated with sensory information processing, which was maintained until adulthood. Conversely, only small differences in hippocampal and striatal areas were present during early postnatal development in CNTNAP2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice, while major connectivity deficits in prefrontal and limbic pathways developed between adolescence and adulthood. These findings are supported by viral tracing and electron micrograph approaches and define 2 clearly distinct connectivity endophenotypes within the autism spectrum. We conclude that the genetic background of ASD strongly influences which circuits are most affected, the nature of the phenotype, and the developmental time course of the associated changes.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Hippocampal place cells integrate signals from multiple sensory modalities. However, it is unclear how these different inputs are combined to generate place fields. We investigated how visual spatial cues and an animal’s locomotion are integrated by CA3 place cells of Mongolian gerbils. While the animals moved on a virtual linear track, we adapted the gain between the visually projected environment and the treadmill movement. Place cells responded differently to this manipulation. In a subset, place fields were kept in accord with salient visual cues in the virtual environment or reward location, whereas in another subset, place fields were strongly influenced by locomotion. Theta phase precession was present and indistinguishable between the place field types. Theta compression remained intact under gain changes and extended over both types of place field. Hippocampal place cells thus retain strong influence from distinct input streams suggesting a role of the hippocampus CA3 as a multimodal associator on the theta time scale.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>In this issue of Neuron, Liao and colleagues (2018) uncover a surprising way that the guidance molecule MIG14/Wntless operates in dendrite self-avoidance in sensorimotor neurons. Not only does MIG14/Wntless not require the soluble cue Wntless, but it can mediate direct cell-cell contact at the plasma membrane. During dendrite tip contact, MIG14/Wntless drives local bursts of WASP-dependent actin filament assembly that facilitate sister dendrite repulsion.</description>

	<description>Despite the translational promise of non-invasive neuroimaging, its practical application to individuals has remained largely elusive. In this issue of Neuron, Gratton et al. present data from nine highly sampled adult humans and demonstrate that functional brain networks are in large part composed of individual-specific features that are stable over time. Such data represent a critical prerequisite for the development of new diagnostics and personalized interventions for neuropsychiatric illnesses.</description>

	<description>Cross-frequency coupling in the hippocampus has been hypothesized to support higher-cognition functions. While gamma modulation by theta is widely accepted, evidence of phase-coupling between the two frequency components is so far unconvincing. Our observations show that theta and gamma energy increases with rat speed, while the overall nonlinearity of the LFP trace also increases, suggesting that energy flow is fundamental for hippocampal dynamics. This contradicts current representations based on the Kuramoto phase model. Therefore, we propose a new approach, based on the three-wave equation, a universally-valid nonlinear-physics paradigm that synthesizes the effects of leading order, quadratic nonlinearity. The paradigm identifies bispectral analysis as the natural tool for investigating LFP cross-frequency coupling. Our results confirm the effectiveness of the approach by showing unambiguous coupling between theta and gamma. Bispectra features agree with predictions of the three-wave model, supporting the conclusion that cross-frequency coupling is a manifestation of nonlinear energy transfers.</description>

	<description>Typical responses of cortical neurons to identical sensory stimuli are highly variable. It has thus been proposed that the cortex primarily uses a rate code. However, other reports show spike-time coding under certain conditions. The potential role of spike-time coding is constrained by the variability arising directly from noise sources within local cortical circuits. Here, we quantified this internally generated variability using a detailed model of rat neocortical microcircuitry with biologically realistic noise sources. We found stochastic neurotransmitter release to be a critical component of this variability, which, amplified by recurrent connectivity, causes rapid chaotic divergence with a time constant on the order of 10-20 milliseconds. Surprisingly, however, relatively weak thalamocortical stimuli can transiently overcome the chaos, and induce reliable spike times with millisecond precision. We show that this effect relies on recurrent cortical connectivity and is not a simple result of feed-forward thalamocortical input. We conclude that recurrent cortical architecture simultaneously supports both chaotic network dynamics and millisecond spike-time reliability.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dynamic and causal contribution of parietal cortex to perceptual decisions during category learning</title>

	<description>Making perceptual decisions to classify unknown sensory stimuli into behaviorally relevant categories, known as category learning, is a fundamental cognitive function. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC), although has been intensively studied for its role in perceptual and categorical decision-making, as well as in many other cognitive functions, its functional significance remains controversial due to lack of causal effects on choice behaviors. Here we show that PPC neurons exhibit characteristic dynamics of category learning, and are causally involved specifically in the decision process of categorizing new sensory stimuli, which is attributable to the PPC to sensory cortex feedback circuits. We trained mice to perform an auditory category learning task, where mice made categorical decisions classifying new tone stimuli into learned categories. Using in vivo two-photon imaging tracking the activity of the same population of PPC neurons over learning, we found that PPC neurons show dynamic representations adaptively classifying new stimuli while maintaining stable representation for learned categories. Inactivation of PPC using pharmacology or optogenetics led to significant impairment in categorical decisions for new stimuli but not for well-learned stimuli. In addition, PPC inactivation led to a stronger bias of choices by previous trials, revealing an additional causal contribution of PPC counterbalancing recent history bias. Circuit-level perturbations using chemogenetics to silence the PPC to dorsal auditory cortex projections also impaired categorical decisions during learning. Our results reveal a dynamic and causal role of PPC circuits in decision-making when categorizing new sensory stimuli, which not only provide a potential reconciliation to the widespread controversies, but also provide a circuit-level mechanism for the key cognitive function of perceptual classification of new sensory information.</description>

	<description>Previous research modeling EEG, fMRI and behavioral data has identified three spatially distributed brain networks that activate in temporal sequence, and are thought to enable perceptual decision-making during face-versus-car categorization. These studies have linked late activation (&amp;gt;300ms post stimulus onset) in the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) to object discrimination processes. We applied paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS) to LOC at different temporal latencies with the specific prediction, based on these studies, that ppTMS beginning at 400ms after stimulus onset would slow reaction time (RT) performance. Thirteen healthy adults performed a two-alternative forced choice task selecting whether a car or face was present on each trial amidst visual noise pre-titrated to approximate 79% accuracy. ppTMS, with pulses separated by 50ms, was applied at one of five stimulus onset asynchronies: -200, 200, 400, 450, or 500ms, and a sixth no-stimulation condition. As predicted, TMS at 400ms resulted in significant slowing of RTs, providing causal evidence in support of LOC contribution to perceptual decision processing. In addition, TMS delivered at -200ms resulted in faster RTs, indicating early stimulation may result in performance enhancement. These findings build upon correlational EEG and fMRI observations and demonstrate the use of TMS in predictive validation of psychophysiological models.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dynamic causal modelling of fluctuating connectivity in resting-state EEG</title>

	<description>Functional and effective connectivity are known to change systematically over time. These changes might be explained by several factors, including intrinsic fluctuations in activity dependent neuronal coupling and contextual factors, like experimental condition and time. Furthermore, contextual effects may be subject-specific or conserved over subjects. To characterize fluctuations in effective connectivity, we used dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of cross spectral responses over 1 min of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during rest, divided into 1-sec windows. We focused on two intrinsic networks: the default mode and the saliency network. DCM was applied to estimate connectivity in each time-window for both networks. Fluctuations in DCM connectivity parameters were assessed using hierarchical parametric empirical Bayes (PEB). Within-subject, between-window effects were modelled with a second-level linear model with temporal basis functions as regressors. This procedure was conducted for every subject separately. Bayesian model reduction was then used to assess which (combination of) temporal basis functions best explain dynamic connectivity over windows. A third (between-subject) level model was used to infer which dynamic connectivity parameters are conserved over subjects. Our results indicate that connectivity fluctuations in the saliency network comprised both subject-specific components and a common component. For the default mode network, connectivity trajectories only showed a common component. For both networks, connections to higher order regions appear to monotonically increase during the one minute period. These results not only establish the predictive validity of dynamic connectivity estimates - in virtue of detecting systematic changes over subjects - they also suggest a network-specific dissociation in the relative contribution of fluctuations in connectivity that depend upon experimental context. We envisage these procedures could be useful for characterizing brain state transitions that may be explained by their cognitive or neuropathological underpinnings.</description>

	<description>Reduced models of neuronal spiking activity simulated with a fixed integration time step are frequently used in studies of spatio-temporal dynamics of neurobiological networks. The choice of fixed time step integration provides computational simplicity and efficiency, especially in cases dealing with large number of neurons and synapses operating at a different level of activity across the population at any given time. A network model tuned to generate a particular type of oscillations or wave patterns is sensitive to the intrinsic properties of neurons and synapses and, therefore, commonly susceptible to changes in the time step of integration. In this study, we analyzed a model of sharp-wave activity in the network of hippocampal area CA3, to examine how an increase of the integration time step affects network behavior and to propose adjustments of intrinsic properties of neurons and synapses that help minimize or remove the damage caused by the time step increase.</description>

	<description>Long-term memory encoding is impaired in healthy aging but the underlying mechanisms in humans remain unclear. Here, we tested whether this relates to failures in associating information with previous memories to build multi-item representations. To gain insight into age-related differences in such neural mechanisms during online encoding, we employed the temporal precision of electroencephalography to examine how semantic integration during encoding is affected by healthy aging. As expected, we found that congruent matches improved subsequent recognition memory in younger adults (i.e. congruency effect) but this effect was reduced in the elderly. At the neural level, congruence caused changes in neural activity within ~1500 ms after stimulus presentation, and there were widespread differences in ERPs and alpha-beta oscillations (8-30 Hz), which are known to support semantic processing. Importantly, these ERP differences predicted increases in memory performance, especially for congruent items. Finally, age-related differences in memory were accompanied by an early positive ERP and a later decrease in theta-alpha and low beta power (5-13 Hz), during encoding, which were greater in the younger group. Our findings provide evidence that age-related memory impairments can be explained by deficits in online semantic integration, depending on theta-alpha and low beta oscillations.</description>

	<description>Background: A substantial proportion of the school-age population experience cognitive-related learning difficulties. Not all children who struggle at school receive a diagnosis, yet their problems are sufficient to warrant additional support. Understanding the causes of learning difficulties is the key to developing effective prevention and intervention strategies for struggling learners. The aim of this project is to apply a transdiagnostic approach to children with cognitive developmental difficulties related to learning to discover the underpinning mechanisms of learning problems. Methods/Design: A cohort of 1000 children aged 5 to 18 years is being recruited. The sample consists of of 800 children with problems in attention, learning and / memory, as identified by a health or educational professional, and 200 typically-developing children recruited from the same schools as those with difficulties. All children are completing assessments of cognition, including tests of phonological processing, short-term and working memory, attention, executive function and processing speed. Their parents/ carers are completing questionnaires about the child's family history, communication skills, mental health and behaviour. Children are invited for an optional MRI brain scan and are asked to provide an optional DNA sample (saliva). Hypothesis-free data-driven methods will be used to identify the cognitive, behavioural and neural dimensions of learning difficulties. Machine-learning approaches will be used to map the multi-dimensional space of the cognitive, neural and behavioural measures to identify clusters of children with shared profiles. Finally, group comparisons will be used to test theories of development and disorder. Discussion: Our multi-systems approach to identifying the causes of learning difficulties in a heterogeneous sample of struggling learners provides a novel way to enhance our understanding of the common and complex needs of the majority of children who struggle at school. Our broad recruitment criteria targeting all children with cognitive learning problems, irrespective of diagnoses and comorbidities, are novel and make our sample unique. Our dataset will also provide a valuable resource of genetic, imaging and cognitive developmental data for the scientific community.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The rodent lateral orbitofrontal cortex represents expected Pavlovian outcome value but not identity</title>

	<description>The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for updating reward-directed behaviours flexibly when task contingencies are reversed, or when outcomes are devalued. We systematically examined the generality of these findings using lesions of the rodent lateral OFC (LO) in instrumental action-outcome, and Pavlovian cue-outcome, learning using specific satiety and taste aversion methods of outcome devaluation. LO lesions disrupted outcome devaluation in Pavlovian but not instrumental procedures. Furthermore, this effect was only observed when using taste-aversion devaluation. Using a specific Pavlovian-to-Instrumental transfer procedure, we established that LO is not necessary for the representation of specific outcome properties, but rather in using these properties to access the current motivational value of outcomes. The role of LO in outcome devaluation and reversal learning was also dissociable between anterior and posterior subregions. These novel dissociable task- and subregion-specific effects suggest a way to reconcile contradictory findings between rodent and non-human primate OFC research.</description>

	<description>Neural selectivity to orientation is one of the simplest and most thoroughly-studied cortical sensory features. Here, we show that a large body of research that purported to measure orientation tuning may have in fact been inadvertently measuring sensitivity to second-order changes in luminance, a phenomenon we term 'vignetting'. Using a computational model of neural responses in primary visual cortex (V1), we demonstrate the impact of vignetting on simulated V1 responses. We then used the model to generate a set of predictions, which we confirmed with functional MRI experiments in human observers. Our results demonstrate that stimulus vignetting can wholly determine the orientation selectivity of responses in visual cortex measured at a macroscopic scale, and suggest a reinterpretation of a well-established literature on orientation processing in visual cortex.</description>

	<description>Visual exploration is influenced by what we remember. Amnesic cases, who have damage to the hippocampus (HC) and/or extended medial temporal lobe (MTL), show alterations in their gaze patterns relative to neurologically intact adults on tasks of memory. Recent work has revealed an extensive set of polysynaptic connections between the hippocampus and oculomotor system. However, little is known about how activation within the HC may impact the oculomotor system. In the present work, we conducted simulations of the functional interactions between the two systems by leveraging a computational modeling platform (The Virtual Brain; thevirtualbrain.org) with structural connectivity as defined through the CoCoMac database and tractography data from macaques. We examined how activity dissipated throughout the pre-identified polysynaptic pathways when subregions of the HC, and regions of the broader MTL, were stimulated. Stimulation of CA1, pre- and para-subiculum, and entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices each resulted in observable responses in regions of the oculomotor system, including the frontal eye fields. Stimulation of the subiculum and CA3 did not culminate in responses in the frontal eye fields, and in such instances, activity was also not observed in parietal areas, posterior cingulate, and V4, suggesting that these regions may be important for transmitting information from the HC to regions within the oculomotor system. These findings provide novel evidence that activity originating within the HC and/or MTL may travel through specific nodes and pathways to influence the oculomotor system.</description>

	<description>Linear registration to stereotaxic space is a common first step in many automated image-processing tools for analysis of human brain MRI scans. This step is crucial for the success of the following image-processing steps. Several well-established algorithms are commonly used in the field of neuroimaging for this task, but none of them has a 100% success rate. Manual assessment of the registration is commonly used as part of quality control. We propose a completely automatic quality control method based on deep learning that replaces human rater and accurately performs quality control assessment for stereotaxic registration of T1w brain scans. In a recently published study from our group comparing linear registration methods, we used a database of 9693 MRI scans from several publically available datasets and applied five linear registration tools. In this study, the resulting images that were assessed and labeled by a human rater are used to train a deep neural network to detect cases when registration failed. Our method was able to achieve 88% accuracy and 11% false positive rate in detecting scans that should pass quality control, better than a manual QC rater.</description>

	<description>Extracting single-unit activity from in vivo extracellular neural electrophysiology data requires sorting spikes from background noise and action potentials from multiple cells in order to identify the activity of individual neurons. Typically this has been achieved by algorithms that employ principal component analyses followed by manual allocation of spikes to individual clusters based on visual inspection of the waveform shape. This method of manual sorting can give varying results between human operators and is highly time-consuming, especially in recordings with higher levels of background noise. To address these problems, automatic sorting algorithms have begun to gain popularity as viable methods for sorting electrophysiological data, although little is known about the use of these algorithms with neural data from midbrain recordings. KiloSort is a relatively new algorithm that automatically clusters raw data which can then be manually curated. In this report, we compare results of manually-sorted and KiloSort-processed recordings from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Sorting with KiloSort required substantially less time to complete, while yielding comparable and consistent results. We conclude that the use of KiloSort to identify single units from multi-channel recording in the VTA and SNc is accurate and efficient.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A Coupled Network of Growth Transform Neurons for Spike-Encoded Auditory Feature Extraction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303453v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>This paper builds upon our previously reported growth transform based optimization framework to present a novel spiking neuron model and demonstrate its application for spike-based auditory signal processing. Unlike conventional neuromorphic approaches, the proposed Growth Transform (GT) neuron model is tightly coupled to a system objective function, which results in network dynamics that are always stable and interpretable; and the process of spike generation and population dynamics is the result of minimizing an energy functional. We then extend the model to include axonal propagation delays in a manner that the optimized solution of the system or network objective function remains unaffected. The paper characterizes the model for different types of stimuli, and explores how changing different aspects of the cost function can reproduce known single neuron dynamics. We then investigate the properties of a coupled GT neural network that can generate spike-encoded auditory features corresponding to the output of a gammatone filterbank. We show that the discriminatory information is not only encoded in the traditional spike-rates and interspike-interval statistics, but is also encoded in the subthreshold response of GT neurons for inputs that are not strong enough to elicit spikes. We also demonstrate that while different forms of coupling between the neurons could produce compact and energy-efficient representation of the auditory features, the classification performance for a speaker recognition task remains invariant across different types of coupling. Thus, we believe that the proposed GT neuron model provides a flexible neuromorphic framework to systematically design large-scale spiking neural networks with stable and interpretable dynamics.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Correct CYFIP1 dosage is essential for synaptic inhibition and the excitatory/inhibitory balance.</title>

	<description>Altered excitatory/inhibitory balance is implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders but the genetic aetiology of this is still poorly understood. Copy number variations in CYFIP1 are associated with autism, schizophrenia and intellectual disability but the role of CYFIP1 in regulating synaptic inhibition or excitatory/inhibitory balance remains unclear. We show, CYFIP1, and its paralogue CYFIP2, are enriched at inhibitory postsynaptic sites. While upregulation of CYFIP1 or CYFIP2 increased excitatory synapse number and the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), it had the opposite effect at inhibitory synapses, decreasing their size and the amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). Contrary to CYFIP1 upregulation, its loss in vivo, upon conditional knockout in neocortical principal cells, increased expression of postsynaptic GABAA receptor {beta}2/3-subunits and neuroligin 3 and enhanced synaptic inhibition. Thus, CYFIP1 dosage can bi-directionally impact inhibitory synaptic structure and function, potentially leading to altered excitatory/inhibitory balance and circuit dysfunction in CYFIP1-associated neurodevelopmental disorders.</description>

	<description>The subiculum is the major output structure of the hippocampal formation and is involved in learning and memory as well as in spatial navigation. Little is known about how the cellular diversity of subicular neurons is related to function. Primed by in vitro studies, which identified distinct bursting patterns in subicular cells, we asked how subicular burst firing is related to spatial coding in vivo. Using high-resolution juxtacellular recordings in freely moving rats, we analyzed the firing patterns of 51 subicular principal neurons and distinguished two populations based on their bursting behavior, i.e. sparsely bursting (~80%) and dominantly bursting neurons (~20%). Dominantly bursting neurons had significantly higher firing rates than sparsely bursting neurons. Furthermore, the two clusters had distinct spatial properties, sparsely bursting cells showing strong positional tuning and dominantly bursting cells being only weakly tuned. Additionally, the occurrence of bursts in sparsely bursting neurons defined well-defined spatial fields. In contrast, isolated spikes contained less spatial information. We conclude that burst firing distinguishes subicular principal cell types and constitutes a distinct unit encoding spatial information in sparsely bursting spatial cells. Overall, our results demonstrate that burst firing is highly relevant to subicular space coding.</description>

	<description>The variability of natural scenes places perceptual processes in the realm of statistical inference, where sensory evidence must be weighted by its reliability. Absent prior information, estimating environmental variability requires real-time sampling and computations. However, a portion of environmental variability can be assumed invariant across conditions. Perceptual tasks relying on time-dependent information may be vastly enhanced if the invariant statistical structure of sensory cues is built into the underlying neural processing. We investigated this question in human sound localization, where the statistics of spatial cues can be estimated. Localizing low frequency sounds in the horizontal plane relies on interaural time differences (ITD). We estimated the ITD statistics across frequency and azimuth from human head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). The mean ITD varied with azimuth following a sigmoid relationship, whose slope is steepest at the center. In addition, ITD was more variable over time for sounds located in the periphery compared to the center, in a frequency-dependent manner. We investigated the role of these statistics -- ITD slope and ITD variability -- in low-frequency lateralization of human subjects, to test the hypothesis that high-order sensory statistics are represented in the human brain influencing spatial discriminability and novelty detection. Thresholds for discriminating ITD changes reported by classical studies (Mills, 1958) were predicted by a model that considered both ITD slope and ITD variability. To further test our hypothesis, EEG novelty responses were recorded in human subjects undergoing an oddball stimulation sequence, where repetitive (&quot;standard&quot;) tones of a given ITD were combined with sporadic (&quot;deviant&quot;) tones of a different ITD. By using insert earphones, ITD was shifted with zero variability across time and location. Mismatch negativity (MMN) brain signals were used as an index of discriminability between standard and deviant stimuli. We found that MMNs were weaker for standards in the periphery, where the ITD slope is lower and the ITD variability is higher. Overall, the amplitude of novelty EEG signals was predicted by the difference in ITD between the standard and deviant normalized by the anticipated discriminability of the standard location, indicating that change detection is weighted by expected statistics of the sensory input. In sum, our results show that spatial discriminability thresholds and deviant detection are consistent with a representation of anticipated ITD statistics in the human brain, supporting the hypothesis that high-order statistics are built into human perceptual processes biasing behavior.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by J. Swaroop Guntupalli, Ma Feilong, James V. Haxby&lt;/p&gt;

Variation in cortical connectivity profiles is typically modeled as having a coarse spatial scale parcellated into interconnected brain areas. We created a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome to search for fine-scale structure that is shared across brains. Projecting individual connectivity data into this new common model connectome accounts for substantially more variance in the human connectome than do previous models. This newly discovered shared structure is closely related to fine-scale distinctions in representations of information. These results reveal a shared fine-scale structure that is a major component of the human connectome that coexists with coarse-scale, areal structure. This shared fine-scale structure was not captured in previous models and was, therefore, inaccessible to analysis and study.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PKWzqyJ_2Tk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: On the role of extrinsic noise in microRNA-mediated bimodal gene expression</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Marco Del Giudice, Stefano Bo, Silvia Grigolon, Carla Bosia&lt;/p&gt;

Several studies highlighted the relevance of extrinsic noise in shaping cell decision making and differentiation in molecular networks. Bimodal distributions of gene expression levels provide experimental evidence of phenotypic differentiation, where the modes of the distribution often correspond to different physiological states of the system. We theoretically address the presence of bimodal phenotypes in the context of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation. MiRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that downregulate the expression of their target mRNAs. The nature of this interaction is titrative and induces a threshold effect: below a given target transcription rate almost no mRNAs are free and available for translation. We investigate the effect of extrinsic noise on the system by introducing a fluctuating miRNA-transcription rate. We find that the presence of extrinsic noise favours the presence of bimodal target distributions which can be observed for a wider range of parameters compared to the case with intrinsic noise only and for lower miRNA-target interaction strength. Our results suggest that combining threshold-inducing interactions with extrinsic noise provides a simple and robust mechanism for obtaining bimodal populations without requiring fine tuning. Furthermore, we characterise the protein distribution’s dependence on protein half-life.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kcCJaIvDnzk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The Midline Axon Crossing Decision Is Regulated through an Activity-Dependent Mechanism by the NMDA Receptor</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Axon guidance in vertebrates is controlled by genetic cascades as well as by intrinsic activity-dependent refinement of connections. Midline axon crossing is one of the best studied pathfinding models and is fundamental to the establishment of bilaterally symmetric nervous systems. However, it is not known whether crossing requires intrinsic activity in axons, and what controls that activity. Further, a mechanism linking neuronal activity and gene expression has not been identified for axon pathfinding. Using embryonic zebrafish, we found that the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) NR1.1 subunit (&lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt;) is expressed in commissural axons. Pharmacological inhibition of &lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt;, hypoxia exposure reduction of &lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt; expression, or CRISPR knock-down of &lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt; leads to defects in midline crossing. Inhibition of neuronal activity phenocopies the effects of &lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt; loss on midline crossing. By combining pharmacological inhibition of the NMDAR with optogenetic stimulation to precisely restore neuronal activity, we observed rescue of midline crossing. This suggests that the NMDAR controls pathfinding by an activity-dependent mechanism. We further show that the NMDAR may act, via modulating activity, on the transcription factor &lt;i&gt;arxa&lt;/i&gt; (mammalian &lt;i&gt;Arx&lt;/i&gt;), a known regulator of midline pathfinding. These findings uncover a novel role for the NMDAR in controlling activity to regulate commissural pathfinding and identify &lt;i&gt;arxa&lt;/i&gt; as a key link between the genetic and activity-dependent regulation of midline axon guidance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Beneficial Outcome of Urethane Treatment Following Status Epilepticus in a Rat Organophosphorus Toxicity Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of benzodiazepines to terminate electrographic status epilepticus (SE) declines the longer a patient is in SE. Therefore, alternative methods for ensuring complete block of SE and refractory SE are necessary. We compared the ability of diazepam and a subanesthetic dose of urethane to terminate prolonged SE and mitigate subsequent pathologies. Adult Sprague Dawley rats were injected with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) to induce SE. Rats were administered diazepam (10 mg/kg, ip) or urethane (0.8 g/kg, s.c.) 1 h after DFP-induced SE and compared to rats that experienced uninterrupted SE. Large-amplitude and high-frequency spikes induced by DFP administration were quenched for at least 46 h in rats administered urethane 1 h after SE onset as demonstrated by cortical electroencephalography (EEG). By contrast, diazepam interrupted SE but seizures with high power in the 20- to 70-Hz band returned 6–10 h later. Urethane was more effective than diazepam at reducing hippocampal neurodegeneration, brain inflammation, gliosis and weight loss as measured on day 4 after SE. Furthermore, rats administered urethane displayed a 73% reduction in the incidence of spontaneous recurrent seizures after four to eight weeks and a 90% reduction in frequency of seizures in epileptic rats. By contrast, behavioral changes in the light/dark box, open field and a novel object recognition task were not improved by urethane. These findings indicate that in typical rodent SE models, it is the return of SE overnight, and not the initially intense 1–2 h of SE experience, that is largely responsible for neurodegeneration, accompanying inflammation, and the subsequent development of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Frontal Eye Field Inactivation Reduces Saccade Preparation in the Superior Colliculus but Does Not Alter How Preparatory Activity Relates to Saccades of a Given Latency</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;A neural correlate for saccadic reaction times (SRTs) in the gap saccade task is the level of low-frequency activity in the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (iSC) just before visual target onset: greater levels of such &lt;i&gt;preparatory&lt;/i&gt; iSC low-frequency activity precede shorter SRTs. The frontal eye fields (FEFs) are one likely source of iSC preparatory activity, since FEF preparatory activity is also inversely related to SRT. To better understand the FEF’s role in saccade preparation, and the way in which such preparation relates to SRT, in two male rhesus monkeys, we compared iSC preparatory activity across unilateral reversible cryogenic inactivation of the FEF. FEF inactivation increased contralesional SRTs, and lowered ipsilesional iSC preparatory activity. FEF inactivation also reduced rostral iSC activity during the gap period. Importantly, the distributions of SRTs generated with or without FEF inactivation overlapped, enabling us to conduct a novel population-level analyses examining iSC preparatory activity just before generation of SRT-matched saccades. When matched for SRTs, we observed no change during FEF inactivation in the relationship between iSC preparatory activity and SRT-matched saccades across a range of SRTs, even for the occasional express saccade. Thus, while our results emphasize that the FEF has an overall excitatory influence on preparatory activity in the iSC, the communication between the iSC and downstream oculomotor brainstem is unaltered for SRT-matched saccades.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Equalization of the network sensitivity enhances predictive power at criticality in a whole-brain model. (arXiv:1804.05823v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the relationship between structural and functional connectivity
remains a crucial issue in modern neuroscience. Here we investigate such
relationship through a stochastic neural whole-brain model, using as input the
structural connectivity matrix defined by the human connectome. Importantly, we
address the structure-function relationship both at the group and
individual-based levels. In this work, we show that equalization of the nodes
excitatory input improves the correlation between simulated neural patterns of
the model and various brain functional data. We find that the best model
performance is achieved when the model control parameter is in its critical
value and that equalization minimizes both the variability of the critical
points and neuronal activity patterns among subjects. Our results open new
perspectives in personalized brain modelling with potential applications to
investigate the deviation from criticality due to structural lesions (e.g.
stroke) or brain disorders.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Universal Features in Phonological Neighbor Networks. (arXiv:1804.05766v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human speech perception involves transforming a countinous acoustic signal
into discrete linguistically meaningful units, such as phonemes, while
simultaneously causing a listener to activate words that are similar to the
spoken utterance and to each other. The Neighborhood Activation Model
(NAM~\cite{Luce:1986,Luce:1998}) posits that phonological neighbors (two forms
[words] that differ by one phoneme) compete significantly for recognition as a
spoken word is heard. This definition of phonological similarity can be
extended to an entire corpus of forms to produce a phonological neighbor
network~\cite{Vitevitch:2008} (PNN). We study PNNs for five languages: English,
Spanish, French, Dutch, and German. Consistent with previous work, we find that
the PNNs share a consistent set of topological features. Using an approach that
generates random lexicons with increasing levels of phonological realism, we
show that even random forms with minimal relationship to any real language,
combined with only the empirical distribution of language-specific phonological
form lengths, are sufficient to produce the topological properties observed in
the real language PNNs. The resulting pseudo-PNNs are insensitive to the level
of lingusitic realism in the random lexicons but quite sensitive to the shape
of the form length distribution. We therefore conclude that &quot;universal&quot;
features seen across multiple languages are really string universals, not
language universals, and arise primarily due to limitations in the kinds of
networks generated by the one-step neighbor definition. Taken together, our
results indicate that caution is warranted when linking the dynamics of human
spoken word recognition to the topological properties of PNNs, and that the
investigation of alternative similarity metrics for phonological forms should
be a priority.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Cochlear detection of double-slip motion in cello bowing. (arXiv:1804.05695v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05695</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05695</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A double-slip motion of a cello sound is investigated experimentally with a
bowing machine and analyzed using a Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD)
cochlear model. A double-slip sound is investigated. Here the sawtooth motion
of normal bowing is basically present, but within each period the bow hair
tears off the strings once more within the period, resulting in a blurred
sound. This additional intermediate slip appears around the middle of each
period and drifts temporally around while the sound progresses. When the
double-slip is perfectly in the middle of one period the sound is that of a
regular sawtooth motion. If not, two periodicities are present around double
the fundamental periodicity, making the sound arbitrary. Analyzing the sound
with a Wavelet-transform, the expected double-peak of two periodicities around
the second partial cannot be found. Analyzing the tone with a cochlear FDTD
model including the transfer of mechanical energy into spikes, the doubling and
even more complex behaviour is perfectly represented in the Interspike Interval
(ISI) of two adjacent spikes. This cochlear spike representation fits perfectly
to an amplitude peak detection algorithm, tracking the precise time point of
the double-slip within the fundamental period. Therefore the ear is able to
detect the double-slip motion right at the transition from the basilar membrane
motion into electrical spikes.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Robust entropy requires strong and balanced excitatory and inhibitory synapses. (arXiv:1804.05266v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05266</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05266</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is widely appreciated that well-balanced excitation and inhibition are
necessary for proper function in neural networks. However, in principle, such
balance could be achieved by many possible configurations of excitatory and
inhibitory strengths, and relative numbers of excitatory and inhibitory
neurons. For instance, a given level of excitation could be balanced by either
numerous inhibitory neurons with weak synapses, or few inhibitory neurons with
strong synapses. Among the continuum of different but balanced configurations,
why should any particular configuration be favored? Here we address this
question in the context of the entropy of network dynamics by studying an
analytically tractable network of binary neurons. We find that entropy is
highest at the boundary between excitation-dominant and inhibition-dominant
regimes. Entropy also varies along this boundary with a trade-off between high
and robust entropy: weak synapse strengths yield high network entropy which is
fragile to parameter variations, while strong synapse strengths yield a lower,
but more robust, network entropy. In the case where inhibitory and excitatory
synapses are constrained to have similar strength, we find that a small, but
non-zero fraction of inhibitory neurons, like that seen in mammalian cortex,
results in robust and relatively high entropy.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A modelling approach for exploring muscle dynamics during cyclic contractions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006123</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Stephanie A. Ross, Nilima Nigam, James M. Wakeling&lt;/p&gt;

Hill-type muscle models are widely used within the field of biomechanics to predict and understand muscle behaviour, and are often essential where muscle forces cannot be directly measured. However, these models have limited accuracy, particularly during cyclic contractions at the submaximal levels of activation that typically occur during locomotion. To address this issue, recent studies have incorporated effects into Hill-type models that are oftentimes neglected, such as size-dependent, history-dependent, and activation-dependent effects. However, the contribution of these effects on muscle performance has yet to be evaluated under common contractile conditions that reflect the range of activations, strains, and strain rates that occur &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The purpose of this study was to develop a modelling framework to evaluate modifications to Hill-type muscle models when they contract in cyclic loops that are typical of locomotor muscle function. Here we present a modelling framework composed of a damped harmonic oscillator in series with a Hill-type muscle actuator that consists of a contractile element and parallel elastic element. The intrinsic force-length and force-velocity properties are described using Bezier curves where we present a system to relate physiological parameters to the control points for these curves. The muscle-oscillator system can be geometrically scaled while preserving dynamic and kinematic similarity to investigate the muscle size effects while controlling for the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. The model is driven by time-varying muscle activations that cause the muscle to cyclically contract and drive the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. Thus, this framework provides a platform to test current and future Hill-type model formulations and explore factors affecting muscle performance in muscles of different sizes under a range of cyclic contractile conditions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wFWSqfInABw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The C-terminus domain of non-structural 3 (NS3) protein of the &lt;i&gt;Flaviviridae&lt;/i&gt; viruses (e.g. HCV, dengue, West Nile, Zika) is a nucleotide triphosphatase (NTPase) -dependent superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase that unwinds double-stranded RNA while translocating along the nucleic polymer. Due to these functions, NS3 is an important target for antiviral development yet the biophysics of this enzyme are poorly understood. Microsecond-long molecular dynamic simulations of the dengue NS3 helicase domain are reported from which allosteric effects of RNA and NTPase substrates are observed. The presence of a bound single-stranded RNA catalytically enhances the phosphate hydrolysis reaction by affecting the dynamics and positioning of waters within the hydrolysis active site. Coupled with results from the simulations, electronic structure calculations of the reaction are used to quantify this enhancement to be a 150-fold increase, in qualitative agreement with the experimental enhancement factor of 10–100. Additionally, protein-RNA interactions exhibit NTPase substrate-induced allostery, where the presence of a nucleotide (e.g. ATP or ADP) structurally perturbs residues in direct contact with the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA. Residue-residue network analyses highlight pathways of short ranged interactions that connect the two active sites. These analyses identify motif V as a highly connected region of protein structure through which energy released from either active site is hypothesized to move, thereby inducing the observed allosteric effects. These results lay the foundation for the design of novel allosteric inhibitors of NS3.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Tae9aMgOb9I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The origin of the machinery that realizes protein biosynthesis in all organisms is still unclear. One key component of this machinery are aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which ligate tRNAs to amino acids while consuming ATP. Sequence analyses revealed that these enzymes can be divided into two complementary classes. Both classes differ significantly on a sequence and structural level, feature different reaction mechanisms, and occur in diverse oligomerization states. The one unifying aspect of both classes is their function of binding ATP. We identified Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers as most compact ATP binding motifs characteristic for each Class. Geometric analysis shows a structural rearrangement of the Backbone Brackets upon ATP binding, indicating a general mechanism of all Class I structures. Regarding the origin of aaRS, the Rodin-Ohno hypothesis states that the peculiar nature of the two aaRS classes is the result of their primordial forms, called Protozymes, being encoded on opposite strands of the same gene. Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers were traced back to the proposed Protozymes and their more efficient successors, the Urzymes. Both structural motifs can be observed as pairs of residues in contemporary structures and it seems that the time of their addition, indicated by their placement in the ancient aaRS, coincides with the evolutionary trace of Proto- and Urzymes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZqNwxiUByA0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Pooled DNA from multiple unknown organisms arises in a variety of contexts, for example microbial samples from ecological or human health research. Determining the composition of pooled samples can be difficult, especially at the scale of modern sequencing data and reference databases. Here we propose a novel method for taxonomic profiling in pooled DNA that combines the speed and low-memory requirements of k-mer based pseudoalignment with a likelihood framework that uses base quality information to better resolve multiply mapped reads. We apply the method to the problem of classifying 16S rRNA reads using a reference database of known organisms, a common challenge in microbiome research. Using simulations, we show the method is accurate across a variety of read lengths, with different length reference sequences, at different sample depths, and when samples contain reads originating from organisms absent from the reference. We also assess performance in real 16S data, where we reanalyze previous genetic association data to show our method discovers a larger number of quantitative trait associations than other widely used methods. We implement our method in the software Karp, for k-mer based analysis of read pools, to provide a novel combination of speed and accuracy that is uniquely suited for enhancing discoveries in microbial studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T3dI4mAo5X0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Biofilms are microbial collectives that occupy a diverse array of surfaces. It is well known that the function and evolution of biofilms are strongly influenced by the spatial arrangement of different strains and species within them, but how spatiotemporal distributions of different genotypes in biofilm populations originate is still underexplored. Here, we study the origins of biofilm genetic structure by combining model development, numerical simulations, and microfluidic experiments using the human pathogen &lt;i&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/i&gt;. Using spatial correlation functions to quantify the differences between emergent cell lineage segregation patterns, we find that strong adhesion often, but not always, maximizes the size of clonal cell clusters on flat surfaces. Counterintuitively, our model predicts that, under some conditions, investing in adhesion can reduce rather than increase clonal group size. Our results emphasize that a complex interaction between fluid flow and cell adhesiveness can underlie emergent patterns of biofilm genetic structure. This structure, in turn, has an outsize influence on how biofilm-dwelling populations function and evolve.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-LcIezdmCHM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In this work, we assess a previously advanced hypothesis that predicts the existence of ion channels in the capsid of small and non-enveloped icosahedral viruses. With this purpose we examine &lt;i&gt;Triatoma Virus&lt;/i&gt; (TrV) as a case study. This virus has a stable capsid under highly acidic conditions but disassembles and releases the genome in alkaline environments. Our calculations range from a subtle sub-atomic proton interchange to the dismantling of a large-scale system representing several million of atoms. Our results provide structure-based explanations for the three roles played by the capsid to enable genome release. First, we observe, for the first time, the formation of a hydrophobic gate in the cavity along the five-fold axis of the wild-type virus capsid, which can be disrupted by an ion located in the pore. Second, the channel enables protons to permeate the capsid through a unidirectional Grotthuss-like mechanism, which is the most likely process through which the capsid senses pH. Finally, assuming that the proton leak promotes a charge imbalance in the interior of the capsid, we model an internal pressure that forces shell cracking using coarse-grained simulations. Although qualitatively, this last step could represent the mechanism of capsid opening that allows RNA release. All of our calculations are in agreement with current experimental data obtained using TrV and describe a cascade of events that could explain the destabilization and disassembly of similar icosahedral viruses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HAp1mwq20rY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Iron plays vital roles in the human body including enzymatic processes, oxygen-transport via hemoglobin and immune response. Iron metabolism is characterized by ~95% recycling and minor replenishment through diet. Anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a lack of synthesis of erythropoietin leading to reduced red blood cell (RBC) formation and aberrant iron recycling. Treatment of CKD anemia aims to normalize RBC count and serum hemoglobin. Clinically, the various fluxes of iron transport and accumulation are not measured so that changes during disease (e.g., CKD) and treatment are unknown. Unwanted iron accumulation in patients is known to lead to adverse effects. Current whole-body models lack the mechanistic details of iron transport related to RBC maturation, transferrin (Tf and TfR) dynamics and assume passive iron efflux from macrophages. Hence, they are not predictive of whole-body iron dynamics and cannot be used to design individualized patient treatment. For prediction, we developed a mechanistic, multi-scale computational model of whole-body iron metabolism incorporating four compartments containing major pools of iron and RBC generation process. The model accounts for multiple forms of iron &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, mechanisms involved in iron uptake and release and their regulation. Furthermore, the model is interfaced with drug pharmacokinetics to allow simulation of treatment dynamics. We calibrated our model with experimental and clinical data from peer-reviewed literature to reliably simulate CKD anemia and the effects of current treatment involving combination of epoietin-alpha and iron dextran. This &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; whole-body model of iron metabolism predicts that a year of treatment can potentially lead to 90% downregulation of ferroportin (FPN) levels, 15-fold increase in iron stores with only a 20% increase in iron flux from the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). Model simulations quantified unmeasured iron fluxes, previously unknown effects of treatment on FPN-level and iron stores in the RES. This mechanistic whole-body model can be the basis for future studies that incorporate iron metabolism together with related clinical experiments. Such an approach could pave the way for development of effective personalized treatment of CKD anemia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mfiym6I-5Rs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A computational study of astrocytic glutamate influence on post-synaptic neuronal excitability</title>

The ability of astrocytes to rapidly clear synaptic glutamate and purposefully release the excitatory transmitter is critical in the functioning of synapses and neuronal circuits. Dysfunctions of these homeostatic functions have been implicated in the pathology of brain disorders such as mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. However, the reasons for these dysfunctions are not clear from experimental data and computational models have been developed to provide further understanding of the implications of glutamate clearance from the extracellular space, as a result of EAAT2 downregulation: although they only partially account for the glutamate clearance process. In this work, we develop an explicit model of the astrocytic glutamate transporters, providing a more complete description of the glutamate chemical potential across the astrocytic membrane and its contribution to glutamate transporter driving force based on thermodynamic principles and experimental data. Analysis of our model demonstrates that increased astrocytic glutamate content due to glutamine synthetase downregulation also results in increased postsynaptic quantal size due to gliotransmission. Moreover, the proposed model demonstrates that increased astrocytic glutamate could prolong the time course of glutamate in the synaptic cleft and enhances astrocyte-induced slow inward currents, causing a disruption to the clarity of synaptic signalling and the occurrence of intervals of higher frequency postsynaptic firing. Overall, our work distilled the necessity of a low astrocytic glutamate concentration for reliable synaptic transmission of information and the possible implications of enhanced glutamate levels as in epilepsy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Cj--aAPMpfQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Origins of scale invariance in vocalization sequences and speech</title>

To communicate effectively animals need to detect temporal vocalization cues that vary over several orders of magnitude in their amplitude and frequency content. This large range of temporal cues is evident in the power-law scale-invariant relationship between the power of temporal fluctuations in sounds and the sound modulation frequency (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;). Though various forms of scale invariance have been described for natural sounds, the origins and implications of scale invariant phenomenon remain unknown. Using animal vocalization sequences, including continuous human speech, and a stochastic model of temporal amplitude fluctuations we demonstrate that temporal acoustic edges are the primary acoustic cue accounting for the scale invariant phenomenon. The modulation spectrum of vocalization sequences and the model both exhibit a dual regime lowpass structure with a flat region at low modulation frequencies and scale invariant 1/&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; trend for high modulation frequencies. Moreover, we find a time-frequency tradeoff between the average vocalization duration of each vocalization sequence and the cutoff frequency beyond which scale invariant behavior is observed. These results indicate that temporal edges are universal features responsible for scale invariance in vocalized sounds. This is significant since temporal acoustic edges are salient perceptually and the auditory system could exploit such statistical regularities to minimize redundancies and generate compact neural representations of vocalized sounds.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bhrtKDTjYVA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Exposure to stress increases the risk of developing affective disorders such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, these disorders occur in only a subset of individuals, those that are more vulnerable to the effects of stress, whereas others remain resilient. The coping style adopted to deal with the stressor, either passive or active coping, is related to vulnerability or resilience, respectively. Important neural substrates that mediate responses to a stressor are the orexins. These neuropeptides are altered in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with stress-related illnesses such as depression and PTSD. The present experiments used a rodent social defeat model that generates actively coping rats and passively coping rats, which we have previously shown exhibit resilient and vulnerable profiles, respectively, to examine if orexins play a role in these stress-induced phenotypes. &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; radiolabeling and qPCR revealed that actively coping rats expressed significantly lower prepro-orexin mRNA compared with passively coping rats. This led to the hypothesis that lower levels of orexins contribute to resilience to repeated social stress. To test this hypothesis, rats first underwent 5 d of social defeat to establish active and passive coping phenotypes. Then, orexin neurons were inhibited before each social defeat for three additional days using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). Inhibition of orexins increased social interaction behavior and decreased depressive-like behavior in the vulnerable population of rats. Indeed, these data suggest that lowering orexins promoted resilience to social defeat and may be an important target for treatment of stress-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Cortical Measures of Phoneme-Level Speech Encoding Correlate with the Perceived Clarity of Natural Speech</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In real-world environments, humans comprehend speech by actively integrating prior knowledge (P) and expectations with sensory input. Recent studies have revealed effects of prior information in temporal and frontal cortical areas and have suggested that these effects are underpinned by enhanced encoding of speech-specific features, rather than a broad enhancement or suppression of cortical activity. However, in terms of the specific hierarchical stages of processing involved in speech comprehension, the effects of integrating bottom-up sensory responses and top-down predictions are still unclear. In addition, it is unclear whether the predictability that comes with prior information may differentially affect speech encoding relative to the perceptual enhancement that comes with that prediction. One way to investigate these issues is through examining the impact of P on indices of cortical tracking of continuous speech features. Here, we did this by presenting participants with degraded speech sentences that either were or were not preceded by a clear recording of the same sentences while recording non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG). We assessed the impact of prior information on an isolated index of cortical tracking that reflected phoneme-level processing. Our findings suggest the possibility that prior information affects the early encoding of natural speech in a dual manner. Firstly, the availability of prior information, as hypothesized, enhanced the perceived clarity of degraded speech, which was positively correlated with changes in phoneme-level encoding across subjects. In addition, P induced an overall reduction of this cortical measure, which we interpret as resulting from the increase in predictability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Post-Stroke Intranasal (+)-Naloxone Delivery Reduces Microglial Activation and Improves Behavioral Recovery from Ischemic Injury</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of disability, and effective therapeutic strategies are needed to promote incomplete recovery. Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in stroke pathophysiology, and there is limited understanding how it affects recovery. The aim of the study was to characterize the spatiotemporal expression profile of microglial activation and to study whether dampening microglial/macrophage activation post-stroke facilitates the recovery. For dampening microglial/macrophage activation we chose intranasal administration of naloxone, a drug that is already in clinical use for opioid overdose and is known to decrease microglia/macrophage activation. We characterized the temporal progression of microglia/macrophage activation following cortical ischemic injury in rat and found the peak activation in cortex 7 days post-stroke. Unexpectedly, there was a chronic expression of phagocytic cells in the thalamus associated with neuronal loss. (+)-Naloxone, an enantiomer that reduces microglial activation without antagonizing opioid receptors, was administered intranasally starting 1 day post-stroke and continuing for 7 days. (+)-Naloxone treatment decreased microglia/macrophage activation in the striatum and thalamus, promoted behavioral recovery during the 14-day monitoring period, and reduced neuronal death in the lesioned cortex and ipsilateral thalamus. Our results are the first to show that post-stroke intranasal (+)-naloxone administration promotes short-term functional recovery and reduces microglia/macrophage activation. Therefore, (+)-naloxone is a promising drug for the treatment of ischemic stroke and further studies should be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of adult disability and new drug treatments are needed as there is no drug that would promote the recovery. Neuroinflammation is suggested to play a role in the recovery process. Naloxone is a drug used clinically to treat opioid overdose. Its opioid receptor inactive form, (+)-naloxone, is known to reduce the activation of microglia, the immune cells of the brain. We show for the first time that repeated dosing of intranasal (+)-naloxone starting one day after stroke promotes short-term recovery in rats, reduces microglial activation and neuronal loss in the stroke brain. Our finding could be important for future stroke treatment and encourages further testing of (+)-naloxone in stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: The Midline Axon Crossing Decision Is Regulated through an Activity-Dependent Mechanism by the NMDA Receptor</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0389-17.2018v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Axon guidance in vertebrates is controlled by genetic cascades as well as by intrinsic activity-dependent refinement of connections. Midline axon crossing is one of the best studied pathfinding models and is fundamental to the establishment of bilaterally symmetric nervous systems. However, it is not known whether crossing requires intrinsic activity in axons, and what controls that activity. Further, a mechanism linking neuronal activity and gene expression has not been identified for axon pathfinding. Using embryonic zebrafish, we found that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) NR1.1 subunit (&lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt;) is expressed in commissural axons. Pharmacological inhibition of &lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt;, hypoxia exposure reduction of &lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt; expression, or CRISPR knockdown of &lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt;, leads to defects in midline crossing. Inhibition of neuronal activity phenocopies the effects of &lt;i&gt;grin1a&lt;/i&gt; loss on midline crossing. By combining pharmacological inhibition of the NMDAR with optogenetic stimulation to precisely restore neuronal activity, we observed rescue of midline crossing. This suggests that the NMDAR controls pathfinding by an activity-dependent mechanism. We further show that the NMDAR may act, via modulating activity, on the transcription factor &lt;i&gt;arxa&lt;/i&gt; (mammalian &lt;i&gt;Arx&lt;/i&gt;), a known regulator of midline pathfinding. These findings uncover a novel role for the NMDAR in controlling activity to regulate commissural pathfinding, and identify &lt;i&gt;arxa&lt;/i&gt; as a key link between the genetic and activity-dependent regulation of midline axon guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; While intrinsic neuronal activity is involved in refinement of axon connections, its role in pathfinding decisions is poorly understood. We found that midline axon crossing is regulated by the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). The NMDAR is expressed on axons that cross the midline, and inhibition or knockdown of the NDMDAR led to fewer axons crossing. Precise optogenetic stimulation of neurons rescued the effects of NMDAR blockade, demonstrating that the NMDAR acts by an activity-dependent mechanism. In turn, the NMDAR affects expression of &lt;i&gt;arxa&lt;/i&gt;, an important gene for brain development and that is associated with several human neurologic diseases. These results show a critical role for the NMDAR in early axon guidance decisions by control of neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Retinal degenerations are a major cause of vision impairment and blindness. Neuroprotective therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy for retinal degenerative diseases. We investigated a novel neurotrophic factor MANF (mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor) in the retina. MANF is expressed at a high level during postnatal development and the expression declines to a lower level as the retina matures. Müller cells are the major cells expressing MANF. The expression is also found in the retinal ganglion cells, in the inner nuclear layer neurons, and in retinal pigment epithelial cells. Intravitreal injection of recombinant human MANF significantly protected rod and cone photoreceptors in rats carrying the rhodopsin S334ter mutation, and preserved ERGs (electroretinograms) in the &lt;i&gt;rd10&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Pde6b&lt;sup&gt;rd10/rd10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) mice. These results indicate that MANF is a native protein in the retina and is a potent neurotrophic factor for photoreceptor protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This is a study of high translational value to examine the neuroprotective potential of a novel neurotrophic factor MANF in the retina. MANF is expressed in the retina at high level during postnatal development and then declines as the retina matures. Recombinant MANF protects rod and cone photoreceptor cells, and preserves ERGs. These results suggest a role of MANF in the retinal development, and provide preclinical evidence for further development of MANF as a neuroprotective agent as a potential treatment for retinal degenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of benzodiazepines to terminate electrographic status epilepticus (SE) declines the longer a patient is in SE. Therefore, alternative methods for ensuring complete block of SE and refractory SE are necessary. We compared the ability of diazepam and a subanesthetic dose of urethane to terminate prolonged SE and mitigate subsequent pathologies. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) to induce SE. Rats were administered diazepam (10 mg/kg, ip) or urethane (0.8 g/kg, sc) one hour after DFP-induced SE and compared to rats that experienced uninterrupted SE. Large amplitude and high frequency spikes induced by DFP administration were quenched for at least 46 hr in rats administered urethane one hour after SE onset as demonstrated by cortical electroencephalography (EEG). By contrast, diazepam interrupted SE but seizures with high power in the 20-70Hz band returned 6-10 hr later. Urethane was more effective than diazepam at reducing hippocampal neurodegeneration, brain inflammation, gliosis and weight loss as measured on day 4 after SE. Furthermore, rats administered urethane displayed a 73% reduction in the incidence of spontaneous recurrent seizures after 4-8 weeks and a 90% reduction in frequency of seizures in epileptic rats. By contrast, behavioral changes in the light-dark box, open field and a novel object recognition task were not improved by urethane. These findings indicate that in typical rodent SE models it is the return of SE overnight, and not the initially intense 1-2 hr SE experience, that is largely responsible for neurodegeneration, accompanying inflammation, and the subsequent development of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; Delayed medical care to patients exposed to high levels of an organophosphorus (OP) agent can lead to the development of seizures and/or status epilepticus, which if left untreated results in neuropathologies and the inevitable development of epilepsy in surviving rats. Administration of the general anesthetic, urethane following DFP induced status epilepticus produced a number of beneficial consequences. Urethane effectively terminated electrographic status epilepticus, reduced neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and astrogliosis, accelerated weight regain within 4 days after DFP exposure, and reduced the incidence and frequency of spontaneous recurrent seizures. This study gives insight into therapeutic modalities for the treatment of status epilepticus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Asymmetry in the subthreshold resonance properties of neurons generated by high amplitude currents. (arXiv:1804.04748v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04748</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04748</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The impedance profile of a neuron can identify its resonant properties, even
though this measure can not distinguish if the input signal is positive or
negative. Experimental observations suggest that the response of neurons to
oscillatory inputs in different frequencies may enhance excitation or
inhibition. Here we show that this asymmetric voltage response can arise by
submitting a neuron model to ZAP functions of high amplitude. We propose a
method to characterize resonance in both depolarized and hyperpolarized states,
which depending on a combination of parameters may differ in frequency and
amplitude, and discuss on the implications of such observation. Our work offers
a simple yet biophysically grounded framework to characterize resonance
properties and to provide further advancement on the understanding of the
modulation of an input by a neuron.

Sample-induced image-degradation remains an intricate wave-optical problem in light-sheet microscopy. Here we present &lt;i&gt;biobeam&lt;/i&gt;, an open-source software package that enables simulation of operational light-sheet microscopes by combining data from 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; multiplexed and GPU-accelerated point-spread-function calculations. The wave-optical nature of these simulations leads to the faithful reproduction of spatially varying aberrations, diffraction artifacts, geometric image distortions, adaptive optics, and emergent wave-optical phenomena, and renders image-formation in light-sheet microscopy computationally tractable.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r2Zl1-90KGY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Differences in the Electrophysiological Properties of Mouse Somatosensory Layer 2/3 Neurons In Vivo and Slice Stem from Intrinsic Sources Rather than a Network-Generated High Conductance State</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Synaptic activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; can potentially alter the integration properties of neurons. Using recordings in awake mice, we targeted somatosensory layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons and compared neuronal properties with those from slices. Pyramidal cells &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; had lower resistance and gain values, as well as broader spikes and increased spike frequency adaptation compared to the same cells in slices. Increasing conductance in neurons using dynamic clamp to levels observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, however, did not lessen the differences between &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and slice conditions. Further, local application of tetrodotoxin (TTX) &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; blocked synaptic-mediated membrane voltage fluctuations but had little impact on pyramidal cell membrane input resistance and time constant values. Differences in electrophysiological properties of layer 2/3 neurons in mouse somatosensory cortex, therefore, stem from intrinsic sources separate from synaptic-mediated membrane voltage fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) Activation Suppresses TRPV1 Sensitization in Mouse, But Not Human, Sensory Neurons</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The use of human tissue to validate putative analgesic targets identified in rodents is a promising strategy for improving the historically poor translational record of preclinical pain research. We recently demonstrated that in mouse and human sensory neurons, agonists for metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3) reduce membrane hyperexcitability produced by the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Previous rodent studies indicate that mGluR2/3 can also reduce peripheral sensitization by suppressing inflammation-induced sensitization of TRPV1. Whether this observation similarly translates to human sensory neurons has not yet been tested. We found that activation of mGluR2/3 with the agonist APDC suppressed PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced sensitization of TRPV1 in mouse, but not human, sensory neurons. We also evaluated sensory neuron expression of the gene transcripts for mGluR2 (&lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt;), mGluR3 (&lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;), and TRPV1 (&lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt;). The majority of &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mouse and human sensory neurons expressed &lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;, and in both mice and humans, &lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt; was expressed in a greater percentage of sensory neurons than &lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;. Although we demonstrated a functional difference in the modulation of TRPV1 sensitization by mGluR2/3 activation between mouse and human, there were no species differences in the gene transcript colocalization of mGluR2 or mGluR3 with TRPV1 that might explain this functional difference. Taken together with our previous work, these results suggest that mGluR2/3 activation suppresses only some aspects of human sensory neuron sensitization caused by PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These differences have implications for potential healthy human voluntary studies or clinical trials evaluating the analgesic efficacy of mGluR2/3 agonists or positive allosteric modulators.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Combined Blockade of Interleukin-1{alpha} and -1{beta} Signaling Protects Mice from Cognitive Dysfunction after Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Diffuse activation of interleukin-1 inflammatory cytokine signaling after traumatic brain injury (TBI) elicits progressive neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric dysfunction, and thus represents a potential opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Although interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-1β both activate the common type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI), they manifest distinct injury-specific roles in some models of neurodegeneration. Despite its potential relevance to treating patients with TBI, however, the individual contributions of IL-1α and IL-1β to TBI-pathology have not been previously investigated. To address this need, we applied genetic and pharmacologic approaches in mice to dissect the individual contributions of IL-1α, IL-β, and IL-1RI signaling to the pathophysiology of fluid percussion–mediated TBI, a model of mixed focal and diffuse TBI. IL-1RI ablation conferred a greater protective effect on brain cytokine expression and cognitive function after TBI than did individual IL-1α or IL-1β ablation. This protective effect was recapitulated by treatment with the drug anakinra, a recombinant naturally occurring IL-1RI antagonist. Our data thus suggest that broad targeting of IL-1RI signaling is more likely to reduce neuroinflammation and preserve cognitive function after TBI than are approaches that individually target IL-1α or IL-1β signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Discovery and usage of joint attention in images. (arXiv:1804.04604v1 [cs.CV])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04604</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Joint visual attention is characterized by two or more individuals looking at
a common target at the same time. The ability to identify joint attention in
scenes, the people involved, and their common target, is fundamental to the
understanding of social interactions, including others' intentions and goals.
In this work we deal with the extraction of joint attention events, and the use
of such events for image descriptions. The work makes two novel contributions.
First, our extraction algorithm is the first which identifies joint visual
attention in single static images. It computes 3D gaze direction, identifies
the gaze target by combining gaze direction with a 3D depth map computed for
the image, and identifies the common gaze target. Second, we use a human study
to demonstrate the sensitivity of humans to joint attention, suggesting that
the detection of such a configuration in an image can be useful for
understanding the image, including the goals of the agents and their joint
activity, and therefore can contribute to image captioning and related tasks.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Automated Classification of Hand-grip action on Objects using Machine Learning. (arXiv:1804.04538v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Brain computer interface is the current area of research to provide
assistance to disabled persons. To cope up with the growing needs of BCI
applications, this paper presents an automated classification scheme for
handgrip actions on objects by using Electroencephalography (EEG) data. The
presented approach focuses on investigation of classifying correct and
incorrect handgrip responses for objects by using EEG recorded patterns. The
method starts with preprocessing of data, followed by extraction of relevant
features from the epoch data in the form of discrete wavelet transform (DWT),
and entropy measures. After computing feature vectors, artificial neural
network classifiers used to classify the patterns into correct and incorrect
handgrips on different objects. The proposed method was tested on real dataset,
which contains EEG recordings from 14 persons. The results showed that the
proposed approach is effective and may be useful to develop a variety of BCI
based devices to control hand movements.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Decision making based on behavioral and neural observations of living systems
has been extensively studied in brain science, psychology, and other
disciplines. Decision-making mechanisms have also been experimentally
implemented in physical processes, such as single photons and chaotic lasers.
The findings of these experiments suggest that there is a certain common basis
in describing decision making, regardless of its physical realizations. In this
study, we propose a local reservoir model to account for choice-based learning
(CBL). CBL describes decision consistency as a phenomenon where making a
certain decision increases the possibility of making that same decision again
later, which has been intensively investigated in neuroscience, psychology,
etc. Our proposed model is inspired by the viewpoint that a decision is
affected by its local environment, which is referred to as a local reservoir.
If the size of the local reservoir is large enough, consecutive decision making
will not be affected by previous decisions, thus showing lower degrees of
decision consistency in CBL. In contrast, if the size of the local reservoir
decreases, a biased distribution occurs within it, which leads to higher
degrees of decision consistency in CBL. In this study, an analytical approach
on local reservoirs is presented, as well as several numerical demonstrations.
Furthermore, a physical architecture for CBL based on single photons is
discussed, and the effects of local reservoirs is numerically demonstrated.
Decision consistency in human decision-making tasks and in recruiting empirical
data are evaluated based on local reservoir. In summary, the proposed local
reservoir model paves a path toward establishing a foundation for computational
mechanisms and the systematic analysis of decision making on different levels.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Association Between Brain Activation and Functional Connectivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy077</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The origin of the “resting-state” brain activity recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is still uncertain. Here we provide evidence for the neurovascular origins of the amplitude of the low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and the local functional connectivity density (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;FCD) by comparing them with task-induced blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses, which are considered a proxy for neuronal activation. Using fMRI data for 2 different tasks (Relational and Social) collected by the Human Connectome Project in 426 healthy adults, we show that ALFF and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;FCD have linear associations with the BOLD response. This association was significantly attenuated by a novel task signal regression (TSR) procedure, indicating that task performance enhances &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;FCD and ALFF in activated regions. We also show that lFCD predicts BOLD activation patterns, as was recently shown for other functional connectivity metrics, which corroborates that resting functional connectivity architecture impacts brain activation responses. Thus, our findings indicate a common source for BOLD responses, ALFF and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;FCD, which is consistent with the neurovascular origin of local hemodynamic synchrony presumably reflecting coordinated fluctuations in neuronal activity. This study also supports the development of task-evoked functional connectivity density mapping.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: MEG Working Memory N-Back Task Reveals Functional Deficits in Combat-Related Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Combat-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a leading cause of sustained cognitive impairment in military service members and Veterans. However, the mechanism of persistent cognitive deficits including working memory (WM) dysfunction is not fully understood in mTBI. Few studies of WM deficits in mTBI have taken advantage of the temporal and frequency resolution afforded by electromagnetic measurements. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and an N-back WM task, we investigated functional abnormalities in combat-related mTBI. Study participants included 25 symptomatic active-duty service members or Veterans with combat-related mTBI and 20 healthy controls with similar combat experiences. MEG source–magnitude images were obtained for alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (15–30 Hz), gamma (30–90 Hz), and low-frequency (1–7 Hz) bands. Compared with healthy combat controls, mTBI participants showed increased MEG signals across frequency bands in frontal pole (FP), ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), but decreased MEG signals in anterior cingulate cortex. Hyperactivations in FP, OFC, and anterior dlPFC were associated with slower reaction times. MEG activations in lateral FP also negatively correlated with performance on tests of letter sequencing, verbal fluency, and digit symbol coding. The profound hyperactivations from FP suggest that FP is particularly vulnerable to combat-related mTBI.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

Rho-GTPases are master regulators of polarity establishment and cell morphology. Positive feedback enables concentration of Rho-GTPases into clusters at the cell cortex, from where they regulate the cytoskeleton. Different cell types reproducibly generate either one (e.g. the front of a migrating cell) or several clusters (e.g. the multiple dendrites of a neuron), but the mechanistic basis for unipolar or multipolar outcomes is unclear. The design principles of Rho-GTPase circuits are captured by two-component reaction-diffusion models based on conserved aspects of Rho-GTPase biochemistry. Some such models display rapid winner-takes-all competition between clusters, yielding a unipolar outcome. Other models allow prolonged co-existence of clusters. We investigate the behavior of a simple class of models and show that while the timescale of competition varies enormously depending on model parameters, a single factor explains a large majority of this variation. The dominant factor concerns the degree to which the maximal active GTPase concentration in a cluster approaches a “saturation point” determined by model parameters. We suggest that both saturation and the effect of saturation on competition reflect fundamental properties of the Rho-GTPase polarity machinery, regardless of the specific feedback mechanism, which predict whether the system will generate unipolar or multipolar outcomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HtPVWxk38yc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Characterising information-theoretic storage and transfer in continuous time processes. (arXiv:1804.03269v1 [cs.IT] CROSS LISTED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03269</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03269</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The characterisation of information processing is an important task in
complex systems science. Information dynamics is a quantitative methodology for
modelling the intrinsic information processing conducted by a process
represented as a time series, but to date has only been formulated in discrete
time. Building on previous work which demonstrated how to formulate transfer
entropy in continuous time, we give a total account of information processing
in this setting, incorporating information storage. We find that a convergent
rate of predictive capacity, comprised of the transfer entropy and active
information storage, does not exist, arising through divergent rates of active
information storage. We identify that active information storage can be
decomposed into two separate quantities that characterise predictive capacity
stored in a process: active memory utilisation and instantaneous predictive
capacity. The latter involves prediction related to path regularity and so
solely inherits the divergent properties of the active information storage,
whilst the former permits definitions of pathwise and rate quantities. We
formulate measures of memory utilisation for jump and neural spiking processes
and illustrate measures of information processing in synthetic neural spiking
models and coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. The application to synthetic
neural spiking models demonstrates that active memory utilisation for point
processes consists of discontinuous jump contributions (at spikes) interrupting
a continuously varying contribution (relating to waiting times between spikes),
complementing the behaviour previously demonstrated for transfer entropy in
these processes.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Topology of Functional Connectivity and Hub Dynamics in the Beta Band As Temporal Prior for Natural Vision in the Human Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/15/3858?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Networks hubs represent points of convergence for the integration of information across many different nodes and systems. Although a great deal is known on the topology of hub regions in the human brain, little is known about their temporal dynamics. Here, we examine the static and dynamic centrality of hub regions when measured in the absence of a task (rest) or during the observation of natural or synthetic visual stimuli. We used Magnetoencephalography (MEG) in humans (both sexes) to measure static and transient regional and network-level interaction in α- and β-band limited power (BLP) in three conditions: visual fixation (rest), viewing of movie clips (natural vision), and time-scrambled versions of the same clips (scrambled vision). Compared with rest, we observed in both movie conditions a robust decrement of α-BLP connectivity. Moreover, both movie conditions caused a significant reorganization of connections in the α band, especially between networks. In contrast, β-BLP connectivity was remarkably similar between rest and natural vision. Not only the topology did not change, but the joint dynamics of hubs in a core network during natural vision was predicted by similar fluctuations in the resting state. We interpret these findings by suggesting that slow-varying fluctuations of integration occurring in higher-order regions in the β band may be a mechanism to anticipate and predict slow-varying temporal patterns of the visual environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A fundamental question in neuroscience concerns the function of spontaneous brain connectivity. Here, we tested the hypothesis that topology of intrinsic brain connectivity and its dynamics might predict those observed during natural vision. Using MEG, we tracked the static and time-varying brain functional connectivity when observers were either fixating or watching different movie clips. The spatial distribution of connections and the dynamics of centrality of a set of regions were similar during rest and movie in the β band, but not in the α band. These results support the hypothesis that the intrinsic β-rhythm integration occurs with a similar temporal structure during natural vision, possibly providing advanced information about incoming stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Controlling seizure propagation in large-scale brain networks. (arXiv:1804.03588v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Information transmission in the human brain is a fundamentally dynamic
network process. In partial epilepsy, this process is perturbed and highly
synchronous seizures originate in a local network, the so-called epileptogenic
zone (EZ), before recruiting other close or distant brain regions. We studied
patient-specific brain network models of 15 drug-resistant epilepsy patients
with implanted stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes. Each
personalized brain model was derived from structural data of magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor weighted imaging (DTI), comprising 88 nodes
equipped with region specific neural mass models capable of demonstrating a
range of epileptiform discharges. Each patients virtual brain was further
personalized through the integration of the clinically hypothesized EZ.
Subsequent simulations and connectivity modulations were performed and
uncovered a finite repertoire of seizure propagation patterns. Across patients,
we found that (i) patient-specific network connectivity is predictive for the
subsequent seizure propagation pattern; (ii)seizure propagation is
characterized by a systematic sequence of brain states; (iii) propagation can
be controlled by an optimal intervention on the connectivity matrix; (iv) the
degree of invasiveness can be significantly reduced via the here proposed
seizure control as compared to traditional resective surgery. To stop seizures,
neurosurgeons typically resect the EZ completely. We showed that stability
analysis of the network dynamics using graph theoretical metrics estimates
reliably the spatiotemporal properties of seizure propagation. This suggests
novel less invasive paradigms of surgical interventions to treat and manage
partial epilepsy.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Efficient brain simulation is a scientific grand challenge, a
parallel/distributed coding challenge and a source of requirements and
suggestions for future computing architectures. Indeed, the human brain
includes about 10^15 synapses and 10^11 neurons activated at a mean rate of
several Hz. Full brain simulation poses Exascale challenges even if simulated
at the highest abstraction level. The WaveScalES experiment in the Human Brain
Project (HBP) has the goal of matching experimental measures and simulations of
slow waves during deep-sleep and anesthesia and the transition to other brain
states. The focus is the development of dedicated large-scale
parallel/distributed simulation technologies. The ExaNeSt project designs an
ARM-based, low-power HPC architecture scalable to million of cores, developing
a dedicated scalable interconnect system, and SWA/AW simulations are included
among the driving benchmarks. At the joint between both projects is the INFN
proprietary Distributed and Plastic Spiking Neural Networks (DPSNN) simulation
engine. DPSNN can be configured to stress either the networking or the
computation features available on the execution platforms. The simulation
stresses the networking component when the neural net - composed by a
relatively low number of neurons, each one projecting thousands of synapses -
is distributed over a large number of hardware cores. When growing the number
of neurons per core, the computation starts to be the dominating component for
short range connections. This paper reports about preliminary performance
results obtained on an ARM-based HPC prototype developed in the framework of
the ExaNeSt project. Furthermore, a comparison is given of instantaneous power,
total energy consumption, execution time and energetic cost per synaptic event
of SWA/AW DPSNN simulations when executed on either ARM- or Intel-based server
platforms.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Studying the Effects of Deep Brain Stimulation and Medication on the Dynamics of STN-LFP Signals for Human Behavior Analysis. (arXiv:1804.03190v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03190</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03190</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents the results of our recent work on studying the effects of
deep brain stimulation (DBS) and medication on the dynamics of brain local
field potential (LFP) signals used for behavior analysis of patients with
Parkinson s disease (PD). DBS is a technique used to alleviate the severe
symptoms of PD when pharmacotherapy is not very effective. Behavior recognition
from the LFP signals recorded from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has
application in developing closed-loop DBS systems, where the stimulation pulse
is adaptively generated according to subjects performing behavior. Most of the
existing studies on behavior recognition that use STN-LFPs are based on the DBS
being off. This paper discovers how the performance and accuracy of automated
behavior recognition from the LFP signals are affected under different
paradigms of stimulation on/off. We first study the notion of beta power
suppression in LFP signals under different scenarios (stimulation on/off and
medication on/off). Afterward, we explore the accuracy of support vector
machines in predicting human actions (button press and reach) using the
spectrogram of STN-LFP signals. Our experiments on the recorded LFP signals of
three subjects confirm that the beta power is suppressed significantly when the
patients take medication (p-value&amp;lt;0.002) or stimulation (p-value&amp;lt;0.0003). The
results also show that we can classify different behaviors with a reasonable
accuracy of 85% even when the high-amplitude stimulation is applied.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Quantifying behavior is crucial for many applications in neuroscience.
Videography provides easy methods for the observation and recording of animal
behavior in diverse settings, yet extracting particular aspects of a behavior
for further analysis can be highly time consuming. In motor control studies,
humans or other animals are often marked with reflective markers to assist with
computer-based tracking, yet markers are intrusive (especially for smaller
animals), and the number and location of the markers must be determined a
priori. Here, we present a highly efficient method for markerless tracking
based on transfer learning with deep neural networks that achieves excellent
results with minimal training data. We demonstrate the versatility of this
framework by tracking various body parts in a broad collection of experimental
settings: mice odor trail-tracking, egg-laying behavior in drosophila, and
mouse hand articulation in a skilled forelimb task. For example, during the
skilled reaching behavior, individual joints can be automatically tracked (and
a confidence score is reported). Remarkably, even when a small number of frames
are labeled ($\approx 200$), the algorithm achieves excellent tracking
performance on test frames that is comparable to human accuracy.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A theory of consciousness: computation, algorithm, and neurobiological realization. (arXiv:1804.02952v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02952</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02952</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The most enigmatic aspect of consciousness is the fact that it is felt, as a
subjective sensation. This particular aspect is explained by the theory
proposed here. The theory encompasses both the computation that is presumably
involved and the way in which that computation may be realized in the brain's
neurobiology. It is assumed that the brain makes an internal estimate of an
individual's own evolutionary fitness, which can be shown to produce an
irreducible, distinct cause. Communicating components of the fitness estimate
(either for external or internal use) requires inverting them. Such inversion
can be performed by the thalamocortical feedback loop in the mammalian brain,
if that loop is operating in a switched, dual-stage mode. A first
(nonconscious) stage produces forward estimates, whereas the second (conscious)
stage inverts those estimates. It is argued that inversion produces
irreducible, distinct, and spatially localized causes, which are plausibly
sensed as the feeling of consciousness.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Visual detection of time-varying signals: opposing biases and their timescales. (arXiv:1804.02885v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02885</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02885</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human visual perception is a complex, dynamic and fluctuating process. In
addition to the incoming visual stimulus, it is affected by many other factors
including temporal context, both external and internal to the observer. In this
study we investigate the dynamic properties of psychophysical responses to a
continuous stream of visual near-threshold detection tasks. We manipulate the
incoming signals to have temporal structures with various characteristic
timescales. Responses of human observers to these signals are analyzed using
tools that highlight their dynamical features as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find that two opposing biases shape perception, and operate over distinct
timescales. Positive recency appears over short times, e.g. consecutive trials.
Adaptation, entailing an increased probability of changed response, reflects
trends over longer times. Analysis of psychometric curves conditioned on
various temporal events reveals that the balance between the two biases can
shift depending on their interplay with the temporal properties of the input
signal. A simple mathematical model reproduces the experimental data in all
stimulus regimes. Taken together, our results support the view that visual
response fluctuations reflect complex internal dynamics, possibly related to
higher cognitive processes.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Big imaging data is becoming more prominent in brain sciences across
spatiotemporal scales and phylogenies. We have developed a computational
ecosystem that enables storage, visualization, and analysis of these data in
the cloud, thusfar spanning 20+ publications and 100+ terabytes including
nanoscale ultrastructure, microscale synaptogenetic diversity, and mesoscale
whole brain connectivity, making NeuroData the largest and most diverse open
repository of brain data.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The new phenomenological model of the ensemble of three neurons with chemical
(synaptic) and electrical couplings has been studied. One neuron is modeled by
a single Van der Pol oscillator. The influence of the electrical coupling
strength and the frequency mismatch between the elements to the regime of
sequential activity is investigated.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Baby brains reflect maternal inflammation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baby brains reflect maternal inflammation, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0134-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0134-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Epidemiology and animal research have shown that the offspring of mothers who experience inflammation during pregnancy are at increased risk for psychopathology. A human study links a mother’s inflammation during pregnancy to her newborn’s functional brain organization and the child’s working memory two years later.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/Ngzyqfknp-A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tbr1 instructs laminar patterning of retinal ganglion cell dendrites&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tbr1 instructs laminar patterning of retinal ganglion cell dendrites, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0127-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0127-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Specific retinal connectivity depends on laminar restriction of neuronal processes. The authors show that a single transcription factor specifies a common laminar identity in dendrites of four retinal cell types, albeit via cell-type-specific means.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/eIKIN32gJvk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Slow-Wave Activity Enhancement to Improve Cognition</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30064-X?rss=yes</guid>

	<description>Slow-wave activity (SWA), and its coupling with other sleep features, reorganizes cortical circuitry, supporting cognition. This raises the question: can cognition be improved through SWA enhancement? SWA enhancement techniques range from behavioral interventions (such as exercise), which have high feasibility but low specificity, to laboratory-based techniques (such as transcranial stimulation), which have high specificity but are less feasible for widespread use. In this review we describe the pathways through which SWA is enhanced.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: ‘Surface Transplantation’ for Nerve Injury and Repair: The Quest for Minimally Invasive Cell Delivery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30069-9?rss=yes</guid>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30069-9?rss=yes</link>
	<description>Cell transplantation is an ambitious, but arguably realistic, therapy for repair of the nervous system. Cell delivery is a major challenge for clinical translation, especially given the apparently inhibitory astrogliotic environment in degenerated tissue. However, astrogliotic tissue also contains endogenous structural and biochemical cues that can be harnessed for functional repair. Minimizing damage to these cues during cell delivery could enhance cell integration. This theory is supported by studies with an auditory astrocyte scar model, in which cells delivered onto the surface of the damaged nerve were more successfully integrated in the host than those injected into the tissue.</description>

	<description>Deafness causes speech to deteriorate, but whether this deterioration reflects an active or passive process is unclear. Birdsong – a learned vocal behavior that resembles speech in its dependence on auditory feedback – also deteriorates following deafening. In their 2000 paper, Brainard and Doupe showed that, following deafening, birdsong deteriorates through an active process mediated by a cortex–basal ganglia (BG) circuit.</description>

	<description>In the late 1970s, key discoveries in neurophysiology, psychophysics, computer vision, and image processing had reached a tipping point that would shape visual science for decades to come. David Marr and Ellen Hildreth’s ‘Theory of edge detection’, published in 1980, set out to integrate the newly available wealth of data from behavioral, physiological, and computational approaches in a unifying theory. Although their work had wide and enduring ramifications, their most important contribution may have been to consolidate the foundations of the ongoing dialogue between theoretical and empirical vision science.</description>

In 2010, Churchland et al. reported wide experimental evidence showing that spontaneous and stimulus-evoked conditions are two distinct states, as indicated by a marked reduction of neuronal variability after stimulus onset.</description>

	<description>How are different neural cell types generated from progenitor cells? In 1990, Turner et al. used new lineage tracing techniques to show that different cells in the mammalian retina share their progenitor origin. The findings established a key step toward our understanding of how multipotent progenitor cells give rise to complex circuitry in the retina.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Complement: The Emerging Architect of the Developing Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30070-5?rss=yes</guid>

	<description>Complement activation products have long been associated with roles in the innate immune system, linking the humoral and cellular responses. However, among their recently described non-inflammatory roles, complement proteins also have multiple emerging novel functions in brain development. Within this context, separate proteins and pathways of complement have carved out physiological niches in the formation, development, and refinement of neurons. They demonstrate actions that are both reminiscent of peripheral immune actions and removed from them.</description>
