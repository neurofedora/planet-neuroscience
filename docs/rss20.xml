	<title>Annals of Neurology: To do or not to do? Plasma exchange and timing of steroid administration in PML</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25070</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25070</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To retrospectively analyze the effect of plasma exchange (PLEX, yes=PLEX+, no=PLEX-) and steroids administration timing (prophylactically –proST- or therapeutically –therST-) on the longitudinal clinical course of patients with natalizumab related progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and full blown immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (PML-IRIS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Clinical and radiological data of 42 Italian patients with PML were analyzed. Patient's data are available until 12 months after PML diagnosis. PLEX and steroids treatment as time-dependent covariates were entered in: i) a Cox model to investigate their impact on full blown PML-IRIS latency; ii) an ANOVA to investigate their impact on IRIS duration; iii) a linear mixed model to assess their impact on the longitudinal clinical course (measured by means of EDSS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Treatment with PLEX was not associated to PML-IRIS latency (HR=1.05, p=0.92), but once IRIS emerged, its duration was significantly longer in patients who underwent PLEX (101 vs 54 days in PLEX+ and PLEX- patients, p=0.028). Receiving proST vs therST was not associated to IRIS latency (HR=0.67, p=0.39) or duration (p=0.95). Patients who underwent proST had a significant higher EDSS increase during PML (0.09 EDSS points per month, p=0.04) as compared to those who had therST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: this study highlights that: i) caution on the use of PLEX should be considered as the current data do not support a beneficial effect of PLEX; ii) caution on the early use of steroids is suggested since their prophylactic use to prevent full blown PML-IRIS seems to negatively impact on the longitudinal disability course.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: High-dimensional dynamics of generalization error in neural networks. (arXiv:1710.03667v1 [stat.ML])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03667</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03667</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We perform an average case analysis of the generalization dynamics of large
neural networks trained using gradient descent. We study the
practically-relevant &quot;high-dimensional&quot; regime where the number of free
parameters in the network is on the order of or even larger than the number of
examples in the dataset. Using random matrix theory and exact solutions in
linear models, we derive the generalization error and training error dynamics
of learning and analyze how they depend on the dimensionality of data and
signal to noise ratio of the learning problem. We find that the dynamics of
gradient descent learning naturally protect against overtraining and
overfitting in large networks. Overtraining is worst at intermediate network
sizes, when the effective number of free parameters equals the number of
samples, and thus can be reduced by making a network smaller or larger.
Additionally, in the high-dimensional regime, low generalization error requires
starting with small initial weights. We then turn to non-linear neural
networks, and show that making networks very large does not harm their
generalization performance. On the contrary, it can in fact reduce
overtraining, even without early stopping or regularization of any sort. We
identify two novel phenomena underlying this behavior in overcomplete models:
first, there is a frozen subspace of the weights in which no learning occurs
under gradient descent; and second, the statistical properties of the
high-dimensional regime yield better-conditioned input correlations which
protect against overtraining. We demonstrate that naive application of
worst-case theories such as Rademacher complexity are inaccurate in predicting
the generalization performance of deep neural networks, and derive an
alternative bound which incorporates the frozen subspace and conditioning
effects and qualitatively matches the behavior observed in simulation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Auditory Brainstem Response in Infants and Children with Autism: A Meta-Analysis. (arXiv:1710.03613v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03613</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03613</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Infants with autism were recently found to have prolonged Auditory Brainstem
Response (ABR); however, at older ages, findings are contradictory. We compared
ABR differences between participants with autism and controls with respect to
age using a meta-analysis. Data sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of
Science, Google Scholar, HOLLIS and ScienceDirect from their inception to June
2016. The 25 studies that were included had a total of 1349 participants (727
participants with autism and 622 controls) and an age range of 0-40 years.
Prolongation of wave V in autism had a significant negative correlation with
age (R2=0.23; P=.01). The 22 studies below age 18 years showed a significantly
prolonged wave V in autism (Standard Mean Difference=0.6 [95% CI, 0.5 to 0.8];
P&amp;lt;.001). The 3 studies above 18 years of age showed a significantly shorter
wave V in autism (SMD=-0.6 [95% CI, -1.0 to -0.2]; P=.004). Prolonged ABR was
consistent in infants and children with autism, suggesting it can serve as an
autism biomarker at infancy. As the ABR is routinely used to screen infants for
hearing impairment, the opportunity for replication studies is extensive.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A novel method linking neural connectivity to behavioral fluctuations: Behavior-Regressed Connectivity. (arXiv:1606.05522v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05522</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05522</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: During an experimental session, behavioral performance
fluctuates, yet most neuroimaging analyses of functional connectivity derive a
single connectivity pattern. These conventional connectivity approaches assume
that since the underlying behavior of the task remains constant, the
connectivity pattern is also constant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Method: We introduce a novel method, behavior-regressed connectivity
(BRC), to directly examine behavioral fluctuations within an experimental
session and capture their relationship to changes in functional connectivity.
This method employs the weighted phase lag index (WPLI) applied to a window of
trials with a weighting function. Using two datasets, the BRC results are
compared to conventional connectivity results during two time windows: the one
second before stimulus onset to identify predictive relationships, and the one
second after onset to capture task-dependent relationships.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: In both tasks, we replicate the expected results for the
conventional connectivity analysis, and extend our understanding of the
brain-behavior relationship using the BRC analysis, demonstrating
subject-specific connectivity patterns that correspond to both positive and
negative relationships with behavior.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparison with Existing Method(s): Conventional connectivity analyses assume
a consistent relationship between behaviors and functional connectivity, but
the BRC method examines performance variability within an experimental session
to understand dynamic connectivity and transient behavior.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The BRC approach examines connectivity as it covaries with
behavior to complement the knowledge of underlying neural activity derived from
conventional connectivity analyses. Within this framework, BRC may be
implemented for the purpose of understanding performance variability both
within and between participants.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;:To detect and quantify peripheral nerve lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: 36 patients diagnosed with MS based on the 2010 McDonald criteria (34 with the relapsing-remitting form, 2 with clinically isolated syndrome) with and without disease modifying treatment were compared to 35 healthy age/sex-matched volunteers. All patients underwent detailed neurological and electrophysiological examinations. 3T MRN with large anatomical coverage of both legs and the lumbosacral plexus was performed by using 2D fat-saturated, T2-weighted and dual echo turbo-spin-echo sequences as well as a 3D T2-weighted, fat-saturated SPACE sequence. Besides qualitative visual nerve assessment, a T2w-signal quantification was performed by calculation of proton-spin-density and T2-relaxation time. Nerve diameter was measured as a morphometric criterion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;:T2w-hyperintense nerve lesions were detectable in all MS patients with a mean lesion number at thigh level of 151.5±5.7 vs. 19.1±2.4 in controls (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Nerve proton-spin-density was higher in MS (tibial/peroneal: 371.8±7.7/368.9±8.2) vs. controls (tibial/peroneal: 266.0±11.0/276.8±9.7;p&amp;lt;0.0001). In contrast, T2-relaxation time was significantly higher in controls (tibial/peroneal:82.0±2.1/78.3±1.7) vs. MS (tibial/peroneal:64.3±1.0/61.2±0.9; p&amp;lt;0.0001). Proximal tibial and peroneal nerve caliber was higher in MS (tibial:52.4±2.1mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; peroneal:25.4±1.3mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) vs. controls (tibial:45.2±1.4mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; p&amp;lt;0.0015; peroneal:21.3±0.7mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; p=0.0049).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;:Peripheral nerve lesions could be visualized and quantified in MS &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; by high resolution MRN. Lesions are defined by an increase of proton-spin-density and a decrease of T2-relaxation time, indicating changes in the microstructural organization of the extracellular matrix in peripheral nerve tissue in MS. By showing involvement of the peripheral nervous system in MS, this proof-of-concept study may offer new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of MS. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: General principles of binding between cell surface receptors and multi-specific ligands: A computational study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jiawen Chen, Steven C. Almo, Yinghao Wu&lt;/p&gt;

The interactions between membrane receptors and extracellular ligands control cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, and environmental responsiveness by representing the initial steps of cell signaling pathways. These interactions can be spatial-temporally regulated when different extracellular ligands are tethered. The detailed mechanisms of this spatial-temporal regulation, including the competition between distinct ligands with overlapping binding sites and the conformational flexibility in multi-specific ligand assemblies have not been quantitatively evaluated. We present a new coarse-grained model to realistically simulate the binding process between multi-specific ligands and membrane receptors on cell surfaces. The model simplifies each receptor and each binding site in a multi-specific ligand as a rigid body. Different numbers or types of ligands are spatially organized together in the simulation. These designs were used to test the relation between the overall binding of a multi-specific ligand and the affinity of its cognate binding site. When a variety of ligands are exposed to cells expressing different densities of surface receptors, we demonstrated that ligands with reduced affinities have higher specificity to distinguish cells based on the relative concentrations of their receptors. Finally, modification of intramolecular flexibility was shown to play a role in optimizing the binding between receptors and ligands. In summary, our studies bring new insights to the general principles of ligand-receptor interactions. Future applications of our method will pave the way for new strategies to generate next-generation biologics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x-8iK-8w2t8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Neural coding in the visual system of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;: How do small neural populations support visually guided behaviours?</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Alex D. M. Dewar, Antoine Wystrach, Andrew Philippides, Paul Graham&lt;/p&gt;

All organisms wishing to survive and reproduce must be able to respond adaptively to a complex, changing world. Yet the computational power available is constrained by biology and evolution, favouring mechanisms that are parsimonious yet robust. Here we investigate the information carried in small populations of visually responsive neurons in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. These so-called ‘ring neurons’, projecting to the ellipsoid body of the central complex, are reported to be necessary for complex visual tasks such as pattern recognition and visual navigation. Recently the receptive fields of these neurons have been mapped, allowing us to investigate how well they can support such behaviours. For instance, in a simulation of classic pattern discrimination experiments, we show that the pattern of output from the ring neurons matches observed fly behaviour. However, performance of the neurons (as with flies) is not perfect and can be easily improved with the addition of extra neurons, suggesting the neurons’ receptive fields are not optimised for recognising abstract shapes, a conclusion which casts doubt on cognitive explanations of fly behaviour in pattern recognition assays. Using artificial neural networks, we then assess how easy it is to decode more general information about stimulus shape from the ring neuron population codes. We show that these neurons are well suited for encoding information about size, position and orientation, which are more relevant behavioural parameters for a fly than abstract pattern properties. This leads us to suggest that in order to understand the properties of neural systems, one must consider how perceptual circuits put information at the service of behaviour.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DGYmgqBhDFo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>Dysfunction of microglia is known to play an important role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we investigated the role of RIPK1 in microglia mediating the pathogenesis of AD. RIPK1 is highly expressed by microglial cells in human AD brains.

	<description>There are no general methods for reliably assessing the firing properties or even calcium profiles of specific neurons in freely moving flies. To this end, we adapted a GFP-based calcium reporter to luciferase that was expressed in small subsets of circadian neurons.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Previous work measures spinal cord thinning in chronic progressive myelopathies, including HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Quantitative measurements of spinal cord atrophy are important in fully characterizing these and other spinal cord diseases. We aimed to investigate patterns of spinal cord atrophy and correlations with clinical markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Spinal cord cross sectional area was measured in individuals (24 healthy controls (HC), 17 asymptomatic carriers of HTLV-1 (AC), 47 HAM/TSP, 74 RRMS, 17 SPMS, and 40 PPMS) from C1 to T10. Clinical disability scores, viral markers, and immunological parameters were obtained for patients and correlated with representative spinal cord cross sectional area regions at the C2-C3, C4-C5, and T4-T9 levels. In two HAM/TSP patients, spinal cord cross sectional area was measured over three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: All spinal cord regions are thinner in HAM/TSP (56 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [SD 10], 59 [10], 23 [5]) than in HC (76 [7], 83 [8], 38 [4]) and AC (71 [7], 78 [9], 36 [7]). SPMS (62 [9], 66 [9], 32 [6]) and PPMS (65 [11], 68 [10], 35 [7]) have thinner cervical cords than HC and RRMS (73 [9], 77 [10], 37 [6]). Clinical disability scores (EDSS (p=0.009) and IPEC(p=0.03)) and CD8+ T cell frequency (p=0.04) correlate with T4-T9 spinal cord cross sectional area in HAM/TSP. Higher CSF HTLV-1 proviral load (p=0.01) was associated with thinner spinal cord cross sectional area. Both HAM/TSP patients followed longitudinally showed thoracic thinning followed by cervical thinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: Group average spinal cord cross sectional area in HAM/TSP and progressive MS show spinal cord atrophy. We further hypothesize that is possible that neuroglial loss from a thoracic inflammatory process results in anterograde and retrograde degeneration of axons, leading to the temporal progression of thoracic to cervical atrophy described here.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Stroke-Induced Chronic Systolic Dysfunction Driven by Sympathetic Overactivity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25073</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Cardiac diseases are established risk factors for ischemic stroke incidence and severity. Conversely, there is increasing evidence that brain ischemia can cause cardiac dysfunction. The mechanisms underlying this neurogenic heart disease are incompletely understood. While it is established that ischemic stroke is associated with cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial damage, elevated cardiac enzymes and plasma catecholamines in the acute phase, nothing is known about the delayed consequences of ischemic stroke on cardiovascular function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: To determine the long-term cardiac consequences of a focal cerebral ischemia, we subjected young and aged mice to a 30-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and analyzed cardiac function by serial transthoracic echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements up to week 8 after surgery. Finally, animals were treated with metoprolol to evaluate a pharmacologic treatment option to prevent the development of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Focal cerebral ischemia induced a long-term cardiac dysfunction with a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and an increase in left ventricular volumes; this development was associated with higher peripheral sympathetic activity. Metoprolol treatment prevented the development of chronic cardiac dysfunction by decelerating extracellular cardiac remodeling and inhibiting sympathetic signaling relevant to chronic autonomic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Focal cerebral ischemia in mice leads to the development of chronic systolic dysfunction driven by increased sympathetic activity. If these results can be confirmed in a clinical setting, treating physicians should be attentive to clinical signs of heart failure in every patient after ischemic stroke. Therapeutically, the successful β-blockade with metoprolol in mice could also have future clinical implications. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Traumatic Brain Injury in the Prodromal Period of Parkinson Disease: A Large Epidemiological Study Using Medicare Data</title>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Studies suggest a greater risk of Parkinson disease (PD) after traumatic brain injury (TBI), but it is possible that the risk of TBI is greater in the prodromal period of PD. We aimed to examine the time-to-TBI in PD patients in their prodromal period compared to population-based controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We identified 89,790 incident PD cases and 118,095 comparable controls &amp;gt; 65 years of age in 2009 using Medicare claims data. Using data from the preceding five years, we compared time-to-TBI in PD patients in their prodromal period to controls. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for TBI in a Cox regression, while adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, modified Charlson comorbidity index, smoking, and alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Risk of TBI was greater in PD patients in their prodromal period across all age and sex groups, with HRs consistently increasing with proximity to PD diagnosis. HRs ranged from 1.64 (95% CI 1.52, 1.77) five years prior to diagnosis to 3.93 (95% CI 3.74, 4.13) in the year prior. The interaction between PD, TBI, and time was primarily observed for TBI attributed to falls. Motor dysfunction and cognitive impairment, suggested by corresponding ICD-9 codes, partially mediated the PD-TBI association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: There is a strong association between PD and a recent TBI in the prodromal period of PD. This association strengthens as PD diagnosis approaches and may be a result of undetected non-motor and motor symptoms, but confirmation will be required. This article is protected by copyright.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;/b&gt;: To investigate the associations between age, vascular health, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) imaging biomarkers in an elderly sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;METHODS&lt;/b&gt;: We identified 430 individuals along the cognitive continuum aged&amp;gt;60 years with amyloid-PET, Tau-PET, and MRI scans from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. A subset of 329 individuals had FDG-PET. We ascertained presently existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from healthcare records and used the summation of presence/absence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac-arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke as a surrogate for vascular health. We used global amyloid from PiB-PET, entorhinal cortex tau uptake (ERC-tau) from Tau-PET, and neurodegeneration in AD signature regions from MRI and FDG-PET as surrogates for AD pathophysiology. We dichotomized participants into CMC=0 (CMC-) vs. CMC&amp;gt;0 (CMC+) and tested for age-adjusted group differences in AD biomarkers. Using structural equation models (SEM), we assessed the impact of vascular health on AD biomarker cascade (amyloid leads to tau leads to neurodegeneration) after considering the direct and indirect age, sex, and APOE effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RESULTS&lt;/b&gt;: CMC+ participants had significantly greater neurodegeneration than CMC- participants but did not differ by amyloid or ERC-tau. The SEM models showed that i) vascular health had a significant direct and indirect impact on neurodegeneration but not on amyloid; and ii) vascular health specifically the presence of hyperlipidemia had a significant direct impact on ERC-tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;INTERPRETATION&lt;/b&gt;: Vascular health had quantifiably greater impact on neurodegeneration in AD regions than on amyloid deposition. Longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify the relationship between tau deposition and vascular health. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Prediction of phenotypic severity in mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25069</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25069</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective&lt;/em&gt;: Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA or Sanfilippo disease type A is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder presenting in early childhood, caused by an inherited deficiency of the lysosomal hydrolase sulfamidase. New missense mutations, for which genotype-phenotype correlations are currently unknown, are frequently reported, hampering early prediction of phenotypic severity and efficacy assessment of new disease-modifying treatments. We aimed to design a method to determine phenotypic severity early in the disease course. &lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;: Fifty-three patients were included of whom skin fibroblasts and data on disease course and mutation analysis were available. Patients were phenotypically characterized on clinical data as ‘rapidly progressing' or ‘slowly progressing'. Sulfamidase activity was measured in fibroblasts cultured at 37°C and at 30°C. &lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;: Sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts from patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for a combination of known severe mutations remained below the limit of quantification under both culture conditions. In contrast, sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts from patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for a known mild mutation increased above the limit of quantification when cultured at 30°C. With division on the basis of the patients phenotype, fibroblasts from ‘slowly progressing' patients could be separated from ‘rapid progressing' patients by increase in sulfamidase activity when cultured at 30°C (p&amp;lt;0.001, sensitivity 96%, specificity 93%). &lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;: Phenotypic severity strongly correlates with the potential to increase sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts cultured at 30°C, allowing reliable distinction between patients with ‘rapidly progressing' or ‘slowly progressing' phenotypes. This method may provide an essential tool for assessment of treatment effects and for healthcare and life planning decisions. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Bicycling suppresses abnormal beta synchrony in the Parkinsonian basal ganglia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25047</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25047</link>
	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25047-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freezing of gait is a poorly understood symptom of Parkinson disease, and can severely disrupt the locomotion of affected patients. However, bicycling ability remains surprisingly unaffected in most patients suffering from freezing, suggesting functional differences in the motor network. The purpose of this study was to characterize and contrast the oscillatory dynamics underlying bicycling and walking in the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25047-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We present the first local field potential recordings directly comparing bicycling and walking in Parkinson disease patients with electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nuclei for deep brain stimulation. Low (13–22Hz) and high (23–35Hz) beta power changes were analyzed in 22 subthalamic nuclei from 13 Parkinson disease patients (57.5 ± 5.9 years old, 4 female). The study group consisted of 5 patients with and 8 patients without freezing of gait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25047-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In patients without freezing of gait, both bicycling and walking led to a suppression of subthalamic beta power (13–35Hz), and this suppression was stronger for bicycling. Freezers showed a similar pattern in general. Superimposed on this pattern, however, we observed a movement-induced, narrowband power increase around 18Hz, which was evident even in the absence of freezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25047-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results indicate that bicycling facilitates overall suppression of beta power. Furthermore, movement leads to exaggerated synchronization in the low beta band specifically within the basal ganglia of patients susceptible to freezing. Abnormal ∼18Hz oscillations are implicated in the pathophysiology of freezing of gait, and suppressing them may form a key strategy in developing potential therapies.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Research showed that, the information transmitted in biological neurons is
encoded in the instants of successive action potentials or their firing rate.
In addition to that, in-vivo operation of the neuron makes measurement
difficult and thus continuous data collection is restricted. Due to those
reasons, classical mean square estimation techniques that are frequently used
in neural network training is very difficult to apply. In such situations,
point processes and related likelihood methods may be beneficial. In this
study, we will present how one can apply certain methods to use the
stimulus-response data obtained from a neural process in the mathematical
modeling of a neuron. The study is theoretical in nature and it will be
supported by simulations. In addition it will be compared to a similar study.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Trained recurrent networks are powerful tools for modeling dynamic neural
computations. We present a target-based method for modifying the full
connectivity matrix of a recurrent network to train it to perform tasks
involving temporally complex input/output transformations. The method
introduces a second network during training to provide suitable &quot;target&quot;
dynamics useful for performing the task. Because it exploits the full recurrent
connectivity, the method produces networks that perform tasks with fewer
neurons and greater noise robustness than traditional least-squares (FORCE)
approaches. In addition, we show how introducing additional input signals into
the target-generating network, which act as task hints, greatly extends the
range of tasks that can be learned and provides control over the complexity and
nature of the dynamics of the trained, task-performing network.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The spiking activity of principal cells in mammalian hippocampus encodes an
internalized neuronal representation of the ambient space---a cognitive map.
Once learned, such a map enables the animal to navigate a given environment for
a long period. However, the neuronal substrate that produces this map remains
transient: the synaptic connections in the hippocampus and in the downstream
neuronal networks never cease to form and to deteriorate at a rapid rate. How
can the brain maintain a robust, reliable representation of space using a
network that constantly changes its architecture? Here, we demonstrate, using
novel Algebraic Topology techniques, that cognitive map's stability is a
generic, emergent phenomenon. The model allows evaluating the effect produced
by specific physiological parameters, e.g., the distribution of connections'
decay times, on the properties of the cognitive map as a whole. It also points
out that spatial memory deterioration caused by weakening or excessive loss of
the synaptic connections may be compensated by simulating the neuronal
activity. Lastly, the model explicates functional importance of the
complementary learning systems for processing spatial information at different
levels of spatiotemporal granularity, by establishing three complementary
timescales at which spatial information unfolds. Thus, the model provides a
principal insight into how can the brain develop a reliable representation of
the world, learn and retain memories despite complex plasticity of the
underlying networks and allows studying how instabilities and memory
deterioration mechanisms may affect learning process.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Expectation-induced modulation of metastable activity underlies faster coding of sensory stimuli. (arXiv:1710.02563v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory stimuli can be recognized more rapidly when they are expected. This
phenomenon depends on expectation affecting the cortical processing of sensory
information. However, virtually nothing is known on the mechanisms responsible
for the effects of expectation on sensory networks. Here, we report a novel
computational mechanism underlying the expectation-dependent acceleration of
coding observed in the gustatory cortex (GC) of alert rats. We use a recurrent
spiking network model with a clustered architecture capturing essential
features of cortical activity, including the metastable activity observed in GC
before and after gustatory stimulation. Relying both on network theory and
computer simulations, we propose that expectation exerts its function by
modulating the intrinsically generated dynamics preceding taste delivery. Our
model, whose predictions are confirmed in the experimental data, demonstrates
how the modulation of intrinsic metastable activity can shape sensory coding
and mediate cognitive processes such as the expectation of relevant events.
Altogether, these results provide a biologically plausible theory of
expectation and ascribe a new functional role to intrinsically generated,
metastable activity.

	<description>Many sensory neural circuits exhibit response normalization, which occurs when the response of a neuron to a combination of multiple stimuli is less than the sum of the responses to the individual stimuli presented alone. In the visual cortex, normalization takes the forms of cross-orientation suppression and surround suppression. At the onset of visual experience, visual circuits are partially developed and exhibit some mature features such as orientation selectivity, but it is unknown whether cross-orientation suppression or surround suppression are present at the onset of visual experience or require visual experience for their emergence. We characterized the development of these properties and their dependence on visual experience in ferrets. Visual experience was varied across three conditions: typical rearing, dark rearing, and dark rearing with daily exposure to simple sinusoidal gratings (14-16 hours total). Cross-orientation suppression and surround suppression were noted in the earliest observations, and did not vary considerably with experience. We also observed evidence of continued maturation of receptive field properties in the second month of visual experience: substantial length summation was observed only in the oldest animals (postnatal day 90); evoked firing rates were greatly increased in older animals; and direction selectivity required experience, but declined slightly in older animals. These results constrain the space of possible circuit implementations of these features.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Bayesian Optimisation for Neuroimaging Pre-processing in Brain Age Prediction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/201061v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Neuroimaging-based age predictions using machine learning have been shown to relate to cognitive performance, health outcomes and progression of neurodegenerative disease. However, even leading age-prediction algorithms contain measurement error, motivating efforts to improve experimental pipelines. T1-weighted MRI is commonly used for age prediction, and the pre-processing of these scans involves normalisation to a common template and resampling to a common voxel size, followed by spatial smoothing. Resampling parameters are often selected arbitrarily. Here, we sought to improve brain-age prediction accuracy by optimising resampling parameters using Bayesian optimisation. Using data on N=2001 healthy individuals (aged 16-90 years) we trained support vector machines to i) distinguish between young (&amp;lt;50 years) and old (&amp;gt;50 years) brains and ii) predict chronological age, with accuracy assessed using cross-validation. We also evaluated model generalisability to the Cam-CAN dataset (N=648, aged 18-88 years). Bayesian optimisation was used to identify optimal voxel size and smoothing kernel size for each task. This procedure adaptively samples the parameter space to evaluate accuracy across a range of possible parameters, using independent sub-samples to iteratively assess different parameter combinations to arrive at optimal values. When distinguishing between young and old brains a classification accuracy of 96.25% was achieved, with voxel size = 11.5mm3 and smoothing kernel = 2.3mm. For predicting chronological age, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.08 years was achieved, with voxel size = 3.73mm3 and smoothing kernel = 3.68mm. This was compared to performance using default values of 1.5mm3 and 4mm respectively, which gave a MAE = 5.48 years, a 7.3% improvement. When assessing generalisability, best performance was achieved when applying the entire Bayesian optimisation framework to the new dataset, out-performing the parameters optimised for the initial training dataset. Our study demonstrates the proof-of-principle that neuroimaging models for brain age prediction can be improved by using Bayesian optimisation to select more appropriate pre-processing parameters. Our results suggest that different parameters are selected and performance improves when optimisation is conducted in specific contexts. This motivates use of optimisation techniques at many different points during the experimental process, which may result in improved statistical sensitivity and reduce opportunities for experimenter-led bias.</description>

	<description>The heterogeneous organization of the mammalian neocortex poses a challenge to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its physiological processes. Although high-throughput molecular methods are increasingly deployed in neuroscience, their anatomical specificity is often lacking. Here we introduce a targeted microdissection technique that enables extraction of high-quality RNA and proteins at high anatomical resolution from acutely prepared brain slices. We exemplify its utility by isolating single cortical columns and laminae from the mouse primary somatosensory (barrel) cortex. Tissues can be isolated from living slices in minutes, and the extracted RNA and protein are of sufficient quantity and quality to be used for RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry. This technique will help to increase the anatomical specificity of molecular studies of the neocortex, and the brain in general as it is applicable to any brain structure that can be identified using optical landmarks in living slices.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neural signatures of dynamic emotion constructs in the human brain</title>

	<description>How is emotion represented in the brain: is it categorical or along dimensions? In the present study, we applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study the brain's temporally unfolding representations of different emotion constructs. First, participants rated 525 images on the dimensions of valence and arousal and by intensity of discrete emotion categories (happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, and sadness). Thirteen new participants then viewed subsets of these images within an MEG scanner. We used Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to compare behavioral ratings to the unfolding neural representation of the stimuli in the brain. Ratings of valence and arousal explained significant proportions of the MEG data, even after corrections for low-level image properties. Additionally, behavioral ratings of the discrete emotions fear, disgust, and happiness significantly predicted early neural representations, whereas rating models of anger and sadness did not. Different emotion constructs also showed unique temporal signatures. Fear and disgust - both highly arousing and negative - were rapidly discriminated by the brain, but disgust was represented for an extended period of time relative to fear. Overall, our findings suggest that 1) dimensions of valence and arousal are quickly represented by the brain, as are some discrete emotions, and 2) different emotion constructs exhibit unique temporal dynamics. We discuss implications of these findings for theoretical understanding of emotion and for the interplay of discrete and dimensional aspects of emotional experience.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/200824v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Granule cells at the input layer of the cerebellum comprise over half the neurons in the human brain and are thought to be critical for learning. However, little is known about granule neuron signaling at the population scale during behavior. We used calcium imaging in awake zebrafish during optokinetic behavior to record transgenically identified granule neurons throughout a cerebellar population. A significant fraction of the population was responsive at any given time. In contrast to core precerebellar populations, granule neuron responses were relatively heterogeneous, with variation in the degree of rectification and the balance of excitation versus inhibition. Functional correlations were strongest for nearby cells, with weak spatial gradients in the degree of rectification and excitation. These data open a new window upon cerebellar function and suggest granule layer signals represent elementary building blocks underrepresented in core sensorimotor pathways, thereby enabling the construction of novel patterns of activity for learning.</description>

	<description>Memory coding strengthens synaptic efficacy in the hippocampus via a long-term potentiation (LTP)-like mechanism. Given that animals are able to store memories of everyday experiences, hippocampal circuits should be able to avoid saturation of overall synaptic weight to preserve learning capacity. However, the underlying mechanism for this is still poorly understood. Here, we show that adult neurogenesis in rats plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the hippocampal learning capacity for learning. Artificial saturation with hippocampal LTP impaired learning capacity in contextual fear conditioning, which then completely recovered after 14 days, when LTP had decayed to the basal level. Ablation of neurogenesis by X-ray irradiation delayed the recovery of learning capacity, while enhancement of neurogenesis using running wheel sped up the recovery. Thus, one benefit of ongoing adult neurogenesis is the maintenance of hippocampal learning capacity through homeostatic renewing of hippocampal memory circuits. Decreased neurogenesis in aged animals may underlie declines in cognitive function with aging.</description>

	<description>There is longstanding interest in the relationship between motor imagery, action observation, and movement execution. Several models propose that these tasks recruit the same brain regions in a similar manner; however, there is no quantitative synthesis of the literature that compares their respective networks. Here we summarized data from neuroimaging experiments examining Motor Imagery (304 experiments, 4,911 participants), Action Observation (595 experiments, 11,032 participants), and related control tasks involving Movement Execution (143 experiments, 2,315 participants). Motor Imagery recruited a network of premotor-parietal cortical regions, alongside the thalamus, putamen, and cerebellum. Action Observation involved a cortical premotor-parietal and occipital network, with no consistent subcortical contributions. Movement Execution engaged sensorimotor-premotor areas, and the thalamus, putamen, and cerebellum. Comparisons across these networks highlighted key differences in their recruitment of motor cortex, parietal cortex, and subcortical structures. Conjunction across all three tasks identified a consistent premotor-parietal and somatosensory network. These data amend previous models of the relationships between motor imagery, action observation, and movement execution, and provide a quantitative assessment of their respective networks.</description>

Hematopoietic stem cells in mammals are known to reside mostly in the bone marrow, but also transitively passage in small numbers in the blood. Experimental findings have suggested that they exist in a dynamic equilibrium, continuously migrating between these two compartments. Here we construct an individual-based mathematical model of this process, which is parametrised using existing empirical findings from mice. This approach allows us to quantify the amount of migration between the bone marrow niches and the peripheral blood. We use this model to investigate clonal hematopoiesis, which is a significant risk factor for hematologic cancers. We also analyse the engraftment of donor stem cells into non-conditioned and conditioned hosts, quantifying the impact of different treatment scenarios. The simplicity of the model permits a thorough mathematical analysis, providing deeper insights into the dynamics of both the model and of the real-world system. We predict the time taken for mutant clones to expand within a host, as well as chimerism levels that can be expected following transplantation therapy, and the probability that a preconditioned host is reconstituted by donor cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rXyJusEBHNY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We simulate deformable red blood cells in the microcirculation using the immersed boundary method with a cytoskeletal model that incorporates structural details revealed by tomographic images. The elasticity of red blood cells is known to be supplied by both their lipid bilayer membranes, which resist bending and local changes in area, and their cytoskeletons, which resist in-plane shear. The cytoskeleton consists of spectrin tetramers that are tethered to the lipid bilayer by ankyrin and by actin-based junctional complexes. We model the cytoskeleton as a random geometric graph, with nodes corresponding to junctional complexes and with edges corresponding to spectrin tetramers such that the edge lengths are given by the end-to-end distances between nodes. The statistical properties of this graph are based on distributions gathered from three-dimensional tomographic images of the cytoskeleton by a segmentation algorithm. We show that the elastic response of our model cytoskeleton, in which the spectrin polymers are treated as entropic springs, is in good agreement with the experimentally measured shear modulus. By simulating red blood cells in flow with the immersed boundary method, we compare this discrete cytoskeletal model to an existing continuum model and predict the extent to which dynamic spectrin network connectivity can protect against failure in the case of a red cell subjected to an applied strain. The methods presented here could form the basis of disease- and patient-specific computational studies of hereditary diseases affecting the red cell cytoskeleton.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0HEAkCv60RE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Humans and many other species sense visual information with varying spatial resolution across the visual field (foveated vision) and deploy eye movements to actively sample regions of interests in scenes. The advantage of such varying resolution architecture is a reduced computational, hence metabolic cost. But what are the performance costs of such processing strategy relative to a scheme that processes the visual field at high spatial resolution? Here we first focus on visual search and combine object detectors from computer vision with a recent model of peripheral pooling regions found at the V1 layer of the human visual system. We develop a foveated object detector that processes the entire scene with varying resolution, uses retino-specific object detection classifiers to guide eye movements, aligns its fovea with regions of interest in the input image and integrates observations across multiple fixations. We compared the foveated object detector against a non-foveated version of the same object detector which processes the entire image at with homogeneous high spatial resolution. We evaluated the accuracy of the foveated and non-foveated object detectors identifying 20 different objects classes in scenes from a standard computer vision data set (the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset). We show that the foveated object detector can approximate the performance of the object detector with homogeneous high spatial resolution processing while bringing significant computational cost savings. Additionally, we assessed the impact of foveation on the computation of bottom-up saliency. An implementation of a simple foveated bottom-up saliency model with eye movements showed agreement in the selection of top salient regions of scenes with those selected by a non-foveated high resolution saliency model. Together, our results might help explain the evolution of foveated visual systems with eye movements as a solution that preserves perceptual performance in visual search while resulting in computational and metabolic savings to the brain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aI5auQXLGpk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We study the electro-diffusion properties of a domain containing a
cusp-shaped structure in three dimensions when one ionic specie is dominant.
The mathematical problem consists in solving the steady-state
Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equation with an integral constraint for the number
of charges. A non-homogeneous Neumann boundary condition is imposed on the
boundary. We construct an asymptotic approximation for certain singular limits
that agree with numerical simulations. Finally, we analyse the consequences of
non-homogeneous surface charge density. We conclude that the geometry of
cusp-shaped domains influences the voltage profile, specifically inside the
cusp structure. The main results are summarized in the form of new
three-dimensional electrostatic laws for non-electroneutral electrolytes. We
discuss applications to dendritic spines in neuroscience.

	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02387</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02387</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce new techniques to the analysis of neural spatiotemporal dynamics
via applying $\epsilon$-machine reconstruction to electroencephalography (EEG)
microstate sequences. Microstates are short duration quasi-stable states of the
dynamically changing electrical field topographies recorded via an array of
electrodes from the human scalp, and cluster into four canonical classes. The
sequence of microstates observed under particular conditions can be considered
an information source with unknown underlying structure. $\epsilon$-machines
are discrete dynamical system automata with state-dependent probabilities on
different future observations (in this case the next measured EEG microstate).
They artificially reproduce underlying structure in an optimally predictive
manner as generative models exhibiting dynamics emulating the behaviour of the
source. Here we present experiments using both simulations and empirical data
supporting the value of associating these discrete dynamical systems with
mental states (e.g. mind-wandering, focused attention, etc.) and with clinical
populations. The neurodynamics of mental states and clinical populations can
then be further characterized by properties of these dynamical systems,
including: i) statistical complexity (determined by the number of states of the
corresponding $\epsilon$-automaton); ii) entropy rate; iii) characteristic
sequence patterning (syntax, probabilistic grammars); iv) duration, persistence
and stability of dynamical patterns; and v) algebraic measures such as
Krohn-Rhodes complexity or holonomy length of the decompositions of these. The
potential applications include the characterization of mental states in
neurodynamic terms for mental health diagnostics, well-being interventions,
human-machine interface, and others on both subject-specific and
group/population-level.

We use multiscale deep supervision and inputs to train a convolutional network.

segmentation challenge where we obtained dice scores of 0.755, 0.900, 0.782 and
95% Hausdorff distance of 3.63mm, 4.10mm, and 6.81mm for enhanced tumor core,
whole tumor and tumor core respectively.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Mapping hybrid functional-structural connectivity traits in the human connectome. (arXiv:1710.02199v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02199</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02199</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the crucial questions in neuroscience is how a rich functional
repertoire of brain states relates to its underlying structural organization.
How to study the associations between these structural and functional layers is
an open problem that involves novel conceptual ways of tackling this question.
We here propose an extension of the Connectivity Independent Component Analysis
(connICA) framework, to identify joint structural-functional connectivity
traits. Here, we extend connICA to integrate structural and functional
connectomes by merging them into common -hybrid- connectivity patterns that
represent the connectivity fingerprint of a subject. We test this extended
approach on the 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project. The
method is able to extract main independent structural-functional connectivity
patterns from the entire cohort that are sensitive to the realization of
different tasks. The hybrid connICA extracted two main task-sensitive hybrid
traits. The first, encompassing the within and between connections of dorsal
attentional and visual areas, as well as fronto-parietal circuits. The second,
mainly encompassing the connectivity between visual, attentional, DMN and
subcortical networks. Overall, these findings confirms the potential of the
hybrid connICA for the compression of structural/functional connectomes into
integrated patterns from a set of individual brain networks.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Analytic tractography: A closed-form solution for estimating local white matter connectivity with diffusion MRI. (arXiv:1710.02165v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02165</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02165</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;White matter structures composed of myelinated axons in the living human
brain are primarily studied by diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI). These long-range
projections are typically characterized in a two-step process: dMRI is used to
estimate the orientation of axons within each voxel, then these local
orientations are linked together to estimate the spatial extent of putative
white matter bundles. Tractography, the process of tracing bundles across
voxels, either requires computationally expensive (probabilistic) simulations
to model uncertainty in fiber orientation or ignores it completely
(deterministic). Probabilistic simulation necessarily generates a finite number
of trajectories, introducing &quot;simulation error&quot; to trajectory estimates. Here
we introduce a method to analytically (via a closed-form solution) take an
orientation distribution function (ODF) from each voxel and calculate the
probabilities that a trajectory projects from a voxel into each directly
adjacent voxel. We validate our method by demonstrating that probabilistic
simulations converge to our analytically computed probabilities at the voxel
level as the number of simulated seeds increases. We show that our method
accurately calculates the ground-truth transition probabilities from a phantom
dataset. As a demonstration, we incoroporate our analytic method for voxel
transition probabilities into the Voxel Graph framework, creating a
quantitative framework for assessing white matter structure that we call
&quot;analytic tractography&quot;. The long-range connectivity problem is reduced to
finding paths in a graph whose adjacency structure reflects voxel-to-voxel
analytic transition probabilities. We demonstrate this approach performs
comparably to many current probabilistic and deterministic approaches at a
fraction of the computational cost. Open source software software is provided.

	<description>A dramatic maturational process ongoing in adolescence is prefrontal cortex development, including its dopamine innervation. Dopamine axons grow from the striatum to the prefrontal cortex, the only known case of long-distance axon growth during adolescence. This is coordinated by the Netrin-1 guidance cue receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), which in turn controls the intrinsic development of the prefrontal cortex itself. Stimulant drugs in adolescence alter DCC in dopamine neurons and, in turn prefrontal cortex maturation, impacting cognitive abilities.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/200675v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Reconstruction of neural circuits from volume electron microscopy data requires the tracing of complete cells including all their neurites. Automated approaches have been developed to perform the tracing, but without costly human proofreading their error rates are too high to obtain reliable circuit diagrams. We present a method for automated segmentation that, like the majority of previous efforts, employs convolutional neural networks, but contains in addition a recurrent pathway that allows the iterative optimization and extension of the reconstructed shape of individual neural processes. We used this technique, which we call flood-filling networks, to trace neurons in a data set obtained by serial block-face electron microscopy from a male zebra finch brain. Our method achieved a mean error-free neurite path length of 1.1 mm, an order of magnitude better than previously published approaches applied to the same dataset. Only 4 mergers were observed in a neurite test set of 97 mm path length.</description>

	<description>Humans commonly operate within 3D environments such as multi-floor buildings and yet there is a surprising dearth of studies that have examined how these spaces are represented in the brain. Here we had participants learn the locations of paintings within a virtual multi-level gallery building and then used behavioural tests and fMRI repetition suppression analyses to investigate how this 3D multi-compartment space was represented, and whether there was a bias in encoding vertical and horizontal information. We found faster response times for within-room egocentric spatial judgments and behavioural priming effects of visiting the same room, providing evidence for a compartmentalised representation of space. At the neural level, we observed a hierarchical encoding of 3D spatial information, with left anterior hippocampus representing local information within a room, while retrosplenial cortex, parahippocampal cortex and posterior hippocampus represented room information within the wider building. Of note, both our behavioural and neural findings showed that vertical and horizontal location information was similarly encoded, suggesting an isotropic representation of 3D space even in the context of a multi-compartment environment. These findings provide much-needed information about how the human brain supports spatial memory and navigation in buildings with numerous levels and rooms.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Algorithmic complexity of EEG as a prognosis biomarker of neurodegeneration in idiopathic rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD)</title>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/200543v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Rapid eye movement sleep (REM) behavior disorder (RBD) is a serious risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). We describe here the analysis of resting state EEG data collected from idiopathic RBD patients and healthy controls (HC) forming a balanced cohort of 178 subjects in which a subset of RBD patients eventually developed either PD or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In earlier work [1, 2], we implemented support vector machine classifiers using EEG mean spectral features to predict the course of disease with an AUC of 85% in several classification problems, and, later, in [3] an Echo State recurrent neural network that delivered high classification accuracy on balanced datasets. Here we investigate the data in a complementary way and describe the statistics of global algorithmic complexity of these EEG multi-channel time series, which are analyzed as spectrograms (time-frequency plots). We provide an upper bound to algorithmic complexity using Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression (LZW) and entropy rate of the set of stacked spectrograms of 14 channels for each subject. Both LZW and entropy rate highlight strong statistically significant differences between the groups. Results are compared to those using the well-known ratio of fast to slow frequency power associated with slowing of EEG [4, 5], which they are seen to complement by picking up dynamical features of EEG spectral series. Poor prognosis in RBD appears to be associated with decreased temporal variability of the EEG spectrum in beta and gamma frequencies.</description>

	<description>Memory reactivation during sleep is critical for consolidation, but also extremely difficult to measure as it is subtle, distributed and temporally unpredictable. This article reports a novel method for detecting such reactivation in standard sleep recordings. During learning, participants produced a complex sequence of finger presses, with each finger cued by a distinct audio-visual stimulus. Auditory cues were then re-played during subsequent sleep to trigger neural reactivation through a method known as targeted memory reactivation (TMR). Next, we used electroencephalography data from the learning session to train a machine learning classifier, and then applied this classifier to sleep data to determine how successfully each tone had elicited memory reactivation. Above chance classification was significantly higher in slow wave sleep than in stage 2, suggesting differential efficacy of TMR in these two sleep stages. Interestingly, classification success reduced across numerous repetitions of the tone cue, suggesting either a gradually reducing responsiveness to such cues or a plasticity-related change in the neural signature as a result of cueing. We believe this method will be invaluable for future investigations of memory consolidation.</description>

	<description>N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant internal RNA modification that regulates transcript processing and translation. The regulation of brain m6A by stressful stimuli in vivo and its role in the stress response are currently unknown. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the stress-epitranscriptome using m6A-Seq, global and gene-specific m6A measurements. We show that stress exposure and glucocorticoids alter m6A and its regulatory network in a region- and time-specific manner. We demonstrate that depletion of the methyltransferase Mettl3 and the demethylase Fto in adult neurons increases fear memory, and alters the transcriptome response to fear as well as synaptic plasticity. Finally, we report that regulation of m6A is impaired in major depressive disorder patients following glucocorticoid receptor activation. Our findings indicate that brain m6A represents a novel layer of complexity in gene expression regulation after stress and that dysregulation of the m6A-response may contribute to the pathophysiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders.</description>

	<description>Visuospatial neglect is a neuropsychological condition commonly experienced after stroke, whereby a patient is unable to attend to stimuli on their contralesional side. We aimed to investigate whether egocentric and allocentric neglect are functionally dissociable and differ in prevalence, laterality and outcome predictors. A consecutive sample of 366 acute stroke patients completed the Broken Hearts test from the Oxford Cognitive Screen. A subsample of 160 patients was followed up 6 months later. We evaluated the association between egocentric and allocentric neglect, contrasted the prevalence and severity of left-sided versus right-sided neglect, and determined the predictors of persistence versus recovery at follow up. Clinically, we found a double dissociation between ego- and allocentric neglect, with 50% of the neglect patients showing 'only' egocentric neglect and 25% 'only' allocentric neglect. Importantly, patients with only allocentric neglect did not demonstrate any egocentric spatial bias in the locations of the allocentric errors. Left-sided egocentric neglect was more prevalent and more severe than right-sided egocentric neglect, though right-sided neglect was still highly prevalent in the acute stroke sample (35%). Left-sided allocentric neglect was more severe but not more prevalent than right-sided allocentric neglect. Overall recovery of neglect was high: 81% of egocentric and 75% of allocentric neglect patients recovered. Severity of neglect was the only significant behavioural measure for predicting recovery at 6 months.</description>

	<description>Background: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a FDA approved therapy for epilepsy and depression. However, the efficacy of VNS varies, and its mechanism is unclear. Prior studies have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map brain activations with VNS in human brains but yielded inconsistent findings. The source of the inconsistency might be attributed to the complex temporal characteristics of VNS evoked responses that cannot be fully explained by simplified response models. Objective: We used fMRI to characterize the effects of VNS in rat brains without assuming any priori response model. The questions of primary interest were 1) whether and where the VNS evoked responses at the level of networks, and 2) whether and where the VNS altered the patterns of interactions among intrinsic functional networks. Methods: We performed 7 Tesla blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI on Sprague Dawley rats receiving simultaneous electrical stimulation at the left cervical vagus nerve. Using independent component analysis, we mapped the patterns of network activations and interactions in contrast to those in the resting state. Results: Left cervical VNS evoked widespread responses over ~76% of the brain volume with the most notable activations in the brainstem and hypothalamus. The VNS evoked complex and distinctive temporal responses at different brain networks and altered the patterns of interactions among networks, especially for the limbic system. Conclusion: This paper reports a method for exploring the complex response of VNS in a data-driven manner. The results suggest that VNS evokes wide spread BOLD responses and alters large-scale functional connectivity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: OPRM1 A118G and serum {beta}-endorphin interact with sex and digit ratio (2D:4D) to influence risk and course of alcohol dependence</title>

	<description>Activation of mesolimbic mu-opioid receptor by its endogenous ligand, {beta}-endorphin, mediates part of the rewarding effects of alcohol. There is controversial evidence surrounding the relationship between the functional mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) A118G single nucleotide polymorphism and alcohol dependence risk. Some preclinical evidence suggests that sex and sex hormone-dependent prenatal brain organization may interact with the opioid system to influence alcohol drinking behavior. We genotyped 200 alcohol-dependent patients and 240 healthy individuals for the A118G variant and measured serum {beta}-endorphin level at recruitment and during acute withdrawal. We then evaluated the association between these factors and alcohol dependence risk and outcome in the context of both sex and second-to-fourth digit length ratio (2D:4D) - a biomarker of prenatal sex hormone load. For the first time, the AA genotype was found to be associated with elevated alcohol-related hospital readmission risk, more readmissions, and fewer days until first readmission in male but not female patients. Upon accounting for 2D:4D, the G-allele predicted alcohol dependence and more readmissions (1 vs [≥]2) in males, suggesting prenatal sex hormones interact with OPRM1 to influence addiction pathology. Withdrawal {beta}-endorphin level also correlated negatively with withdrawal severity in females but not in males, indicating {beta}-endorphin might protect against withdrawal-induced stress in a sex-specific manner. Organizational effects of sex hormones may prime individuals for alcohol dependence by inducing permanent changes to the endogenous opioid system.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Phencyclidine discoordinates hippocampal network activity but not place fields</title>

	<description>We used the psychotomimetic phencyclidine (PCP) to investigate the relationships between cognitive behavior, coordinated neural network function and information processing within the hippocampus place cell system. We report in rats that PCP (5mg/kg i.p.) impairs a well-learned hippocampus-dependent place avoidance behavior in rats that requires cognitive control, even when PCP is injected directly into dorsal hippocampus. PCP increases 60-100 Hz medium gamma oscillations in hippocampus CA1 and these increases correlate with the cognitive impairment caused by systemic PCP administration. PCP discoordinates theta-modulated medium and slow gamma oscillations in CA1 local field potentials (LFP) such that medium gamma oscillations become more theta-organized than slow gamma oscillations. CA1 place cell firing fields are preserved under PCP but the drug discoordinates the sub-second temporal organization of discharge amongst place cells. This discoordination causes place cell ensemble representations of a familiar space to cease resembling pre-PCP representations, despite preserved place fields. These findings point to the cognitive impairments caused by PCP arising from neural discoordination. PCP disrupts the timing of discharge with respect to the sub-second timescales of theta and gamma oscillations in the LFP. Because these oscillations arise from local inhibitory synaptic activity, these findings point to excitation-inhibition discoordination as the root of PCP-induced cognitive impairment.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Working Memory Training Integrates Visual Cortex into Beta-Band Networks in Congenitally Blind Individuals</title>

	<description>Congenitally blind individuals activate the visual cortex during non-visual tasks. Such crossmodal reorganization is likely associated with changes in large-scale functional connectivity, the spectral characteristics of which can be assessed by analysis of neural oscillations. To test visual cortical integration into working memory networks, we recorded magnetoencephalographic data from congenitally blind and sighted individuals during resting state as well as during a voice-based working memory task prior to and following working memory training with voices, or tactile stimuli or a training-control task. Auditory training strengthened beta-band (17.5-22.5 Hz) connectivity (imaginary coherency) in the blind and theta-band (2.5-5 Hz) connectivity in the sighted during the task, suggesting different neural coupling mechanisms. In the sighted, theta-band connectivity increased between brain areas involved in auditory working memory (inferior frontal, superior temporal, insular cortex). In the blind, beta-band networks largely emerged during the training, and connectivity increased between brain areas involved in auditory working memory and the visual cortex. The prominent involvement of the right fusiform face area in this beta-band network suggests a task-specific integration of visual cortex. Our findings highlight large-scale interactions as a key mechanism of functional reorganization following congenital blindness, and provide new insights into the spectral characteristics of the mechanism.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Experience-dependent modulation of behavioral features in sensory navigation of nematodes and bats revealed by machine learning</title>

	<description>Animal behavior is the integrated output of multiple brain functions. However, understanding how multiple brain functions affect behavior has been difficult. In order to decipher dynamic brain functions from time-series of behavioral data, we developed a machine learning strategy that extracts distinguishing behavioral features of sensory navigation. We first investigated experience-dependent enhancement of odor avoidance behavior of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We segmented worms' trajectories during olfactory navigation into two behavioral states, analyzed 92 features of the states, and automatically extracted 9 distinguishing features modulated by prior odor experience using a statistical index, the gain ratio. The extracted features included ones previously unidentified, one of which indicated that the prior odor experience lowers worms' behavioral responses to a small increase in odor concentration, causing enhanced odor avoidance. Consistently, calcium imaging analysis under gradually increased odor stimulation revealed that the response of ASH nociceptive neurons to a small odor increase was significantly reduced after prior odor experience. In addition, based on extracted features, multiple mutant strains were categorized into several groups that are related to physiological functions of the mutated genes, suggesting a possible estimation of unknown gene function by behavioral features. Furthermore, we also extracted behavioral features modulated by experience in acoustic navigation of bats. Thus, our results demonstrate that, regardless of animal species, sensory modality, and spatio-temporal scale, behavioral features during navigation can be extracted by machine learning analysis, which may lead to the understanding of information processing in the brain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Speech tracking in auditory and motor regions reflects distinct linguistic features</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/195941v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>During online speech processing, our brain tracks the acoustic fluctuations in speech at different time-scales. Previous research has focussed on generic time-scales (for example, delta or theta bands) that are assumed to map onto linguistic features such as prosody or syllables. However, given the high inter-subject variability in speaking patterns, such a generic association between the time-scales of brain activity and speech properties can be ambiguous. Here, we analyse speech tracking in source-localised magnetoencephalographic data by directly focusing on time-scales extracted from statistical regularities in the speech material. This revealed widespread tracking at the time-scales of phrases (0.6 - 1.3 Hz), words (1.8 - 3 Hz), syllables (2.8 - 4.8 Hz), and phonemes (8 - 12.4 Hz). Importantly, when examining the relevance for single-trial comprehension, we found stronger tracking for correctly comprehended trials in the left premotor cortex at the phrasal scale, and in left middle temporal cortex at the word scale. Control analyses using generic bands confirmed that these effects were specific to the stimulus-tailored speech regularities. Furthermore, we found that the phase at the phrasal time-scale coupled to beta-power in motor areas. This cross-frequency coupling likely mediates the comprehension effect in the motor system, and implies top-down temporal prediction in speech perception. Together, our results reveal specific functional and perceptually relevant roles of distinct entrainment processes along the auditory-motor pathway. These processes act concurrently at time-scales within the traditional delta band and highlight the role of neural tracking mechanisms that reflect the temporal characteristics of speech.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Propagation of BOLD activity reveals directed interactions across human visual cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/172452v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/172452v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>It has recently been shown that large-scale propagation of blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity is constrained by anatomical connections and reflects transitions between behavioral states. It remains to be seen, however, if the propagation of BOLD activity can also relate to the brain anatomical structure at a more local scale. Here, we hypothesized that BOLD propagation reflect structured neural activity across early visual field maps. To explore this hypothesis, we characterize the propagation of BOLD activity across V1, V2 and V3 using a modeling approach that aims to disentangle the contributions of local activity and directed interactions in shaping BOLD propagation. It does so by estimating the effective connectivity (EC) and the excitability of a noise-diffusion network to reproduce the spatiotemporal covariance structure of the data. We apply our approach to 7T fMRI recordings acquired during resting state (RS) and visual field mapping (VFM). Our results reveal different EC interactions and changes in cortical excitability in RS and VFM, and point to a reconfiguration of feedforward and feedback interactions across the visual system. We conclude that the propagation of BOLD activity has functional relevance, as it reveals directed interactions and changes in cortical excitability in a state-dependent manner.</description>

Calcium responses have been observed as spikes of the whole-cell calcium concentration in numerous cell types and are essential for translating extracellular stimuli into cellular responses. While there are several suggestions for how this encoding is achieved, we still lack a comprehensive theory. To achieve this goal it is necessary to reliably predict the temporal evolution of calcium spike sequences for a given stimulus. Here, we propose a modelling framework that allows us to quantitatively describe the timing of calcium spikes. Using a Bayesian approach, we show that Gaussian processes model calcium spike rates with high fidelity and perform better than standard tools such as peri-stimulus time histograms and kernel smoothing. We employ our modelling concept to analyse calcium spike sequences from dynamically-stimulated HEK293T cells. Under these conditions, different cells often experience diverse stimuli time courses, which is a situation likely to occur &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. This single cell variability and the concomitant small number of calcium spikes per cell pose a significant modelling challenge, but we demonstrate that Gaussian processes can successfully describe calcium spike rates in these circumstances. Our results therefore pave the way towards a statistical description of heterogeneous calcium oscillations in a dynamic environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0pkioumH9Mg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Vanillyl alcohol oxidase (VAO) is a homooctameric flavoenzyme belonging to the VAO/PCMH family. Each VAO subunit consists of two domains, the FAD-binding and the cap domain. VAO catalyses, among other reactions, the two-step conversion of &lt;i&gt;p-&lt;/i&gt;creosol (2-methoxy-4-methylphenol) to vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde). To elucidate how different ligands enter and exit the secluded active site, Monte Carlo based simulations have been performed. One entry/exit path via the subunit interface and two additional exit paths have been identified for phenolic ligands, all leading to the &lt;i&gt;si&lt;/i&gt; side of FAD. We argue that the entry/exit path is the most probable route for these ligands. A fourth path leading to the &lt;i&gt;re&lt;/i&gt; side of FAD has been found for the co-ligands dioxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Based on binding energies and on the behaviour of ligands in these four paths, we propose a sequence of events for ligand and co-ligand migration during catalysis. We have also identified two residues, His466 and Tyr503, which could act as concierges of the active site for phenolic ligands, as well as two other residues, Tyr51 and Tyr408, which could act as a gateway to the &lt;i&gt;re&lt;/i&gt; side of FAD for dioxygen. Most of the residues in the four paths are also present in VAO’s closest relatives, eugenol oxidase and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cresol methylhydroxylase. Key path residues show movements in our simulations that correspond well to conformations observed in crystal structures of these enzymes. Preservation of other path residues can be linked to the electron acceptor specificity and oligomerisation state of the three enzymes. This study is the first comprehensive overview of ligand and co-ligand migration in a member of the VAO/PCMH family, and provides a proof of concept for the use of an unbiased method to sample this process.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Muxexz4UbOk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Oscillations are observed at various frequency bands in continuous-valued neural recordings like the electroencephalogram (EEG) and local field potential (LFP) in bulk brain matter, and analysis of spike-field coherence reveals that spiking of single neurons often occurs at certain phases of the global oscillation. Oscillatory modulation has been examined in relation to continuous-valued oscillatory signals, and independently from the spike train alone, but behavior or stimulus triggered firing-rate modulation, spiking sparseness, presence of slow modulation not locked to stimuli and irregular oscillations with large variability in oscillatory periods, present challenges to searching for temporal structures present in the spike train. In order to study oscillatory modulation in real data collected under a variety of experimental conditions, we describe a flexible point-process framework we call the Latent Oscillatory Spike Train (LOST) model to decompose the instantaneous firing rate in biologically and behaviorally relevant factors: spiking refractoriness, event-locked firing rate non-stationarity, and trial-to-trial variability accounted for by baseline offset and a stochastic oscillatory modulation. We also extend the LOST model to accommodate changes in the modulatory structure over the duration of the experiment, and thereby discover trial-to-trial variability in the spike-field coherence of a rat primary motor cortical neuron to the LFP theta rhythm. Because LOST incorporates a latent stochastic auto-regressive term, LOST is able to detect oscillations when the firing rate is low, the modulation is weak, and when the modulating oscillation has a broad spectral peak.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VhFO6g8iZto&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Anatomical Pattern Analysis for decoding visual stimuli in human brains. (arXiv:1710.02113v1 [stat.ML])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02113</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02113</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: A universal unanswered question in neuroscience and machine
learning is whether computers can decode the patterns of the human brain.
Multi-Voxels Pattern Analysis (MVPA) is a critical tool for addressing this
question. However, there are two challenges in the previous MVPA methods, which
include decreasing sparsity and noise in the extracted features and increasing
the performance of prediction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: In overcoming mentioned challenges, this paper proposes Anatomical
Pattern Analysis (APA) for decoding visual stimuli in the human brain. This
framework develops a novel anatomical feature extraction method and a new
imbalance AdaBoost algorithm for binary classification. Further, it utilizes an
Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) method for multiclass prediction. APA can
automatically detect active regions for each category of the visual stimuli.
Moreover, it enables us to combine homogeneous datasets for applying advanced
classification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results and Conclusions: Experimental studies on 4 visual categories (words,
consonants, objects and scrambled photos) demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Acetylcholine-modulated plasticity in reward-driven navigation: a computational study. (arXiv:1710.01951v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01951</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01951</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation plays a fundamental role in the acquisition of new
behaviours. Our experimental findings show that, whereas acetylcholine biases
hippocampal synaptic plasticity towards depression, the subsequent application
of dopamine can retroactively convert depression into potentiation. We
previously demonstrated that incorporating this sequentially neuromodulated
Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) rule in a network model of navigation
yields effective learning of changing reward locations. Here, we further
characterize the effects of cholinergic depression on behaviour. We find that
acetylcholine, by allowing learning from negative outcomes, influences
exploration in a non-trivial manner that highly depends on the specifics of the
model, the environment and the task. Interestingly, sequentially neuromodulated
STDP also yields flexible learning, surpassing the performance of other
reward-modulated plasticity rules.

	<description>The hippocampus community, and the wider groups of neuroscientists studying learning and memory, were shocked to learn of the sudden and unexpected death of Dr Howard Eichenbaum on 21 July 2017. An immensely respected and well-liked figure, Howard made major contributions to our understanding of the neurobiology of memory at a systems level. In addition to his scientific contributions, he was also a diligent member and steward of the neuroscience community as Editor of the journal Hippocampus and in many other ways.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A unifying Bayesian account of contextual effects in value-based choice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005769</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/LFieRi1R8Vw/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Francesco Rigoli, Christoph Mathys, Karl J. Friston, Raymond J. Dolan&lt;/p&gt;

Empirical evidence suggests the incentive value of an option is affected by other options available during choice and by options presented in the past. These contextual effects are hard to reconcile with classical theories and have inspired accounts where contextual influences play a crucial role. However, each account only addresses one or the other of the empirical findings and a unifying perspective has been elusive. Here, we offer a unifying theory of context effects on incentive value attribution and choice based on normative Bayesian principles. This formulation assumes that incentive value corresponds to a precision-weighted prediction error, where predictions are based upon expectations about reward. We show that this scheme explains a wide range of contextual effects, such as those elicited by other options available during choice (or within-choice context effects). These include both conditions in which choice requires an integration of multiple attributes and conditions where a multi-attribute integration is not necessary. Moreover, the same scheme explains context effects elicited by options presented in the past or between-choice context effects. Our formulation encompasses a wide range of contextual influences (comprising both within- and between-choice effects) by calling on Bayesian principles, without invoking &lt;i&gt;ad-hoc&lt;/i&gt; assumptions. This helps clarify the contextual nature of incentive value and choice behaviour and may offer insights into psychopathologies characterized by dysfunctional decision-making, such as addiction and pathological gambling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LFieRi1R8Vw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Differential temperature sensitivity of synaptic and firing processes in a neural mass model of epileptic discharges explains heterogeneous response of experimental epilepsy to focal brain cooling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005736</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jaymar Soriano, Takatomi Kubo, Takao Inoue, Hiroyuki Kida, Toshitaka Yamakawa, Michiyasu Suzuki, Kazushi Ikeda&lt;/p&gt;

Experiments with drug-induced epilepsy in rat brains and epileptic human brain region reveal that focal cooling can suppress epileptic discharges without affecting the brain’s normal neurological function. Findings suggest a viable treatment for intractable epilepsy cases via an implantable cooling device. However, precise mechanisms by which cooling suppresses epileptic discharges are still not clearly understood. Cooling experiments &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; presented evidence of reduction in neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals and loss of dendritic spines at post-synaptic terminals offering a possible synaptic mechanism. We show that termination of epileptic discharges is possible by introducing a homogeneous temperature factor in a neural mass model which attenuates the post-synaptic impulse responses of the neuronal populations. This result however may be expected since such attenuation leads to reduced post-synaptic potential and when the effect on inhibitory interneurons is less than on excitatory interneurons, frequency of firing of pyramidal cells is consequently reduced. While this is observed in cooling experiments &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, experiments &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; exhibit persistent discharges during cooling but suppressed in magnitude. This leads us to conjecture that reduction in the frequency of discharges may be compensated through intrinsic excitability mechanisms. Such compensatory mechanism is modelled using a reciprocal temperature factor in the firing response function in the neural mass model. We demonstrate that the complete model can reproduce attenuation of both magnitude and frequency of epileptic discharges during cooling. The compensatory mechanism suggests that cooling lowers the average and the variance of the distribution of threshold potential of firing across the population. Bifurcation study with respect to the temperature parameters of the model reveals how heterogeneous response of epileptic discharges to cooling (termination or suppression only) is exhibited. Possibility of differential temperature effects on post-synaptic potential generation of different populations is also explored.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZK3SX5hF730&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Guerfali, Colleen Saunders, Ahmed Mansour Alzohairy, Samson P. Salifu, Rehab Ahmed, Ruben Cloete, Jonathan Kayondo, Deogratius Ssemwanga, Nicola Mulder, H3ABioNet Consortium's Education Training and Working Group as members of the H3Africa Consortium &lt;/p&gt;

Africa is not unique in its need for basic bioinformatics training for individuals from a diverse range of academic backgrounds. However, particular logistical challenges in Africa, most notably access to bioinformatics expertise and internet stability, must be addressed in order to meet this need on the continent. H3ABioNet (www.h3abionet.org), the Pan African Bioinformatics Network for H3Africa, has therefore developed an innovative, free-of-charge “Introduction to Bioinformatics” course, taking these challenges into account as part of its educational efforts to provide on-site training and develop local expertise inside its network. A multiple-delivery–mode learning model was selected for this 3-month course in order to increase access to (mostly) African, expert bioinformatics trainers. The content of the course was developed to include a range of fundamental bioinformatics topics at the introductory level. For the first iteration of the course (2016), classrooms with a total of 364 enrolled participants were hosted at 20 institutions across 10 African countries. To ensure that classroom success did not depend on stable internet, trainers pre-recorded their lectures, and classrooms downloaded and watched these locally during biweekly contact sessions. The trainers were available via video conferencing to take questions during contact sessions, as well as via online “question and discussion” forums outside of contact session time. This learning model, developed for a resource-limited setting, could easily be adapted to other settings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WjESFGyD0a8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Serum tau and neurological outcome in cardiac arrest</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25067</guid>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25067</link>
	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To test serum tau as a predictor of neurological outcome after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We measured the neuronal protein tau in serum at 24, 48, and 72 h after cardiac arrest in 689 patients in the prospective international Target Temperature Management trial. The main outcome was poor neurological outcome, defined as Cerebral Performance Category 3-5 at 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Increased tau was associated with poor outcome at 6 months after cardiac arrest (median 38.5 [IQR 5.7-245] ng/L in poor versus 1.5 [0.7-2.4] ng/L in good outcome, for tau at 72 h, p&amp;lt;0.0001). Tau improved prediction of poor outcome compared to using clinical information (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Tau cut-offs had low false positive rates (FPR) for good outcome while retaining high sensitivity for poor outcome. For example, tau at 72 h had FPR 2% (95% CI 1-4%) with sensitivity 66% (95% CI 61-70%). Tau had higher accuracy than serum NSE (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.91 for tau versus 0.86 for NSE at 72 hours, p=0.00024). During follow-up (up to 956 days), tau was significantly associated with overall survival. The accuracy to predict outcome by serum tau was equally high for patients randomized to 33°C and 36°C targeted temperature after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Serum tau is a promising novel biomarker for prediction of neurological outcome in patients with cardiac arrest. It may be significantly better than serum NSE, which is recommended in guidelines and currently used in clinical practice in several countries to predict outcome after cardiac arrest.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pooled analysis of the HLA-DRB1 by smoking interaction in Parkinson's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25065</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Inflammatory response plays an important role in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have reported an association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-&lt;em&gt;DRB1&lt;/em&gt; and the risk of PD. There has also been growing interest in investigating whether inflammation-related genes interact with environmental factors such as smoking to influence PD risk. We performed a pooled analysis of the interaction between &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1&lt;/em&gt; and smoking in PD in three population-based case-control studies from Denmark and France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We included 2,056 cases and 2,723 controls from three PD studies (Denmark, France) that obtained information on smoking through interviews. Genotyping of the rs660895 polymorphism in the &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1&lt;/em&gt; region was based on saliva or blood DNA samples. To assess interactions, we used logistic regression with product terms between rs660895 and smoking. We performed random-effects meta-analysis of marginal associations and interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Both carrying rs660895-G (AG vs. AA: OR= 0.81; GG vs. AA: OR= 0.56; p-trend=0.003) and ever smoking (OR=0.56, p&amp;lt;0.001) were inversely associated with PD. A multiplicative interaction was observed between rs660895 and smoking using codominant, additive (interaction parameter=1.37, p=0.005), and dominant (interaction parameter=1.54, p=0.001) genetic models without any heterogeneity (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.0%): the inverse association of rs660895-(AG+GG) with PD seen in never smokers (OR=0.64, p&amp;lt;0.001) disappeared among ever smokers (OR=1.00, p=0.99). Similar interactions were observed when we investigated light and heavy smokers separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our study provides the first evidence that smoking modifies the previously reported inverse association of rs660895-G with PD, and suggests that smoking and &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1&lt;/em&gt; are involved in common pathways, possibly related to neuroinflammation.

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir (formerly &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-AV1451 or &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-T807) binds to neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but tissue studies assessing binding to tau aggregates in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) have yielded mixed results. We compared &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir uptake in patients meeting clinical research criteria for PSP (N=33) to normal controls (N=46) and patients meeting criteria for Parkinson's disease (PD, N=26).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Participants underwent MRI and positron emission tomography for amyloid-β (&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-PiB or &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-florbetapir) and tau (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir). &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir Standardized Uptake Value Ratios were calculated (t=80-100 min, cerebellum gray matter reference). Voxelwise and region-of-interest group comparisons were performed in template space, with Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analyses to assess single-subject discrimination. Qualitative comparisons with postmortem tau are reported in one patient who died nine months after &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Clinical PSP patients showed bilaterally elevated &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir uptake in globus pallidus, putamen, subthalamic nucleus, midbrain and dentate nucleus relative to controls and PD patients (voxelwise p&amp;lt;0.05 family-wise-error-corrected). Globus pallidus binding best distinguished PSP patients from controls and PD (Area Under the Curve (AUC)=0.872 vs. controls, AUC=0.893 vs. PD). PSP clinical severity did not correlate with &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir in any region. A patient with clinical PSP and pathological diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration had severe tau-pathology in PSP-related brain structures with good correspondence between &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-flortaucipir and postmortem tau neuropathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>Inhibitory interneurons comprise a diverse subpopulation of cells that are critical to circuit function. How distinct inhibitory microcircuits control long-range projections remains poorly understood. A recent study by Lu and colleagues uncovered a unidirectional microcircuit of prefrontal chandelier cells that preferentially innervate and suppress long-range amygdala-projecting pyramidal cells.</description>

	<description>Self representation is fundamental to mental functions. While the self has mostly been studied in traditional psychophilosophical terms (‘self as subject’), recent laboratory work suggests that the self can be measured quantitatively by assessing biases towards self-associated stimuli (‘self as object’). Here, we summarize new quantitative paradigms for assessing the self, drawn from psychology, neuroeconomics, embodied cognition, and social neuroscience. We then propose a neural model of the self as an emerging property of interactions between a core ‘self network’ (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex; mPFC), a cognitive control network [e.g., dorsolateral (dl)PFC], and a salience network (e.g., insula).</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Architecture of Selective Stopping Strategies: Distinct Brain Activity Patterns Are Associated with Attentional Capture But Not with Outright Stopping</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9785?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9785?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In stimulus-selective stop-signal tasks, the salient stop signal needs attentional processing before genuine response inhibition is completed. Differential prefrontal involvement in attentional capture and response inhibition has been linked to the right inferior frontal junction (IFJ) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), respectively. Recently, it has been suggested that stimulus-selective stopping may be accomplished by the following different strategies: individuals may selectively inhibit their response only upon detecting a stop signal (independent discriminate then stop strategy) or unselectively whenever detecting a stop or attentional capture signal (stop then discriminate strategy). Alternatively, the discrimination process of the critical signal (stop vs attentional capture signal) may interact with the go process (dependent discriminate then stop strategy). Those different strategies might differentially involve attention- and stopping-related processes that might be implemented by divergent neural networks. This should lead to divergent activation patterns and, if disregarded, interfere with analyses in neuroimaging studies. To clarify this crucial issue, we studied 87 human participants of both sexes during a stimulus-selective stop-signal task and performed strategy-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses. We found that, regardless of the strategy applied, outright stopping displayed indistinguishable brain activation patterns. However, during attentional capture different strategies resulted in divergent neural activation patterns with variable activation of right IFJ and bilateral VLPFC. In conclusion, the neural network involved in outright stopping is ubiquitous and independent of strategy, while different strategies impact on attention-related processes and underlying neural network usage. Strategic differences should therefore be taken into account particularly when studying attention-related processes in stimulus-selective stopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dissociating inhibition from attention has been a major challenge for the cognitive neuroscience of executive functions. Selective stopping tasks have been instrumental in addressing this question. However, recent theoretical, cognitive and behavioral research suggests that different strategies are applied in successful execution of the task. The underlying strategy-dependent neural networks might differ substantially. Here, we show evidence that, regardless of the strategy used, the neural network involved in outright stopping is ubiquitous. However, significant differences can only be found in the attention-related processes underlying those different strategies. Thus, when studying attentional processing of salient stop signals, strategic differences should be considered. In contrast, the neural networks implementing outright stopping seem less or not at all affected by strategic differences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reticulospinal Contributions to Gross Hand Function after Human Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9778?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple descending motor pathways likely contribute to the recovery of hand motor function following spinal cord injury (SCI). Reticulospinal neurons project to spinal motor neurons controlling hand muscles and extensively sprout into gray matter structures after SCI; therefore, it has been proposed that the reticulospinal tract is one of the descending motor pathways involved in recovery of hand function after injury. To test this hypothesis, we examined the StartReact response, an involuntary release of a planned movement via a startling stimulus that engages the reticulospinal tract, by measuring reaction times from electromyographic activity in an intrinsic finger muscle during three motor tasks requiring different degrees of hand dexterity: index finger abduction, a precision grip, and a power grip. Males and females with and without incomplete chronic cervical SCI were tested. We found that although SCI participants voluntarily responded to all tasks, reaction times were shorter during a startle cue while performing a power grip but not index finger abduction or precision grip. Control subjects had similarly shorter reaction times during a startle cue in all motor tasks. These results provide the first evidence for a contribution of the reticulospinal tract to hand control in humans with SCI during gross finger manipulations and suggest that this contribution is less pronounced during fine dexterous finger movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It has been long proposed that brainstem pathways contribute to the recovery of hand function in humans with spinal cord injury (SCI). Here, we show that individuals with anatomically incomplete chronic cervical SCI responded to a startle stimulus, a test that engages the reticulospinal tract, while performing a power grip but not during index finger abduction or precision grip. Control subjects responded to a startle stimulus similarly across tasks. These observations suggest that reticulospinal outputs after SCI contribute to hand motor tasks involving gross finger movements. Interestingly, this contribution is less pronounced during fine dexterous finger movements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Content-Specific Codes of Parametric Vibrotactile Working Memory in Humans</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9771?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;To understand how the brain handles mentally represented information flexibly in the absence of sensory stimulation, working memory (WM) studies have been essential. A seminal finding in monkey research is that neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) retain stimulus-specific information when vibrotactile frequencies were memorized. A direct mapping between monkey studies and human research is still controversial. Although oscillatory signatures, in terms of frequency-dependent parametric beta-band modulation, have been observed recently in human EEG studies, the content specificity of these representations in terms of multivariate pattern analysis has not yet been shown. Here, we used fMRI in combination with multivariate classification techniques to determine which brain regions retain information during WM. In a retro-cue delayed-match-to-sample task, human subjects memorized the frequency of vibrotactile stimulation over a 12 s delay phase. Using an assumption-free whole-brain searchlight approach, we tested with support vector regression which brain regions exhibited multivariate parametric WM codes of the maintained frequencies during the WM delay. Interestingly, our analysis revealed an overlap with regions previously identified in monkeys composed of bilateral premotor cortices, supplementary motor area, and the right inferior frontal gyrus as part of the PFC. Therefore, our results establish a link between the WM codes found in monkeys and those in humans and emphasize the importance of the PFC for information maintenance during WM also in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Working memory (WM) research in monkeys has identified a network of regions, including prefrontal regions, to code stimulus-specific information when vibrotactile frequencies are memorized. Here, we performed an fMRI study during which human subjects had to memorize vibratory frequencies in parallel to previous monkey research. Using an assumption-free, whole-brain searchlight decoding approach, we identified for the first time regions in the human brain that exhibit multivariate patterns of activity to code the vibratory frequency parametrically during WM. Our results parallel previous monkey findings and show that the supplementary motor area, premotor, and the right prefrontal cortex are involved in vibrotactile WM coding in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nigral Glutamatergic Neurons Control the Speed of Locomotion</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) plays a crucial role in locomotor control. In vertebrates, stimulation of the MLR at increasing intensities elicits locomotion of growing speed. This effect has been presumed to result from higher brain inputs activating the MLR like a dimmer switch. Here, we show in lampreys (&lt;i&gt;Petromyzon marinus&lt;/i&gt;) of either sex that incremental stimulation of a region homologous to the mammalian substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) evokes increasing activation of MLR cells with a graded increase in the frequency of locomotor movements. Neurons co-storing glutamate and dopamine were found to project from the primal SNc to the MLR. Blockade of glutamatergic transmission largely diminished MLR cell responses and locomotion. Local blockade of D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the MLR decreased locomotor frequency, but did not disrupt the SNc-evoked graded control of locomotion. Our findings revealed the presence of a glutamatergic input to the MLR originating from the primal SNc that evokes graded locomotor movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) plays a crucial role in the control of locomotion. It projects downward to reticulospinal neurons that in turn activate the spinal locomotor networks. Increasing the intensity of MLR stimulation produces a growing activation of reticulospinal cells and a progressive increase in the speed of locomotor movements. Since the discovery of the MLR some 50 years ago, it has been presumed that higher brain regions activate the MLR in a graded fashion, but this has not been confirmed yet. Here, using a combination of techniques from cell to behavior, we provide evidence of a new glutamatergic pathway activating the MLR in a graded fashion, and consequently evoking a progressive increase in locomotor output.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Increased GSNOR Expression during Aging Impairs Cognitive Function and Decreases S-Nitrosation of CaMKII{alpha}</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9741?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;As the population ages, an increasing number of people suffer from age-related cognitive impairment. However, the mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Here, we found that S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), the key enzyme that metabolizes intracellular nitric oxide (NO) and regulates S-nitrosation, was significantly increased in the hippocampus of both aging humans and mice. Transgenic mice overexpressing GSNOR exclusively in neurons showed cognitive impairment in behavioral tests, including the Morris water maze, fear conditioning, and the Y-maze test. We also found that &lt;i&gt;GSNOR&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice have LTP defects and lower dendrite spine density, whereas &lt;i&gt;GSNOR&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice rescued the age-related cognitive impairment. Analysis of S-nitrosation showed significantly decreased hippocampal CaMKIIα S-nitrosation in naturally aged mice and &lt;i&gt;GSNOR&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice. Consistent with the change in CaMKIIα S-nitrosation, the accumulation of CaMKIIα in the hippocampal synaptosomal fraction, as well as its downstream signaling targets p(S831)-GLUR1, was also significantly decreased. All these effects could be rescued in the &lt;i&gt;GSNOR&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice. We further verified that the S-nitrosation of CaMKIIα was responsible for the CaMKIIα synaptosomal accumulation by mutating CaMKIIα S-nitrosated sites (C280/C289). Upregulation of the NO signaling pathway rescued the cognitive impairment in &lt;i&gt;GSNOR&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mice. In summary, our research demonstrates that GSNOR impairs cognitive function in aging and it could serve as a new potential target for the treatment of age-related cognitive impairment. In contrast to the free radical theory of aging, NO signaling deficiency may be the main mediator of age-related cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study indicated that S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), a key protein S-nitrosation metabolic enzyme, is a new potential target in age-related cognitive impairment; and in contrast to the free radical theory of aging, NO signaling deficiency may be the main cause of this process. In addition, increased GSNOR expression during aging decreases S-nitrosation of CaMKIIα and reduces CaMKIIα synaptosomal accumulation. To our knowledge, it is for the first time to show the cellular function regulation of CaMKIIα by GSNOR-dependent S-nitrosation as a new post-translational modification after its phosphorylation was explored. These findings elucidate a novel mechanism of age-related cognitive impairment and may provide a new potential target and strategy for slowing down this process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to track a moving target with the eye is substantially improved when the target is self-moved compared with when it is moved by an external agent. To account for this observation, it has been postulated that the oculomotor system has access to hand efference copy, thereby allowing to predict the motion of the visual target. Along this scheme, we tested the effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the hand area of the primary motor cortex (M1) when human participants (50% females) are asked to track with their eyes a visual target whose horizontal motion is driven by their grip force. We reasoned that, if the output of M1 is used by the oculomotor system to keep track of the target, on top of inducing short latency disturbance of grip force, single-pulse TMS should also quickly disrupt ongoing eye motion. For comparison purposes, the effect of TMS over M1 was monitored when subjects tracked an externally moved target (while keeping their hand at rest or not). In both cases, results showed no alterations in smooth pursuit, meaning that its velocity was unaffected within the 25–125 ms epoch that followed TMS. Overall, our results imply that the output of M1 has limited contribution in driving the eye motion during our eye-hand coordination task. This study suggests that, if hand motor signals are accessed by the oculomotor system, this is upstream of M1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ability to coordinate eye and hand actions is central in everyday activity. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this coordination remain to be clarified. A leading hypothesis is that the oculomotor system has access to hand motor signals. Here we explored this possibility by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the hand area of the primary motor cortex (M1) when humans tracked with the eyes a visual target that was moved by the hand. As expected, ongoing hand action was perturbed 25–30 ms after TMS, but our results fail to show any disruption of eye motion, smooth pursuit velocity being unaffected. This work suggests that, if hand motor signals are accessed by the oculomotor system, this is upstream of M1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reward-Related Ventral Striatum Activity Buffers against the Experience of Depressive Symptoms Associated with Sleep Disturbances</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9724?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep disturbances represent one risk factor for depression. Reward-related brain function, particularly the activity of the ventral striatum (VS), has been identified as a potential buffer against stress-related depression. We were therefore interested in testing whether reward-related VS activity would moderate the effect of sleep disturbances on depression in a large cohort of young adults. Data were available from 1129 university students (mean age 19.71 ± 1.25 years; 637 women) who completed a reward-related functional MRI task to assay VS activity and provided self-reports of sleep using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and symptoms of depression using a summation of the General Distress/Depression and Anhedonic Depression subscales of the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire-short form. Analyses revealed that as VS activity increased the association between sleep disturbances and depressive symptoms decreased. The interaction between sleep disturbances and VS activity was robust to the inclusion of sex, age, race/ethnicity, past or present clinical disorder, early and recent life stress, and anxiety symptoms, as well as the interactions between VS activity and early or recent life stress as covariates. We provide initial evidence that high reward-related VS activity may buffer against depressive symptoms associated with poor sleep. Our analyses help advance an emerging literature supporting the importance of individual differences in reward-related brain function as a potential biomarker of relative risk for depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sleep disturbances are a common risk factor for depression. An emerging literature suggests that reward-related activity of the ventral striatum (VS), a brain region critical for motivation and goal-directed behavior, may buffer against the effect of negative experiences on the development of depression. Using data from a large sample of 1129 university students we demonstrate that as reward-related VS activity increases, the link between sleep disturbances and depression decreases. This finding contributes to accumulating research demonstrating that reward-related brain function may be a useful biomarker of relative risk for depression in the context of negative experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Suppression of Striatal Prediction Errors by the Prefrontal Cortex in Placebo Hypoalgesia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9715?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Classical learning theories predict extinction after the discontinuation of reinforcement through prediction errors. However, placebo hypoalgesia, although mediated by associative learning, has been shown to be resistant to extinction. We tested the hypothesis that this is mediated by the suppression of prediction error processing through the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We compared pain modulation through treatment cues (placebo hypoalgesia, treatment context) with pain modulation through stimulus intensity cues (stimulus context) during functional magnetic resonance imaging in 48 male and female healthy volunteers. During acquisition, our data show that expectations are correctly learned and that this is associated with prediction error signals in the ventral striatum (VS) in both contexts. However, in the nonreinforced test phase, pain modulation and expectations of pain relief persisted to a larger degree in the treatment context, indicating that the expectations were not correctly updated in the treatment context. Consistently, we observed significantly stronger neural prediction error signals in the VS in the stimulus context compared with the treatment context. A connectivity analysis revealed negative coupling between the anterior PFC and the VS in the treatment context, suggesting that the PFC can suppress the expression of prediction errors in the VS. Consistent with this, a participant's conceptual views and beliefs about treatments influenced the pain modulation only in the treatment context. Our results indicate that in placebo hypoalgesia contextual treatment information engages prefrontal conceptual processes, which can suppress prediction error processing in the VS and lead to reduced updating of treatment expectancies, resulting in less extinction of placebo hypoalgesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In aversive and appetitive reinforcement learning, learned effects show extinction when reinforcement is discontinued. This is thought to be mediated by prediction errors (i.e., the difference between expectations and outcome). Although reinforcement learning has been central in explaining placebo hypoalgesia, placebo hypoalgesic effects show little extinction and persist after the discontinuation of reinforcement. Our results support the idea that conceptual treatment beliefs bias the neural processing of expectations in a treatment context compared with a more stimulus-driven processing of expectations with stimulus intensity cues. We provide evidence that this is associated with the suppression of prediction error processing in the ventral striatum by the prefrontal cortex. This provides a neural basis for persisting effects in reinforcement learning and placebo hypoalgesia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Action Potential Broadening in Capsaicin-Sensitive DRG Neurons from Frequency-Dependent Reduction of Kv3 Current</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9705?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Action potential (AP) shape is a key determinant of cellular electrophysiological behavior. We found that in small-diameter, capsaicin-sensitive dorsal root ganglia neurons corresponding to nociceptors (from rats of either sex), stimulation at frequencies as low as 1 Hz produced progressive broadening of the APs. Stimulation at 10 Hz for 3 s resulted in an increase in AP width by an average of 76 ± 7% at 22°C and by 38 ± 3% at 35°C. AP clamp experiments showed that spike broadening results from frequency-dependent reduction of potassium current during spike repolarization. The major current responsible for frequency-dependent reduction of overall spike-repolarizing potassium current was identified as Kv3 current by its sensitivity to low concentrations of 4-aminopyridine (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt;100 μm) and block by the peptide inhibitor blood depressing substance I (BDS-I). There was a small component of Kv1-mediated current during AP repolarization, but this current did not show frequency-dependent reduction. In a small fraction of cells, there was a component of calcium-dependent potassium current that showed frequency-dependent reduction, but the contribution to overall potassium current reduction was almost always much smaller than that of Kv3-mediated current. These results show that Kv3 channels make a major contribution to spike repolarization in small-diameter DRG neurons and undergo frequency-dependent reduction, leading to spike broadening at moderate firing frequencies. Spike broadening from frequency-dependent reduction in Kv3 current could mitigate the frequency-dependent decreases in conduction velocity typical of C-fiber axons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Small-diameter dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons mediating nociception and other sensory modalities express many types of potassium channels, but how they combine to control firing patterns and conduction is not well understood. We found that action potentials of small-diameter rat DRG neurons showed spike broadening at frequencies as low as 1 Hz and that spike broadening resulted predominantly from frequency-dependent inactivation of Kv3 channels. Spike width helps to control transmitter release, conduction velocity, and firing patterns and understanding the role of particular potassium channels can help to guide new pharmacological strategies for targeting pain-sensing neurons selectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Memantine and Ketamine Differentially Alter NMDA Receptor Desensitization</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9686?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9686?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Memantine and ketamine are clinically useful NMDA receptor (NMDAR) open channel blockers that inhibit NMDARs with similar potency and kinetics, but display vastly different clinical profiles. This discrepancy has been hypothesized to result from inhibition by memantine and ketamine of overlapping but distinct NMDAR subpopulations. For example, memantine but not ketamine may inhibit extrasynaptic NMDARs more effectively than synaptic NMDARs. However, the basis for preferential NMDAR inhibition depending on subcellular location has not been investigated systematically. We integrated recordings from heterologously expressed single NMDAR subtypes, kinetic modeling, and recordings of synaptically evoked NMDAR responses in acute brain slices to investigate mechanisms by which channel blockers may distinguish NMDAR subpopulations. We found that memantine and ketamine differentially alter NMDAR desensitization and that memantine stabilizes a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent desensitized state. As a result, inhibition by memantine of GluN1/2A receptors in tsA201 cells and of native synaptic NMDARs in cortical pyramidal neurons from mice of either sex increased in conditions that enhanced intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation. Therefore, differential inhibition by memantine and ketamine based on NMDAR location is likely to result from location dependence of the intensity and duration of NMDAR activation. Modulation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent NMDAR desensitization is an unexplored mechanism of inhibitory action with the potential to endow drugs with NMDAR selectivity that leads to superior clinical profiles. Our results suggest that designing compounds to target specific receptor states, rather than specific receptor types, may be a viable strategy for future drug development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Memantine and ketamine are NMDA receptor (NMDAR) channel-blocking drugs with divergent clinical effects. Understanding mechanistically their differential actions may advance our understanding of nervous system disorders and suggest strategies for the design of more effective drugs. Here, we show that memantine and ketamine have contrasting effects on NMDAR desensitization. Ketamine binding decreases occupancy of desensitized states of the GluN1/2B NMDAR subtype. In contrast, memantine binding increases occupancy of GluN1/2A and native NMDAR desensitized states entered after accumulation of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, a novel inhibitory mechanism. These properties may contribute to inhibition of distinct NMDAR subpopulations by memantine and ketamine and help to explain their differential clinical effects. Our results suggest stabilization of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent desensitized states as a new strategy for pharmaceutical neuroprotection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Prior Learning of Relevant Nonaversive Information Is a Boundary Condition for Avoidance Memory Reconsolidation in the Rat Hippocampus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9675?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9675?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reactivated memories can be modified during reconsolidation, making this process a potential therapeutic target for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a mental illness characterized by the recurring avoidance of situations that evoke trauma-related fears. However, avoidance memory reconsolidation depends on a set of still loosely defined boundary conditions, limiting the translational value of basic research. In particular, the involvement of the hippocampus in fear-motivated avoidance memory reconsolidation remains controversial. Combining behavioral and electrophysiological analyses in male Wistar rats, we found that previous learning of relevant nonaversive information is essential to elicit the participation of the hippocampus in avoidance memory reconsolidation, which is associated with an increase in theta- and gamma-oscillation power and cross-frequency coupling in dorsal CA1 during reactivation of the avoidance response. Our results indicate that the hippocampus is involved in memory reconsolidation only when reactivation results in contradictory representations regarding the consequences of avoidance and suggest that robust nesting of hippocampal theta–gamma rhythms at the time of retrieval is a specific reconsolidation marker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by maladaptive avoidance responses to stimuli or behaviors that represent or bear resemblance to some aspect of a traumatic experience. Disruption of reconsolidation, the process by which reactivated memories become susceptible to modifications, is a promising approach for treating PTSD patients. However, much of what is known about fear-motivated avoidance memory reconsolidation derives from studies based on fear conditioning instead of avoidance-learning paradigms. Using a step-down inhibitory avoidance task in rats, we found that the hippocampus is involved in memory reconsolidation only when the animals acquired the avoidance response in an environment that they had previously learned as safe and showed that increased theta- and gamma-oscillation coupling during reactivation is an electrophysiological signature of this process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Patterns of Temporal and Directional Connectivity among Intrinsic Networks in the Human Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9667?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9667?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To determine the spatiotemporal relationships among intrinsic networks of the human brain, we recruited seven neurosurgical patients (four males and three females) who were implanted with intracranial depth electrodes. We first identified canonical resting-state networks at the individual subject level using an iterative matching procedure on each subject's resting-state fMRI data. We then introduced single electrical pulses to fMRI pre-identified nodes of the default network (DN), frontoparietal network (FPN), and salience network (SN) while recording evoked responses in other recording sites within the same networks. We found bidirectional signal flow across the three networks, albeit with distinct patterns of evoked responses within different time windows. We used a data-driven clustering approach to show that stimulation of the FPN and SN evoked a rapid (&amp;lt;70 ms) response that was predominantly higher within the SN sites, whereas stimulation of the DN led to sustained responses in later time windows (85–200 ms). Stimulations in the medial temporal lobe components of the DN evoked relatively late effects (&amp;gt;130 ms) in other nodes of the DN, as well as FPN and SN. Our results provide temporal information about the patterns of signal flow between intrinsic networks that provide insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics that are likely to constrain the architecture of the brain networks supporting human cognition and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite great progress in the functional neuroimaging of the human brain, we still do not know the precise set of rules that define the patterns of temporal organization between large-scale networks of the brain. In this study, we stimulated and then recorded electrical evoked potentials within and between three large-scale networks of the brain, the default network (DN), frontoparietal network (FPN), and salience network (SN), in seven subjects undergoing invasive neurosurgery. Using a data-driven clustering approach, we observed distinct temporal and directional patterns between the three networks, with FPN and SN activity predominant in early windows and DN stimulation affecting the network in later windows. These results provide important temporal information about the interactions between brain networks supporting human cognition and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Overdominant Effect of a CHRNA4 Polymorphism on Cingulo-Opercular Network Activity and Cognitive Control</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The nicotinic system plays an important role in cognitive control and is implicated in several neuropsychiatric conditions. However, the contributions of genetic variability in this system to individuals' cognitive control abilities are poorly understood and the brain processes that mediate such genetic contributions remain largely unidentified. In this first large-scale neuroimaging genetics study of the human nicotinic receptor system (two cohorts, males and females, fMRI total &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 1586, behavioral total &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 3650), we investigated a common polymorphism of the high-affinity nicotinic receptor α4β2 (rs1044396 on the &lt;i&gt;CHRNA4&lt;/i&gt; gene) previously implicated in behavioral and nicotine-related studies (albeit with inconsistent major/minor allele impacts). Based on our prior neuroimaging findings, we expected this polymorphism to affect neural activity in the cingulo-opercular (CO) network involved in core cognitive control processes including maintenance of alertness. Consistent across the cohorts, all cortical areas of the CO network showed higher activity in heterozygotes compared with both types of homozygotes during cognitive engagement. This inverted U-shaped relation reflects an overdominant effect; that is, allelic interaction (cumulative evidence &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 1.33 * 10&lt;sup&gt;–5&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, heterozygotes performed more accurately in behavioral tasks that primarily depend on sustained alertness. No effects were observed for haplotypes of the surrounding &lt;i&gt;CHRNA4&lt;/i&gt; region, supporting a true overdominant effect at rs1044396. As a possible mechanism, we observed that this polymorphism is an expression quantitative trait locus modulating &lt;i&gt;CHRNA4&lt;/i&gt; expression levels. This is the first report of overdominance in the nicotinic system. These findings connect &lt;i&gt;CHRNA4&lt;/i&gt; genotype, CO network activation, and sustained alertness, providing insights into how genetics shapes individuals' cognitive control abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The nicotinic acetylcholine system plays a central role in neuromodulatory regulation of cognitive control processes and is dysregulated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite this functional importance, no large-scale neuroimaging genetics studies have targeted the contributions of genetic variability in this system to human brain activity. Here, we show the impact of a common polymorphism of the high-affinity nicotinic receptor α4β2 that is consistent across brain activity and behavior in two large human cohorts. We report a hitherto unknown overdominant effect (allelic interaction) at this locus, where the heterozygotes show higher activity in the cingulo-opercular network underlying alertness maintenance and higher behavioral alertness performance than both homozygous groups. This gene–brain–behavior relationship informs about the biological basis of interindividual differences in cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: How Human Amygdala and Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis May Drive Distinct Defensive Responses</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9645?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to adaptively regulate responses to the proximity of potential danger is critical to survival and imbalance in this system may contribute to psychopathology. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is implicated in defensive responding during uncertain threat anticipation whereas the amygdala may drive responding upon more acute danger. This functional dissociation between the BNST and amygdala is however controversial, and human evidence scarce. Here we used data from two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 108 males and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 70 (45 females)] to probe how coordination between the BNST and amygdala may regulate responses during shock anticipation and actual shock confrontation. In a subset of participants from Sample 2 (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 48) we demonstrate that anticipation and confrontation evoke bradycardic and tachycardic responses, respectively. Further, we show that in each sample when going from shock anticipation to the moment of shock confrontation neural activity shifted from a region anatomically consistent with the BNST toward the amygdala. Comparisons of functional connectivity during threat processing showed overlapping yet also consistently divergent functional connectivity profiles for the BNST and amygdala. Finally, childhood maltreatment levels predicted amygdala, but not BNST, hyperactivity during shock anticipation. Our results support an evolutionary conserved, defensive distance-dependent dynamic balance between BNST and amygdala activity. Shifts in this balance may enable shifts in defensive reactions via the demonstrated differential functional connectivity. Our results indicate that early life stress may tip the neural balance toward acute threat responding and via that route predispose for affective disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Previously proposed differential contributions of the BNST and amygdala to fear and anxiety have been recently debated. Despite the significance of understanding their contributions to defensive reactions, there is a paucity of human studies that directly compared these regions on activity and connectivity during threat processing. We show strong evidence for a dissociable role of the BNST and amygdala in threat processing by demonstrating in two large participant samples that they show a distinct temporal signature of threat responding as well as a discriminable pattern of functional connections and differential sensitivity to early life threat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: KLF9 and JNK3 Interact to Suppress Axon Regeneration in the Adult CNS</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9632?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the adult mammalian CNS decrease in intrinsic axon growth capacity during development in concert with changes in Krüppel-like transcription factors (KLFs). KLFs regulate axon growth in CNS neurons including retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Here, we found that knock-down of KLF9, an axon growth suppressor that is normally upregulated 250-fold in RGC development, promotes long-distance optic nerve regeneration in adult rats of both sexes. We identified a novel binding partner, MAPK10/JNK3 kinase, and found that JNK3 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3) is critical for KLF9's axon-growth-suppressive activity. Interfering with a JNK3-binding domain or mutating two newly discovered serine phosphorylation acceptor sites, Ser106 and Ser110, effectively abolished KLF9's neurite growth suppression &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and promoted axon regeneration &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These findings demonstrate a novel, physiologic role for the interaction of KLF9 and JNK3 in regenerative failure in the optic nerve and suggest new therapeutic strategies to promote axon regeneration in the adult CNS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Injured CNS nerves fail to regenerate spontaneously. Promoting intrinsic axon growth capacity has been a major challenge in the field. Here, we demonstrate that knocking down Krüppel-like transcription factor 9 (KLF9) via shRNA promotes long-distance axon regeneration after optic nerve injury and uncover a novel and important KLF9–JNK3 interaction that contributes to axon growth suppression &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and regenerative failure &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These studies suggest potential therapeutic approaches to promote axon regeneration in injury and other degenerative diseases in the adult CNS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Glucosylsphingosine Promotes {alpha}-Synuclein Pathology in Mutant GBA-Associated Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/40/9617?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glucocerebrosidase 1 (&lt;i&gt;GBA&lt;/i&gt;) mutations responsible for Gaucher disease (GD) are the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the genetic link between GD and PD is well established, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) are not well understood. We propose that glucosylsphingosine, a sphingolipid accumulating in GD, mediates PD pathology in &lt;i&gt;GBA&lt;/i&gt;-associated PD. We show that, whereas GD-related sphingolipids (glucosylceramide, glucosylsphingosine, sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate) promote α-synuclein aggregation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, glucosylsphingosine triggers the formation of oligomeric α-synuclein species capable of templating in human cells and neurons. Using newly generated GD/PD mouse lines of either sex [&lt;i&gt;Gba&lt;/i&gt; mutant (N370S, L444P, KO) crossed to α-synuclein transgenics], we show that &lt;i&gt;Gba&lt;/i&gt; mutations predispose to PD through a loss-of-function mechanism. We further demonstrate that glucosylsphingosine specifically accumulates in young GD/PD mouse brain. With age, brains exhibit glucosylceramide accumulations colocalized with α-synuclein pathology. These findings indicate that glucosylsphingosine promotes pathological aggregation of α-synuclein, increasing PD risk in GD patients and carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the aging population. Glucocerebrosidase 1 mutations, which cause Gaucher disease, are the most common genetic risk factor for PD, underscoring the importance of delineating the mechanisms underlying mutant &lt;i&gt;GBA&lt;/i&gt;-associated PD. We show that lipids accumulating in Gaucher disease, especially glucosylsphingosine, play a key role in PD pathology in the brain. These data indicate that ASAH1 (acid ceramidase 1) and GBA2 (glucocerebrosidase 2) enzymes that mediate glucosylsphingosine production and metabolism are attractive therapeutic targets for treating mutant &lt;i&gt;GBA&lt;/i&gt;-associated PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a beneficial replacement treatment for Spinocerebellar Ataxia 38 (SCA38)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25059</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Spinocerebellar Ataxia 38 (SCA38) is caused by mutations in the &lt;em&gt;ELOVL5&lt;/em&gt; gene, which encodes an elongase involved in the synthesis of polyunsatured fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). As a consequence, DHA is significantly reduced in the serum of SCA38 subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of DHA supplementation on clinical symptoms and changes of brain functional imaging in SCA38 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We enrolled ten SCA38 patients, and we carried out a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled study for 16 weeks, followed by an open-label study with overall 40-week DHA treatment. At baseline, and at follow-up visit, patients underwent standardised clinical assessment, brain 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET), electroneurography (ENG), and &lt;em&gt;ELOVL5&lt;/em&gt; expression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: After 16 weeks, we showed a significant pre-post clinical improvement in the DHA group vs. placebo (mean difference, MD), using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) (MD=+2.70, 95%CI: +0.13 to +5.27, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.042). At 40-week treatment, clinical improvement was found significant both in SARA (MD=+2.2, 95%CI: +0.93 to +3.46, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.008) and International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) (MD= +3.8, 95%CI: +1.39 to +6.41, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.02) scores; clinical data were corroborated by significant improvement of cerebellar hypometabolism (statistical parametric mapping analyses, False Discovery Rate corrected). We also showed a decreased expression of &lt;em&gt;ELOVL5&lt;/em&gt; in patients' blood at 40 weeks as compared to baseline. No side effect was recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: DHA supplementation is a safe and effective treatment for SCA38, showing an improvement of clinical symptoms and cerebellar hypometabolism.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A control mechanism for intramural periarterial drainage via astrocytes: How neuronal activity could improve waste clearance from the brain. (arXiv:1710.01117v2 [q-bio.TO] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01117</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01117</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms behind waste clearance from deep within the parenchyma of the
brain remain unclear to this date. Experimental evidence has shown that one
pathway for waste clearance, termed intramural periarterial drainage (IPAD), is
the rapid drainage of interstitial fluid (ISF) via basement membranes (BM) of
the smooth muscle cells (SMC) of cerebral arteries and its failure is closely
associated with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously
shown that arterial pulsations from the heart beat are not strong enough to
drive waste clearance. Here we demonstrate computational evidence for a
mechanism for cerebral waste clearance that is driven by functional hyperaemia,
that is, the dilation of cerebral arteries as a consequence of increased
neuronal demand. This mechanism is based on our model for fluid flow through
the vascular basement membrane. It accounts for waste clearance rates observed
in mouse experiments and aligns with pathological observations as well as
recommendations to lower the individual risk of AD, such as keeping mentally
and physically active.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Global Brain Dynamics During Social Exclusion Predict Subsequent Behavioral Conformity. (arXiv:1710.00869v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Individuals react differently to social experiences; for example, people who
are more sensitive to negative social experiences, such as being excluded, may
be more likely to adapt their behavior to fit in with others. We examined
whether functional brain connectivity during social exclusion in the fMRI
scanner can be used to predict subsequent conformity to peer norms. Adolescent
males (N = 57) completed a two-part study on teen driving risk: a social
exclusion task (Cyberball) during an fMRI session and a subsequent driving
simulator session in which they drove alone and in the presence of a peer who
expressed risk-averse or risk-accepting driving norms. We computed the
difference in functional connectivity between social exclusion and social
inclusion from each node in the brain to nodes in two brain networks, one
previously associated with mentalizing (medial prefrontal cortex,
temporoparietal junction, precuneus, temporal poles) and another with social
pain (anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula). Using cross-validated
machine learning, this measure of global network connectivity during exclusion
predicts the extent of conformity to peer pressure during driving in the
subsequent experimental session. These findings extend our understanding of how
global neural dynamics guide social behavior, revealing functional network
activity that captures individual differences.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Developmental increases in white matter network controllability support a growing diversity of brain dynamics. (arXiv:1607.01010v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01010</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01010</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;As the human brain develops, it increasingly supports coordinated control of
neural activity. The mechanism by which white matter evolves to support this
coordination is not well understood. We use a network representation of
diffusion imaging data from 882 youth ages 8 to 22 to show that white matter
connectivity becomes increasingly optimized for a diverse range of predicted
dynamics in development. Notably, stable controllers in subcortical areas are
negatively related to cognitive performance. Investigating structural
mechanisms supporting these changes, we simulate network evolution with a set
of growth rules. We find that all brain networks are structured in a manner
highly optimized for network control, with distinct control mechanisms
predicted in child versus older youth. We demonstrate that our results cannot
be simply explained by changes in network modularity. This work reveals a
possible mechanism of human brain development that preferentially optimizes
dynamic network control over static network architecture.

We study through a reaction-diffusion algorithm the influence of landscape diversity on the efficiency of search dynamics. Remarkably, the &lt;i&gt;identical&lt;/i&gt; optimal search strategy arises in a wide variety of environments, provided the target density is sparse and the searcher’s information is restricted to its close vicinity. Our results strongly impact the current debate on the &lt;i&gt;emergentist&lt;/i&gt; vs. &lt;i&gt;evolutionary&lt;/i&gt; origins of animal foraging. The inherent character of the optimal solution (i.e., independent on the landscape for the broad scenarios assumed here) suggests an interpretation favoring the &lt;i&gt;evolutionary&lt;/i&gt; view, as originally implied by the Lévy flight foraging hypothesis. The latter states that, under conditions of scarcity of information and sparse resources, some organisms must have evolved to exploit optimal strategies characterized by heavy-tailed truncated power-law distributions of move lengths. These results strongly suggest that Lévy strategies—and hence the selection pressure for the relevant adaptations—are robust with respect to large changes in habitat. In contrast, the usual emergentist explanation seems not able to explain how very similar Lévy walks can emerge from all the distinct non-Lévy foraging strategies that are needed for the observed large variety of specific environments. We also report that deviations from Lévy can take place in plentiful ecosystems, where locomotion truncation is very frequent due to high encounter rates. So, in this case normal diffusion strategies—performing as effectively as the optimal one—can naturally emerge from Lévy. Our results constitute the strongest theoretical evidence to date supporting the evolutionary origins of experimentally observed Lévy walks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xPyS8b1UUR4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Mathematical modelling has become an established tool for studying the dynamics of biological systems. Current applications range from building models that reproduce quantitative data to identifying systems with predefined qualitative features, such as switching behaviour, bistability or oscillations. Mathematically, the latter question amounts to identifying parameter values associated with a given qualitative feature. We introduce a procedure to partition the parameter space of a parameterized system of ordinary differential equations into regions for which the system has a unique or multiple equilibria. The procedure is based on the computation of the Brouwer degree, and it creates a multivariate polynomial with parameter depending coefficients. The signs of the coefficients determine parameter regions with and without multistationarity. A particular strength of the procedure is the avoidance of numerical analysis and parameter sampling. The procedure consists of a number of steps. Each of these steps might be addressed algorithmically using various computer programs and available software, or manually. We demonstrate our procedure on several models of gene transcription and cell signalling, and show that in many cases we obtain a complete partitioning of the parameter space with respect to multistationarity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VgqzApXN7uk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Signatures of criticality arise from random subsampling in simple population models</title>

The rise of large-scale recordings of neuronal activity has fueled the hope to gain new insights into the collective activity of neural ensembles. How can one link the statistics of neural population activity to underlying principles and theories? One attempt to interpret such data builds upon analogies to the behaviour of collective systems in statistical physics. Divergence of the specific heat—a measure of population statistics derived from thermodynamics—has been used to suggest that neural populations are optimized to operate at a “critical point”. However, these findings have been challenged by theoretical studies which have shown that common inputs can lead to diverging specific heat. Here, we connect “signatures of criticality”, and in particular the divergence of specific heat, back to statistics of neural population activity commonly studied in neural coding: firing rates and pairwise correlations. We show that the specific heat diverges whenever the average correlation strength does not depend on population size. This is necessarily true when data with correlations is randomly subsampled during the analysis process, irrespective of the detailed structure or origin of correlations. We also show how the characteristic shape of specific heat capacity curves depends on firing rates and correlations, using both analytically tractable models and numerical simulations of a canonical feed-forward population model. To analyze these simulations, we develop efficient methods for characterizing large-scale neural population activity with maximum entropy models. We find that, consistent with experimental findings, increases in firing rates and correlation directly lead to more pronounced signatures. Thus, previous reports of thermodynamical criticality in neural populations based on the analysis of specific heat can be explained by average firing rates and correlations, and are not indicative of an optimized coding strategy. We conclude that a reliable interpretation of statistical tests for theories of neural coding is possible only in reference to relevant ground-truth models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JM3_Ni6t73U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Crude EEG parameter provides sleep medicine with well-defined continuous hypnograms. (arXiv:1710.00559v1 [stat.AP])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00559</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00559</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;To evaluate EEG data, one can count local maxima and minima on a fine scale,
in a sliding window analysis. This straightforward calculation, which
simplifies and improves previous work on permutation entropy, directly defines
a good proxy for brain activity in an EEG channel during an epoch of 30
seconds. Different channels and persons can be compared when they are measured
with the same device and prefiltering options. This could lead to a rigorously
defined and suitably standardized biomarker of cortex activity, like blood
pressure or laboratory values. Applied to sleep EEG, the algorithm yields
hypnograms with continuous scale which show amazing coincidence with sleep
stage annotation by trained experts. Although produced by a crude method,
continuous hypnograms provide a lot of details. For example, sleep depth
usually decreases from evening to morning even within the same annotated sleep
stage, except for REM phases where mean sleep depth is rather constant, but
different in frontal and parietal channels. The diagnostic potential of the
method is demonstrated with two hypnograms of narcoleptic patients. In all 10
subjects, infra-slow oscillations of activity with a wavelength between 30s and
two minutes were clearly seen, particularly strong at the onset of sleep and in
S2 phases. The suggested method needs to be checked and improved. In its
present form it seems already an appropriate tool for screening long-term EEG
data.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A single-cell spiking model for the origin of grid-cell patterns</title>

Spatial cognition in mammals is thought to rely on the activity of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, yet the fundamental principles underlying the origin of grid-cell firing are still debated. Grid-like patterns could emerge via Hebbian learning and neuronal adaptation, but current computational models remained too abstract to allow direct confrontation with experimental data. Here, we propose a single-cell spiking model that generates grid firing fields via spike-rate adaptation and spike-timing dependent plasticity. Through rigorous mathematical analysis applicable in the linear limit, we quantitatively predict the requirements for grid-pattern formation, and we establish a direct link to classical pattern-forming systems of the Turing type. Our study lays the groundwork for biophysically-realistic models of grid-cell activity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OBzyBRe4hNc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Determining how synaptic coupling within and between regions is modulated during sensory processing is an important topic in neuroscience. Electrophysiological recordings provide detailed information about neural spiking but have traditionally been confined to a particular region or layer of cortex. Here we develop new theoretical methods to study interactions between and within two brain regions, based on experimental measurements of spiking activity simultaneously recorded from the two regions. By systematically comparing experimentally-obtained spiking statistics to (efficiently computed) model spike rate statistics, we identify regions in model parameter space that are consistent with the experimental data. We apply our new technique to dual micro-electrode array &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings from two distinct regions: olfactory bulb (OB) and anterior piriform cortex (PC). Our analysis predicts that: i) inhibition within the afferent region (OB) has to be weaker than the inhibition within PC, ii) excitation from PC to OB is generally stronger than excitation from OB to PC, iii) excitation from PC to OB and inhibition within PC have to both be relatively strong compared to presynaptic inputs from OB. These predictions are validated in a spiking neural network model of the OB–PC pathway that satisfies the many constraints from our experimental data. We find when the derived relationships are violated, the spiking statistics no longer satisfy the constraints from the data. In principle this modeling framework can be adapted to other systems and be used to investigate relationships between other neural attributes besides network connection strengths. Thus, this work can serve as a guide to further investigations into the relationships of various neural attributes within and across different regions during sensory processing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bmAz5E-V358&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

With the rapidly increasing volume of deep sequencing data, more efficient algorithms and data structures are needed. Minimizers are a central recent paradigm that has improved various sequence analysis tasks, including hashing for faster read overlap detection, sparse suffix arrays for creating smaller indexes, and Bloom filters for speeding up sequence search. Here, we propose an alternative paradigm that can lead to substantial further improvement in these and other tasks. For integers &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;, we say that a set of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mers is a &lt;i&gt;universal hitting set&lt;/i&gt; (UHS) if every possible &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-long sequence must contain a &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-mer from the set. We develop a heuristic called DOCKS to find a compact UHS, which works in two phases: The first phase is solved optimally, and for the second we propose several efficient heuristics, trading set size for speed and memory. The use of heuristics is motivated by showing the NP-hardness of a closely related problem. We show that DOCKS works well in practice and produces UHSs that are very close to a theoretical lower bound. We present results for various values of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt; and by applying them to real genomes show that UHSs indeed improve over minimizers. In particular, DOCKS uses less than 30% of the 10-mers needed to span the human genome compared to minimizers. The software and computed UHSs are freely available at github.com/Shamir-Lab/DOCKS/ and acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/docks/, respectively.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-LCuI1mRyPk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Estimating time of HIV-1 infection from next-generation sequence diversity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005775</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Vadim Puller, Richard Neher, Jan Albert&lt;/p&gt;

Estimating the time since infection (TI) in newly diagnosed HIV-1 patients is challenging, but important to understand the epidemiology of the infection. Here we explore the utility of virus diversity estimated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) as novel biomarker by using a recent genome-wide longitudinal dataset obtained from 11 untreated HIV-1-infected patients with known dates of infection. The results were validated on a second dataset from 31 patients. Virus diversity increased linearly with time, particularly at 3rd codon positions, with little inter-patient variation. The precision of the TI estimate improved with increasing sequencing depth, showing that diversity in NGS data yields superior estimates to the number of ambiguous sites in Sanger sequences, which is one of the alternative biomarkers. The full advantage of deep NGS was utilized with continuous diversity measures such as average pairwise distance or site entropy, rather than the fraction of polymorphic sites. The precision depended on the genomic region and codon position and was highest when 3rd codon positions in the entire &lt;i&gt;pol&lt;/i&gt; gene were used. For these data, TI estimates had a mean absolute error of around 1 year. The error increased only slightly from around 0.6 years at a TI of 6 months to around 1.1 years at 6 years. Our results show that virus diversity determined by NGS can be used to estimate time since HIV-1 infection many years after the infection, in contrast to most alternative biomarkers. We provide the regression coefficients as well as web tool for TI estimation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KMtznCSBzrY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: In reply to Faes et al. and Barnett et al. regarding &quot;A study of problems encountered in Granger causality analysis from a neuroscience perspective&quot;. (arXiv:1709.10248v1 [stat.ME])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This reply is in response to commentaries by Barnett, Barrett, and Seth
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1708.08001&quot;&gt;arXiv:1708.08001&lt;/a&gt;) and Faes, Stramaglia, and Marinazzo (&lt;a href=&quot;http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1708.06990&quot;&gt;arXiv:1708.06990&lt;/a&gt;) on
our paper entitled &quot;A study of problems encountered in Granger causality
analysis from a neuroscience perspective.&quot; (PNAS 114(34):7063-7072. 2017). In
our paper, we analyzed several properties of Granger-Geweke causality (GGC) and
discussed potential problems in neuroscience applications. We demonstrated: (i)
that GGC, estimated using separate model fits, is either severely biased,
particularly when the true model is known, or a high variance is introduced to
overcome the bias; and (ii) that GGC does not reflect some component dynamics
of the system. The commentaries by both Faes et al. and Barnett et al. point
out that the computational problems of (i) are resolved by using recent
computational methods. We acknowledge that these problems are indeed resolved
by these methods. However, the traditional computation using separate model
fits continues to be presented and applied. More fundamentally, the
interpretational problems stemming from (ii) are not in anyway addressed by the
improved methods because they are inherent to the definition of GGC. These
properties are indeed acknowledged by both commentaries. We have no
misconception of the GGC measure and do not claim that these properties are
facially wrong. But we do discuss at length how these properties make it
inappropriate and misleading for common types of scientific questions, how
presentation of GGC results without model estimates are not decipherable, and
how the absence of clear statements of questions of interest present further
opportunities for misinterpretation.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The characterisation of neuronal connectivity is one of the most important
matters in neuroscience. In this work, we show that a recently proposed
informational quantity, the causal mutual information, employed with an
appropriate methodology, can be used not only to correctly infer the direction
of the underlying physical synapses, but also to identify their excitatory or
inhibitory nature, considering easy to handle and measure bivariate
time-series. The success of our approach relies on a surprising property found
in neuronal networks by which non-adjacent neurons do &quot;understand&quot; each other
(positive mutual information), however this exchange of information is not
capable of causing effect (zero transfer entropy). Remarkably, inhibitory
connections, responsible for enhancing synchronisation, transfer more
information than excitatory connections, known to enhance entropy in the
network. We also demonstrate that our methodology can be used to correctly
infer directionality of synapses even in the presence of dynamic and
observational Gaussian noise, and is also successful in providing the effective
directionality of inter modular connectivity, when only mean fields can be
measured.

	<description>While clues have existed that endosomal trafficking is associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), whether it plays a central role in the disease and if so how has remained unknown. Here we rely on recent genetic and cellular findings to construct a model proposing that traffic jams in the early endosome can act as an upstream pathogenic hub in AD. We also rely on an independent series of findings to suggest how the traffic jams can act as a unified mediator of downstream pathophysiology. The model predicts, therefore, that interventions designed to unjam the endosome carry high therapeutic promise.</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Estradiol Membrane-Initiated Signaling in the Brain Mediates Reproduction</title>

	<description>Over the past few years our understanding of estrogen signaling in the brain has expanded rapidly. Estrogens are synthesized in the periphery and in the brain, acting on multiple receptors to regulate gene transcription, neural function, and behavior. Various estrogen-sensitive signaling pathways often operate in concert within the same cell, increasing the complexity of the system. In females, estrogen concentrations fluctuate over the estrous/menstrual cycle, dynamically modulating estrogen receptor (ER) expression, activity, and trafficking.</description>
