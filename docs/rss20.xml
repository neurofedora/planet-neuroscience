	<description>Premature, sudden death is devastating. Certain patient populations are at greater risk to succumb to sudden death. For instance, infants under 1year of age are at risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and patients with epilepsy are at risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Deaths are attributed to these syndromic entities in these select populations when other diagnoses have been excluded. There are a number of similarities between these syndromes, and the commonalities suggest that the two syndromes may share certain etiological features.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we aimed at reviewing several different approaches present
today in the search for more accurate diagnostic and treatment management in
mental healthcare. Our focus is on mood disorders, and in particular on the
major depressive disorder (MDD). We are reviewing and discussing findings based
on neuroimaging studies (MRI and fMRI) first to get the impression of the body
of knowledge about the anatomical and functional differences in depression.
Then, we are focusing on less expensive data-driven approach, applicable for
everyday clinical practice, in particular, those based on
electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Among those studies utilizing EEG, we
are discussing a group of applications used for detecting of depression based
on the resting state EEG (detection studies) and interventional studies (using
stimulus in their protocols or aiming to predict the outcome of therapy). We
conclude with a discussion and review of guidelines to improve the reliability
of developed models that could serve improvement of diagnostic of depression in
psychiatry.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: LMTRDA: Using logistic model tree to predict MiRNA-disease associations by fusing multi-source information of sequences and similarities</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006865</guid>

Emerging evidence has shown microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in human disease research. Identifying potential association among them is significant for the development of pathology, diagnose and therapy. However, only a tiny portion of all miRNA-disease pairs in the current datasets are experimentally validated. This prompts the development of high-precision computational methods to predict real interaction pairs. In this paper, we propose a new model of Logistic Model Tree for predicting miRNA-Disease Association (LMTRDA) by fusing multi-source information including miRNA sequences, miRNA functional similarity, disease semantic similarity, and known miRNA-disease associations. In particular, we introduce miRNA sequence information and extract its features using natural language processing technique for the first time in the miRNA-disease prediction model. In the cross-validation experiment, LMTRDA obtained 90.51% prediction accuracy with 92.55% sensitivity at the AUC of 90.54% on the HMDD V3.0 dataset. To further evaluate the performance of LMTRDA, we compared it with different classifier and feature descriptor models. In addition, we also validate the predictive ability of LMTRDA in human diseases including Breast Neoplasms, Breast Neoplasms and Lymphoma. As a result, 28, 27 and 26 out of the top 30 miRNAs associated with these diseases were verified by experiments in different kinds of case studies. These experimental results demonstrate that LMTRDA is a reliable model for predicting the association among miRNAs and diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uk6W5kII4WE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Combining structural proteomics experimental data with computational methods is a powerful tool for protein structure prediction. Here, we apply a recently-developed approach for &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; protein structure determination based on the incorporation of short-distance crosslinking data as constraints in discrete molecular dynamics simulations (CL-DMD) for the determination of conformational ensemble of the intrinsically disordered protein α-synuclein in the solution. The predicted structures were in agreement with hydrogen-deuterium exchange, circular dichroism, surface modification, and long-distance crosslinking data. We found that α-synuclein is present in solution as an ensemble of rather compact globular conformations with distinct topology and inter-residue contacts, which is well-represented by movements of the large loops and formation of few transient secondary structure elements. Non-amyloid component and C-terminal regions were consistently found to contain β-structure elements and hairpins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jeUZw_xosck&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Artificial Intelligence is exponentially increasing its impact on healthcare. As deep learning is mastering computer vision tasks, its application to digital pathology is natural, with the promise of aiding in routine reporting and standardizing results across trials. Deep learning features inferred from digital pathology scans can improve validity and robustness of current clinico-pathological features, up to identifying novel histological patterns, &lt;i&gt;e.g&lt;/i&gt;., from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. In this study, we examine the issue of evaluating accuracy of predictive models from deep learning features in digital pathology, as an hallmark of reproducibility. We introduce the DAPPER framework for validation based on a rigorous Data Analysis Plan derived from the FDA’s MAQC project, designed to analyze causes of variability in predictive biomarkers. We apply the framework on models that identify tissue of origin on 787 Whole Slide Images from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We test three different deep learning architectures (VGG, ResNet, Inception) as feature extractors and three classifiers (a fully connected multilayer, Support Vector Machine and Random Forests) and work with four datasets (5, 10, 20 or 30 classes), for a total of 53, 000 tiles at 512 × 512 resolution. We analyze accuracy and feature stability of the machine learning classifiers, also demonstrating the need for diagnostic tests (&lt;i&gt;e.g&lt;/i&gt;., random labels) to identify selection bias and risks for reproducibility. Further, we use the deep features from the VGG model from GTEx on the KIMIA24 dataset for identification of slide of origin (24 classes) to train a classifier on 1, 060 annotated tiles and validated on 265 unseen ones. The DAPPER software, including its deep learning pipeline and the Histological Imaging—Newsy Tiles (HINT) benchmark dataset derived from GTEx, is released as a basis for standardization and validation initiatives in AI for digital pathology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cFNBmsecX-4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Restrained Dendritic Growth of Adult-born Granule Cells Innervated by Transplanted Fetal GABAergic Interneurons in Mice with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The dentate gyrus (DG) is a region of the adult rodent brain that undergoes continuous neurogenesis. Seizures and loss or dysfunction of GABAergic synapses onto adult-born dentate granule cells (GCs) alter their dendritic growth and migration, resulting in dysmorphic and hyperexcitable GCs. Additionally, transplants of fetal GABAergic interneurons in the DG of mice with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) result in seizure suppression, but it is unknown whether increasing interneurons with these transplants restores GABAergic innervation to adult-born GCs. Here we address this question by retroviral birth-dating GCs at different times up to 12 weeks after pilocarpine-induced TLE in adult mice. ChR2-EYFP-expressing MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons from E13.5 mouse embryos were transplanted into the DG of the TLE mice and GCs with transplant-derived inhibitory post-synaptic currents were identified by patch-clamp electrophysiology and optogenetic interrogation. Putative synaptic sites between GCs and GABAergic transplants were also confirmed by intracellular biocytin staining, immunohistochemistry, and confocal imaging. 3D reconstructions of dendritic arbors and quantitative morphometric analyses were carried out in &amp;gt;150 adult-born GCs. GABAergic inputs from transplanted interneurons correlated with markedly shorter GC dendrites, compared to GCs that were not innervated by the transplants. Moreover, these effects were confined to distal dendritic branches and a short time window of 6-8 weeks. The effects were independent of seizures as they were also observed in naïve mice with MGE transplants. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that increased inhibitory currents over a smaller dendritic arbor in adult-born GCs may reduce their excitability and lead to seizure suppression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Transplants of medial-ganglionic eminence (MGE) GABAergic progenitors into the hippocampus of adult mice with pilocarpine-induced TLE have been shown to increase inhibitory synaptic currents in granule cells (GCs) in the dentate gyrus (DG) and suppress seizures. Here we investigated whether the increased transplant-derived inhibition resulted in structural changes to the dendritic arbors of adult-born GCs that might be responsible for reduced excitability. Our results show that transplant-innervated adult-born GCs form significantly shorter dendrites compared to non-innervated GCs. These changes were restricted to distal dendrites in GCs generated within two-months after transplantation. These findings suggest a structural mechanism for seizure suppression whereby increased GABAergic innervation from transplanted MGE progenitors may restrict the growth of dendritic arbors in adult-born hippocampal granule cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Genome-Wide Association Studies of Impulsive Personality Traits (BIS-11 and UPPS-P) and Drug Experimentation in up to 22,861 Adult Research Participants Identify Loci in the CACNA1I and CADM2 genes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Impulsive personality traits are complex heritable traits that are governed by frontal-subcortical circuits and are associated with numerous neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly drug abuse and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In collaboration with the genetics company 23andMe, we performed 10 genome-wide association studies on measures of impulsive personality traits [the short version of the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11)] and drug experimentation (the number of drug classes an individual had tried in their lifetime) in up to 22,861 male and female adult human research participants of European ancestry. Impulsive personality traits and drug experimentation showed single nucleotide polymorphism heritabilities that ranged from 5 to 11%. Genetic variants in the &lt;i&gt;CADM2&lt;/i&gt; locus were significantly associated with UPPS-P Sensation Seeking (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 8.3 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;–9&lt;/sup&gt;, rs139528938) and showed a suggestive association with Drug Experimentation (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 3.0 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;–7&lt;/sup&gt;, rs2163971; &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.68 with rs139528938). Furthermore, genetic variants in the &lt;i&gt;CACNA1I&lt;/i&gt; locus were significantly associated with UPPS-P Negative Urgency (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 3.8 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;–8&lt;/sup&gt;; rs199694726). The role of these genes was supported by single variant, gene- and transcriptome-based analyses. Multiple subscales from both UPPS-P and BIS showed strong genetic correlations (&amp;gt;0.5) with Drug Experimentation and other substance use traits measured in independent cohorts, including smoking initiation, and lifetime cannabis use. Several UPPS-P and BIS subscales were genetically correlated with ADHD (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.30–0.51), supporting their validity as endophenotypes. Our findings demonstrate a role for common genetic contributions to individual differences in impulsivity. Furthermore, our study is the first to provide a genetic dissection of the relationship between different types of impulsive personality traits and various psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Impulsive personality traits (IPTs) are heritable traits that are governed by frontal-subcortical circuits and are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly substance use disorders. We have performed genome-wide association studies of IPTs to identify regions and genes that account for this heritable variation. IPTs and drug experimentation were modestly heritable (5–11%). We identified an association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in &lt;i&gt;CADM2&lt;/i&gt; and both sensation seeking and drug experimentation; and between variants in &lt;i&gt;CACNA1I&lt;/i&gt; and negative urgency. The role of these genes was supported by single variant, gene- and transcriptome-based analyses. This study provides evidence that impulsivity can be genetically separated into distinct components. We showed that IPT are genetically associated with substance use and ADHD, suggesting impulsivity is an endophenotype contributing to these psychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a principal environmental risk factor contributing to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which compromises fetal brain development at critical periods of pregnancy and might be causally linked to ASD symptoms. We report that endogenous activation of the purinergic ion channel P2X7 (P2rx7) is necessary and sufficient to transduce MIA to autistic phenotype in male offspring. MIA induced by poly(I:C) injections to P2rx7 WT mouse dams elicited an autism-like phenotype in their offspring, and these alterations were not observed in P2rx7-deficient mice, or following maternal treatment with a specific P2rx7 antagonist, JNJ47965567. Genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of maternal P2rx7s also counteracted the induction of IL-6 in the maternal plasma and fetal brain, and disrupted brain development, whereas postnatal P2rx7 inhibition alleviated behavioral and morphological alterations in the offspring. Administration of ATP to P2rx7 WT dams also evoked autistic phenotype, but not in KO dams, implying that P2rx7 activation by ATP is sufficient to induce autism-like features in offspring. Our results point to maternal and offspring P2rx7s as potential therapeutic targets for the early prevention and treatment of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder caused by genetic and environmental factors. Recent studies highlighted the importance of perinatal risks, in particular, maternal immune activation (MIA), showing strong association with the later emergence of ASD in the affected children. MIA could be mimicked in animal models via injection of a nonpathogenic agent poly(I:C) during pregnancy. This is the first report showing the key role of a ligand gated ion channel, the purinergic P2X7 receptor in MIA-induced autism-like behavioral and biochemical features. We show that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of both maternal and offspring P2X7 receptors could reverse the compromised brain development and autistic phenotype pointing to new possibilities for prevention and treatment of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Insensitivity of Place Cells to the Value of Spatial Goals in a Two-Choice Flexible Navigation Task</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal place cells show position-specific activity thought to reflect a self-localization signal. Several reports also point to some form of goal encoding by place cells. We investigated this by asking whether they also encode the value of spatial goals, which is crucial information for optimizing goal-directed navigation. We used a continuous place navigation task in which male rats navigate to one of two (freely chosen) unmarked locations and wait, triggering the release of reward, which is then located and consumed elsewhere. This allows sampling of place fields and dissociates spatial goal from reward consumption. The two goals varied in the amount of reward provided, allowing assessment of whether the rats factored goal value into their navigational choice and of possible neural correlates of this value. Rats successfully learned the task, indicating goal localization, and they preferred higher-value goals, indicating processing of goal value. Replicating previous findings, there was goal-related activity in the out-of-field firing of CA1 place cells, with a ramping-up of firing rate during the waiting period, but no general overrepresentation of goals by place fields, an observation that we extended to CA3 place cells. Importantly, place cells were not modulated by goal value. This suggests that dorsal hippocampal place cells encode space independently of its associated value despite the effect of that value on spatial behavior. Our findings are consistent with a model of place cells in which they provide a spontaneously constructed value-free spatial representation rather than encoding other navigationally relevant but nonspatial information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We investigated whether hippocampal place cells, which compute a self-localization signal, also encode the relative value of places, which is essential information for optimal navigation. When choosing between two spatial goals of different value, rats preferred the higher-value goal. We saw out-of-field goal firing in place cells, replicating previous observations that the cells are influenced by the goal, but their activity was not modulated by the value of these goals. Our results suggest that place cells do not encode all of the navigationally relevant aspects of a place, but instead form a value-free &quot;map&quot; that links to such aspects in other parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: An Essential Role of the Intraparietal Sulcus in Response Inhibition Predicted by Parcellation-Based Network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2509?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) features close anatomical and functional relationships with the prefrontal cortex. However, the necessity of the PPC in executive functions has been questioned. The present study used the stop-signal task to examine response inhibition, an executive function that inhibits prepotent response tendency. The brain activity and resting-state functional connectivity were measured to analyze a parcellation-based network that was aimed at identifying a candidate PPC region essential for response inhibition in humans. The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) was activated during response inhibition and connected with the inferior frontal cortex and the presupplementary motor area, the two frontal regions known to be necessary for response inhibition. Next, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to test the essential role of the IPS region for response inhibition. TMS over the IPS region prolonged the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), the standard behavioral index used to evaluate stopping performance, when stimulation was applied 30–0 ms before stopping. On the contrary, stimulation over the temporoparietal junction region, an area activated during response inhibition but lacking connectivity with the two frontal regions, did not show changes in SSRT. These results indicate that the IPS identified using the parcellation-based network plays an essential role in executive functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Based on the previous neuropsychological studies reporting no impairment in executive functions after lesions in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), the necessity of PPC in executive functions has been questioned. Here, contrary to the long-lasting view, by using recently developed analysis in functional MRI (&quot;parcellation-based network analysis&quot;), we identified the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) region in the PPC as essential for response inhibition: one executive function to stop actions that are inaccurate in a given context. The necessity of IPS for response inhibition was further tested by an interventional technique of transcranial magnetic stimulation. Stimulation to the IPS disrupted the performance of stopping. Our findings suggest that the IPS plays essential roles in executive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cognitive Control of Saccadic Selection and Inhibition from within the Core Cortical Saccadic Network</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2497?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to select the task-relevant stimulus for a saccadic eye movement, while inhibiting saccades to task-irrelevant stimuli, is crucial for active vision. Here, we present a novel saccade-contingent behavioral paradigm and investigate the neural basis of the central cognitive functions underpinning such behavior, saccade selection, saccade inhibition, and saccadic choice, in female and male human participants. The paradigm allows for exceptionally well-matched contrasts, with task demands formalized with stochastic accumulation-to-threshold models. Using fMRI, we replicated the core cortical eye-movement network for saccade generation (frontal eye fields, posterior parietal cortex, and higher-level visual areas). However, in contrast to previously published tasks, saccadic selection and inhibition recruited only this core network. Brain–behavior analyses further showed that inhibition efficiency may be underpinned by white-matter integrity of tracts between key saccade-generating regions, and that inhibition efficiency is associated with right inferior frontal gyrus engagement, potentially implementing general-purpose inhibition. The core network, however, was insufficient for saccadic choice, which recruited anterior regions commonly attributed to saccadic action selection, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. Jointly, the results indicate that extra-saccadic activity observed for free choice, and in previously published tasks probing saccadic control, is likely due to increased load on higher-level cognitive processes, and not saccadic selection per se, which is achieved within the canonical cortical eye movement network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ability to selectively attend to, and to not attend to, parts of the world is crucial for successful action. Mapping the neural substrate of the key cognitive functions underlying such behavior, saccade selection and inhibition, is a challenge. Canonical tasks, often preceding the cognitive neuroscience revolution by decennia, were not designed to isolate single cognitive functions, and result in extremely widespread brain activity. We developed a novel behavioral paradigm, which demonstrates the following: (1) the cognitive control of saccades is achieved within key cortical saccadic brain regions; (2) individual variability in control efficiency is related to white-matter connectivity between the same regions; and (3) widespread activity in canonical tasks is likely related to higher-level cognitive demands and not saccadic control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nucleus Accumbens Drd1-Expressing Neurons Control Aggression Self-Administration and Aggression Seeking in Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We recently developed a mouse model of appetitive operant aggression and reported that adult male outbred CD-1 mice lever-press for the opportunity to attack subordinate male mice and relapse to aggression seeking during abstinence. Here we studied the role of nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine receptor (Drd)1- and Drd2-expressing neurons in aggression self-administration and aggression seeking. We trained CD-1 mice to self-administer intruders (9 d, 12 trials/d) and tested them for aggression self-administration and aggression seeking on abstinence Day 1. We used immunohistochemistry and &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization to measure the neuronal activity marker Fos in the NAc, and cell-type-specific colocalization of Fos with Drd1- and Drd2-expressing neurons. To test the causal role of Drd1- and Drd2-expressing neurons, we validated a transgenic hybrid breeding strategy crossing inbred Drd1-Cre and Drd2-Cre transgenic mice with outbred CD-1 mice and used cell-type-specific Cre-DREADD (hM4Di) to inhibit NAc Drd1- and Drd2-expressing neuron activity. We found that aggression self-administration and aggression seeking induced higher Fos expression in NAc shell than in core, that &lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt; colocalized with &lt;i&gt;Drd1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Drd2&lt;/i&gt; in both subregions, and that chemogenetic inhibition of Drd1-, but not Drd2-, expressing neurons decreased aggression self-administration and aggression seeking. Results indicate a cell-type-specific role of Drd1-expressing neurons that is critical for both aggression self-administration and aggression seeking. Our study also validates a simple breeding strategy between outbred CD-1 mice and inbred C57-based Cre lines that can be used to study cell-type and circuit mechanisms of aggression reward and relapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Aggression is often comorbid with neuropsychiatric diseases, including drug addiction. One form, appetitive aggression, exhibits symptomatology that mimics that of drug addiction and is hypothesized to be due to dysregulation of addiction-related reward circuits. However, our mechanistic understanding of the circuitry modulating appetitive operant aggression is limited. Here we used a novel mouse model of aggression self-administration and relapse, in combination with immunohistochemistry, &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, and chemogenetic manipulations to examine how cell types in the nucleus accumbens are recruited for, and control, operant aggression self-administration and aggression seeking on abstinence Day 1. We found that one population, dopamine receptor 1-expressing neurons, act as a critical modulator of operant aggression reward and aggression seeking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Connectivity and Dynamics Underlying Synaptic Control of the Subthalamic Nucleus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2470?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Adaptive motor control critically depends on the interconnected nuclei of the basal ganglia in the CNS. A pivotal element of the basal ganglia is the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which serves as a therapeutic target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. The functional connectivity of the STN at the microcircuit level, however, still requires rigorous investigation. Here we combine multiple simultaneous whole-cell recordings with extracellular stimulation and &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; neuroanatomical analysis to investigate intrinsic and afferent connectivity and synaptic properties of the STN in acute brain slices obtained from rats of both sexes. Our data reveal an absence of intrinsic connectivity and an afferent innervation with low divergence, suggesting that STN neurons operate as independent processing elements driven by upstream structures. Hence, synchrony in the STN, a hallmark of motor processing, exclusively depends on the interactions and dynamics of GABAergic and glutamatergic afferents. Importantly, these inputs are subject to differential short-term depression when stimulated at high, DBS-like frequencies, shifting the balance of excitation and inhibition toward inhibition. Thus, we present a mechanism for fast yet transient decoupling of the STN from synchronizing afferent control. Together, our study provides new insights into the microcircuit organization of the STN by identifying its neurons as parallel processing units and thus sets new constraints for future computational models of the basal ganglia. The observed differential short-term plasticity of afferent inputs further offers a basis to better understand and optimize DBS algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a pivotal element of the basal ganglia and serves as target for deep brain stimulation, but information on the functional connectivity of its neurons is limited. To investigate the STN microcircuitry, we combined multiple simultaneous patch-clamp recordings and neuroanatomical analysis. Our results provide new insights into the synaptic organization of the STN identifying its neurons as parallel processing units and thus set new constraints for future computational models of the basal ganglia. We further find that synaptic dynamics of afferent inputs result in a rapid yet transient decoupling of the STN when stimulated at high frequencies. These results offer a better understanding of deep brain stimulation mechanisms, promoting the development of optimized algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ethanol Experience Enhances Glutamatergic Ventral Hippocampal Inputs to D1 Receptor-Expressing Medium Spiny Neurons in the Nucleus Accumbens Shell</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A growing number of studies implicate alterations in glutamatergic signaling within the reward circuitry of the brain during alcohol abuse and dependence. A key integrator of glutamatergic signaling in the reward circuit is the nucleus accumbens, more specifically, the dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) within this region, which have been implicated in the formation of dependence to many drugs of abuse including alcohol. D1-MSNs receive glutamatergic input from several brain regions; however, it is not currently known how individual inputs onto D1-MSNs are altered by alcohol experience. Here, we investigate input-specific adaptations in glutamatergic transmission in response to varying levels of alcohol experience. Virally mediated expression of Channelrhodopsin in ventral hippocampal (vHipp) glutamate neurons of male mice allowed for selective activation of vHipp to D1-MSN synapses. Therefore, we were able to compare synaptic adaptations in response to low and high alcohol experience &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Alcohol experience enhanced glutamatergic activity and abolished LTD at vHipp to D1-MSN synapses. Following chronic alcohol experience, GluA2-lacking AMPARs, which are Ca permeable, were inserted into vHipp to D1-MSN synapses. These findings support the reversal of alcohol-induced insertion of Ca-permeable AMPARs and the enhancement of glutamatergic activity at vHipp to D1-MSNs as potential targets for intervention during early exposure to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Given the roles of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in integrating cortical and allocortical information and in reward learning, it is vital to understand how inputs to this region are altered by drugs of abuse such as alcohol. The strength of excitatory inputs from the ventral hippocampus (vHipp) to the NAc has been positively associated with reward-related behaviors, but it is unclear whether or how ethanol affects these inputs. Here we show that vHipp–NAc synapses indeed are altered by ethanol exposure, with vHipp glutamatergic input to the NAc being enhanced following chronic ethanol experience. This work provides insight into ethanol-induced alterations of vHipp–NAc synapses and suggests that, similarly to drugs such as cocaine, the strengthening of these synapses promotes reward behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional BDNF Delivery from Astrocytes Rescues Memory Deficits, Spine Density, and Synaptic Properties in the 5xFAD Mouse Model of Alzheimer Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2441?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2441?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been well documented that neurotrophins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are severely affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their administration faces a myriad of technical challenges. Here we took advantage of the early astrogliosis observed in an amyloid mouse model of AD (5xFAD) and used it as an internal sensor to administer BDNF conditionally and locally. We first demonstrate the relevance of BDNF release from astrocytes by evaluating the effects of coculturing WT neurons and BDNF-deficient astrocytes. Next, we crossed 5xFAD mice with pGFAP:BDNF mice (only males were used) to create 5xFAD mice that overexpress BDNF when and where astrogliosis is initiated (5xF:pGB mice). We evaluated the behavioral phenotype of these mice. We first found that BDNF from astrocytes is crucial for dendrite outgrowth and spine number in cultured WT neurons. Double-mutant 5xF:pGB mice displayed improvements in cognitive tasks compared with 5xFAD littermates. In these mice, there was a rescue of BDNF/TrkB downstream signaling activity associated with an improvement of dendritic spine density and morphology. Clusters of synaptic markers, PSD-95 and synaptophysin, were also recovered in 5xF:pGB compared with 5xFAD mice as well as the number of presynaptic vesicles at excitatory synapses. Additionally, experimentally evoked LTP &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; was increased in 5xF:pGB mice. The beneficial effects of conditional BDNF production and local delivery at the location of active neuropathology highlight the potential to use endogenous biomarkers with early onset, such as astrogliosis, as regulators of neurotrophic therapy in AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent evidence places astrocytes as pivotal players during synaptic plasticity and memory processes. In the present work, we first provide evidence that astrocytes are essential for neuronal morphology via BDNF release. We then crossed transgenic mice (5xFAD mice) with the transgenic pGFAP-BDNF mice, which express BDNF under the GFAP promoter. The resultant double-mutant mice 5xF:pGB mice displayed a full rescue of hippocampal BDNF loss and related signaling compared with 5xFAD mice and a significant and specific improvement in all the evaluated cognitive tasks. These improvements did not correlate with amelioration of β amyloid load or hippocampal adult neurogenesis rate but were accompanied by a dramatic recovery of structural and functional synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Deep Brain Stimulation Rescues Memory and Synaptic Activity in a Rat Model of Global Ischemia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is responsible for a large number of neurological deficits including memory impairment. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), a well established therapeutic modality for the treatment of movement disorders, has recently shown potential beneficial effects on memory in animals and patients with Alzheimer's disease. Here, we test DBS for its ability to improve memory impairments by stimulating the entorhinal cortex (EC) in a rat model of global ischemia (GI). Two weeks after GI, adult male rats received high-frequency EC DBS for 1 h, and animals were assessed for changes in locomotor activity, learning, and memory 6 weeks later. GI produced spatial memory impairment that was ameliorated by DBS, with no difference between the group that received DBS for GI (GI-DBS ON group) and nonstroke control groups. Although GI led to a dramatic CA1 neuronal loss that could not be rescued with DBS, stimulation attenuated the reduction of CA1 synaptophysin expression after GI. Further, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; slice recordings showed a restoration of typical evoked synaptic dendritic fields in GI-DBS ON animals, indicating that the DBS-induced memory rescue is associated with increased synaptophysin expression and enhanced synaptic function. These results suggest that DBS may ameliorate the functional consequences of cerebral ischemia and point to be a potential new therapeutic approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is remarkably effective in treating Parkinson's disease and is currently under investigation for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Until now, DBS has not been examined for its cognitive benefits in the context of hypoxic-ischemic injuries. Here, we investigated the effect of DBS in a rat model of global ischemia (GI) that mimics the neurological consequences occurring after a cardiac arrest. We show that DBS rescues memory deficits induced by GI and produces changes in synaptic activity in the hippocampus. Novel approaches to improve neurological outcomes after stroke are urgently needed; therefore, the present study highlights a possible role for DBS in the treatment of cognitive impairment associated with ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Endogenous Tagging Reveals Differential Regulation of Ca2+ Channels at Single Active Zones during Presynaptic Homeostatic Potentiation and Depression</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2416?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurons communicate through Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent neurotransmitter release at presynaptic active zones (AZs). Neurotransmitter release properties play a key role in defining information flow in circuits and are tuned during multiple forms of plasticity. Despite their central role in determining neurotransmitter release properties, little is known about how Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel levels are modulated to calibrate synaptic function. We used CRISPR to tag the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2 Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel Cacophony (Cac) and, in males in which all Cac channels are tagged, investigated the regulation of endogenous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels during homeostatic plasticity. We found that heterogeneously distributed Cac is highly predictive of neurotransmitter release probability at individual AZs and differentially regulated during opposing forms of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. Specifically, AZ Cac levels are increased during chronic and acute presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP), and live imaging during acute expression of PHP reveals proportional Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel accumulation across heterogeneous AZs. In contrast, endogenous Cac levels do not change during presynaptic homeostatic depression (PHD), implying that the reported reduction in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx during PHD is achieved through functional adaptions to pre-existing Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Thus, distinct mechanisms bidirectionally modulate presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels to maintain stable synaptic strength in response to diverse challenges, with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel abundance providing a rapidly tunable substrate for potentiating neurotransmitter release over both acute and chronic timescales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics play an important role in establishing neurotransmitter release properties. Presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx is modulated during multiple forms of homeostatic plasticity at &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junctions to stabilize synaptic communication. However, it remains unclear how this dynamic regulation is achieved. We used CRISPR gene editing to endogenously tag the sole &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel responsible for synchronized neurotransmitter release, and found that channel abundance is regulated during homeostatic potentiation, but not homeostatic depression. Through live imaging experiments during the adaptation to acute homeostatic challenge, we visualize the accumulation of endogenous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels at individual active zones within 10 min. We propose that differential regulation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels confers broad capacity for tuning neurotransmitter release properties to maintain neural communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Ciliopathy Gene Ftm/Rpgrip1l Controls Mouse Forebrain Patterning via Region-Specific Modulation of Hedgehog/Gli Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2398?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Primary cilia are essential for CNS development. In the mouse, they play a critical role in patterning the spinal cord and telencephalon via the regulation of Hedgehog/Gli signaling. However, despite the frequent disruption of this signaling pathway in human forebrain malformations, the role of primary cilia in forebrain morphogenesis has been little investigated outside the telencephalon. Here we studied development of the diencephalon, hypothalamus and eyes in mutant mice in which the &lt;i&gt;Ftm/Rpgrip1l&lt;/i&gt; ciliopathy gene is disrupted. At the end of gestation, &lt;i&gt;Ftm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; fetuses displayed anophthalmia, a reduction of the ventral hypothalamus and a disorganization of diencephalic nuclei and axonal tracts. In &lt;i&gt;Ftm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; embryos, we found that the ventral forebrain structures and the rostral thalamus were missing. Optic vesicles formed but lacked the optic cups. In &lt;i&gt;Ftm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; embryos, &lt;i&gt;Sonic hedgehog&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Shh&lt;/i&gt;) expression was virtually lost in the ventral forebrain but maintained in the zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI), the mid-diencephalic organizer. Gli activity was severely downregulated but not lost in the ventral forebrain and in regions adjacent to the &lt;i&gt;Shh&lt;/i&gt;-expressing ZLI. Reintroduction of the repressor form of Gli3 into the &lt;i&gt;Ftm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; background restored optic cup formation. Our data thus uncover a complex role of cilia in development of the diencephalon, hypothalamus and eyes via the region-specific control of the ratio of activator and repressor forms of the Gli transcription factors. They call for a closer examination of forebrain defects in severe ciliopathies and for a search for ciliopathy genes as modifiers in other human conditions with forebrain defects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is essential for proper forebrain development as illustrated by a human condition called holoprosencephaly. The Hh pathway relies on primary cilia, cellular organelles that receive and transduce extracellular signals and whose dysfunctions lead to rare inherited diseases called ciliopathies. To date, the role of cilia in the forebrain has been poorly studied outside the telencephalon. In this paper we study the role of the &lt;i&gt;Ftm/Rpgrip1l&lt;/i&gt; ciliopathy gene in mouse forebrain development. We uncover complex functions of primary cilia in forebrain morphogenesis through region-specific modulation of the Hh pathway. Our data call for further examination of forebrain defects in ciliopathies and for a search for ciliopathy genes as modifiers in human conditions affecting forebrain development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are pervasive neurodevelopmental conditions that often involve mutations affecting synaptic mechanisms. Recently, the involvement of cerebellum in ASDs has been suggested, but the underlying functional alterations remained obscure. We investigated single-neuron and microcircuit properties in IB2 (Islet Brain-2) KO mice of either sex. The IB2 gene (chr22q13.3 terminal region) deletion occurs in virtually all cases of Phelan–McDermid syndrome, causing autistic symptoms and a severe delay in motor skill acquisition. IB2 KO granule cells showed a larger NMDA receptor-mediated current and enhanced intrinsic excitability, raising the excitatory/inhibitory balance. Furthermore, the spatial organization of granular layer responses to mossy fibers shifted from a &quot;Mexican hat&quot; to a &quot;stovepipe hat&quot; profile, with stronger excitation in the core and weaker inhibition in the surround. Finally, the size and extension of long-term synaptic plasticity were remarkably increased. These results show for the first time that hyperexcitability and hyperplasticity disrupt signal transfer in the granular layer of IB2 KO mice, supporting cerebellar involvement in the pathogenesis of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This article shows for the first time a complex set of alterations in the cerebellum granular layer of a mouse model [IB2 (Islet Brain-2) KO] of autism spectrum disorders. The IB2 KO in mice mimics the deletion of the corresponding gene in the Phelan–McDermid syndrome in humans. The changes reported here are centered on NMDA receptor hyperactivity, hyperplasticity, and hyperexcitability. These, in turn, increase the excitatory/inhibitory balance and alter the shape of center/surround structures that emerge in the granular layer in response to mossy fiber activity. These results support recent theories suggesting the involvement of cerebellum in autism spectrum disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Lactate Mediates the Effects of Exercise on Learning and Memory through SIRT1-Dependent Activation of Hippocampal Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Exercise promotes learning and memory formation. These effects depend on increases in hippocampal BDNF, a growth factor associated with cognitive improvement and the alleviation of depression symptoms. Identifying molecules that are produced during exercise and that mediate hippocampal &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; expression will allow us to harness the therapeutic potential of exercise. Here, we report that an endogenous molecule produced during exercise in male mice induces the &lt;i&gt;Mus musculus Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; gene and promotes learning and memory formation. The metabolite lactate, which is released during exercise by the muscles, crosses the blood–brain barrier and induces &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; expression and TRKB signaling in the hippocampus. Indeed, we find that lactate-dependent increases in BDNF are associated with improved spatial learning and memory retention. The action of lactate is dependent on the activation of the Sirtuin1 deacetylase. SIRT1 increases the levels of the transcriptional coactivator PGC1a and the secreted molecule FNDC5, known to mediate &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; expression. These results reveal an endogenous mechanism to explain how physical exercise leads to the induction of BDNF, and identify lactate as a potential endogenous molecule that may have therapeutic value for CNS diseases in which BDNF signaling is disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is established that exercise promotes learning and memory formation and alleviates the symptoms of depression. These effects are mediated through inducing &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; expression and signaling in the hippocampus. Understanding how exercise induces &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; and identifying the molecules that mediate this induction will allow us to design therapeutic strategies that can mimic the effects of exercise on the brain, especially for patients with CNS disorders characterized by a decrease in &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; expression and who cannot exercise because of their conditions. We identify lactate as an endogenous metabolite that is produced during exercise, crosses the blood–brain barrier and promotes hippocampal dependent learning and memory in a BDNF-dependent manner. Our work identifies lactate as a component of the &quot;exercise pill.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Selectively Inhibiting the Median Preoptic Nucleus Attenuates Angiotensin II and Hyperosmotic-Induced Drinking Behavior and Vasopressin Release in Adult Male Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) is a putative integrative region that contributes to body fluid balance. Activation of the MnPO can influence thirst, but it is not clear how these responses are linked to body fluid homeostasis. We used designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to determine the role of the MnPO in drinking behavior and vasopressin release in response to peripheral angiotensin II (ANG II) or 3% hypertonic saline (3% HTN) in adult male Sprague Dawley rats (250–300 g). Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and stereotaxically injected with an inhibitory DREADD (rAAV5-CaMKIIa-hM4D(G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)-mCherry) or control (rAAV5-CaMKIIa-mCherry) virus in the MnPO. After two weeks’ recovery, a subset of rats was used for extracellular recordings to verify functional effects of ANG II or hyperosmotic challenges in MnPO slice preparations. Remaining rats were used in drinking behavior studies. Each rat was administered either 10 mg/kg of exogenous clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) to inhibit DREADD-expressing cells or vehicle intraperitoneal followed by a test treatment with either 2-mg/kg ANG II or 3% HTN (1 ml/100-g bw, s.c.), twice per week for two separate treatment weeks. CNO-induced inhibition during either test treatment significantly attenuated drinking responses compared to vehicle treatments and controls. Brain tissue processed for cFos immunohistochemistry showed decreased expression with CNO-induced inhibition during either test treatment in the MnPO and downstream nuclei compared to controls. CNO-mediated inhibition significantly attenuated treatment-induced increases in plasma vasopressin compared to controls. The results indicate inhibition of CaMKIIa-expressing MnPO neurons significantly reduces drinking and vasopressin release in response to ANG II or hyperosmotic challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Phase Coherent Currents Underlying Neocortical Seizure-Like State Transitions</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In the epileptic brain, phase amplitude cross-frequency coupling (CFC) features have been used to objectively classify seizure-related states, and the inter-seizure state has been demonstrated as being random, in contrast to the seizure state being predictable; however, the excitatory and inhibitory networks underlying their dynamics remain unclear. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to classify the dynamics of seizure sub-states labeling seizure-like event (SLE) onset and termination intervals using CFC features and to obtain their underlying excitatory/inhibitory cellular correlates. SLEs were induced in mouse neocortical brain slices using a low-magnesium perfusate, and were recorded in Layer II/III using simultaneous local field potential (LFP) and whole-cell voltage clamp electrodes. Classification of onset and termination of SLE transitions was investigated using CFC features in conjunction with an unsupervised two-state hidden Markov model (HMM). -Distributions of their durations indicated that both are predictable. Furthermore, omitting 4 Hz from the HMM classifier switched both SLE sub-states from statistically deterministic to random without changing the dynamics of the SLE state. These results were generalized to 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-induced SLEs and human seizure traces. Only during these sub-states, both excitatory and inhibitory currents coupled with the field. Where excitatory currents phase locked to a broad range of frequencies between 1 and 12 Hz, inhibitory currents dominantly phase locked at 4 Hz. We conclude that inhibition underlies the predictability of neocortical CFC-defined SLE transition sub-states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Extrafield Activity Shifts the Place Field Center of Mass to Encode Aversive Experience</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal place cells are known to have a key role in encoding spatial information. Aversive stimuli, such as predator odor, evoke place field remapping and a change in preferred firing locations. However, it remains unclear how place cells use positive or negative experiences to remap. We investigated whether CA1 place cells, recorded from behaving rats, remap randomly or whether their reconfiguration depends on the perceived location of the aversive stimulus. Exposure to trimethylthiazoline (TMT; an innately aversive odor), increased the amplitude of hippocampal β oscillations in the two arms of the maze in which TMT exposure occurred. We found that a population of place cells with fields located outside the TMT arms increased their activity (extrafield spiking) in the TMT arms during the aversive episodes. Moreover, in the subsequent post-TMT recording, these cells exhibited a significant shift in their center of mass (COM) towards the TMT arms. The induction of extrafield plasticity was mediated by the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). Photostimulation of the BLA triggered aversive behavior, synchronized hippocampal local field oscillations, and increased the extrafield spiking of the hippocampal place cells for the first 100 ms after light delivery. Optogenetic BLA activation triggered an increase in extrafield spiking activity that was correlated with the degree of place field plasticity. Furthermore, BLA-mediated increase of the extrafield activity predicts the degree of subsequent field plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that that the remapping of hippocampal place cells during aversive episodes is not random but it depends on the location of the aversive stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Echoes of Emotions Past: How Neuromodulators Determine What We Recollect</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;We tend to re-live emotional experiences more richly in memory than more mundane experiences. According to one recent neurocognitive model of emotional memory, negative events may be encoded with a larger amount of sensory information than neutral and positive events. As a result, there may be more perceptual information available to reconstruct these events at retrieval, leading to memory reinstatement patterns that correspond with greater memory vividness and sense of recollection for negative events. In this commentary, we offer an alternative perspective on how emotion may influence such sensory cortex reinstatement that focuses on engagement of the noradrenergic (NE) and dopaminergic (DA) systems rather than valence. Specifically, we propose that arousal-related locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system activation promotes the prioritization of the most salient features of an emotional experience in memory. Thus, a select few details may drive lower-level sensory cortical activity and a stronger sense of recollection for arousing events. By contrast, states of high behavioral activation, including novelty-seeking and exploration, may recruit the DA system to broaden the scope of cognitive processing and integrate multiple event aspects in memory. These more integrated memory representations may be reflected in higher-order cortical reinstatement at retrieval. Thus, the balance between activation in these neuromodulatory systems at encoding, rather than the valence of the event, may ultimately determine the quality of emotional memory recollection and neural reinstatement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence from Alzheimer disease supports a potentially beneficial role of slow‐wave sleep in neurodegeneration. However, the importance of slow‐wave sleep in Parkinson disease is unknown. In 129 patients with Parkinson disease, we retrospectively tested whether sleep slow waves, objectively quantified with polysomnography, relate to longitudinal changes in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores. We found that higher accumulated power of sleep slow waves was associated with slower motor progression, particularly of axial motor symptoms, over a mean time of 4.6 ± 2.3 years. This preliminary finding suggests that deeper sleep relates to slower motor progression in Parkinson disease. Ann Neurol 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Neuronal apolipoprotein E4 increases cell death and phosphorylated tau release in alzheimer disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25455?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25455?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apolipoprotein E (&lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;) E4 isoform is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD). Although &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; is predominantly expressed by astrocytes in the central nervous system, neuronal expression of &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; is of increasing interest in age‐related cognitive impairment, neurological injury, and neurodegeneration. Here, we show that endogenous expression of E4 in stem‐cell–derived neurons predisposes them to injury and promotes the release of phosphorylated tau.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Induced pluripotent stem cells from 2 unrelated AD patients carrying the E4 allele were corrected to the E3/E3 genotype with the CRISPR/Cas9 system and differentiated into pure cultures of forebrain excitatory neurons without contamination from other cells types.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to unedited E4 neurons, E3 neurons were less susceptible to ionomycin‐induced cytotoxicity. Biochemically, E4 cells exhibited increased tau phosphorylation and ERK1/2 phosphoactivation. Moreover, E4 neurons released increased amounts of phosphorylated tau extracellularly in an isoform‐dependent manner by a heparin sulfate proteoglycan–dependent mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate that endogenous expression of E4 by stem‐cell–derived forebrain excitatory neurons predisposes neurons to calcium dysregulation and ultimately cell death. This change is associated with increased cellular tau phosphorylation and markedly enhanced release of phosphorylated tau. Importantly, these effects are independent of glial APOE. These findings suggest that E4 accelerates spreading of tau pathology and neuron death in part by neuron‐specific, glia‐independent mechanisms. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Seeding Variability of Different Alpha Synuclein Strains in Synucleinopathies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25446?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25446?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the exact reasons why different α‐synucleinopathies exhibit variable pathologies and phenotypes are still unknown. A potential explanation may be the existence of distinctive α‐synuclein conformers or strains. Here, we intend to analyze the seeding activity of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD) brain‐derived α‐synuclein seeds by real‐time quaking‐induced conversion (RT‐QuIC) and to investigate the structure and morphology of the α‐synuclein aggregates generated by RT‐QuIC.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A misfolded α‐synuclein–enriched brain fraction from frontal cortex and substantia nigra pars compacta tissue, isolated by several filtration and centrifugation steps, was subjected to α‐synuclein/RT‐QuIC analysis. Our study included neuropathologically well‐characterized cases with DLB, PD, and controls (Ctrl). Biochemical and morphological analyses of RT‐QuIC products were conducted by western blot, dot blot analysis, Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independently from the brain region, we observed different seeding kinetics of α‐synuclein in the RT‐QuIC in patients with DLB compared to PD and Ctrl. Biochemical characterization of the RT‐QuIC product indicated the generation of a proteinase K–resistant and fibrillary α‐synuclein species in DLB‐seeded reactions, whereas PD and control seeds failed in the conversion of wild‐type α‐synuclein substrate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural variances of α‐synuclein seeding kinetics and products in DLB and PD indicated, for the first time, the existence of different α‐synuclein strains in these groups. Therefore, our study contributes to a better understanding of the clinical heterogeneity among α‐synucleinopathies, offers an opportunity for a specific diagnosis, and opens new avenues for the future development of strain‐specific therapies.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The role of physiological complexity changes in resting-state EEG in clinical effectiveness of rTMS and tDCS in treatments of resistant depression. (arXiv:1903.10626v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The present literature about possible mechanisms behind the effectivity of
noninvasive electromagnetic stimulation in major depressive disorder (MDD) is
not very rich. Despite extensive research in applications for clinical
practice, the exact effects are yet not clear. We are comparing our previous
results about the complexity changes induced by repetitive Transcranial
Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
which are known to modulate neural dynamics. Also, we are reviewing different
biomarkers of complexity changes connected to depression, and how they change
with the stimulation. TDCS is low-intensity TES, known to have polarity
specific effects (neuromodulatory effects), and rTMS is inducing an electric
field in the tissue circumstantially via Faraday's law. Both nonlinear
modalities of electromagnetic stimulation may affect the levels of
physiological complexity in the brain. We also compare the changes of
complexity in electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG), as

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Robustness of Griffiths effects in homeostatic connectome models. (arXiv:1812.06259v2 [cond-mat.dis-nn] CROSS LISTED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06259</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I provide numerical evidence for the robustness of the Griffiths phase (GP)
reported previously in dynamical threshold model simulations on a large human
brain network with N=836733 connected nodes. The model, with equalized network
sensitivity, is extended in two ways: introduction of refractory states or by
randomized time dependent thresholds. The non-universal power-law dynamics in
an extended control parameter region survives these modifications for a short
refractory state and weak disorder. In case of temporal disorder the GP shrinks
and for stronger heterogeneity disappears, leaving behind a mean-field type of
critical transition. Activity avalanche size distributions below the critical
point decay faster than in the original model, but the addition of inhibitory
interactions sets it back to the range of experimental values.

	<description>Representing the dynamic nature of biological processes is a challenge. This article describes a collaborative project in which the authors – a philosopher of biology, an artist and a cell biologist – explore how best to represent the entire process of cell division in one connected image. This involved a series of group Drawing Labs, one-to-one sessions, and discussions between the authors. The drawings generated during the collaboration were then reviewed by four experts in cell division. We propose that such an approach has value, both in communicating the dynamic nature of biological processes and in generating new insights and hypotheses that can be tested by artists and scientists.</description>

	<description>Immune activated T lymphocytes modulate the activity of key metabolic pathways to support the transcriptional reprograming and reshaping of cell proteomes that permits effector T cell differentiation. The present study uses high resolution mass spectrometry and metabolic labelling to explore how murine T cells control the methionine cycle to produce methyl donors for protein and nucleotide methylations. We show that antigen receptor engagement controls flux through the methionine cycle and RNA and histone methylations. We establish that the main rate limiting step for protein synthesis and the methionine cycle is control of methionine transporter expression. Only T cells that respond to antigen to upregulate and sustain methionine transport are supplied with methyl donors that permit the dynamic nucleotide methylations and epigenetic reprogramming that drives T cell differentiation. These data highlight how the regulation of methionine transport licenses use of methionine for multiple fundamental processes that drive T lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Decoupling sensory from decisional choice biases in perceptual decision making</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43994</link>
	<description>The contribution of sensory and decisional processes to perceptual decision making is still unclear, even in simple perceptual tasks. When decision makers need to select an action from a set of balanced alternatives, any tendency to choose one alternative more often—choice bias—is consistent with a bias in the sensory evidence, but also with a preference to select that alternative independently of the sensory evidence. To decouple sensory from decisional biases, here we asked humans to perform a simple perceptual discrimination task with two symmetric alternatives under two different task instructions. The instructions varied the response mapping between perception and the category of the alternatives. We found that from 32 participants, 30 exhibited sensory biases and 15 decisional biases. The decisional biases were consistent with a criterion change in a simple signal detection theory model. Perceptual decision making, thus, even in simple scenarios, is affected by sensory and decisional choice biases.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Discrete and Continuous Cell Identities of the Adult Murine Striatum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/591396v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/591396v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The striatum is a large brain region containing two major cell types: D1 (dopamine receptor 1) and D2 (dopamine receptor 2) expressing spiny projection neurons (SPNs). We generated a cell type atlas of the adult murine striatum using single-cell RNA-seq of SPNs combined with quantitative RNA in situ hybridization (ISH). We developed a novel computational pipeline that distinguishes discrete versus continuous cell identities in scRNA-seq data, and used it to show that SPNs in the striatum can be classified into four discrete types that reside in discrete anatomical clusters or are spatially intermingled. Within each discrete type, we find multiple independent axes of continuous cell identity that map to spatial gradients and whose genes are conserved between discrete types. These gradients correlate well to previously-mapped gradients of connectivity. Using these insights, we discovered multiple novel spatially localized region of the striatum, one of which contains patch-D2 SPNs that express Tac1, Htr7, and Th. Intriguingly, we found one subtype that strongly co-expresses both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors, and uniquely expresses a rare D2 receptor splice variant. These results collectively suggest an organizational principal of neuron identity in which major neuron types can be separated into discrete classes with little overlap and no implied spatial relationship. However these discrete classes are then continuously subdivided by multiple spatial gradients of expression defining anatomical location via a combinatorial mechanism. Finally, they suggest that neuronal circuitry has a substructure at far higher resolution than is typically interrogated which is defined by the precise identity and location of a neuron.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A systematic evaluation of neural morphology representations forcell type discrimination</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/591370v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/591370v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The anatomy of a neuron has always been a defining feature of its cell type and quantitative analysis of neuronal morphologies usually begins with choosing a particular feature representation in order to make individual morphologies amenable to standard statistical tools. Many different feature representations have been suggested in the literature, ranging from density maps to intersection profiles, but they have never been compared side by side. Here we performed a systematic comparison of various representations, measuring how well they were able to capture the difference between known morphological cell types. For our benchmarking, we used several curated data sets consisting of mouse retinal bipolar cells and cortical inhibitory neurons. We found that the best performing feature representations were two-dimensional density maps and a small set of morphometric statistics which continued to perform well even when neurons were only partially traced. Combining both representations increased their performance further, suggesting that they captured some complementary information about the cell anatomy. The same combined representation performed well in an unsupervised setting, implying that it can be suitable for dimensionality reduction or clustering. Our study provides a thorough quantitative benchmark of morphology representations which forms the basis for the design and evaluation of morphological descriptors in future studies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Mammillothalamic disconnection alters hippocampo-cortical oscillatory activity and microstructure: Implications for diencephalic amnesia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/590901v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/590901v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Diencephalic amnesia can be as disruptive as the more commonly known temporal lobe amnesia, yet the precise contribution of diencephalic structures to memory processes remains elusive. We used discrete lesions of the mammillothalamic tract to model aspects of diencephalic amnesia and assessed the impact of these lesions on multiple measures of activity and plasticity within the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex. Lesions of the mammillothalamic tract had widespread indirect effects on hippocampo-cortical oscillatory activity within both theta and gamma bands. Both within-region oscillatory activity and cross-regional synchrony were altered. The network changes were state-dependent, displaying different profiles during locomotion and paradoxical sleep. Consistent with the associations between oscillatory activity and plasticity, complementary analyses using several convergent approaches revealed microstructural changes, which appeared to reflect a suppression of learning-induced plasticity in lesioned animals. Together, these combined findings suggest a mechanism by which damage to the medial diencephalon can impact upon learning and memory processes, highlighting important role for the mammillary bodies in the co-ordination of hippocampo-cortical activity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Quantitative assessment of anti-gravity reflexes to evaluate vestibular dysfunction in rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/590257v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/590257v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The tail-lift reflex and the air-righting reflex are anti-gravity reflexes in rats that depend on vestibular function. To obtain objective and quantitative measures of performance, we recorded these reflexes with slow motion video in two experiments. In the first experiment, vestibular dysfunction was elicited by acute exposure to 0 (control), 400, 600 or 1000 mg/kg of 3,3'-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN), which causes dose-dependent hair cell degeneration. In the second, rats were exposed to sub-chronic IDPN in the drinking water for 0 (control), 4 or 8 weeks; this causes reversible or irreversible loss of vestibular function depending on exposure time. In the tail-lift test, we obtained the minimum angle defined during the lift and descent maneuver by the nose, the back of the neck and the base of the tail. In the air-righting test, we obtained the time to right the head. We also obtained Vestibular Dysfunction Ratings (VDRs) using a previously validated behavioral test battery. Each measure, VDR, tail-lift angle and air-righting time, demonstrated dose-dependent loss of vestibular function after acute IDPN, and time-dependent loss of vestibular function after sub-chronic IDPN. All measures showed high correlations between each other, and maximal correlation coefficients were found between VDRs and tail-lift angles. In scanning electron microscopy evaluation of the vestibular sensory epithelia, the utricle and the saccule showed diverse pathological outcomes, suggesting that they have a different role in these reflexes. We conclude that these anti-gravity reflexes provide useful objective and quantitative measures of vestibular function in rats that are open to further development.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Expression and distribution of Trophoblast Glycoprotein in the mouse retina</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/590216v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/590216v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>We recently identified the leucine-rich repeat adhesion protein, trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG), as a novel PKC-dependent phosphoprotein in retinal rod bipolar cells (RBCs). Since TPBG has not been thoroughly examined in the retina, this study characterizes the localization and expression patterns of TPBG in the developing and adult mouse retina using two antibodies, one against the N-terminal, leucine-rich domain and the other against the C-terminal PDZ- interacting motif. Both antibodies labeled dendrites and synaptic terminals of RBCs, as well as the cell bodies and dendrites of an uncharacterized class of amacrine cell. In transfected HEK293 cells, TPBG was localized to the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes and was associated with the tips of thin filopodia-like membrane projections. TPBG immunofluorescence in RBCs detected with the C-terminal antibody was strongly dependent on the activity state of the adult retina, with less labeling in dark-adapted compared to light-adapted retina, and less labeling in light-adapted PKC knockout and TRPM1 knockout retinas compared to wild type, despite no change in total TPBG detected by immunoblotting. These results suggest that the C-terminal epitope is blocked in the dark-adapted and knockout retinas compared to light-adapted wild type retinas, possibly through interaction with a PDZ domain protein. During development, TPBG expression increases dramatically just prior to eye opening with a time course closely correlated with that of TRPM1 expression. In the retina, leucine-rich repeat proteins like TPBG have been implicated in the development and maintenance of functional bipolar cell synapses, and TPBG may play a similar role in RBCs.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Properties of individual hippocampal synapses influencing NMDA-receptor activation by spontaneous neurotransmission.</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/590141v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/590141v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation is critical for maintenance and modification of synapse strength. Specifically, NMDAR activation by spontaneous glutamate release has been shown to mediate forms of synaptic plasticity as well as synaptic development. Interestingly, there is evidence that within individual synapses each release mode may be segregated such that postsynaptically there are distinct pools of responsive receptors. In order to examine potential regulators of NMDAR activation due to spontaneous glutamate release in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, we utilized GCaMP6f imaging at single synapses in concert with confocal and super-resolution imaging. Using these single spine approaches, we found that Ca2+ entry activated by spontaneous release tends to be carried by GluN2B-NMDARs. Additionally, the amount of NMDAR activation varies greatly both between synapses and within synapses, and is unrelated to spine and synapse size, but does correlate loosely with synapse distance from the soma. Despite the critical role of spontaneous activation of NMDARs in maintaining synaptic function, their activation seems to be controlled factors other than synapse size or synapse distance from the soma. It is most likely that NMDAR activation by spontaneous release influenced variability in subsynaptic receptor position, release site position, vesicle content, and channel properties. Therefore, spontaneous activation of NMDARs appears to be regulated distinctly from other receptor types, notably AMPARs, within individual synapses.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Contribution of PSD-95 protein to reward location memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/590109v1?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/590109v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>The molecular mechanisms involved in formation of memory are still poorly understood. We focus here on the function of post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and its phosphorylation by CaMKII in spontaneous learning about reward location in female mice. We show that formation of reward location memory leads to downregulation of PSD-95 protein in dendritic spines of the stratum radiatum, area CA1, and selective shrinkage of dendritic spines that contain PSD-95. ShRNA-driven, long-term downregulation of PSD-95 in the area CA1 decreases precision of memory. Autophosphorylation deficient CaMKII mutant mice (CaMKII:T286A) need more time than wild-type animals to learn the location of reward. The same impairment is observed after CA1-targeted overexpression of CaMKII phosphorylation-deficient form of PSD-95 (PSD-95:S73A). In contrast to young adult mice, in aged animals reward location learning affects only spines that lack PSD-95. The frequency and size of the spines without PSD-95 are increased, while shRNA targeted to PSD-95 affects neither speed of learning nor precision of memory indicating alternative mechanisms to support successful memory formation in old mice. Altogether, our data suggest that dynamic regulation of PSD-95 expression is a mechanism that accelerates learning and improves precision of reward location memory in young mice. The function of PSD-95 in memory processes changes in aged animals.</description>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/589978v1?rss=1</link>
	<description>Cross-frequency coupling of sleep oscillations is thought to mediate memory consolidation. While the hippocampus is deemed central to this process, detailed knowledge of which oscillatory rhythms interact in the human hippocampus is lacking. Combining intracranial hippocampal and non-invasive electroencephalography from twelve neurosurgical patients, we characterized spectral power and coupling during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Hippocampal coupling was extensive, with the majority of channels expressing spectral interactions. NREM consistently showed delta-ripple coupling, but ripples were also modulated by slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles. SO-delta and SO-theta coupling, as well as interactions between delta/theta and spindle/beta frequencies also occurred. During REM, limited interactions between delta/theta and beta frequencies emerged. Moreover, oscillatory organization differed substantially between i) hippocampus and scalp, ii) sites along the anterior-posterior hippocampal axis, and iii) individuals. Overall, these results extend and refine our understanding of hippocampal sleep oscillations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Automated quantification of synaptic boutons reveals their 3D distribution in the insect mushroom body</title>

	<description>Synaptic boutons are highly plastic structures undergoing experience-dependent changes in their number, volume, and shape. Their plasticity has been intensively studied in the insect mushroom bodies by counting manually the number of boutons within small regions of interest and extrapolating this number to the volume of the mushroom body neuropil. Here we extend the analysis of synaptic bouton distributions within the mushroom body neuropil of honey bees (Apis mellifera) beyond sampling small volumes. This study, based on large 3D two-photon imaging combined with advanced image post-processing and multiple thresholds segmentation, suggests that previously reported results overestimated the number of synaptic boutons significantly. As a reason for that, we identified boundaries effects in the small volume samples. The application of the automated analysis to large volumes of the mushroom body neuropil revealed a corrected average density of synaptic boutons and, for the first time, their 3D spatial distribution. This distribution exhibited a considerable heterogeneity. This additional information on synaptic bouton distribution provides new dimensions to future studies on brain development, symmetry, and plasticity.</description>

	<description>Early parenthood results in changes in cortical thickness in regions related to parental care. However, the enduring effects of this period on the structure of the human brain, and cognition in late-life, is unknown. In an elderly sample, we examined the relationship between the number of children parented (here, 1-6 children) and cortical thickness in 267 males (74.0{+/-}3.5 years) and 231 females (73.8{+/-}3.5 years). We also compared cognition and cortical thickness between parents of one child and non-parents, in n=36 males (73.4{+/-}3.7 years), and n=46 females (72.8{+/-}3.3 years). We obtained a positive relationship between number of children parented and verbal memory performance, showing increasing memory performance with number of children. For mothers, number of children positively correlated with cortical thickness in the parahippocampal gyrus and negatively correlated with regions of the visual cortex. Mothers of one child showed thinner cortical thickness in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and visual cortex compared with childless women. Fathers of one child showed thinner cortical thickness in the anterior cingulate cortex and thicker cortical thickness in the temporal pole compared with childless men. Our results are the first to reveal distributed differences in cortical thickness related to parenthood that are evident beyond the post-partum period. Our findings overlap substantially with the areas found to be altered across pregnancy and the postpartum period, suggesting that neural changes associated with early parenthood persist into older age, and are potentially cognitively beneficial.</description>

	<description>To form the most reliable percept of the environment, the brain needs to represent sensory uncertainty. Current theories of perceptual inference assume that the brain computes sensory uncertainty instantaneously and independently for each stimulus. In a series of psychophysics experiments human observers localized auditory signals that were presented in synchrony with spatially disparate visual signals. Critically, the visual noise changed dynamically over time with or without intermittent jumps. Our results show that observers integrate audiovisual inputs weighted by sensory reliability estimates that combine information from past and current signals as predicted by an optimal Bayesian learner or approximate strategies of exponential discounting. Our results challenge classical models of perceptual inference where sensory uncertainty estimates depend only on the current stimulus. They demonstrate that the brain capitalizes on the temporal dynamics of the external world and estimates sensory uncertainty by combining past experiences with new incoming sensory signals.</description>

	<description>Scientists and engineers have created computations and made measurements that characterize the first steps of seeing. ISETBio software integrates such computations and data into an open-source software package. The initial ISETBio implementations modeled image formation (physiological optics) for planar or distant scenes. The ISET3d software described here extends that implementation, simulating image formation for three-dimensional scenes. The software system relies on a quantitative computer graphics program that ray traces the scene radiance through the physiological optics to the retinal irradiance. We describe and validate the implementation for several model eyes. Then, we use the software to quantify the impact of several physiological optics parameters on three-dimensional image formation. ISET3d is integrated with ISETBio, making it straightforward to convert the retinal irradiance into cone excitations. These methods help the user compute the predictions of optics models for a wide range of spatially-rich three-dimensional scenes. They can also be used to evaluate the impact of nearby visual occlusion, the information available to binocular vision, or the retinal images expected from near-field and augmented reality displays.</description>

	<description>Adjusting to a wide range of light intensities is an essential feature of retinal rod bipolar cell (RBC) function. While persuasive evidence suggests this modulation involves phosphorylation by protein kinase C-alpha (PKC), the targets of PKC phosphorylation in the retina have not been identified. PKCactivity and phosphorylation in RBCs was examined by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy using a conformation-specific PKC antibody and antibodies to phosphorylated PKC motifs. PKC activity was dependent on light and expression of TRPM1, and RBC dendrites were the primary sites of light-dependent phosphorylation. PKC-dependent retinal phosphoproteins were identified using a phosphoproteomics approach to compare total protein and phosphopeptide abundance between phorbol ester-treated wild type and PKC knockout (PKC-KO) mouse retinas. Phosphopeptide mass spectrometry identified over 1100 phosphopeptides in mouse retina, with 12 displaying significantly greater phosphorylation in WT compared to PKC-KO samples. The differentially phosphorylated proteins fall into the following functional groups: cytoskeleton/trafficking (4 proteins), ECM/adhesion (2 proteins), signaling (2 proteins), transcriptional regulation (3 proteins), and homeostasis/metabolism (1 protein). Two strongly differentially expressed phosphoproteins, BORG4 and TPBG, were localized to the synaptic layers of the retina, and may play a role in PKC-dependent modulation of RBC physiology. Upon publication, data will be available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD012906.</description>

	<description>We provide the first measures of foveal cone density as a function of axial length in living eyes and discuss the physical and visual implications of our findings. We used a new generation Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to image cones at and near the fovea in 28 eyes of 16 subjects. Cone density and other metrics were computed in units of visual angle and linear retinal units. The foveal cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fovea, but not in proportion to eye length. Despite retinal stretching (decrease in cones/mm2), myopes generally have a higher angular sampling density (increase in cones/deg2) in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes, offering the potential for better visual acuity. Reports of deficits in best-corrected foveal vision in myopes compared to emmetropes cannot be explained by increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during myopic progression.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: From acoustic to linguistic analysis of temporal speech structure: acousto-linguistic transformation during speech perception using speech quilts.</title>

	<description>Speech perception entails the mapping of the acoustic waveform to linguistic representations. For this mapping to succeed, the speech signal needs to be tracked over various temporal windows at high temporal precision in order to decode linguistic units ranging from phonemes (tens of milliseconds) to sentences (seconds). Here, we tested the hypothesis that cortical processing of speech-specific temporal structure is modulated by higher-level linguistic analysis. Using fMRI, we measured BOLD signal changes to 4-s long speech quilts with variable temporal structure (30, 120, 480, 960 ms segment lengths), as well as natural speech, created from a familiar (English) or foreign (Korean) language. We found evidence for the acoustic analysis of temporal speech properties in superior temporal sulcus (STS): the BOLD signal increased as a function of temporal speech structure in both familiar and foreign languages. However, activity in left inferior gyrus (IFG) revealed evidence for linguistic processing of temporal speech properties: the BOLD signal increased as a function of temporal speech structure only in familiar, but not in foreign speech. Network analyses suggested that left IFG modulates processing of speech-specific temporal structure in primary auditory cortex, which in turn sensitizes processing of speech-specific temporal structure in STS. The results thus reveal a network for acousto-linguistic transformation consisting of primary and non-primary auditory cortex, STS, and left IFG.</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Inverted Encoding Models Reconstruct an Arbitrary Model Response, Not the Stimulus</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Probing how large populations of neurons represent stimuli is key to understanding sensory representations as many stimulus characteristics can only be discerned from population activity and not from individual single-units. Recently, inverted encoding models have been used to produce channel response functions from large spatial-scale measurements of human brain activity that are reminiscent of single-unit tuning functions and have been proposed to assay &quot;population-level stimulus representations&quot; (Sprague et al., 2018a). However, these channel response functions do not assay population tuning. We show by derivation that the channel response function is only determined up to an invertible linear transform. Thus, these channel response functions are arbitrary, one of an infinite family and therefore not a unique description of population representation. Indeed, simulations demonstrate that bimodal, even random, channel basis functions can account perfectly well for population responses without any underlying neural response units that are so tuned. However, the approach can be salvaged by extending it to reconstruct the stimulus, not the assumed model. We show that when this is done, even using bimodal and random channel basis functions, a unimodal function peaking at the appropriate value of the stimulus is recovered which can be interpreted as a measure of population selectivity. More precisely, the recovered function signifies how likely any value of the stimulus is, given the observed population response. Whether an analysis is recovering the hypothetical responses of an arbitrary model rather than assessing the selectivity of population representations is not an issue unique to the inverted encoding model and human neuroscience, but a general problem that must be confronted as more complex analyses intervene between measurement of population activity and presentation of data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Plasticity of NMDA Receptors at Ventral Hippocampal Synapses in the Infralimbic Cortex Regulates Cued Fear</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0354-18.2019?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) processes contextual information from the hippocampus to generate appropriate fear responses. In rodents, one path for sending contextual information to the mPFC is via the direct projections from the ventral hippocampus (vHC) to the infralimbic cortex (IL). Plasticity in the synaptic communication from the vHC to the IL could contribute to the behavioral changes produced by the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear. To examine this possibility, we used optogenetic stimulation of vHC synapses in brain slices from trained rats. We found that fear acquisition reduced NMDA receptor (NMDAR) currents at vHC synapses onto IL pyramidal neurons. The depression of NMDAR currents reversed more efficiently after extinction in the conditioning context than extinction in a novel context. Moreover, a cohort of animals that exhibited poor extinction retrieval failed to reverse the plasticity induced by fear conditioning. In addition, ex vivo application of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is known to simulate extinction in IL, reversed this conditioning-induced plasticity mimicking extinction. Therefore, we have identified a novel mechanism that modulates conditioned fear via changes in NMDAR current at vHC synapses onto IL pyramidal neurons. Disruption of this mechanism could contribute to the abnormal contextual modulation of fear seen in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Multisensory effects are found when the input from single senses combines, and this has been well researched in the brain. Presently, we examined in humans the potential impact of visuo-proprioceptive interactions at the peripheral level, using microneurography, and compared it with a similar behavioral task. We used a paradigm where participants had either proprioceptive information only (no vision) or combined visual and proprioceptive signals (vision). We moved the foot to measure changes in the sensitivity of single muscle afferents, which can be altered by the descending fusimotor drive. Visual information interacted with proprioceptive information, where we found that for the same passive movement, the response of muscle afferents increased when the proprioceptive channel was the only source of information, as compared with when visual cues were added, regardless of the attentional level. Behaviorally, when participants looked at their foot moving, they more accurately judged differences between movement amplitudes, than in the absence of visual cues. These results impact our understanding of multisensory interactions throughout the nervous system, where the information from different senses can modify the sensitivity of peripheral receptors. This has clinical implications, where future strategies may modulate such visual signals during sensorimotor rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Creating three-dimensional (3D) representations of the world from two-dimensional retinal images is fundamental to visually guided behaviors including reaching and grasping. A critical component of this process is determining the 3D orientation of objects. Previous studies have shown that neurons in the caudal intraparietal area (CIP) of the macaque monkey represent 3D planar surface orientation (i.e., slant and tilt). Here we compare the responses of neurons in areas V3A (which is implicated in 3D visual processing and precedes CIP in the visual hierarchy) and CIP to 3D-oriented planar surfaces. We then examine whether activity in these areas correlates with perception during a fine slant discrimination task in which the monkeys report if the top of a surface is slanted toward or away from them. Although we find that V3A and CIP neurons show similar sensitivity to planar surface orientation, significant choice-related activity during the slant discrimination task is rare in V3A but prominent in CIP. These results implicate both V3A and CIP in the representation of 3D surface orientation, and suggest a functional dissociation between the areas based on slant-related choice signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Here we report the identification of...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/8remeS8GBnY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>There has been much interest in how the hippocampus codes time in support of episodic memory.

	<description>Memory is stored in neural networks via changes in synaptic strength mediated in part by NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). Here we show that a cholecystokinin (CCK)-B receptor (CCKBR) antagonist blocks high-frequency stimulation-induced neocortical LTP, whereas local infusion of CCK induces LTP. CCK−/− mice lacked neocortical LTP and showed...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/LT8KiUj4GQo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25450?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the safety, putaminal coverage, and enzyme expression of adeno‐associated viral vector serotype‐2 encoding the complementary DNA for the enzyme, aromatic L‐amino acid decarboxylase (VY‐AADC01), delivered using novel intraoperative monitoring to optimize delivery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen subjects (three cohorts of 5) with moderately advanced Parkinson's disease and medically refractory motor fluctuations received VY‐AADC01 bilaterally coadministered with gadoteridol to the putamen using intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance to visualize the anatomic spread of the infusate and calculate coverage. Cohort 1 received 8.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;vg/ml and ≤450 μl per putamen (total dose, ≤7.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;vg); cohort 2 received the same concentration (8.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;vg/ml) and ≤900 μl per putamen (total dose, ≤1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;vg); and cohort 3 received 2.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;vg/ml and ≤900 μl per putamen (total dose, ≤4.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;vg). (18)F‐fluoro‐L‐dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography (PET) at baseline and 6 months postprocedure assessed enzyme activity; standard assessments measured clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRI‐guided administration of ascending VY‐AADC01 doses resulted in putaminal coverage of 21% (cohort 1), 34% (cohort 2), and 42% (cohort 3). Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 showed corresponding increases in enzyme activity assessed by PET of 13%, 56%, and 79%, and reductions in antiparkinsonian medication of –15%, –33%, and –42%, respectively, at 6 months. At 12 months, there were dose‐related improvements in clinical outcomes, including increases in patient‐reported ON‐time without troublesome dyskinesia (1.6, 3.3, and 1.5 hours, respectively) and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel intraoperative monitoring of administration facilitated targeted delivery of VY‐AADC01 in this phase 1 study, which was well tolerated. Increases in enzyme expression and clinical improvements were dose dependent.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The functional role of cue-driven feature-based feedback in object recognition. (arXiv:1903.10446v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual object recognition is not a trivial task, especially when the objects
are degraded or surrounded by clutter or presented briefly. External cues (such
as verbal cues or visual context) can boost recognition performance in such
conditions. In this work, we build an artificial neural network to model the
interaction between the object processing stream (OPS) and the cue. We study
the effects of varying neural and representational capacities of the OPS on the
performance boost provided by cue-driven feature-based feedback in the OPS. We
observe that the feedback provides performance boosts only if the
category-specific features about the objects cannot be fully represented in the
OPS. This representational limit is more dependent on task demands than neural
capacity. We also observe that the feedback scheme trained to maximise
recognition performance boost is not the same as tuning-based feedback, and
actually performs better than tuning-based feedback.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Comparative study of training intensity in neurofeedback. (arXiv:1903.10425v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurofeedback has proved to be useful in many instances. This technique is
often used to address both medical issues and performance improvement. Despite
the wide range of applications, no consensus has been reached about the optimal
training schedule.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, a practical experiment was conducted aiming to compare the
effects of intensive and sparse training modalities of enhancement of the
individual upper alpha band at Fz, for working memory improvement, in 19
healthy subjects. The INTENSIVE group was submitted to 4 sessions of 37.5
minutes each, during consecutive days, while the SPARSE group performed 15
sessions of 25 minutes along approximately 2 months.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intensive modality proved to be significantly more effective in
increasing the target frequency at Fz within session. However, no significant
differences were found across sessions neither regarding cognitive
improvements. The distinction between learners and non-learners led to
significant results for the two groups across sessions, but only the learners
of the INTENSIVE group show significant changes within session. Besides, for
this subsample the effects in the INTENSIVE group are significantly stronger
both within and across sessions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that longer sessions with shorter trials and more breaks
could be advantageous when training healthy subjects. Although further
investigation is needed to establish if one modality outperforms the other,
better outcomes might be obtained if each session consists in many short trials
(in this case 30 seconds) and is performed on consecutive days.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human brains are arguably the most complex entities known. Composed of
billions of neurons, connected via a highly detailed structure where the
underlying method by which functionality occurs is still debated. Here we
consider one theory for neural coding, synchronization coding, which gives rise
to the highest possible number of discrete states that a brain could exist in.
A strict upper bound on the number of these states is determined. We conclude
that the theoretical upper limit on the capacity of one human brain is almost
inconceivably large and massively larger than the corresponding theoretical
limit that could be obtained using every transistor ever built.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10327</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The output signal is examined for the Jacobi neuronal model which is
characterized by input-dependent multiplicative noise. The dependence of the
noise on the rate of inhibition turns out to be of primary importance to
observe maxima both in the output firing rate and in the diffusion coefficient
of the spike count and, simultaneously, a minimum in the coefficient of
variation (Fano factor). Moreover, we observe that an increment of the rate of
inhibition can increase the degree of coherence computed from the power
spectrum. This means that inhibition can enhance the coherence and thus the
information transmission between the input and the output in this neuronal
model. Finally, we stress that the firing rate, the coefficient of variation
and the diffusion coefficient of the spike count cannot be used as the only
indicator of coherence resonance without considering the power spectrum.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The last decades saw dramatic progress in brain research. These advances were
often buttressed by probing single variables to make circumscribed discoveries,
typically through null hypothesis significance testing. New ways for generating
massive data fueled tension between the traditional methodology, used to infer
statistically relevant effects in carefully-chosen variables, and
pattern-learning algorithms, used to identify predictive signatures by
searching through abundant information. In this article, we detail the
antagonistic philosophies behind two quantitative approaches: certifying robust
effects in understandable variables, and evaluating how accurately a built
model can forecast future outcomes. We discourage choosing analysis tools via
categories like 'statistics' or 'machine learning'. Rather, to establish
reproducible knowledge about the brain, we advocate prioritizing tools in view
of the core motivation of each quantitative analysis: aiming towards
mechanistic insight, or optimizing predictive accuracy.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10131</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Decision-making in dynamic environments typically requires adaptive evidence
accumulation that weights new evidence more heavily than old observations.
Recent experimental studies of dynamic decision tasks require subjects to make
decisions for which the correct choice switches stochastically throughout a
single trial. In such cases, an ideal observer's belief is described by an
evolution equation that is doubly stochastic, reflecting stochasticity in the
both observations and environmental changes. In these contexts, we show that
the probability density of the belief can be represented using differential
Chapman-Kolmogorov equations, allowing efficient computation of ensemble
statistics. This allows us to reliably compare normative models to
near-normative approximations using, as model performance metrics, decision
response accuracy and Kullback-Leibler divergence of the belief distributions.
Such belief distributions could be obtained empirically from subjects by asking
them to report their decision confidence. We also study how response accuracy
is affected by additional internal noise, showing optimality requires longer
integration timescales as more noise is added. Lastly, we demonstrate that our
method can be applied to tasks in which evidence arrives in a discrete,
pulsatile fashion, rather than continuously.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10120</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A model simulating transport of dense core vesicles (DCVs) in type II axonal
terminals of Drosophila motoneurons has been developed. An interesting feature
of the morphology of type II terminals is the large number of en passant
boutons. The lack of both scaled up DCV transport and scaled down DCV capture
in boutons results in a less efficient supply of DCVs to distal boutons.
Furthermore, the large number of boutons that DCVs pass as they move
anterogradely, until they reach the most distal bouton, may lead to the capture
of a majority of DCVs before they turn around in the most distal bouton to move
in the retrograde direction. This may lead to a reduced retrograde flux of DCVs
and a lack of DCV circulation in type II terminals. The developed model
simulates DCV concentrations in boutons, DCV fluxes between the boutons, age
density distributions of DCVs, and the mean age of DCVs in various boutons.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Found in varied contexts from neurons to ants to fish, binary decision-making
is one of the simplest forms of collective computation. In this process,
information collected by individuals about an uncertain environment is
accumulated to guide behavior at the aggregate scale. We study binary
decision-making dynamics in networks responding to inputs with small
signal-to-noise ratios, looking for quantitative measures of collectivity that
control decision-making performance. We find that decision accuracy is
controlled largely by three factors: the leading eigenvalue of the network
adjacency matrix, the corresponding eigenvector's participation ratio, and
distance from the corresponding symmetry-breaking bifurcation. This allows us
to predict how decision-making performance scales in large networks based on
their spectral properties. Specifically, we explore the effects of localization
caused by the hierarchical assortative structure of a &quot;rich club&quot; topology.
This gives insight into the tradeoffs involved in the higher-order structure
found in living networks performing collective computations.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increasing experimental evidence suggests that axonal action potential
conduction velocity is a highly adaptive parameter in the adult central nervous
system. Yet, the effects of this newfound plasticity on global brain dynamics
is poorly understood. In this work, we analyzed oscillations in biologically
plausible neuronal networks with different conduction velocity distributions.
Changes of 1-2 (ms) in network mean signal transmission time resulted in
substantial network oscillation frequency changes ranging in 0-120 (Hz). Our
results suggest that changes in axonal conduction velocity may significantly
affect both the frequency and synchrony of brain rhythms, which have well
established connections to learning, memory, and other cognitive processes.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Modeling the ballistic-to-diffusive transition in nematode motility reveals variation in exploratory behavior across species. (arXiv:1501.00481v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00481</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00481</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A quantitative understanding of organism-level behavior requires predictive
models that can capture the richness of behavioral phenotypes, yet are simple
enough to connect with underlying mechanistic processes. Here we investigate
the motile behavior of nematodes at the level of their translational motion on
surfaces driven by undulatory propulsion. We broadly sample the nematode
behavioral repertoire by measuring motile trajectories of the canonical lab
strain $C. elegans$ N2 as well as wild strains and distant species. We focus on
trajectory dynamics over timescales spanning the transition from ballistic
(straight) to diffusive (random) movement and find that salient features of the
motility statistics are captured by a random walk model with independent
dynamics in the speed, bearing and reversal events. We show that the model
parameters vary among species in a correlated, low-dimensional manner
suggestive of a common mode of behavioral control and a trade-off between
exploration and exploitation. The distribution of phenotypes along this primary
mode of variation reveals that not only the mean but also the variance varies
considerably across strains, suggesting that these nematode lineages employ
contrasting ``bet-hedging'' strategies for foraging.

	<description>SOX2 positive pituitary stem cells (PSCs) are specified embryonically and persist throughout life, giving rise to all pituitary endocrine lineages. We have previously shown the activation of the STK/LATS/YAP/TAZ signalling cascade in the developing and postnatal mammalian pituitary. Here, we investigate the function of this pathway during pituitary development and in the regulation of the SOX2 cell compartment. Through loss- and gain-of-function genetic approaches, we reveal that restricting YAP/TAZ activation during development is essential for normal organ size and specification from SOX2+ PSCs. Postnatal deletion of LATS kinases and subsequent upregulation of YAP/TAZ leads to uncontrolled clonal expansion of the SOX2+ PSCs and disruption of their differentiation, causing the formation of non-secreting, aggressive pituitary tumours. In contrast, sustained expression of YAP alone results in expansion of SOX2+ PSCs capable of differentiation and devoid of tumourigenic potential. Our findings identify the LATS/YAP/TAZ signalling cascade as an essential component of PSC regulation in normal pituitary physiology and tumourigenesis.</description>

	<description>Besides cardiomyocytes (CM), the heart contains numerous stromal cell types which play key roles in heart repair, regeneration and disease, including fibroblast, vascular and immune cells. However, a comprehensive understanding of this interactive cell community is lacking. We performed single cell RNA-sequencing of the total non-CM fraction and enriched (&lt;i&gt;Pdgfra&lt;/i&gt;-GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) fibroblast lineage cells from murine hearts at days 3 and 7 post-sham or myocardial infarction surgery. Clustering of &amp;gt;30,000 single cells allowed us to identify &amp;gt;30 populations representing 9 cell lineages, included a previously undescribed fibroblast lineage trajectory present in both sham and MI hearts leading to a uniquely activated cell state defined in part by a strong anti-WNT transcriptome signature. We also defined three novel myofibroblast subtypes expressing either pro-fibrotic or anti-fibrotic signatures, and 8 macrophage subsets. These comprehensive cardiac single cell transcriptome data provide an entry point for deeper analysis of cardiac homeostasis, inflammation, fibrosis, repair and regeneration.</description>

	<description>ATP synthase produces the majority of cellular energy in most cells. We have previously reported cryo-EM maps of autoinhibited &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; ATP synthase imaged without addition of nucleotide (Sobti et al. 2016), indicating that the subunit ε engages the α, β and γ subunits to lock the enzyme and prevent functional rotation. Here we present multiple cryo-EM reconstructions of the enzyme frozen after the addition of MgATP to identify the changes that occur when this ε inhibition is removed. The maps generated show that, after exposure to MgATP, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; ATP synthase adopts a different conformation with a catalytic subunit changing conformation substantially and the ε C-terminal domain transitioning via an intermediate 'half-up' state to a condensed 'down' state. This work provides direct evidence for unique conformational states that occur in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; ATP synthase when ATP binding prevents the ε C-terminal domain from entering the inhibitory 'up' state.</description>

	<description>The vast majority of the adult fly ventral nerve cord is composed of 34 hemilineages, which are clusters of lineally related neurons. Neurons in these hemilineages use one of the three fast-acting neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, GABA, or glutamate) for communication. We generated a comprehensive neurotransmitter usage map for the entire ventral nerve cord. We did not find any cases of neurons using more than one neurotransmitter, but found that the acetylcholine specific gene ChAT is transcribed in many glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, but these transcripts typically do not leave the nucleus and are not translated. Importantly, our work uncovered a simple rule: All neurons within a hemilineage use the same neurotransmitter. Thus, neurotransmitter identity is acquired at the stem cell level. Our detailed transmitter- usage/lineage identity map will be a great resource for studying the developmental basis of behavior and deciphering how neuronal circuits function to regulate behavior.</description>

	<description>Metastasis-initiating cells dynamically adapt to the distinct microenvironments of different organs, but these early adaptations are poorly understood due to the limited sensitivity of &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; transcriptomics. We developed fluorouracil-labeled RNA sequencing (Flura-seq) for &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; analysis with high sensitivity. Flura-seq utilizes cytosine deaminase (CD) to convert fluorocytosine to fluorouracil, metabolically labeling nascent RNA in rare cell populations &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; for purification and sequencing. Flura-seq revealed hundreds of unique, dynamic organ-specific gene signatures depending on the microenvironment in mouse xenograft breast cancer micrometastases. Specifically, the mitochondrial electron transport Complex I, oxidative stress and counteracting antioxidant programs were induced in pulmonary micrometastases, compared to mammary tumors or brain micrometastases. We confirmed lung metastasis-specific increase in oxidative stress and upregulation of antioxidants in clinical samples, thus validating Flura-seq's utility in identifying clinically actionable microenvironmental adaptations in early metastasis. The sensitivity, robustness and economy of Flura-seq are broadly applicable beyond cancer research.</description>

	<description>In most vertebrates, pharyngeal arches form in a stereotypic anterior-to-posterior progression. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying evolutionary changes in pharyngeal arch development, here we investigate embryos and larvae of bichirs. Bichirs represent the earliest diverged living group of ray-finned fishes, and possess intriguing traits otherwise typical for lobe-finned fishes such as ventral paired lungs and larval external gills. In bichir embryos, we find that the anteroposterior way of formation of cranial segments is modified by the unique acceleration of the entire hyoid arch segment, with earlier and orchestrated development of the endodermal, mesodermal, and neural crest tissues. This major heterochronic shift in the anteroposterior developmental sequence enables early appearance of the external gills that represent key breathing organs of bichir free-living embryos and early larvae. Bichirs thus stay as unique models for understanding developmental mechanisms facilitating increased breathing capacity.</description>

	<description>RNA polymerase (Pol) I is a 14-subunit enzyme that solely transcribes pre-ribosomal RNA. Cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structures of Pol I initiation and elongation complexes have given first insights into the molecular mechanisms of Pol I transcription. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of yeast Pol I elongation complexes (ECs) bound to the nucleotide analog GMPCPP at 3.2 to 3.4 Å resolution that provide additional insight into the functional interplay between the Pol I-specific transcription-like factors A49-A34.5 and A12.2. Strikingly, most of the nucleotide-bound ECs lack the A49-A34.5 heterodimer and adopt a Pol II-like conformation, in which the A12.2 C-terminal domain is bound in a previously unobserved position at the A135 surface. Our structural and biochemical data suggest a mechanism where reversible binding of the A49-A34.5 heterodimer could contribute to the regulation of Pol I transcription initiation and elongation.</description>

	<description>Combining clonal analysis with a computational agent based model, we investigate how tissue-specific stem cells for neural retina (NR) and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) of the teleost medaka (&lt;i&gt;Oryzias latipes&lt;/i&gt;) coordinate their growth rates. NR cell division timing is less variable, consistent with an upstream role as growth inducer. RPE cells divide with greater variability, consistent with a downstream role responding to inductive signals. Strikingly, the arrangement of the retinal ciliary marginal zone niche results in a spatially biased random lineage loss, where stem- and progenitor cell domains emerge spontaneously. Further, our data indicate that NR cells orient division axes to regulate organ shape and retinal topology. We highlight an unappreciated mechanism for growth coordination, where one tissue integrates cues to synchronize growth of nearby tissues. This strategy may enable evolution to modulate cell proliferation parameters in one tissue to adapt whole-organ morphogenesis in a complex vertebrate organ.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Microglial SIRPα regulates the emergence of CD11c+ microglia and demyelination damage in white matter</title>

	<description>A characteristic subset of microglia expressing CD11c appears in response to brain damage. However, the functional role of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia, as well as the mechanism of its induction, are poorly understood. Here we report that the genetic ablation of signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα), a membrane protein, induced the emergence of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia in the brain white matter. Mice lacking CD47, a physiological ligand of SIRPα, and microglia-specific SIRPα-knockout mice exhibited the same phenotype, suggesting that an interaction between microglial SIRPα and CD47 on neighbouring cells suppressed the emergence of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia. A lack of SIRPα did not cause detectable damage to the white matter, but resulted in the increased expression of genes whose expression is characteristic of the repair phase after demyelination. In addition, cuprizone-induced demyelination was alleviated by the microglia-specific ablation of SIRPα. Thus, microglial SIRPα suppresses the induction of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia that have the potential to accelerate the repair of damaged white matter.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: A conserved major facilitator superfamily member orchestrates a subset of O-glycosylation to aid macrophage tissue invasion</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41801</link>
	<description>Aberrant display of the truncated core1 O-glycan T-antigen is a common feature of human cancer cells that correlates with metastasis. Here we show that T-antigen in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; macrophages is involved in their developmentally programmed tissue invasion. Higher macrophage T-antigen levels require an atypical major facilitator superfamily (MFS) member that we named Minerva which enables macrophage dissemination and invasion. We characterize for the first time the T and Tn glycoform O-glycoproteome of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; embryo, and determine that Minerva increases the presence of T-antigen on proteins in pathways previously linked to cancer, most strongly on the sulfhydryl oxidase Qsox1 which we show is required for macrophage tissue entry. Minerva’s vertebrate ortholog, MFSD1, rescues the &lt;i&gt;minerva&lt;/i&gt; mutant’s migration and T-antigen glycosylation defects. We thus identify a key conserved regulator that orchestrates O-glycosylation on a protein subset to activate a program governing migration steps important for both development and cancer metastasis.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Non-canonical RNA-directed DNA methylation participates in maternal and environmental control of seed dormancy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37434</guid>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37434</link>
	<description>Seed dormancy is an adaptive trait preventing premature germination out of season. In a previous report (Piskurewicz et al., 2016) we showed that dormancy levels are maternally inherited through the preferential maternal allele expression in the seed endosperm of &lt;i&gt;ALLANTOINASE&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;ALN&lt;/i&gt;), a negative regulator of dormancy. Here we show that suppression of &lt;i&gt;ALN&lt;/i&gt; paternal allele expression is imposed by non-canonical RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) of the paternal &lt;i&gt;ALN&lt;/i&gt; allele promoter. Dormancy levels are further enhanced by cold during seed development. We show that DNA methylation of the &lt;i&gt;ALN&lt;/i&gt; promoter is stimulated by cold in a tissue-specific manner through non-canonical RdDM, involving RDR6 and AGO6. This leads to suppression of &lt;i&gt;ALN&lt;/i&gt; expression and further promotion of seed dormancy. Our results suggest that tissue-specific and cold-induced RdDM is superimposed to parental allele imprints to deposit in the seed progeny a transient memory of environmental conditions experienced by the mother plant.</description>

	<description>The dynamics of CNS function rely upon omnidirectional communication among CNS cell types. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as key mediators of this communication and are actively involved in response to CNS injury, mediating inflammatory response and inflammation-related neuroprotection as they display dual beneficial and detrimental roles. Neuroimmune interactions include communication between neurons and microglia, the resident macrophages within the CNS, and these interactions are a critical mediator of healthy brain functions, mounting an inflammatory response, and disease pathogenesis.</description>

	<description>Binary choices between goods are thought to take place in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, current notions emerged mostly from studies where two offers were presented simultaneously. Other work suggested that choices under sequential offers rely on fundamentally different mechanisms. Here we recorded from the OFC of macaques choosing between two juices offered sequentially. Analyzing neuronal responses across time windows, we discovered different groups of neurons that closely resemble those identified under simultaneous offers, suggesting that decisions in the two modalities are formed in the same neural circuit. Building on this result, we examined five hypotheses on the decision mechanisms. OFC neurons encoded goods and values in a juice-based representation (labeled lines). Contrary to previous assessments, decisions did not involve mutual inhibition between pools of offer value cells. Instead, decisions involved mechanisms of circuit inhibition, whereby each offer value indirectly inhibited neurons encoding the opposite choice outcome. These results reconcile seemingly disparate findings and provide a unitary account for economic decisions.</description>

	<description>Word retrieval deficits are a common problem in patients with stroke-induced brain damage. While complete recovery of language in chronic aphasia is rare, patients' naming ability can be significantly improved by speech therapy. A growing number of neuroimaging studies have tried to pinpoint the neural changes associated with successful outcome of naming treatment. However, the mechanisms supporting naming practice in the healthy brain have received little attention. Yet, understanding these mechanisms is crucial for teasing them apart from functional reorganization following brain damage. To address this issue, we trained a group of healthy monolingual Italian speakers on naming pictured objects and actions for ten consecutive days and scanned them before and after training. Using a combination of univariate and multivariate analyses, we established that object and action naming evoked different responses in lateral occipitotemporal, posterior parietal and left inferior frontal cortices, largely in line with previous findings. However, training of noun and verb production was associated with similar activation changes, encompassing both anterior and posterior regions of the left hemisphere. We argue that while left anterior activation decreases (posterior inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula) are likely associated with decreased lexical selection demands, training-related activation changes in left parietal and temporal cortices potentially reflect retrieval of knowledge pertaining to trained items from episodic memory (precuneus, angular gyrus) and facilitated access to phonological word forms (posterior superior temporal sulcus).</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Near-optimal combination of disparity across a log-polar scaled visual field</title>

	<description>The human visual system is foveated: we can see fine spatial details in central vision, whereas resolution is poor in our peripheral visual field, and this loss of resolution follows an approximately logarithmic decrease. Additionally, our brain organizes visual input in polar coordinates. Therefore, the image projection occurring between retina and primary visual cortex can be mathematically described by the log-polar transform. Here, we test and model how this space-variant visual processing affects how we process binocular disparity, a key component of human depth perception. We observe that the fovea preferentially processes disparities at fine spatial scales, whereas the visual periphery is tuned for coarse spatial scales, in line with the naturally occurring distributions of depths and disparities in the real-world. We further show that the visual field integrates disparity information across the visual field, in a near-optimal fashion. We develop a foveated, log-polar model that mimics the processing of depth information in primary visual cortex and that can process disparity directly in the cortical domain representation. This model takes real images as input and recreates the observed topography of disparity sensitivity in man. Our findings support the notion that our foveated, binocular visual system has been moulded by the statistics of our visual environment.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Graph analysis of looming-selective networks in the tectum, and its replication in a simple computational model</title>

	<description>Looming stimuli evoke behavioral responses in most sighted animals, yet the mechanisms of looming detection in vertebrates are poorly understood. Here we hypothesize that looming detection in the tectum may rely on spontaneous emergence of synfire chains: groups of neurons connected to each other in the same sequence in which they are activated during a loom. We then test some specific consequences of this hypothesis. First, we use high-speed calcium imaging to reconstruct connectivity of small networks within the tectum of \textit{Xenopus} tadpoles. We report that reconstructed directed graphs are clustered and hierarchical, that their modularity increases in development, and that looming-selective cells tend to act as activation sinks within these graphs. Second, we describe spontaneous emergence of looming selectivity in a computational developmental model of the tectum, governed by both synaptic and intrinsic plasticity, and driven by structured visual inputs. We show that synfire chains contribute to looming detection in the model; that structured inputs are critical for the emergence of selectivity, and that biological tectal networks follow most, but not all predictions of the model. Finally, we propose a conceptual scheme for understanding the emergence and fine-tuning of collision detection in developing aquatic animals.</description>

	<description>Bilateral convergence of external stimuli is a common feature of the vertebrate sensory system. This convergence of inputs from the bilateral receptive fields allows higher order sensory perception, such as depth perception in the vertebrate visual system and stimulus localization in the auditory system. The functional role of such bilateral convergence in the olfactory system is mostly unknown. To test whether each olfactory bulb contributes a separate piece of olfactory information and whether the bilateral olfactory information is integrated and perceived as unified, we synchronized the activation of olfactory bulbs with blue light in mice expressing channelrhodopsin in olfactory sensory neurons and behaviorally assessed the relevance of dual olfactory bulb in olfactory perception. Our findings suggest that each olfactory bulb contributes separate components of olfactory information and mice integrate the olfactory information from each olfactory bulb to identify an olfactory stimulus.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Christophe Noroy, Thierry Lefrançois, Damien F. Meyer&lt;/p&gt;

Bacterial pathogens have evolved numerous strategies to corrupt, hijack or mimic cellular processes in order to survive and proliferate. Among those strategies, Type IV effectors (T4Es) are proteins secreted by pathogenic bacteria to manipulate host cell processes during infection. They are delivered into eukaryotic cells in an ATP-dependent manner via the type IV secretion system, a specialized multiprotein complex. T4Es contain a wide spectrum of features including eukaryotic-like domains, localization signals or a C-terminal translocation signal. A combination of these features enables prediction of T4Es in a given bacterial genome. In this study, we developed a web-based comprehensive suite of tools with a user-friendly graphical interface. This version 2.0 of S4TE (Searching Algorithm for Type IV Effector Proteins; http://sate.cirad.fr) enables accurate prediction and comparison of T4Es. Search parameters and threshold can be customized by the user to work with any genome sequence, whether publicly available or not. Applications range from characterizing effector features and identifying potential T4Es to analyzing the effectors based on the genome G+C composition and local gene density. S4TE 2.0 allows the comparison of putative T4E repertoires of up to four bacterial strains at the same time. The software identifies T4E orthologs among strains and provides a Venn diagram and lists of genes for each intersection. New interactive features offer the best visualization of the location of candidate T4Es and hyperlinks to NCBI and Pfam databases. S4TE 2.0 is designed to evolve rapidly with the publication of new experimentally validated T4Es, which will reinforce the predictive power of the algorithm. The computational methodology can be used to identify a wide spectrum of candidate bacterial effectors that lack sequence conservation but have similar amino acid characteristics. This approach will provide very valuable information about bacterial host-specificity and virulence factors and help identify host targets for the development of new anti-bacterial molecules.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7Yst9Q81psQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We present a nonlinear programming (NLP) framework for the scalable solution of parameter estimation problems that arise in dynamic modeling of biological systems. Such problems are computationally challenging because they often involve highly nonlinear and stiff differential equations as well as many experimental data sets and parameters. The proposed framework uses cutting-edge modeling and solution tools which are computationally efficient, robust, and easy-to-use. Specifically, our framework uses a time discretization approach that: i) avoids repetitive simulations of the dynamic model, ii) enables fully algebraic model implementations and computation of derivatives, and iii) enables the use of computationally efficient nonlinear interior point solvers that exploit sparse and structured linear algebra techniques. We demonstrate these capabilities by solving estimation problems for synthetic human gut microbiome community models. We show that an instance with 156 parameters, 144 differential equations, and 1,704 experimental data points can be solved in less than 3 minutes using our proposed framework (while an off-the-shelf simulation-based solution framework requires over 7 hours). We also create large instances to show that the proposed framework is scalable and can solve problems with up to 2,352 parameters, 2,304 differential equations, and 20,352 data points in less than 15 minutes. The proposed framework is flexible and easy-to-use, can be broadly applied to dynamic models of biological systems, and enables the implementation of sophisticated estimation techniques to quantify parameter uncertainty, to diagnose observability/uniqueness issues, to perform model selection, and to handle outliers.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2RRPK3RGZV4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Response adaptation in barrel cortical neurons facilitates stimulus detection during rhythmic whisker stimulation in anesthetized mice</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Rodents use rhythmic whisker movements at frequencies between 4-12 Hz to sense the environment that will be disturbed when the animal touches an object. The aim of this work is to study the response adaptation to rhythmic whisker stimulation trains at 4 Hz in the barrel cortex and the sensitivity of cortical neurons to changes in the timing of the stimulation pattern. Longitudinal arrays of four Iridium oxide electrodes were used to obtain single-unit recordings in supra-, granular and infragranular neurons in urethane anesthetized mice. The stimulation protocol consisted in a stimulation train of 3 air-puffs (20 ms duration each) in which the time interval between the first and the third stimuli was fixed (500 ms) and the time interval between the first and the second stimuli changed (regular: 250 ms; &quot;accelerando&quot;: 375 ms; or &quot;decelerando&quot; stimulation train: 125 ms interval). Cortical neurons adapted strongly their response to regular stimulation trains. Response adaptation was reduced when &quot;accelerando&quot; or &quot;decelerando&quot; stimulation trains were applied. This facilitation of the shifted stimulus was mediated by activation of NMDA receptors since the effect was blocked by AP5. The facilitation was not observed in thalamic nuclei. Facilitation increased during periods of EEG activation induced by systemic application of IGF-I, probably by activation of NMDA receptors, as well. We suggest that response adaptation is the outcome of an intrinsic cortical information processing aimed at contributing to improve the detection of &quot;unexpected&quot; stimuli that disturbed the rhythmic behavior of exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; To detect objects, rodents scan the environment by rhythmic movements of whiskers at 4-12 Hz, suggesting that this rhythmic behavior may facilitate stimulus detection. This rhythmic input in the somatosensory cortex will be disturbed when the animal touches an object. We study if spike responses in the somatosensory cortex are sensitive to small changes in the timing of the rhythmic sensory input. We find that responses were facilitated when a modification of the stimulation interval was introduced in the stimulation sequence. This facilitation was mediated by activation of NMDA receptors and increased during periods of EEG activation induced by IGF-I application. We suggest that the detection mechanism of shifted stimulus may play a role in sensory processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A reliable biomarker is needed for accurate and early differentiation between Parkinson disease and the various forms of atypical parkinsonism. We used a novel real‐time quaking‐induced conversion (RT‐QuIC) assay to detect α‐synuclein (α‐syn) aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 118 patients with parkinsonism of uncertain clinical etiology and 52 controls. Diagnostic accuracy to distinguish α‐synucleinopathies from non–α‐synucleinopathies and controls was 84% (sensitivity = 75%, specificity = 94%, area under the curve = 0.84, 95% confidence interval = 0.78–0.91, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001, positive predictive value = 93%). CSF α‐syn RT‐QuIC could be a useful diagnostic tool to help clinicians differentiate α‐synucleinopathies from other forms of parkinsonism when the clinical picture is uncertain.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: How the brain transitions from conscious to subliminal perception. (arXiv:1903.09630v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09630</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09630</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We study the transition in the functional networks that characterize the
human brains' conscious-state to an unconscious subliminal state of perception
by using k-core percolation. We find that the most inner core (i.e., the most
connected kernel) of the conscious-state functional network (the visual cortex
and the left middle frontal gyrus) corresponds to the areas which remain
functionally active when the brain transitions from the conscious-state to the
subliminal-state. That is, the inner core of the conscious network coincides
with the subliminal-state. Mathematical modeling allows to interpret the
conscious to subliminal transition as driven by k-core percolation, through
which the conscious state is lost by the inactivation of the peripheral
k-shells of the conscious functional network. Thus, the inner core and most
robust component of the conscious brain corresponds to the unconscious
subliminal state. This finding imposes constraints to theoretical models of
consciousness, in that the location of the core of the functional brain network
is in the unconscious part of the brain rather than in the conscious state as
previously thought.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Nonmodular architectures of cognitive systems based on active inference. (arXiv:1903.09542v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09542</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09542</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In psychology and neuroscience it is common to describe cognitive systems as
input/output devices where perceptual and motor functions are implemented in a
purely feedforward, open-loop fashion. On this view, perception and action are
often seen as encapsulated modules with limited interaction between them. While
embodied and enactive approaches to cognitive science have challenged the
idealisation of the brain as an input/output device, we argue that even the
more recent attempts to model systems using closed-loop architectures still
heavily rely on a strong separation between motor and perceptual functions.
Previously, we have suggested that the mainstream notion of modularity strongly
resonates with the separation principle of control theory. In this work we
present a minimal model of a sensorimotor loop implementing an architecture
based on the separation principle. We link this to popular formulations of
perception and action in the cognitive sciences, and show its limitations when,
for instance, external forces are not modelled by an agent. These forces can be
seen as variables that an agent cannot directly control, i.e., a perturbation
from the environment or an interference caused by other agents. As an
alternative approach inspired by embodied cognitive science, we then propose a
nonmodular architecture based on the active inference framework. We demonstrate
the robustness of this architecture to unknown external inputs and show that
the mechanism with which this is achieved in linear models is equivalent to
integral control.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A constrained ICA-EMD Model for Group Level fMRI Analysis. (arXiv:1903.09412v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09412</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09412</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Independent component analysis (ICA), as a data driven method, has shown to
be a powerful tool for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data
analysis. One drawback of this multivariate approach is, that it is not
compatible to the analysis of group data in general. Therefore various
techniques have been proposed in order to overcome this limitation of ICA. In
this paper a novel ICA-based work-flow for extracting resting state networks
from fMRI group studies is proposed. An empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is
used to generate reference signals in a data driven manner, which can be
incorporated into a constrained version of ICA (cICA), what helps to eliminate
the inherent ambiguities of ICA. The results of the proposed workflow are then
compared to those obtained by a widely used group ICA approach for fMRI
analysis. In this paper it is demonstrated that intrinsic modes, extracted by
EMD, are suitable to serve as references for cICA to obtain typical resting
state patterns, which are consistent over subjects. By introducing these
reference signals into the ICA, our processing pipeline makes it transparent
for the user, how comparable activity patterns across subjects emerge. This
additionally allows adapting the trade-off between enforcing similarity across
subjects and preserving individual subject features.

	<description>Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by aberrant forms of tau protein accumulation leading to neuronal death in focal brain areas. Positron emission tomography (PET) tracers that bind to pathological tau are used in diagnosis, but there are no current therapies to eliminate these tau species. We employed targeted protein degradation technology to convert a tau PET-probe into a functional degrader of pathogenic tau. The hetero-bifunctional molecule QC-01-175 was designed to engage both tau and Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate-receptor for the E3-ubiquitin ligase CRL4&lt;sup&gt;CRBN&lt;/sup&gt;, to trigger tau ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. QC-01-175 effected clearance of tau in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patient-derived neuronal cell models, with minimal effect on tau from neurons of healthy controls, indicating specificity for disease-relevant forms. QC-01-175 also rescued stress vulnerability in FTD neurons, phenocopying CRISPR-mediated &lt;i&gt;MAPT&lt;/i&gt;-knockout. This work demonstrates that aberrant tau in FTD patient-derived neurons is amenable to targeted degradation, representing an important advance for therapeutics.</description>

	<description>When presented with a choice, organisms need to assimilate internal information with external stimuli and past experiences to rapidly and flexibly optimize decisions on a moment-to-moment basis. We hypothesized that increasing hunger intensity would curb expression of social behaviors such as mating or territorial aggression; we further hypothesized social interactions, reciprocally, would influence food consumption. We assessed competition between these motivations from both perspectives of mice within a resident-intruder paradigm. We found that as hunger state escalated, resident animal social interactions with either a female or male intruder decreased. Furthermore, intense hunger states, especially those evoked via AgRP photoactivation, fundamentally altered sequences of behavioral choice; effects dependent on food availibility. Additionally, female, but not male, intrusion attenuated resident mouse feeding. Lastly, we noted environmental context-dependent gating of food intake in intruding mice, suggesting a dynamic influence of context cues on the expression of feeding behaviors.</description>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: ParB dynamics and the critical role of the CTD in DNA condensation unveiled by combined force-fluorescence measurements</title>

	<description>&lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; ParB forms multimeric networks involving non-specific DNA binding leading to DNA condensation. Previously, we found that an excess of the free C-terminal domain (CTD) of ParB impeded DNA condensation or promoted decondensation of pre-assembled networks (Fisher et al., 2017). However, interpretation of the molecular basis for this phenomenon was complicated by our inability to uncouple protein binding from DNA condensation. Here, we have combined lateral magnetic tweezers with TIRF microscopy to simultaneously control the restrictive force against condensation and to visualise ParB protein binding by fluorescence. At non-permissive forces for condensation, ParB binds non-specifically and highly dynamically to DNA. Our new approach concluded that the free CTD blocks the formation of ParB networks by heterodimerisation with full length DNA-bound ParB. This strongly supports a model in which the CTD acts as a key bridging interface between distal DNA binding loci within ParB networks.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Rapid interpretation of small-angle X-ray scattering data</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006900</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Marie Weiel, Ines Reinartz, Alexander Schug&lt;/p&gt;

The fundamental aim of structural analyses in biophysics is to reveal a mutual relation between a molecule’s dynamic structure and its physiological function. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is an experimental technique for structural characterization of macromolecules in solution and enables time-resolved analysis of conformational changes under physiological conditions. As such experiments measure spatially averaged low-resolution scattering intensities only, the sparse information obtained is not sufficient to uniquely reconstruct a three-dimensional atomistic model. Here, we integrate the information from SAXS into molecular dynamics simulations using computationally efficient native structure-based models. Dynamically fitting an initial structure towards a scattering intensity, such simulations produce atomistic models in agreement with the target data. In this way, SAXS data can be rapidly interpreted while retaining physico-chemical knowledge and sampling power of the underlying force field. We demonstrate our method’s performance using the example of three protein systems. Simulations are faster than full molecular dynamics approaches by more than two orders of magnitude and consistently achieve comparable accuracy. Computational demands are reduced sufficiently to run the simulations on commodity desktop computers instead of high-performance computing systems. These results underline that scattering-guided structure-based simulations provide a suitable framework for rapid early-stage refinement of structures towards SAXS data with particular focus on minimal computational resources and time.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/169K0P5rCZY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: AZATAX: Acetazolamide safety and efficacy in cerebellar syndrome in PMM2 congenital disorder of glycosylation (PMM2‐CDG)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25457?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25457?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphomannomutase deficiency (PMM2 congenital disorder of glycosylation [PMM2‐CDG]) causes cerebellar syndrome and strokelike episodes (SLEs). SLEs are also described in patients with gain‐of‐function mutations in the CaV2.1 channel, for which acetazolamide therapy is suggested. Impairment in N‐glycosylation of CaV2.1 promotes gain‐of‐function effects and may participate in cerebellar syndrome in PMM2‐CDG. AZATAX was designed to establish whether acetazolamide is safe and improves cerebellar syndrome in PMM2‐CDG.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clinical trial included PMM2‐CDG patients, with a 6‐month first‐phase single acetazolamide therapy group, followed by a randomized 5‐week withdrawal phase. Safety was assessed. The primary outcome measure was improvement in the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). Other measures were the Nijmegen Pediatric CDG Rating Scale (NPCRS), a syllable repetition test (PATA test), and cognitive scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐four patients (mean age = 12.3 ± 4.5 years) were included, showing no serious adverse events. Thirteen patients required dose adjustment due to low bicarbonate or asthenia. There were improvements on ICARS (34.9 ± 23.2 vs 40.7 ± 24.8, effect size = 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.0–7.6, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), detected at 6 weeks in 18 patients among the 20 responders, on NPCRS (95% CI = 0.3–1.6, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013) and on the PATA test (95% CI = 0.5–3.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006). Acetazolamide improved prothrombin time, factor X, and antithrombin. Clinical severity, epilepsy, and lipodystrophy predicted greater response. The randomized withdrawal phase showed ICARS worsening in the withdrawal group (effect size = 1.46, 95% CI = 2.65–7.52, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AZATAX is the first clinical trial of PMM2‐CDG. Acetazolamide is well tolerated and effective for motor cerebellar syndrome. Its ability to prevent SLEs and its long‐term effects on kidney function should be addressed in future studies. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Metabolic patterns across core features in dementia with lewy bodies</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25453?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25453?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify brain regions whose metabolic impairment contributes to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) clinical core features expression and to assess the influence of severity of global cognitive impairment on the DLB hypometabolic pattern.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and information on core features were available in 171 patients belonging to the imaging repository of the European DLB Consortium. Principal component analysis was applied to identify brain regions relevant to the local data variance. A linear regression model was applied to generate core‐feature–specific patterns controlling for the main confounding variables (Mini‐Mental State Examination [MMSE], age, education, gender, and center). Regression analysis to the locally normalized intensities was performed to generate an MMSE‐sensitive map.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinsonism negatively covaried with bilateral parietal, precuneus, and anterior cingulate metabolism; visual hallucinations (VH) with bilateral dorsolateral–frontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and parietal metabolism; and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) with bilateral parieto‐occipital cortex, precuneus, and ventrolateral–frontal metabolism. VH and RBD shared a positive covariance with metabolism in the medial temporal lobe, cerebellum, brainstem, basal ganglia, thalami, and orbitofrontal and sensorimotor cortex. Cognitive fluctuations negatively covaried with occipital metabolism and positively with parietal lobe metabolism. MMSE positively covaried with metabolism in the left superior frontal gyrus, bilateral–parietal cortex, and left precuneus, and negatively with metabolism in the insula, medial frontal gyrus, hippocampus in the left hemisphere, and right cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regions of more preserved metabolism are relatively consistent across the variegate DLB spectrum. By contrast, core features were associated with more prominent hypometabolism in specific regions, thus suggesting a close clinical–imaging correlation, reflecting the interplay between topography of neurodegeneration and clinical presentation in DLB patients.

	<title>RSS PAP: Beyond critical period learning: Striatal FoxP2 affects the active maintenance of learned vocalizations in adulthood</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0071-19.2019v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In humans, mutations in the transcription factor FOXP2 result in language disorders associated with altered striatal structure. Like speech, birdsong is learned through social interactions during maturational critical periods, and relies on auditory feedback during initial learning and on-going maintenance. Hearing loss causes learned vocalizations to deteriorate in adult humans and songbirds. In the adult songbird brain, most FoxP2-enriched regions (e.g. cortex, thalamus) show a static expression level, but in the striatal song control nucleus, Area X, FoxP2 is regulated by singing and social context: When juveniles and adults sing alone, its levels drop, and songs are more variable. When males sing to females, FoxP2 levels remain high and songs are relatively stable: This ‘on-line’ regulation implicates FoxP2 in ongoing vocal processes, but its role in the auditory-based maintenance of learned vocalization has not been examined. To test this, we overexpressed FoxP2 in both hearing and deafened adult zebra finches and assessed effects on song sung alone versus songs directed to females. In intact birds singing alone, no changes were detected between songs of males expressing FoxP2 or a GFP construct in Area X, consistent with the marked stability of mature song in this species. In contrast, songs of males overexpressing FoxP2 became more variable and were less preferable to females, unlike responses to songs of GFP-expressing control males. In deafened birds, song deteriorated more rapidly following FoxP2 overexpression relative to GFP controls. Together, these experiments suggest that behavior-driven FoxP2 expression and auditory feedback interact to precisely maintain learned vocalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Mutations within the FOXP2 gene impair speech and language. In zebra finch songbirds, the predominant model for investigating the neural and genetic mechanisms underlying human speech, FoxP2 is critical for song learning. Striatal FoxP2 expression levels correlate with song variability. We overexpressed FoxP2 in the striatopallidum of adult male zebra finches to assess its contribution to the maintenance of adult vocalizations independent of developmental perturbations. We tested the hypothesis that high FoxP2 expression promotes song stability by longitudinally assessing song in the presence and absence of auditory feedback and in two social contexts. We found that dysregulated FoxP2 interferes with hearing-dependent song maintenance. These results suggest that auditory-based regulation of FoxP2 is critical for the ongoing maintenance of adult vocalizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: FGF-23 Deficiency Impairs Hippocampal-Dependent Cognitive Function</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and α-Klotho transduce FGF-23 signaling in renal tubules to maintain systemic phosphate/vitamin D homeostasis. Mice deficient for either the ligand, FGF-23, or the co-receptor, Klotho, are phenocopies with both showing rapid and premature development of multiple aging-like abnormalities. Such similarity in phenotype, suggests that FGF-23 and Klotho have co-dependent systemic functions. Recent reports revealed inverse central nervous system (CNS) effects of Klotho deficiency or Klotho overexpression on hippocampal synaptic, neurogenic, and cognitive functions. However, it is unknown whether FGF-23 deficiency effects function of the hippocampus. We report that, similar to Klotho-deficient mice, FGF-23-deficient mice develop dose-dependent, hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairment. However, FGF-23-deficient brains had no gross structural or developmental defects, no change in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and only minor impairment to postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis. Together, these data provide evidence that FGF-23 deficiency impairs hippocampal-dependent cognition but otherwise results in a brain phenotype that is distinct from the KL-deficient mouse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Actininopathy – a new muscular dystrophy caused by ACTN2 dominant mutations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25470?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25470?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clinically and pathologically characterize a cohort of patients presenting with a novel form of distal myopathy and to identify the genetic cause of this new muscular dystrophy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied four families (three from Spain and one from Sweden) suffering from an autosomal dominant distal myopathy. Affected members showed adult‐onset asymmetric distal muscle weakness with initial involvement of ankle dorsiflexion later progressing also to proximal limb muscles.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all three Spanish families, we identified a unique missense variant in the &lt;i&gt;ACTN2&lt;/i&gt; gene co‐segregating with the disease. The affected members of the Swedish family carry a different &lt;i&gt;ACTN2&lt;/i&gt; missense variant.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;ACTN2&lt;/i&gt; encodes for alpha actinin2 that is highly expressed in the sarcomeric Z‐disk with a major structural and functional role. Actininopathy is thus a new genetically determined distal myopathy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quantum entanglement in physical and cognitive systems: a conceptual analysis and a general representation. (arXiv:1903.09103v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09103</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09103</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We provide a general description of the phenomenon of entanglement in
bipartite systems, as it manifests in micro and macro physical systems, as well
as in human cognitive processes. We do so by observing that when genuine
coincidence measurements are considered, the violation of the 'marginal laws',
in addition to the Bell-CHSH inequality, is also to be expected. The situation
can be described in the quantum formalism by considering the presence of
entanglement not only at the level of the states, but also at the level of the
measurements. However, at the &quot;local'&quot; level of a specific joint measurement, a
description where entanglement is only incorporated in the state remains always
possible, by adopting a fine-tuned tensor product representation. But
contextual tensor product representations should only be considered when there
are good reasons to describe the outcome-states as (non-entangled) product
states. This will not in general be true, hence, the entangement resource will
have to generally be allocated both in the states and in the measurements. In
view of the numerous violations of the marginal laws observed in physics'
laboratories, it remains unclear to date if entanglement in micro-physical
systems is to be understood only as an 'entanglement of the states', or also as
an 'entanglement of the measurements'. But even if measurements would also be
entangled, the corresponding violation of the marginal laws (no-signaling
conditions) would not for this imply that a superluminal communication would be
possible.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Classification of EEG-Based Brain Connectivity Networks in Schizophrenia Using a Multi-Domain Connectome Convolutional Neural Network. (arXiv:1903.08858v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08858</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We exploit altered patterns in brain functional connectivity as features for
automatic discriminative analysis of neuropsychiatric patients. Deep learning
methods have been introduced to functional network classification only very
recently for fMRI, and the proposed architectures essentially focused on a
single type of connectivity measure. We propose a deep convolutional neural
network (CNN) framework for classification of electroencephalogram
(EEG)-derived brain connectome in schizophrenia (SZ). To capture complementary
aspects of disrupted connectivity in SZ, we explore combination of various
connectivity features consisting of time and frequency-domain metrics of
effective connectivity based on vector autoregressive model and partial
directed coherence, and complex network measures of network topology. We design
a novel multi-domain connectome CNN (MDC-CNN) based on a parallel ensemble of
1D and 2D CNNs to integrate the features from various domains and dimensions
using different fusion strategies. Hierarchical latent representations learned
by the multiple convolutional layers from EEG connectivity reveal apparent
group differences between SZ and healthy controls (HC). Results on a large
resting-state EEG dataset show that the proposed CNNs significantly outperform
traditional support vector machine classifiers. The MDC-CNN with combined
connectivity features further improves performance over single-domain CNNs
using individual features, achieving remarkable accuracy of $93.06\%$ with a
decision-level fusion. The proposed MDC-CNN by integrating information from
diverse brain connectivity descriptors is able to accurately discriminate SZ
from HC. The new framework is potentially useful for developing diagnostic
tools for SZ and other disorders.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Hippocampal and Retrosplenial Goal Distance Coding After Long-term Consolidation of a Real-World Environment</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Recent research indicates the hippocampus may code the distance to the goal during navigation of newly learned environments. It is unclear however, whether this also pertains to highly familiar environments where extensive systems-level consolidation is thought to have transformed mnemonic representations. Here we recorded fMRI while University College London and Imperial College London students navigated virtual simulations of their own familiar campus (&amp;gt;2 years of exposure) and the other campus learned days before scanning. Posterior hippocampal activity tracked the distance to the goal in the newly learned campus, as well as in familiar environments when the future route contained many turns. By contrast retrosplenial cortex only tracked the distance to the goal in the familiar campus. All of these responses were abolished when participants were guided to their goal by external cues. These results open new avenues of research on navigation and consolidation of spatial information and underscore the notion that the hippocampus continues to play a role in navigation when detailed processing of the environment is needed for navigation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: ChIPulate: A comprehensive ChIP-seq simulation pipeline</title>

ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) is a high-throughput technique to identify genomic regions that are bound &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by a particular protein, e.g., a transcription factor (TF). Biological factors, such as chromatin state, indirect and cooperative binding, as well as experimental factors, such as antibody quality, cross-linking, and PCR biases, are known to affect the outcome of ChIP-seq experiments. However, the relative impact of these factors on inferences made from ChIP-seq data is not entirely clear. Here, via a detailed ChIP-seq simulation pipeline, ChIPulate, we assess the impact of various biological and experimental sources of variation on several outcomes of a ChIP-seq experiment, viz., the recoverability of the TF binding motif, accuracy of TF-DNA binding detection, the sensitivity of inferred TF-DNA binding strength, and number of replicates needed to confidently infer binding strength. We find that the TF motif can be recovered despite poor and non-uniform extraction and PCR amplification efficiencies. The recovery of the motif is, however, affected to a larger extent by the fraction of sites that are either cooperatively or indirectly bound. Importantly, our simulations reveal that the number of ChIP-seq replicates needed to accurately measure &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; occupancy at high-affinity sites is larger than the recommended community standards. Our results establish statistical limits on the accuracy of inferences of protein-DNA binding from ChIP-seq and suggest that increasing the mean extraction efficiency, rather than amplification efficiency, would better improve sensitivity. The source code and instructions for running ChIPulate can be found at https://github.com/vishakad/chipulate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lVS1HwZ6VPM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Contrasting the effects of adaptation and synaptic filtering on the timescales of dynamics in recurrent networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006893</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Manuel Beiran, Srdjan Ostojic&lt;/p&gt;

Neural activity in awake behaving animals exhibits a vast range of timescales that can be several fold larger than the membrane time constant of individual neurons. Two types of mechanisms have been proposed to explain this conundrum. One possibility is that large timescales are generated by a network mechanism based on positive feedback, but this hypothesis requires fine-tuning of the strength or structure of the synaptic connections. A second possibility is that large timescales in the neural dynamics are inherited from large timescales of underlying biophysical processes, two prominent candidates being intrinsic adaptive ionic currents and synaptic transmission. How the timescales of adaptation or synaptic transmission influence the timescale of the network dynamics has however not been fully explored. To address this question, here we analyze large networks of randomly connected excitatory and inhibitory units with additional degrees of freedom that correspond to adaptation or synaptic filtering. We determine the fixed points of the systems, their stability to perturbations and the corresponding dynamical timescales. Furthermore, we apply dynamical mean field theory to study the temporal statistics of the activity in the fluctuating regime, and examine how the adaptation and synaptic timescales transfer from individual units to the whole population. Our overarching finding is that synaptic filtering and adaptation in single neurons have very different effects at the network level. Unexpectedly, the macroscopic network dynamics do not inherit the large timescale present in adaptive currents. In contrast, the timescales of network activity increase proportionally to the time constant of the synaptic filter. Altogether, our study demonstrates that the timescales of different biophysical processes have different effects on the network level, so that the slow processes within individual neurons do not necessarily induce slow activity in large recurrent neural networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IrWlAfZyY2k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Early Detection of Mental Stress Using Advanced Neuroimaging and Artificial Intelligence. (arXiv:1903.08511v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08511</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08511</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;While different neuroimaging modalities have been proposed to detect mental
stress, each modality experiences certain limitations. This study proposed
novel approaches to detect stress based on fusion of EEG and fNIRS signals in
the feature-level using joint independent component analysis (jICA) and
canonical correlation analysis method (CCA) and predected the level of stress
using machine-learning approach. The jICA and CCA were then developed to
combine the features to detect mental stress. The jICA fusion scheme discovers
relationships between modalities by utilizing ICA to identify sources from each
modality that modulate in the same way across subjects. The CCA fuse
information from two sets of features to discover the associations across
modalities and to ultimately estimate the sources responsible for these
associations. The study further explored the functional connectivity (FC) and
evaluated the performance of the fusion methods based on their classification
performance and compared it with the result obtained by each individual
modality. The jICA fusion technique significantly improved the classification
accuracy, sensitivity and specificity on average by +3.46% compared to the EEG
and +11.13% compared to the fNIRS. Similarly, CCA method improved the
classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity on average by +8.56%
compared to the EEG and +13.03% compared to the fNIRS, respectively. The
overall performance of the proposed fusion methods significantly improved the
detection rate of mental stress, p&amp;lt;0.05. The FC significantly reduced under
stress and suggested EEG and fNIRS as a potential biomarker of stress.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A study of dependency features of spike trains through copulas. (arXiv:1903.08460v1 [stat.AP])</title>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08460</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous recordings from many neurons hide important information and the
connections characterizing the network remain generally undiscovered despite
the progresses of statistical and machine learning techniques. Discerning the
presence of direct links between neuron from data is still a not completely
solved problem. To enlarge the number of tools for detecting the underlying
network structure, we propose here the use of copulas, pursuing on a research
direction we started in [1]. Here, we adapt their use to distinguish different
types of connections on a very simple network. Our proposal consists in
choosing suitable random intervals in pairs of spike trains determining the
shapes of their copulas. We show that this approach allows to detect different
types of dependencies. We illustrate the features of the proposed method on
synthetic data from suitably connected networks of two or three formal neurons
directly connected or influenced by the surrounding network. We show how a
smart choice of pairs of random times together with the use of empirical
copulas allows to discern between direct and un-direct interactions.

	<description>The PF of the intralaminar thalamus is implicated in human neuropsychiatric disease. Mandelbaum et al. deconstruct the mouse PF using transcription, electrophysiological, and whole-brain anatomical analyses. They reveal organization of the PF that bridges molecular, cellular, and circuit levels, forming cortical-PF-cortical and cortical-PF-striatum circuit motifs. These findings reveal PF as a critical node that organizes limbic, associative, and somatosensory information in the basal ganglia.</description>

Zinc is a vital trace element crucial for the proper function of some 3,000 cellular proteins. Specifically, zinc is essential for key physiological processes including nucleic acid metabolism, regulation of gene expression, signal transduction, cell division, immune- and nervous system functions, wound healing, and apoptosis. Consequently, impairment of zinc homeostasis disrupts key cellular functions resulting in various human pathologies. Mammalian zinc transport proceeds via two transporter families ZnT and ZIP. However, the detailed mechanism of action of ZnT2, which is responsible for vesicular zinc accumulation and zinc secretion into breast milk during lactation, is currently unknown. Moreover, although the putative coupling of zinc transport to the proton gradient in acidic vesicles has been suggested, it has not been conclusively established. Herein we modeled the mechanism of action of ZnT2 and demonstrated both computationally and experimentally, using functional zinc transport assays, that ZnT2 is indeed a proton-coupled zinc antiporter. Bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type proton ATPase (V-ATPase) which alkalizes acidic vesicles, abolished ZnT2-dependent zinc transport into intracellular vesicles. Moreover, using LysoTracker Red and Lyso-pHluorin, we further showed that upon transient ZnT2 overexpression in intracellular vesicles and addition of exogenous zinc, the vesicular pH underwent alkalization, presumably due to a proton-zinc antiport; this phenomenon was reversed in the presence of TPEN, a specific zinc chelator. Finally, based on computational energy calculations, we propose that ZnT2 functions as an antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion. Hence, ZnT2 is a proton motive force-driven, electroneutral vesicular zinc exchanger, concentrating zinc in acidic vesicles on the expense of proton extrusion to the cytoplasm.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sRZv0HVI_Gw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Basal gene expression levels have been shown to be predictive of cellular response to cytotoxic treatments. However, such analyses do not fully reveal complex genotype- phenotype relationships, which are partly encoded in highly interconnected molecular networks. Biological pathways provide a complementary way of understanding drug response variation among individuals. In this study, we integrate chemosensitivity data from a large-scale pharmacogenomics study with basal gene expression data from the CCLE project and prior knowledge of molecular networks to identify specific pathways mediating chemical response. We first develop a computational method called PACER, which ranks pathways for enrichment in a given set of genes using a novel network embedding method. It examines a molecular network that encodes known gene-gene as well as gene-pathway relationships, and determines a vector representation of each gene and pathway in the same low-dimensional vector space. The relevance of a pathway to the given gene set is then captured by the similarity between the pathway vector and gene vectors. To apply this approach to chemosensitivity data, we identify genes whose basal expression levels in a panel of cell lines are correlated with cytotoxic response to a compound, and then rank pathways for relevance to these response-correlated genes using PACER. Extensive evaluation of this approach on benchmarks constructed from databases of compound target genes and large collections of drug response signatures demonstrates its advantages in identifying compound-pathway associations compared to existing statistical methods of pathway enrichment analysis. The associations identified by PACER can serve as testable hypotheses on chemosensitivity pathways and help further study the mechanisms of action of specific cytotoxic drugs. More broadly, PACER represents a novel technique of identifying enriched properties of any gene set of interest while also taking into account networks of known gene-gene relationships and interactions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZzNZeiRYbRM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Prophylactic vaccination is a powerful tool for reducing the burden of infectious diseases, due to a combination of direct protection of vaccinees and indirect protection of others via herd immunity. Computational models play an important role in devising strategies for vaccination by making projections of its impacts on public health. Such projections are subject to uncertainty about numerous factors, however. For example, many vaccine efficacy trials focus on measuring protection against disease rather than protection against infection, leaving the extent of breakthrough infections (i.e., disease ameliorated but infection unimpeded) among vaccinees unknown. Our goal in this study was to quantify the extent to which uncertainty about breakthrough infections results in uncertainty about vaccination impact, with a focus on vaccines for dengue. To realistically account for the many forms of heterogeneity in dengue virus (DENV) transmission, which could have implications for the dynamics of indirect protection, we used a stochastic, agent-based model for DENV transmission informed by more than a decade of empirical studies in the city of Iquitos, Peru. Following 20 years of routine vaccination of nine-year-old children at 80% coverage, projections of the proportion of disease episodes averted varied by a factor of 1.76 (95% CI: 1.54–2.06) across the range of uncertainty about breakthrough infections. This was equivalent to the range of vaccination impact projected across a range of uncertainty about vaccine efficacy of 0.268 (95% CI: 0.210–0.329). Until uncertainty about breakthrough infections can be addressed empirically, our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for it in models of vaccination impact.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/95Qqs3pfPg8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Synaptic basis for contrast-dependent shifts in functional identity in mouse V1</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A central transformation that occurs within mammalian visual cortex is the change from linear, polarity-sensitive responses to nonlinear, polarity-insensitive responses. These neurons are classically labelled as either simple or complex, respectively, on the basis of their response linearity (Skottun et al., 1991). While the difference between cell classes is clear when the stimulus strength is high, reducing stimulus strength diminishes the differences between the cell types and causes some complex cells to respond as simple cells (Crowder et al., 2007; van Kleef et al., 2010; Hietanen et al., 2013). To understand the synaptic basis for this shift in behaviour we used &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; whole cell recordings while systematically shifting stimulus contrast. We find systematic shifts in the degree of complex cell responses in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) at the subthreshold level, demonstrating that synaptic inputs change in concert with the shifts in response linearity and that the change in response linearity is not simply due to the threshold nonlinearity. These shifts are consistent with a visual cortex model in which the recurrent amplification acts as a critical component in the generation of complex cell responses (Chance et al., 1999).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The discovery of simple and complex cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) has been fundamental to our understanding of visual processing. While both cell types are orientation selective, simple cells are spatial phase sensitive while complex cells are phase-invariant. Extracellular recordings have shown that the responses of complex cells become phase sensitive at lower stimulus contrasts, suggesting more flexibility in processing mechanisms than previously thought. The mechanism by which this flexibility arises is not understood. Using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; whole cell recordings, we demonstrated that the flexibility in phase sensitivity is also apparent in the subthreshold responses of mouse V1 cells, suggesting that the effect arises from active cortical recurrent network activity and not from passive spiking threshold mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The transcription factor FosB has been proposed as a molecular switch for the transition from casual, volitional drug use into a chronically addicted state, but the upstream regulatory mechanisms governing FosB expression are incompletely understood. In this study, we find a novel regulatory role for the transcription factor E2F3 — recently implicated in transcriptional regulation by cocaine — in controlling FosB induction in the mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc) following cocaine administration. We find that an E2F consensus sequence 500 bp upstream of the &lt;i&gt;Fosb&lt;/i&gt; transcription start site is enriched for E2F3 specifically over other E2F isoforms. We further conclude that FosB expression is regulated specifically by E2F3a, not E2F3b, that &lt;i&gt;E2f3a&lt;/i&gt; expression is specific to D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons, and that E2F3a overexpression in NAc recapitulates the induction of &lt;i&gt;Fosb&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Fosb&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression observed after chronic cocaine exposure. E2F3a knockdown in NAc does not abolish &lt;i&gt;Fosb&lt;/i&gt; induction by cocaine, a result consistent with previously published data showing that singular knockdown of upstream regulators of FosB is insufficient to block cocaine-induced expression. Finally, to elucidate potential combinatorial epigenetic mechanisms involved in E2F3a’s regulation of &lt;i&gt;Fosb,&lt;/i&gt; we explore H3K4me3 enrichment at the &lt;i&gt;Fosb&lt;/i&gt; promoter and find that it is not enhanced by E2F3a overexpression, suggesting it may instead be a pre-existing permissive mark allowing for E2F3a to interact with &lt;i&gt;Fosb&lt;/i&gt;. Taken together, these findings support a role for E2F3a as a novel, upstream regulator of the addiction-mediating transcription factor FosB in NAc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; A hallmark question in the neuroscience of addiction is how repeated drug use is translated into long-lasting changes in neural regulation. Long-lasting changes in behavior are mediated in part by intracellular transcriptional mechanisms which affect gene expression and neural circuitry. Therefore, pinpointing signaling pathways downstream of abused drugs is a high priority for understanding the addiction process. To this end, we identify and characterize E2F3a as a novel regulator of FosB, a transcription factor widely studied as a molecular switch for the transition from casual drug use to addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: HNCcorr: A Novel Combinatorial Approach for Cell Identification in Calcium Imaging Movies</title>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging is a key method in neuroscience for investigating patterns of neuronal activity in vivo. Still, existing algorithms to detect and extract activity signals from calcium imaging movies have major shortcomings. We introduce the HNCcorr algorithm for cell identification in calcium imaging datasets that addresses these shortcomings. HNCcorr relies on the combinatorial clustering problem HNC - Hochbaum’s Normalized Cut, which is similar to the Normalized Cut problem of Shi and Malik, a well-known problem in image segmentation. HNC identifies cells as coherent clusters of pixels that are highly distinct from the remaining pixels. HNCcorr guarantees a globally optimal solution to the underlying optimization problem as well as minimal dependence on initialization techniques. HNCcorr also employs a new method, named &lt;i&gt;similarity-squared&lt;/i&gt;, for measuring similarity between pixels in calcium imaging movies. The effectiveness of HNCcorr is demonstrated by its top performance on the Neurofinder cell identification benchmark. We believe HNCcorr is an important addition to the toolbox for analysis of calcium imaging movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; Calcium imaging is a method for recording neuronal activity at a cellular resolution that requires automated approaches to identify cells and their signals. HNCcorr is a novel algorithm that identifies these cells successfully and efficiently. HNCcorr is unique in that it addresses an optimization model and delivers a guaranteed globally optimal solution, thus ensuring a fully transparent link between the input data and the resulting cell identification. This contrasts with existing state-of-the-art approaches that produce only heuristic solutions to the underlying optimization model, and consequently may miss cells due to the sub-optimality of the generated solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>RSS PAP: Expression of key guidance genes at a forebrain axon turning point is maintained by distinct Fgfr isoforms but a common downstream signal transduction mechanism</title>

	<description>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;During development the axons of neurons grow toward and locate their synaptic partners to form functional neural circuits. Axons do so by reading a map of guidance cues expressed by surrounding tissues. Guidance cues are expressed at a precise space and time, but how guidance cue expression is regulated, and in a coordinated manner, is poorly understood. Semaphorins (Semas) and Slits are families of molecular ligands that guide axons. We showed previously that Fibroblast Growth Factor (Fgf) signalling maintains &lt;i&gt;sema3a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;slit1&lt;/i&gt; forebrain expression in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt;, and these two repellents cooperate to guide retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons away from the mid-diencephalon and on towards the optic tectum. Here, we investigate whether there are common features of the regulatory pathways that control the expression of these two guidance cues at this single axon guidance decision point. We isolated the &lt;i&gt;sema3a&lt;/i&gt; proximal promoter and confirmed its responsiveness to Fgf signalling. Through misexpression of truncated Fgf receptors (Fgfrs), we found that &lt;i&gt;sema3a&lt;/i&gt; forebrain expression is dependent on Fgfr2-4 but not Fgfr1. This is in contrast to &lt;i&gt;slit1&lt;/i&gt;, whose expression we showed previously depends on Fgfr1 but not Fgfr2-4. Using pharmacological inhibitors and misexpression of constitutively active and dominant negative signalling intermediates, we find that while distinct Fgfrs regulate these two guidance genes, intracellular signalling downstream of Fgfrs appears to converge along the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. A common PI3K-Akt signalling pathway may allow for the coordinated expression of guidance cues that cooperate to direct axons at a guidance choice point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Little is known about the mechanisms regulating axon guidance cue expression. Fibroblast Growth Factor (Fgf) signals maintain &lt;i&gt;semaphorin 3a&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;sema3a&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;slit1&lt;/i&gt; expression at a key guidance point for retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons in the mid-diencephalon. We find that &lt;i&gt;sema3a&lt;/i&gt; expression in the forebrain is promoted by a distinct set of Fgfrs, Fgfr2-4, from the Fgfr1 that maintains &lt;i&gt;slit1&lt;/i&gt; levels. Interestingly, despite the differences in Fgfr dependency, the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway is likely a shared downstream regulator of the expression of both guidance cues. These data argue that related but distinct receptors converge on a common signalling mechanism for coordinated control of a map of molecular cues that cooperate at a single guidance choice point to direct axon behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;CA1 neurons in epileptic animals are vulnerable to selective changes in ion channel expression, called acquired channelopathies, which can increase the excitability of a neuron. Under normal conditions there is a gradient of ion channel expression and intrinsic excitability along the longitudinal, dorsoventral axis of hippocampal area CA1 of the rodent. Many of these channels, including M-channels, GIRK channels and HCN channels, all have dorsoventral expression gradients that might be altered in rodent models of epilepsy. Here, we show that the excitability of dorsal, but not ventral CA1 neurons, had an increased firing rate, reduced interspike interval and increased input resistance in a status epilepticus (SE) model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. As a result, the excitability of CA1 neurons became uniform across the dorsoventral axis of the rat hippocampus post-SE. Using current clamp recordings with pharmacology and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that the expression of HCN channels was downregulated in the dorsal CA1 region post-SE, while the expression of M and GIRK channels were unchanged. We did not find this acquired channelopathy in ventral CA1 neurons post-SE. Our results suggest that the excitability of dorsal CA1 neurons post-SE increase to resemble the intrinsic properties of ventral CA1 neurons, which likely makes the hippocampal circuit more permissible to seizures, and contributes to the cognitive impairments associated with chronic epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Temporal Lobe Epilepsy is characterized by spontaneous seizures. Evidence from patients and animal models suggest seizures are more likely to start in the ventral hippocampus. It is thought that disruptions in ion channel expression contributes to the generation of spontaneous seizures. In this study, we compared the intrinsic properties of neurons at either end of hippocampal area CA1 in chronic epilepsy and found that through a reduction in HCN channel expression the intrinsic properties of neurons in dorsal CA1 change to resemble the properties of ventral CA1 neurons. This work provides an anatomical context for the pathophysiological changes associated with epilepsy, and has implications for finding better treatments for epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Patients with MS typically present with visual, motor, and sensory deficits. However, an additional complication of MS in large subset of patients is neuropathic pain. To study the underlying immune-mediated pathophysiology of pain in MS we employed the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalitis (MOG-EAE) model in mice. Since sensory neurons are crucial for nociceptive transduction, we investigated the effect of this disease on sensory neurons of the lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Here, we report the disease was associated with activation of the complement system and the NLRP3 inflammasome in the DRG. We further observe a transient increase in the number of complement component 5a receptor 1-positive (C5aR1+) immune cells, CD4+ T-cells, and Iba1+ macrophages in the DRG. The absence of any significant change in the levels of mRNA for myelin proteins in the DRG and the sciatic nerve suggests that demyelination in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is not a trigger for the immune response in the DRG. However, we did observe an induction of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) at disease onset and chronic disruption of cytoskeletal proteins in the DRG demonstrating neuronal injury in the PNS in response to the disease. Electrophysiological analysis revealed the emergence of hyperexcitability in medium-to-large (≥26 µm) diameter neurons, especially at the onset of MOG-EAE signs. These results provide conclusive evidence of immune activation, neuronal injury, and peripheral sensitization in MOG-EAE, a model classically considered to be centrally-mediated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) involves central nervous system inflammation, demyelinating plaques, and neurodegeneration. Neuropathic pain is a common symptom of MS thought to occur as a result of disease pathology in the central nervous system. On the contrary, here, we demonstrate that the peripheral nervous system in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (MOG-EAE), a currently used T-cell mediated model of MS, experiences transient inflammation, cellular injury, and chronic cytoskeletal disruption. Furthermore, putative myelinating, medium-to-large diameter sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia show aberrant electrophysiological properties. Our data suggests that pain in MOG-EAE may at least in part be due to disease-mediated sensitization of primary afferents, ultimately enhancing sensory input into the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Circuit Dysfunction in SOD1-ALS Model First Detected in Sensory Feedback Prior to Motor Neuron Degeneration Is Alleviated by BMP Signaling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2347?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease for which the origin and underlying cellular defects are not fully understood. Although motor neuron degeneration is the signature feature of ALS, it is not clear whether motor neurons or other cells of the motor circuit are the site of disease initiation. To better understand the contribution of multiple cell types in ALS, we made use of a &lt;i&gt;Drosophila Sod1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G85R&lt;/sup&gt; knock-in model, in which all cells harbor the disease allele. End-stage &lt;i&gt;dSod1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G85R&lt;/sup&gt; animals of both sexes exhibit severe motor deficits with clear degeneration of motor neurons. Interestingly, earlier in &lt;i&gt;dSod1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G85R&lt;/sup&gt; larvae, motor function is also compromised, but their motor neurons exhibit only subtle morphological and electrophysiological changes that are unlikely to cause the observed decrease in locomotion. We analyzed the intact motor circuit and identified a defect in sensory feedback that likely accounts for the altered motor activity of &lt;i&gt;dSod1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G85R&lt;/sup&gt;. We found cell-autonomous activation of bone morphogenetic protein signaling in proprioceptor sensory neurons which are critical for the relay of the contractile status of muscles back to the central nerve cord, completely rescues early-stage motor defects and partially rescue late-stage motor function to extend lifespan. Identification of a defect in sensory feedback as a potential initiating event in ALS motor dysfunction, coupled with the ability of modified proprioceptors to alleviate such motor deficits, underscores the critical role that nonmotor neurons play in disease progression and highlights their potential as a site to identify early-stage ALS biomarkers and for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; At diagnosis, many cellular processes are already disrupted in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patient. Identifying the initiating cellular events is critical for achieving an earlier diagnosis to slow or prevent disease progression. Our findings indicate that neurons relaying sensory information underlie early stage motor deficits in a &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; knock-in model of ALS that best replicates gene dosage in familial ALS (fALS). Importantly, studies on intact motor circuits revealed defects in sensory feedback before evidence of motor neuron degeneration. These findings strengthen our understanding of how neural circuit dysfunctions lead to neurodegeneration and, coupled with our demonstration that the activation of bone morphogenetic protein signaling in proprioceptors alleviates both early and late motor dysfunction, underscores the importance of considering nonmotor neurons as therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Regulatory T Cells and Their Derived Cytokine, Interleukin-35, Reduce Pain in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sensory problems such as neuropathic pain are common and debilitating symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the CNS. Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis, but their role in MS-associated pain remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Treg cell ablation is sufficient to trigger experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and facial allodynia in immunized female mice. In EAE-induced female mice, adoptive transfer of Treg cells and spinal delivery of the Treg cell cytokine interleukin-35 (IL-35) significantly reduced facial stimulus-evoked pain and spontaneous pain independent of disease severity and increased myelination of the facial nociceptive pathway. The effects of intrathecal IL-35 therapy were Treg-cell dependent and associated with upregulated IL-10 expression in CNS-infiltrating lymphocytes and reduced monocyte infiltration in the trigeminal afferent pathway. We present evidence for a beneficial role of Treg cells and IL-35 in attenuating pain associated with EAE independently of motor symptoms by decreasing neuroinflammation and increasing myelination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pain is a highly prevalent symptom affecting the majority of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and dramatically affects overall health-related quality of life; however, this is a research area that has been largely ignored. Here, we identify for the first time a role for regulatory T (Treg) cells and interleukin-35 (IL-35) in suppressing facial allodynia and facial grimacing in animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We demonstrate that spinal delivery of Treg cells and IL-35 reduces pain associated with EAE by decreasing neuroinflammation and increasing myelination independently of motor symptoms. These findings increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain in EAE and suggest potential treatment strategies for pain relief in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Optogenetic Stimulation of the Superior Colliculus Confers Retinal Neuroprotection in a Mouse Glaucoma Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2313?rss=1</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is characterized by a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the eye, which ultimately results in visual impairment or even blindness. Because current therapies often fail to halt disease progression, there is an unmet need for novel neuroprotective therapies to support RGC survival. Various research lines suggest that visual target centers in the brain support RGC functioning and survival. Here, we explored whether increasing neuronal activity in one of these projection areas could improve survival of RGCs in a mouse glaucoma model. Prolonged activation of an important murine RGC target area, the superior colliculus (SC), was established via a novel optogenetic stimulation paradigm. By leveraging the unique channel kinetics of the stabilized step function opsin (SSFO), protracted stimulation of the SC was achieved with only a brief light pulse. SSFO-mediated collicular stimulation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for the immediate-early gene c-Fos and behavioral tracking, which both demonstrated consistent neuronal activity upon repeated stimulation. Finally, the neuroprotective potential of optogenetic collicular stimulation was investigated in mice of either sex subjected to a glaucoma model and a 63% reduction in RGC loss was found. This work describes a new paradigm for optogenetic collicular stimulation and a first demonstration that increasing target neuron activity can increase survival of the projecting neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite glaucoma being a leading cause of blindness and visual impairment worldwide, no curative therapies exist. This study describes a novel paradigm to reduce retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration underlying glaucoma. Building on previous observations that RGC survival is supported by the target neurons to which they project and using an innovative optogenetic approach, we increased neuronal activity in the mouse superior colliculus, a main projection target of rodent RGCs. This proved to be efficient in reducing RGC loss in a glaucoma model. Our findings establish a new optogenetic paradigm for target stimulation and encourage further exploration of the molecular signaling pathways mediating retrograde neuroprotective communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Neural Mechanisms of Spatial Attention and Expectation Guide Perceptual Inference in a Multisensory World</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2301?rss=1</guid>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2301?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Spatial attention (i.e., task-relevance) and expectation (i.e., signal probability) are two critical top-down mechanisms guiding perceptual inference. Spatial attention prioritizes processing of information at task-relevant locations. Spatial expectations encode the statistical structure of the environment. An unresolved question is how the brain allocates attention and forms expectations in a multisensory environment, where task-relevance and signal probability over space can differ across sensory modalities. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in human participants (female and male) to investigate whether the brain encodes task-relevance and signal probability over space separately or interactively across sensory modalities. In a novel multisensory paradigm, we manipulated spatial attention and expectation selectively in audition and assessed their effects on behavioral and neural responses to auditory and visual stimuli. Our results show that both auditory and visual stimuli increased activations in a right-lateralized frontoparietal system, when they were presented at locations that were task-irrelevant in audition. Yet, only auditory stimuli increased activations in the medial prefrontal cortex when presented at expected locations and in audiovisual and frontoparietal cortices signaling a prediction error when presented at unexpected locations. This dissociation in multisensory generalization for attention and expectation effects shows that the brain controls attentional resources interactively across the senses but encodes the statistical structure of the environment as spatial expectations independently for each sensory system. Our results demonstrate that spatial attention and expectation engage partly overlapping neural systems via distinct mechanisms to guide perceptual inference in a multisensory world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In our natural environment the brain is exposed to a constant influx of signals through all our senses. How does the brain allocate attention and form spatial expectations in this multisensory environment? Because observers need to respond to stimuli regardless of their sensory modality, they may allocate attentional resources and encode the probability of events jointly across the senses. This psychophysics and neuroimaging study shows that the brain controls attentional resources interactively across the senses via a frontoparietal system but encodes the statistical structure of the environment independently for each sense in sensory and frontoparietal areas. Thus, spatial attention and expectation engage partly overlapping neural systems via distinct mechanisms to guide perceptual inference in a multisensory world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Neural Processing of Communication Signals: The Extent of Sender-Receiver Matching Varies across Species of Apteronotus</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;As communication signal properties change, through genetic drift or selective pressure, the sensory systems that receive these signals must also adapt to maintain sensitivity and adaptability in an array of contexts. Shedding light on this process helps us to understand how sensory codes are tailored to specific tasks. In a species of weakly electric fish, &lt;i&gt;Apteronotus albifrons&lt;/i&gt;, we examined the unique neurophysiological properties that support the encoding of electrosensory communication signals that the animal encounters in social exchanges. We compare our findings to the known coding properties of the closely related species &lt;i&gt;Apteronotus leptorhynchus&lt;/i&gt; to establish how these animals differ in their ability to encode their distinctive communication signals. While there are many similarities between these two species, we found notable differences leading to relatively poor coding of the details of chirp structure occurring on high-frequency background beats. As a result, small differences in chirp properties are poorly resolved by the nervous system. We performed behavioral tests to relate &lt;i&gt;A. albifrons&lt;/i&gt; chirp coding strategies to its use of chirps during social encounters. Our results suggest that &lt;i&gt;A. albifrons&lt;/i&gt; does not exchange frequent chirps in a nonbreeding condition, particularly when the beat frequency is high. These findings parallel the mediocre chirp coding accuracy in that they both point to a reduced reliance on frequent and rich exchange of information through chirps during these social interactions. Therefore, our study suggests that neural coding strategies in the CNS vary across species in a way that parallels the behavioral use of the sensory signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Electrophysiological Properties of Medium Spiny Neuron Subtypes in the Caudate-Putamen of Prepubertal Male and Female Drd1a-tdTomato Line 6 BAC Transgenic Mice</title>

	<description>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The caudate-putamen is a striatal brain region essential for sensorimotor behaviors, habit learning, and other cognitive and premotor functions. The output and predominant neuron of the caudate-putamen is the medium spiny neuron (MSN). MSNs present discrete cellular subtypes that show differences in neurochemistry, dopamine receptor expression, efferent targets, gene expression, functional roles, and most importantly for this study, electrophysiological properties. MSN subtypes include the striatonigral and the striatopallidal groups. Most studies identify the striatopallidal MSN subtype as being more excitable than the striatonigral MSN subtype. However, there is some divergence between studies regarding the exact differences in electrophysiological properties. Furthermore, MSN subtype electrophysiological properties have not been reported disaggregated by biological sex. We addressed these questions using prepubertal male and female Drd1a-tdTomato line 6 BAC transgenic mice, an important transgenic line that has not yet received extensive electrophysiological analysis. We made acute caudate-putamen brain slices and assessed a robust battery of 16 relevant electrophysiological properties using whole-cell patch-clamp recording, including intrinsic membrane, action potential, and miniature EPSC (mEPSC) properties. We found that: (1) MSN subtypes exhibited multiple differential electrophysiological properties in both sexes, including rheobase, action potential threshold and width, input resistance in both the linear and rectified ranges, and mEPSC amplitude; (2) select electrophysiological properties showed interactions between MSN subtype and sex. These findings provide a comprehensive evaluation of mouse caudate-putamen MSN subtype electrophysiological properties across females and males, both confirming and extending previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Rethinking interhemispheric imbalance as a target for stroke neurorehabilitation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25452?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25452?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with chronic stroke have been shown to have failure to release interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) from the intact to the damaged hemisphere before movement execution (premovement IHI). This inhibitory imbalance was found to correlate with poor motor performance in the chronic stage after stroke and has since become a target for therapeutic interventions. The logic of this approach, however, implies that abnormal premovement IHI is causal to poor behavioral outcome and should therefore be present early after stroke when motor impairment is at its worst. To test this idea, in a longitudinal study, we investigated interhemispheric interactions by tracking patients’ premovement IHI for one year following stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assessed premovement IHI and motor behavior five times over a 1‐year period after ischemic stroke in 22 patients and 11 healthy participants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that premovement IHI was normal during the acute/subacute period and only became abnormal at the chronic stage; specifically, release of IHI in movement preparation worsened as motor behavior improved. In addition, premovement IHI did not correlate with behavioral measures cross‐sectionally, whereas the longitudinal emergence of abnormal premovement IHI from the acute to the chronic stage was inversely correlated with recovery of finger individuation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that interhemispheric imbalance is not a cause of poor motor recovery, but instead might be the consequence of underlying recovery processes. These findings call into question the rehabilitation strategy of attempting to rebalance interhemispheric interactions in order to improve motor recovery after stroke.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: A case–control–family study of idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25435?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25435?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the familial aggregation of idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), neurodegenerative diseases, and related biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 404 and 387 first‐degree relatives of 102 patients with iRBD and of 89 controls were recruited, respectively. Among them, 204 and 208 relatives of patients and controls underwent face‐to‐face clinical assessment, whereas 97 and 75 relatives underwent further video‐polysomnographic assessment, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with relatives of controls, relatives of patients demonstrated higher levels of RBD features, including chin tonic electromyography activity (mean = 1.5 ± 7.5 vs 0.3 ± 1.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04) and behavioral events (n [weighted %] = 12 [11.3] vs 2 [1.9], adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 7.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.54–33.33, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009) during rapid eye movement sleep, probable diagnosis (n [%] = 57 [14.9] vs 20 [4.9], aHR = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.96–6.25, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and definite diagnosis (n [weighted %] = 10 [8.4] vs 2 [1.4], aHR = 5.56, 95% CI = 1.16–25.00, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). They also had higher risks of Parkinson disease (3.1% vs 0.5%, aHR = 5.88, 95% CI = 1.37–25.00, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), dementia (6.9% vs 2.6%, aHR = 2.44, 95% CI = 1.15–5.26, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), constipation (8.3% vs 2.4%, adjusted odds ratio = 4.21, 95% CI = 1.34–13.17, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01), and motor dysfunction (Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III motor score, mean = 1.9 ± 3.2 vs 0.9 ± 2.3, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). The unaffected relatives of patients demonstrated a higher likelihood ratio of prodromal Parkinson disease (median [interquartile range] = 0.27 [1.19] vs 0.22 [0.51], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iRBD is familially aggregated from isolated features to full‐blown sleep disorder. Relatives of patients carry a higher risk of alpha‐synucleinopathy in terms of neurodegenerative diseases and prodromal markers, suggesting a familial aggregation and staging pathology of alpha‐synucleinopathy.

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a central hub for the primate forebrain networks that control skilled manual behavior, including tool use. Here, we quantified and compared the sources of thalamic input to electrophysiologically-identified hand/forearm-related regions of several PPC areas, namely areas 5v, AIP, PFG, and PF, of the capuchin monkey (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sapajus&lt;/span&gt; sp). We found that these areas receive most of their thalamic connections from the Anterior Pulvinar (PuA), Lateral Posterior (LP) and Medial Pulvinar (PuM) nuclei. Each PPC area receives a specific combination of projections from these nuclei, and fewer additional projections from other nuclei. Moreover, retrograde labeling of the cells innervating different PPC areas revealed substantial intermingling of these cells within the thalamus. Differences in thalamic input may contribute to the different functional properties displayed by the PPC areas. Furthermore, the observed innervation of functionally-related PPC domains from partly intermingled thalamic cell populations accords with the notion that higher-order thalamic inputs may dynamically regulate functional connectivity between cortical areas.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Switching From Fear to No Fear by Different Neural Ensembles in Mouse Retrosplenial Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fear extinction is generally considered a form of new learning that inhibits previously acquired fear memories. Here, by tracking immediate early gene expression in vivo, we found that contextual fear extinction training evoked distinct neural ensembles in mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSC). The optogenetic reactivation of these extinction-activated neurons in the RSC was sufficient to suppress a fear response, while the reactivation of conditioning-activated neurons in the same area promoted a fear response. The generation of such an extinction-memory-related neural ensemble was associated with adult neurogenesis, as abolishing newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus via X-ray irradiation eliminated both the extinction-activated neurons in the RSC and the optogenetic-reactivation-induced suppression of contextual fear memory. Therefore, switching from fear to no fear in response to the same context is modulated by the RSC through an extinction-activated neural ensemble, the generation of which might require adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neurostimulation Reveals Context-Dependent Arbitration Between Model-Based and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;While it is established that humans use model-based (MB) and model-free (MF) reinforcement learning in a complementary fashion, much less is known about how the brain determines which of these systems should control behavior at any given moment. Here we provide causal evidence for a neural mechanism that acts as a context-dependent arbitrator between both systems. We applied excitatory and inhibitory transcranial direct current stimulation over a region of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex previously found to encode the reliability of both learning systems. The opposing neural interventions resulted in a bidirectional shift of control between MB and MF learning. Stimulation also affected the sensitivity of the arbitration mechanism itself, as it changed how often subjects switched between the dominant system over time. Both of these effects depended on varying task contexts that either favored MB or MF control, indicating that this arbitration mechanism is not context-invariant but flexibly incorporates information about current environmental demands.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The mechanism by which hepatitis C virus (HCV) gains entry into cells is a complex one, involving a broad range of host proteins. Entry is a critical phase of the viral lifecycle, and a potential target for therapeutic or vaccine-mediated intervention. However, the mechanics of HCV entry remain poorly understood. Here we describe a novel computational model of viral entry, encompassing the relationship between HCV and the key host receptors CD81 and SR-B1. We conduct experiments to thoroughly quantify the influence of an increase or decrease in receptor availability upon the extent of viral entry. We use these data to build and parameterise a mathematical model, which we then validate by further experiments. Our results are consistent with sequential HCV-receptor interactions, whereby initial interaction between the HCV E2 glycoprotein and SR-B1 facilitates the accumulation CD81 receptors, leading to viral entry. However, we also demonstrate that a small minority of virus can achieve entry in the absence of SR-B1. Our model estimates the impact of the different obstacles that viruses must surmount to achieve entry; among virus particles attaching to the cell surface, around one third of viruses accumulate sufficient CD81 receptors, of which 4–8% then complete the subsequent steps to achieve productive infection. Furthermore, we make estimates of receptor stoichiometry; in excess of 10 receptors are likely to be required to achieve viral entry. Our model provides a tool to investigate the entry characteristics of HCV variants and outlines a framework for future quantitative studies of the multi-receptor dynamics of HCV entry.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z-aktaoyIsc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Endemicity and prevalence of multipartite viruses under heterogeneous between-host transmission</title>

Multipartite viruses replicate through a puzzling evolutionary strategy. Their genome is segmented into two or more parts, and encapsidated in separate particles that appear to propagate independently. Completing the replication cycle, however, requires the full genome, so that a systemic infection of a host requires the concurrent presence of several particles. This represents an apparent evolutionary drawback of multipartitism, while its advantages remain unclear. A transition from monopartite to multipartite viral forms has been described &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; under conditions of high multiplicity of infection, suggesting that cooperation between defective mutants is a plausible evolutionary pathway towards multipartitism. However, it is unknown how the putative advantages that multipartitism might enjoy at the microscopic level affect its epidemiology, or if an explicit advantange is needed to explain its ecological persistence. In order to disentangle which mechanisms might contribute to the rise and fixation of multipartitism, we here investigate the interaction between viral spreading dynamics and host population structure. We set up a compartmental model of the spread of a virus in its different forms and explore its epidemiology using both analytical and numerical techniques. We uncover that the impact of host contact structure on spreading dynamics entails a rich phenomenology of ecological relationships that includes cooperation, competition, and commensality. Furthermore, we find out that multipartitism might rise to fixation even in the absence of explicit microscopic advantages. Multipartitism allows the virus to colonize environments that could not be invaded by the monopartite form, while homogeneous contacts between hosts facilitate its spread. We conjecture that these features might have led to an increase in the diversity and prevalence of multipartite viral forms concomitantly with the expansion of agricultural practices.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JYfD-zG8_Sk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Visual pattern detection and discrimination are essential first steps for scene analysis. Numerous human psychophysical studies have modeled visual pattern detection and discrimination by estimating linear templates for classifying noisy stimuli defined by spatial variations in pixel intensities. However, such methods are poorly suited to understanding sensory processing mechanisms for complex visual stimuli such as second-order boundaries defined by spatial differences in contrast or texture. We introduce a novel machine learning framework for modeling human perception of second-order visual stimuli, using image-computable hierarchical neural network models fit directly to psychophysical trial data. This framework is applied to modeling visual processing of boundaries defined by differences in the contrast of a carrier texture pattern, in two different psychophysical tasks: (1) boundary orientation identification, and (2) fine orientation discrimination. Cross-validation analysis is employed to optimize model hyper-parameters, and demonstrate that these models are able to accurately predict human performance on novel stimulus sets not used for fitting model parameters. We find that, like the ideal observer, human observers take a region-based approach to the orientation identification task, while taking an edge-based approach to the fine orientation discrimination task. How observers integrate contrast modulation across orientation channels is investigated by fitting psychophysical data with two models representing competing hypotheses, revealing a preference for a model which combines multiple orientations at the earliest possible stage. Our results suggest that this machine learning approach has much potential to advance the study of second-order visual processing, and we outline future steps towards generalizing the method to modeling visual segmentation of natural texture boundaries. This study demonstrates how machine learning methodology can be fruitfully applied to psychophysical studies of second-order visual processing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mXErxRfGs4Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We use stochastic neural field theory to analyze the stimulus-dependent tuning of neural variability in ring attractor networks. We apply perturbation methods to show how the neural field equations can be reduced to a pair of stochastic nonlinear phase equations describing the stochastic wandering of spontaneously formed tuning curves or bump solutions. These equations are analyzed using a modified version of the bivariate von Mises distribution, which is well-known in the theory of circular statistics. We first consider a single ring network and derive a simple mathematical expression that accounts for the experimentally observed bimodal (or M-shaped) tuning of neural variability. We then explore the effects of inter-network coupling on stimulus-dependent variability in a pair of ring networks. These could represent populations of cells in two different layers of a cortical hypercolumn linked via vertical synaptic connections, or two different cortical hypercolumns linked by horizontal patchy connections within the same layer. We find that neural variability can be suppressed or facilitated, depending on whether the inter-network coupling is excitatory or inhibitory, and on the relative strengths and biases of the external stimuli to the two networks. These results are consistent with the general observation that increasing the mean firing rate via external stimuli or modulating drives tends to reduce neural variability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YRSKMlstR3Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Self-organization of conducting pathways explains electrical wave propagation in cardiac tissues with high fraction of non-conducting cells</title>

Cardiac fibrosis occurs in many forms of heart disease and is considered to be one of the main arrhythmogenic factors. Regions with a high density of fibroblasts are likely to cause blocks of wave propagation that give rise to dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, studies of the wave propagation through these regions are very important, yet the precise mechanisms leading to arrhythmia formation in fibrotic cardiac tissue remain poorly understood. Particularly, it is not clear how wave propagation is organized at the cellular level, as experiments show that the regions with a high percentage of fibroblasts (65-75%) are still conducting electrical signals, whereas geometric analysis of randomly distributed conducting and non-conducting cells predicts connectivity loss at 40% at the most (percolation threshold). To address this question, we used a joint &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; approach, which combined experiments in neonatal rat cardiac monolayers with morphological and electrophysiological computer simulations. We have shown that the main reason for sustainable wave propagation in highly fibrotic samples is the formation of a branching network of cardiomyocytes. We have successfully reproduced the morphology of conductive pathways in computer modelling, assuming that cardiomyocytes align their cytoskeletons to fuse into cardiac syncytium. The electrophysiological properties of the monolayers, such as conduction velocity, conduction blocks and wave fractionation, were reproduced as well. In a virtual cardiac tissue, we have also examined the wave propagation at the subcellular level, detected wavebreaks formation and its relation to the structure of fibrosis and, thus, analysed the processes leading to the onset of arrhythmias.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oJ7vIl7BoVg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether high‐frequency oscillations (HFOs) show spatiotemporal propagation and assess the relevance of the earliest oscillations in relation to the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and postsurgical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We retrospectively investigated the intracerebral electroencephalography (EEG) of patients who became seizure free after subsequent surgery. We marked HFOs during 1 hour of recordings. We calculated the time delay between pairs of channels as the median delay between their HFOs and constructed a time line of the delay of each channel with respect to the earliest channel (first source channel). A network was defined when a temporal order could be established among the channels based on the existence of statistically significant delays.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen patients with good surgical outcome were included. We found ripple networks in all patients, and fast ripple networks in 9. For ripples, first source channels were found in a higher proportion in the SOZ than the rest of the network channels (15 of 27 [56%] versus 93 of 262 [35%]; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04). For both ripples and fast ripples, first source channels were resected more often that the rest of the network channels (ripples: 13 of 27 [48%] versus 65 of 262 [25%]; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01; fast ripples: 8 of 9 [89%] versus 17 of 40 [43%]; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002); channels with the highest rates of ripples and fast ripples were resected in a similar proportion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate that interictal HFOs are organized in networks and indicate a possible need for the resection of first source channels. However, resecting them is not superior to resecting channels with highest rates of HFOs. Ann Neurol, 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Role of Redox Dysregulation in the Effects of Prenatal Stress on Embryonic Interneuron Migration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz052</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz052/5382211?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Maternal stress during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of psychiatric disorders in offspring, but embryonic brain mechanisms disrupted by prenatal stress are not fully understood. Our lab has shown that prenatal stress delays inhibitory neural progenitor migration. Here, we investigated redox dysregulation as a mechanism for embryonic cortical interneuron migration delay, utilizing direct manipulation of pro- and antioxidants and a mouse model of maternal repetitive restraint stress starting on embryonic day 12. Time-lapse, live-imaging of migrating GAD67GFP+ interneurons showed that normal tangential migration of inhibitory progenitor cells was disrupted by the pro-oxidant, hydrogen peroxide. Interneuron migration was also delayed by in utero intracerebroventricular rotenone. Prenatal stress altered glutathione levels and induced changes in activity of antioxidant enzymes and expression of redox-related genes in the embryonic forebrain. Assessment of dihydroethidium (DHE) fluorescence after prenatal stress in ganglionic eminence (GE), the source of migrating interneurons, showed increased levels of DHE oxidation. Maternal antioxidants (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;-acetylcysteine and astaxanthin) normalized DHE oxidation levels in GE and ameliorated the migration delay caused by prenatal stress. Through convergent redox manipula-tions, delayed interneuron migration after prenatal stress was found to critically involve redox dysregulation. Redox biology during prenatal periods may be a target for protecting brain development.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: The Hyperpolarization-Activated HCN4 Channel is Important for Proper Maintenance of Oscillatory Activity in the Thalamocortical System</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz047</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz047/5382209?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Hyperpolarization-activated cation channels are involved, among other functions, in learning and memory, control of synaptic transmission and epileptogenesis. The importance of the HCN1 and HCN2 isoforms for brain function has been demonstrated, while the role of HCN4, the third major neuronal HCN subunit, is not known. Here we show that HCN4 is essential for oscillatory activity in the thalamocortical (TC) network. HCN4 is selectively expressed in various thalamic nuclei, excluding the thalamic reticular nucleus. HCN4-deficient TC neurons revealed a massive reduction of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ih&lt;/span&gt; and strongly reduced intrinsic burst firing, whereas the current was normal in cortical pyramidal neurons. In addition, evoked bursting in a thalamic slice preparation was strongly reduced in the mutant mice probes. HCN4-deficiency also significantly slowed down thalamic and cortical oscillations during active wakefulness. Taken together, these results establish that thalamic HCN4 channels are essential for the production of rhythmic intrathalamic oscillations and determine regular TC oscillatory activity during alert states.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prefrontal Cortical and Behavioral Adaptations to Surgical Delivery Mediated by Metabolic Principles</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz046</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz046/5382210?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We previously observed an association between mode of delivery and brain mitochondrial mechanisms in pups. We also showed that mitochondrial processes impact adult behavior. However, no experimental data is available to causally connect mode of delivery with cellular processes of neurons in the cerebral cortex and adult behavior. Here we show that surgical delivery of pups alters mitochondrial dynamics and spine synapses of layer 3 pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex compared to the values of mice delivered vaginally. These alterations in ultrastructure seen in adult mice delivered surgically were associated with the development of behavioral phenotypes resembling those characteristic of animal models of psychiatric illness. This included impaired performance in prepulse inhibition as well as hyperlocomotion in the open field and elevated plus maze tests. Knocking out a mitochondria-related gene, UCP-2, blocked cellular and behavioral adaptations induced by surgical delivery. These results highlight a crucial role for brain mitochondrial adaptations in the process of birth to affect neuronal circuitry in support of normal and altered adult behaviors. Further, these findings were supported with neuroimaging data from human neonates delivered vaginally and surgically, suggesting that the murine findings have human clinical relevance.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Corticostriatal Circuits Encode the Subjective Value of Perceived Control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz045</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz045/5382206?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The ability to perceive and exercise control over an outcome is both desirable and beneficial to our well-being. It has been shown that animals and humans alike exhibit behavioral bias towards seeking control and that such bias recruits the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatum. Yet, this bias remains to be quantitatively captured and studied neurally. Here, we employed a behavioral task to measure the preference for control and characterize its neural underpinnings. Participants made a series of binary choices between having control and no-control over a game for monetary reward. The mere presence of the control option evoked activity in the ventral striatum. Importantly, we manipulated the expected value (EV) of each choice pair to extract the pairing where participants were equally likely to choose either option. The difference in EV between the options at this point of equivalence was inferred as the subjective value of control. Strikingly, perceiving control inflated the reward value of the associated option by 30% and this value inflation was tracked by the vmPFC. Altogether, these results capture the subjective value of perceived control inherent in decision making and highlight the role of corticostriatal circuitry in the perception of control.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Dynamic Causal Modeling of the Relationship between Cognition and Theta–alpha Oscillations in Adults with Down Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz043</guid>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) show high inter-subject variability in cognitive ability and have an ultra-high risk of developing dementia (90% lifetime prevalence). Elucidating factors underlying variability in cognitive function can inform us about intellectual disability (ID) and may improve our understanding of factors associated with later cognitive decline. Increased neuronal inhibition has been posited to contribute to ID in DS. Combining electroencephalography (EEG) with dynamic causal modeling (DCM) provides a non-invasive method for investigating excitatory/inhibitory mechanisms. Resting-state EEG recordings were obtained from 36 adults with DS with no evidence of cognitive decline. Theta–alpha activity (4–13 Hz) was characterized in relation to general cognitive ability (raw Kaufmann’s Brief Intelligence Test second Edition (KBIT-2) score). Higher KBIT-2 was associated with higher frontal alpha peak amplitude and higher theta–alpha band power across distributed regions. Modeling this association with DCM revealed intrinsic self-inhibition was the key network parameter underlying observed differences in 4–13 Hz power in relation to KBIT-2 and age. In particular, intrinsic self-inhibition in right V1 was negatively correlated with KBIT-2. Results suggest intrinsic self-inhibition within the alpha network is associated with individual differences in cognitive ability in adults with DS, and may provide a potential therapeutic target for cognitive enhancement.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: When Conflict Cannot be Avoided: Relative Contributions of Early Selection and Frontal Executive Control in Mitigating Stroop Conflict</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz042</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz042/5382203?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;When viewing familiar stimuli (e.g., common words), processing is highly automatized such that it can interfere with the processing of incompatible sensory information. At least two mechanisms may help mitigate this interference. Early selection accounts posit that attentional processes filter out distracting sensory information to avoid conflict. Alternatively, late selection accounts hold that all sensory inputs receive full semantic analysis and that frontal executive mechanisms are recruited to resolve conflict. To test how these mechanisms operate to overcome conflict induced by highly automatized processing, we developed a novel version of the color-word Stroop task, where targets and distractors were simultaneously flickered at different frequencies. We measured the quality of early sensory processing by assessing the amplitude of steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by targets and distractors. We also indexed frontal executive processes by assessing changes in frontal theta oscillations induced by color-word incongruency. We found that target- and distractor-related SSVEPs were not modulated by changes in the level of conflict whereas frontal theta activity increased on high compared to low conflict trials. These results suggest that frontal executive processes play a more dominant role in mitigating cognitive interference driven by the automatic tendency to process highly familiar stimuli.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Phosphodiesterase 1 Bridges Glutamate Inputs with NO- and Dopamine-Induced Cyclic Nucleotide Signals in the Striatum</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The calcium-regulated phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1) family is highly expressed in the brain, but its functional role in neurones is poorly understood. Using the selective PDE1 inhibitor Lu AF64196 and biosensors for cyclic nucleotides including a novel biosensor for cGMP, we analyzed the effect of PDE1 on cAMP and cGMP in individual neurones in brain slices from male newborn mice. Release of caged NMDA triggered a transient increase of intracellular calcium, which was associated with a decrease in cAMP and cGMP in medium spiny neurones in the striatum. Lu AF64196 alone did not increase neuronal cyclic nucleotide levels, but blocked the NMDA-induced reduction in cyclic nucleotides indicating that this was mediated by calcium-activated PDE1. Similar effects were observed in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Upon corelease of dopamine and NMDA, PDE1 was shown to down-regulate the D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-receptor mediated increase in cAMP. PDE1 inhibition increased long-term potentiation in rat ventral striatum, showing that PDE1 is implicated in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Overall, our results show that PDE1 reduces cyclic nucleotide signaling in the context of glutamate and dopamine coincidence. This effect could have a therapeutic value for treating brain disorders related to dysfunctions in dopamine neuromodulation.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Premotor Cortex Provides a Substrate for the Temporal Transformation of Information During the Planning of Gait Modifications</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We tested the hypothesis that the premotor cortex (PMC) in the cat contributes to the planning and execution of visually guided gait modifications. We analyzed single unit activity from 136 cells localized within layer V of cytoarchitectonic areas 6iffu and that part of 4δ within the ventral bank of the cruciate sulcus while cats walked on a treadmill and stepped over an obstacle that advanced toward them. We found a rich variety of discharge patterns, ranging from limb-independent cells that discharged several steps in front of the obstacle to step-related cells that discharged either during steps over the obstacle or in the steps leading up to that step. We propose that this population of task-related cells within this region of the PMC contributes to the temporal evolution of a planning process that transforms global information of the presence of an obstacle into the precise spatio-temporal limb adjustment required to negotiate that obstacle.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: No Evidence that Predictions and Attention Modulate the First Feedforward Sweep of Cortical Information Processing</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz038</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz038/5382202?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Predictive coding models propose that predictions (stimulus likelihood) reduce sensory signals as early as primary visual cortex (V1), and that attention (stimulus relevance) can modulate these effects. Indeed, both prediction and attention have been shown to modulate V1 activity, albeit with fMRI, which has low temporal resolution. This leaves it unclear whether these effects reflect a modulation of the first feedforward sweep of visual information processing and/or later, feedback-related activity. In two experiments, we used electroencephalography and orthogonally manipulated spatial predictions and attention to address this issue. Although clear top-down biases were found, as reflected in pre-stimulus alpha-band activity, we found no evidence for top-down effects on the earliest visual cortical processing stage (&amp;lt;80 ms post-stimulus), as indexed by the amplitude of the C1 event-related potential component and multivariate pattern analyses. These findings indicate that initial visual afferent activity may be impenetrable to top-down influences by spatial prediction and attention.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Acute Inescapable Stress Rapidly Increases Synaptic Energy Metabolism in Prefrontal Cortex and Alters Working Memory Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhz034</guid>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz034/5382201?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain energy metabolism actively regulates synaptic transmission and activity. We have previously shown that acute footshock (FS)-stress induces fast and long-lasting functional and morphological changes at excitatory synapses in prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here, we asked whether FS-stress increased energy metabolism in PFC, and modified related cognitive functions. Using positron emission tomography (PET), we found that FS-stress induced a redistribution of glucose metabolism in the brain, with relative decrease of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake in ventro-caudal regions and increase in dorso-rostral ones. Absolute [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake was inversely correlated with serum corticosterone. Increased specific hexokinase activity was also measured in purified PFC synaptosomes (but not in total extract) of FS-stressed rats, which positively correlated with 2-Deoxy [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H] glucose uptake by synaptosomes. In line with increased synaptic energy demand, using an electron microscopy-based stereological approach, we found that acute stress induced a redistribution of mitochondria at excitatory synapses, together with an increase in their volume. The fast functional and metabolic activation of PFC induced by acute stress, was accompanied by rapid and sustained alterations of working memory performance in delayed response to T-maze test. Taken together, the present data suggest that acute stress increases energy consumption at PFC synaptic terminals and alters working memory.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Reduced Hippocampal Dendrite Branching, Spine Density and Neurocognitive Function in Premature Rabbits, and Reversal with Estrogen or TrkB Agonist Treatment</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Preterm-born children suffer from neurological and behavioral disorders. Herein, we hypothesized that premature birth and non-maternal care of preterm newborns might disrupt neurobehavioral function, hippocampal dendritic arborization, and dendritic spine density. Additionally, we assessed whether 17β-estradiol (E2) replacement or the TrkB receptor agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), would reverse compromised dendritic development and cognitive function in preterm newborns. These hypotheses were tested by comparing preterm (E28.5) rabbit kits cared and gavage-fed by laboratory personnel and term-kits reared and breast-fed by their mother doe at an equivalent postconceptional age. Neurobehavioral tests showed that both premature-birth and formula-feeding with non-maternal care led to increased anxiety behavior, poor social interaction, and lack of novelty preference compared with term-kits. Dendritic branching and number of total or mushroom dendritic spines were reduced in the CA1 field of preterm-kits compared with term controls. While CDC42 and Rac1/2/3 expression levels were lower, RhoA-activity was higher in preterm-kits compared with term controls. Both E2 and DHF treatment reversed prematurity-induced reduction in spine density, reduced total RhoA-GTPase levels, and enhanced cognitive function. Hence, prematurity and non-maternal care result in cognitive deficits, and reduced dendritic arbors and spines in CA1. E2 replacement or DHF treatment might reverse changes in dendritic spines and improve neurodevelopment in premature infants.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Deletion of the KH1 Domain of Fmr1 Leads to Transcriptional Alterations and Attentional Deficits in Rats</title>

	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;FMR1&lt;/span&gt; gene. It is a leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder and inherited intellectual disability and is often comorbid with attention deficits. Most FXS cases are due to an expansion of CGG repeats leading to suppressed expression of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein involved in mRNA metabolism. We found that the previously published &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1&lt;/span&gt; knockout rat model of FXS expresses an &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1&lt;/span&gt; transcript with an in-frame deletion of exon 8, which encodes for the K-homology (KH) RNA-binding domain, KH1. Notably, 3 pathogenic missense mutations associated with FXS lie in the KH domains. We observed that the deletion of exon 8 in rats leads to attention deficits and to alterations in transcriptional profiles within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which map to 2 weighted gene coexpression network modules. These modules are conserved in human frontal cortex and enriched for known FMRP targets. Hub genes in these modules represent potential therapeutic targets for FXS. Taken together, these findings indicate that attentional testing might be a reliable cross-species tool for investigating FXS and identify dysregulated conserved gene networks in a relevant brain region.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Association Between Earliest Amyloid Uptake and Functional Connectivity in Cognitively Unimpaired Elderly</title>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz020/5382200?rss=1</link>
	<description>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Alterations in cognitive performance have been noted in nondemented subjects with elevated accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrils. However, it is not yet understood whether brain function is already influenced by Aβ deposition during the very earliest stages of the disease. We therefore investigated associations between [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]Flutemetamol PET, resting-state functional connectivity, gray and white matter structure and cognitive performance in 133 cognitively normal elderly that exhibited normal global Aβ PET levels. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]Flutemetamol uptake in regions known to accumulate Aβ fibrils early in preclinical AD (i.e., mainly certain parts of the default-mode network) was positively associated with dynamic but not static functional connectivity (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; = 0.77). Dynamic functional connectivity was further related to better cognitive performance (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; = 0.21–0.72). No significant associations were found for Aβ uptake with gray matter volume or white matter diffusivity. The findings demonstrate that the earliest accumulation of Aβ fibrils is associated with increased functional connectivity, which occurs before any structural alterations. The enhanced functional connectivity may reflect a compensatory mechanism to maintain high cognitive performance in the presence of increasing amyloid accumulation during the earliest phases of AD.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<description>Social interactions are fundamental to survival and overall health. The mechanisms underlying social behavior are complex, but we now know that immune signaling plays a fundamental role in the regulation of social interactions. Prolonged or exaggerated alterations in social behavior often accompany altered immune signaling and function in pathological states. Thus, unraveling the link between social behavior and immune signaling is a fundamental challenge, not only to advance our understanding of human health and development, but for the design of comprehensive therapeutic approaches for neural disorders.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Boolean model of growth signaling, cell cycle and apoptosis predicts the molecular mechanism of aberrant cell cycle progression driven by hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006402</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Herbert Sizek, Andrew Hamel, Dávid Deritei, Sarah Campbell, Erzsébet Ravasz Regan&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;AKT&lt;/i&gt; signaling pathway plays a role in most cellular functions linked to cancer progression, including cell growth, proliferation, cell survival, tissue invasion and angiogenesis. It is generally recognized that hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;AKT1&lt;/i&gt; are oncogenic due to their boost to cell survival, cell cycle entry and growth-promoting metabolism. That said, the dynamics of &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;AKT1&lt;/i&gt; during cell cycle progression are highly nonlinear. In addition to negative feedback that curtails their activity, protein expression of &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; subunits has been shown to oscillate in dividing cells. The low-&lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;/low-&lt;i&gt;AKT1&lt;/i&gt; phase of these oscillations is required for cytokinesis, indicating that oncogenic &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; may directly contribute to genome duplication. To explore this, we construct a Boolean model of growth factor signaling that can reproduce &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; oscillations and link them to cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The resulting modular model reproduces hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;-driven cytokinesis failure and genome duplication and predicts the molecular drivers responsible for these failures by linking hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; to mis-regulation of Polo-like kinase 1 (&lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt;) expression late in G2. To do this, our model captures the role of &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt; in cell cycle progression and accurately reproduces multiple effects of its loss: G2 arrest, mitotic catastrophe, chromosome mis-segregation / aneuploidy due to premature anaphase, and cytokinesis failure leading to genome duplication, depending on the timing of &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt; inhibition along the cell cycle. Finally, we offer testable predictions on the molecular drivers of &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; oscillations, the timing of these oscillations with respect to division, and the role of altered &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FoxO&lt;/i&gt; activity in genome-level defects caused by hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;. Our model is an important starting point for the predictive modeling of cell fate decisions that include &lt;i&gt;AKT1&lt;/i&gt;-driven senescence, as well as the non-intuitive effects of drugs that interfere with mitosis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WyFcUBh-Z_Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

However, the first histone demethylase (HDM) was identified in 2004, challenging this notion. Since that time, more than 20 HDMs have been identified and characterized, and many have been shown to have critical roles in organismal development, cell fate, and disease. Here, we highlight some of the recent advances in our understanding of the function of HDMs in the context of neuronal development, plasticity, and disease. We focus, in particular, on molecular genetic studies of LSD1, Kdm6b, and Kdm5c that have elucidated both enzymatic and non-enzymatic gene regulatory functions of these HDMs in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>A variety of environmental regularities enable us to anticipate the timing of upcoming sensations and actions. A recent article (Breska and Ivry, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018;115:12283–12288) reports a striking neural double dissociation between two distinct varieties of temporal anticipation. Looking forward, we consider further dissociations according to the goals for which temporal anticipation is used.</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The logic of ionic homeostasis: Cations are for voltage, but not for volume</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006894</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/VHCTEZgTAC4/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrey V. Dmitriev, Alexander A. Dmitriev, Robert A. Linsenmeier&lt;/p&gt;

Neuronal activity is associated with transmembrane ionic redistribution, which can lead to an osmotic imbalance. Accordingly, activity-dependent changes of the membrane potential are sometimes accompanied by changes in intracellular and/or extracellular volume. Experimental data that include distributions of ions and volume during neuronal activity are rare and rather inconsistent partly due to the technical difficulty of performing such measurements. However, progress in understanding the interrelations among ions, voltage and volume has been achieved recently by computational modelling, particularly “charge-difference” modelling. In this work a charge-difference computational model was used for further understanding of the specific roles for cations and anions. Our simulations show that without anion conductances the transmembrane movements of cations are always osmotically balanced, regardless of the stoichiometry of the pump or the ratio of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductances. Yet any changes in cation conductance or pump activity are associated with changes of the membrane potential, even when a hypothetically electroneutral pump is used in calculations and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductances are equal. On the other hand, when a Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; conductance is present, the only way to keep the Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;equilibrium potential in accordance with the changed membrane potential is to adjust cell volume. Importantly, this voltage-evoked Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent volume change does not affect intracellular cation concentrations or the amount of energy that is necessary to support the system. Taking other factors into consideration (i.e. the presence of internal impermeant poly-anions, the activity of cation-Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; cotransporters, and the buildup of intra- and extracellular osmolytes, both charged and electroneutral) adds complexity, but does not change the main principles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VHCTEZgTAC4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Understanding narwhal diving behaviour using Hidden Markov Models with dependent state distributions and long range dependence</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006425</guid>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/8xzQ9ROcIkY/article</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Manh Cuong Ngô, Mads Peter Heide-Jørgensen, Susanne Ditlevsen&lt;/p&gt;

Diving behaviour of narwhals is still largely unknown. We use Hidden Markov models (HMMs) to describe the diving behaviour of a narwhal and fit the models to a three-dimensional response vector of maximum dive depth, duration of dives and post-dive surface time of 8,609 dives measured in East Greenland over 83 days, an extraordinarily long and rich data set. Narwhal diving patterns have not been analysed like this before, but in studies of other whale species, response variables have been assumed independent. We extend the existing models to allow for dependence between state distributions, and show that the dependence has an impact on the conclusions drawn about the diving behaviour. We try several HMMs with 2, 3 or 4 states, and with independent and dependent log-normal and gamma distributions, respectively, and different covariates to characterize dive patterns. In particular, diurnal patterns in diving behaviour is inferred, by using periodic B-splines with boundary knots in 0 and 24 hours.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8xzQ9ROcIkY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A spatio-temporal individual-based network framework for West Nile virus in the USA: Spreading pattern of West Nile virus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006875</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Sifat A. Moon, Lee W. Cohnstaedt, D. Scott McVey, Caterina M. Scoglio&lt;/p&gt;

West Nile virus (WNV)—a mosquito-borne arbovirus—entered the USA through New York City in 1999 and spread to the contiguous USA within three years while transitioning from epidemic outbreaks to endemic transmission. The virus is transmitted by vector competent mosquitoes and maintained in the avian populations. WNV spatial distribution is mainly determined by the movement of residential and migratory avian populations. We developed an individual-level heterogeneous network framework across the USA with the goal of understanding the long-range spatial distribution of WNV. To this end, we proposed three distance dispersal kernels model: 1) exponential—short-range dispersal, 2) power-law—long-range dispersal in all directions, and 3) power-law biased by flyway direction —long-range dispersal only along established migratory routes. To select the appropriate dispersal kernel we used the human case data and adopted a model selection framework based on approximate Bayesian computation with sequential Monte Carlo sampling (ABC-SMC). From estimated parameters, we find that the power-law biased by flyway direction kernel is the best kernel to fit WNV human case data, supporting the hypothesis of long-range WNV transmission is mainly along the migratory bird flyways. Through extensive simulation from 2014 to 2016, we proposed and tested hypothetical mitigation strategies and found that mosquito population reduction in the infected states and neighboring states is potentially cost-effective.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9rfZ0tOoEtc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Cholinergic system changes of falls and freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25430?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25430?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postural instability and gait difficulties (PIGDs) represent debilitating disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD). Past acetylcholinesterase positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies implicate cholinergic changes as significant contributors to PIGD features. These studies were limited in quantification of striatal cholinergic synapse integrity. Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) PET ligands are better suited for evaluation of high binding areas. We examined associations between regional VAChT expression and freezing of gait (FoG) and falls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ninety‐four PD subjects underwent clinical assessment and VAChT ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FEOBV) PET.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐five subjects (37.2%) reported a history of falls, and 15 (16%) had observed FoG. Univariate volume‐of‐interest analyses demonstrated significantly reduced thalamic (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0016) VAChT expression in fallers compared to nonfallers. VAChT expression was significantly reduced in the striatum (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0012) and limbic archicortex (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004) in freezers compared to nonfreezers. Whole‐brain voxel‐based analyses of FEOBV PET complemented these findings and showed more granular changes associated with falling history, including the right visual thalamus (especially the right lateral geniculate nucleus [LGN]), right caudate nucleus, and bilateral prefrontal regions. Freezers had prominent VAChT expression reductions in the bilateral striatum, temporal, and mesiofrontal limbic regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings confirm and extend on previous PET findings of thalamic cholinergic deficits associated with falling history and now emphasize right visual thalamus complex changes, including the right LGN. FoG status is associated with reduced VAChT expression in striatal cholinergic interneurons and the limbic archicortex. These observations suggest different cholinergic systems changes underlying falls and FoG in PD. Ann Neurol, 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In response to altered neuronal energy state, mitochondria adapt to enable energy homeostasis and nervous system function. This adaptation, also called mitochondrial plasticity, can be observed as alterations in the form, function and position. The primary site of energy consumption in neurons is localized at the synapse, where mitochondria are critical for both pre- and postsynaptic functions. In this review, we will discuss molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondrial plasticity at the synapse and how they contribute to information processing within neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify shared polygenic risk and causal associations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian randomization were applied in a large‐scale, data‐driven manner to explore genetic correlations and causal relationships between &amp;gt;700 phenotypic traits and ALS. Exposures consisted of publicly available genome‐wide association studies (GWASes) summary statistics from &lt;i&gt;MR Base&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LD‐hub&lt;/i&gt;. The outcome data came from the recently published ALS GWAS involving 20,806 cases and 59,804 controls. Multivariate analyses, genetic risk profiling, and Bayesian colocalization analyses were also performed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have shown, by linkage disequilibrium score regression, that ALS shares polygenic risk genetic factors with a number of traits and conditions, including positive correlations with smoking status and moderate levels of physical activity, and negative correlations with higher cognitive performance, higher educational attainment, and light levels of physical activity. Using Mendelian randomization, we found evidence that hyperlipidemia is a causal risk factor for ALS and localized putative functional signals within loci of interest.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we have developed a public resource (&lt;a href=&quot;https://lng-nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;https://lng-nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny&lt;/a&gt;) which we hope will become a valuable tool for the ALS community, and that will be expanded and updated as new data become available. Shared polygenic risk exists between ALS and educational attainment, physical activity, smoking, and tenseness/restlessness. We also found evidence that elevated low‐desnity lipoprotein cholesterol is a causal risk factor for ALS. Future randomized controlled trials should be considered as a proof of causality.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we examined the potential causal effect of smoking on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using the Project MinE data involving 12,577 patients with ALS and 23,475 controls in a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework. The MR approach has the potential to investigate a causal relationship between a risk factor and a disease, avoiding confounding and information bias that often present in conventional epidemiological studies. We found that smokers had a higher risk of ALS compared to never smokers. Our study thus provides evidence for a causal relationship between smoking and ALS. Ann Neurol, 2019&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Movement Vigor as a Reflection of Subjective Economic Utility</title>

	<description>To understand subjective evaluation of an option, various disciplines have quantified the interaction between reward and effort during decision making, producing an estimate of economic utility, namely the subjective ‘goodness’ of an option. However, variables that affect utility of an option also influence the vigor of movements toward that option. For example, expectation of reward increases speed of saccadic eye movements, whereas expectation of effort decreases this speed. These results imply that vigor may serve as a new, real-time metric with which to quantify subjective utility, and that the control of movements may be an implicit reflection of the brain’s economic evaluation of the expected outcome.</description>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Gene therapy improves brain white matter in aromatic l‐amino acid decarboxylase deficiency</title>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children with aromatic &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;‐amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency suffer from severe motor dysfunction. Restoration of dopamine levels in the putamen by gene therapy has led to significant improvement in motor function. This study explored brain structure changes in patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed before and 12 months after gene therapy. Whole‐brain tract‐specific analysis was performed to assess white matter microstructural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the eight patients (1.67 to 8.42 years of age) enrolled in the study, gene therapy did not affect macroscopic structure. DTI prior to gene therapy revealed lower total mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the patients than in the age‐matched pretreatment controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.017, median difference = −0.0136, 95% confidence interval [CI] [−0.0319, −0.0126]). After gene therapy, total mean FA increased (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012, median difference = 0.0211, 95% CI [0.0094, 0.0456]) and the values in the patients were not different from the age‐matched posttreatment controls. The increase in total mean FA after gene therapy in the patients was correlated with their increase in motor score (R = 0.846; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008), but was inversely correlated with their ages at the time of gene therapy (R = −0.754; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.031). The corticospinal tracts, and the thalamic radiation and callosal fibers involving motor function, improved after gene therapy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improvement in the microstructural integrity of white matter tracts is associated with the improvement in motor function following gene therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Association between Perihematomal Cerebral Blood Volume and Intracerebral Hemorrhage Expansion: a CT Perfusion Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25466?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25466?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether CT perfusion can identify intracerebral hemorrhage patients at high risk of hematoma growth (HG). A total of 155 subjects underwent CT perfusion on admission. Variables associated with log‐transformed absolute HG were explored with multivariable linear regression. Perihematomal cerebral blood volume (CBV) was inversely associated with HG (B=‐0.20,p&amp;lt;0.001), independently from blood pressure, ICH volume and other confounders. This association was not dose‐dependent and only very low CBV (&amp;lt;1.4 mL/100g) was significantly associated with HG (B=0.25,p&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, reduced perihematomal CBV is associated with HG, suggesting a potential role of the perihematomal region in the pathophysiology of hematoma enlargement.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Astrocytes usurp neurons as a disease focus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes usurp neurons as a disease focus, Published online: 11 March 2019; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0367-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-019-0367-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Astrocytes are emerging as causal or modulating factors in diverse neurological disorders. Two papers published in Nature Neuroscience in 2007 revealed astrocytes as causally contributing to motor neuron loss in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, thereby challenging the longstanding neuron-centric view of neurodegenerative disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/WR5U7O5dEHs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the lateral hypothalamic area reveals molecularly distinct populations of inhibitory and excitatory neurons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the lateral hypothalamic area reveals molecularly distinct populations of inhibitory and excitatory neurons, Published online: 11 March 2019; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0349-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-019-0349-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) regulates fundamental aspects of innate behavior. However, the circuit-level underpinnings of LHA function are poorly understood given its cellular heterogeneity. Here, Mickelsen et al. employ a single-cell RNA-sequencing approach to classify molecularly distinct cell types in the mouse LHA.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/NpcHBZeQ-10&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Be Prepared: Tune to FM-Theta for Cognitive Control</title>

	<description>Rhythmical brain activity around 5Hz can be observed in the prefrontal cortex under conditions requiring high levels of cognitive control. However, its temporal dynamics are still elusive. A recent research paper (Cooper et al. Neuroimage 2019;189:130–140) provides evidence that the temporal evolution of this frontal-midline theta activity reflects the style of cognitive control being implemented.</description>
