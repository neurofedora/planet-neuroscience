	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neurogenic inflammation including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance-P (SP) release plays a pivotal role in migraine pathogenesis. Prevalence of migraine is ~ 3 folds higher in women than in men, but its underlying mechanisms remained unclear. We investigated the effects of female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone on CGRP and SP in in-vivo and ex-vivo in rats of both sexes. For in-vivo experiments, male, female and ovariectomized rats were separated into four groups (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 7) as control, estrogen, progesterone and estrogen + progesterone, respectively. Groups received daily intraperitoneal vehicle, 17β-estradiol, progesterone and 17β-estradiol + progesterone for 5 days, respectively. For ex-vivo experiments in both sexes, isolated trigeminal ganglia and hemiskull preparations were divided into four groups (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 6 or 8), respectively, as in-vivo groups, and administered the same test substances. CGRP and SP contents in plasma and superfusates were determined using ELISA. In in-vivo experiments, 17β-estradiol decreased CGRP levels in males and SP levels in ovariectomized rats. Progesterone increased both CGRP and SP levels in females. Their combination decreased both CGRP and SP levels in males, and only SP levels in ovariectomized rats. In ex-vivo experiments, 17β-estradiol reduced CGRP release in males and SP release in females in trigeminal ganglia. While progesterone increased CGRP release in trigeminal ganglia, it reduced SP release from hemiskulls in both sexes. Their combination restored progesterone-mediated changes in neuropeptides releases in both trigeminal ganglia and hemiskulls in both sexes. Estrogen alleviates neurogenic inflammation through modulation of CGRP and SP release. Progesterone has dual effects on these neuropeptides in different sites associated with migraine pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Local syntactic violations evoke fast mismatch-related neural activity detected by optical neuroimaging</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;It remains to be investigated whether syntax-related mismatch activity would be evoked in event-related optical signals by syntactic violations that deviate from our language knowledge and expectations. In the current study, we have employed fast optical neuroimaging with a frequency-domain oximeter to examine whether syntactic violations of English bare infinitives in the non-finite complement clause would trigger syntax-related mismatch effects. Recorded sentences of bare or full infinitive structures (without or with the ‘&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;’ infinitival marker) with syntactically correct or incorrect versions and non-syntactic lexical items (verbs) were presented to native speakers of English (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 8) during silent movie viewing as a passive oddball task. The analysis of source strength (i.e., minimum norm current amplitudes) revealed that the syntactic category violations of bare object infinitives led to significantly more robust optical mismatch effects than the other syntactic violation and non-structural, lexical elements. This mismatch response had a peak latency of 186 ms in the left anterior superior temporal gyrus. In combination with our prior MEG report (Kubota et al. in Neurosci Lett 662:195–204, 2018), the present optical neuroimaging findings show that syntactic marking (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;unmarked&lt;/em&gt;-to-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;marked&lt;/em&gt;) violations of the bare object infinitive against the rule of the mental grammar enhance the signal strength exactly in the same manner seen with MEG scanning, including the peak latency of mismatch activity and the activated area of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Functional brain asymmetry for emotions: psychological stress-induced reversed hemispheric asymmetry in emotional face perception</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Empirical evidence has demonstrated functional (mostly right-biased) brain asymmetry for emotion perception, whereas recent studies indicate that acute stress may modulate left and/or right hemisphere activation. However, it is still unknown whether emotion perception can be influenced by stress-induced hemispheric activation since behavioral studies report inconsistent or even contradictory results. We sought to reevaluate this gap. Eighty-eight healthy Caucasian university students participated in the study. In half of the randomly selected participants, acute psychological stress was induced by displaying a brief stressful movie clip (the stress condition), whereas the other half were shown a neutral movie clip (the non-stress condition). Prior to (the baseline) and following the movie clip display an emotion perception task was applied by presenting an emotional (happy, surprised, fearful, sad, angry, or disgusted) or neutral face to the left or right visual field. We found a more accurate perception of emotional and neutral faces presented to the LVF (the right hemisphere) in the baseline. However, we revealed that after watching a neutral movie clip, behavioral performance in emotional and neutral face perception accuracy became relatively equalized for both visual fields, whereas after watching a stressful movie clip, the RVF (the left hemisphere) even became dominant in emotional face perception. We propose a novel hemispheric functional-equivalence model: the brain is initially right-biased in emotional and neutral face perception by default; however, psychophysiological activation of a distributed brain-network due to watching neutral movie clips redistributes hemispheric performance toward relative equivalence. Moreover, even reversed hemispheric asymmetry may occur.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Functional specialization in human dorsal pathway for stereoscopic depth processing</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Binocular disparity, a primary cue for stereoscopic depth perception, is widely represented in visual cortex. However, the functional specialization in the disparity processing network remains unclear. Using magnetic resonance imaging-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation, we studied the causal contributions of V3A and MT+ to stereoscopic depth perception. Subjects viewed random-dot stereograms forming transparent planes with various interplane disparities. Their smallest detectable disparity and largest detectable disparity were measured in two experiments. We found that the smallest detectable disparity was affected by V3A, but not MT+ , stimulation. On the other hand, the largest detectable disparity was affected by both V3A and MT+ stimulation. Our results suggest different roles of V3A and MT+ in stereoscopic depth processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Protection of MCC950 against Alzheimer's disease via inhibiting neuronal pyroptosis in SAMP8 mice</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neuronal dysfunction and loss are thought to be one of the causes of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the specific mechanism of neuronal loss in the pathogenesis of AD remains controversial. This study explored the role of NLRP3 inflammasome-induced neuronal pyroptosis in neuronal loss of AD, and pioneered the use of NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 to intervene in the treatment of senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice. In vitro, human primary neurons (HPNs) pretreated with MCC950 were stimulated with amyloid-β&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; (Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;), and it was found that MCC950 significantly reduced the neurotoxicity of Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; by inhibiting neuronal pyroptosis. In vivo, SAMP8 mice were randomly divided into vehicle-treated group and MCC950-treated group, and it was found that MCC950 also played a positive role in treatment. The intervention of MCC950 improved the spatial memory ability and brain histological morphology of SAMP8 mice, and reduced the deposition of amyloid-β in the brain. Furthermore, MCC950 was found to inhibit the overexpressions of NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD, which were the response factors of pyroptosis in SAMP8 mouse neurons, by immunofluorescence staining. In this study, we found that neuronal pyroptosis induced by the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD axis was an important factor in neuronal loss of AD, and revealed that MCC950 might be a potential AD therapeutic agent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Pupil diameter as a biomarker of effort in goal-directed gait</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Subjects’ eye movement behavior related to cognitive effort during gait was measured as subjects walked to perform low and high cognitive load tasks. We found that all pupil diameter measures, fixation durations, and the proportion of blink duration changed significantly during gait as a function of task load. In contrast, the number of fixations, saccade durations and travel time did not change significantly as a function of task load. Findings showed that pupil diameter was the best predictor of task load during one’s gait preceding the performance of the task. While other studies have demonstrated the importance of eye fixation characteristics during gait, our findings showed that eye measures related to pupil diameter were better at detecting cognitive load while walking to perform a task compared to eye fixation data. We also found that cognitive effort was not limited to just the performance of the task, but that it was also exerted during one’s gait preceding the performance of the task. Therefore, the additional attention demand caused by an increase in task complexity may result in less attentional resources being available to adequately handle distractions (such as obstacle avoidance) while walking to perform the task. Consequently, this may increase the likelihood of falls in those individuals with lower attentional capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Obesity-related alterations in anticipatory postural mechanisms associated with gait initiation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-020-05914-8</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Obesity is known to have a detrimental effect on balance and motor performance during daily motor tasks. However, it remains unclear whether these obesity-related impairments are due to deficient anticipatory postural adjustments (APA) that precede voluntary movement. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of obesity on APA and the impacts related on motor performance and mediolateral postural stability during gait initiation. Fifteen obese and ten normal-weight young participants performed a series of gait initiation at their preferred speed. Our results showed that the durations and amplitudes of APA along both anteroposterior and mediolateral directions did not differ between the two groups (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). In contrast, compared to normal-weight participants, mechanical effectiveness of APA was reduced in obese participants (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). As a result, we observed a decreased motor performance (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), in terms of peak anteroposterior center-of-mass velocity at the end of the first step, and a reduced mediolateral stability at swing foot contact in obese participants compared to normal-weight participants (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). These findings suggest that APA effectiveness during gait initiation is reduced in obese adults, resulting in a decrease of both mediolateral stability and motor performance compared to their lean counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Mesenchymal stem cells with modafinil (gold nanoparticles) significantly improves neurological deficits in rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Systemic treatments for ischemic stroke as a disease with high disability and death have been yet unsuccessful. Combined treatments can potentially cause better results in treatment of patients with Stroke. In this study we assessed the neuroprotective effect of modafinil-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) in ischemic stroke rats. Stem cells and AuNPs offer great promise for new medical treatments. 60 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (12 in each group): (1) the group that developed middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO or ischemia), (2) the normal group (control), (3) the MCAO group that received MSC (C + MCAO), (4) the MCAO group that received MSC and modafinil (CM + MCAO), and (5) the MCAO group that received MSC and modafinil-coated AuNPs (CMN + MCAO). Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) was performed by inserting a silicone coat filament in the right internal carotid artery via the external carotid artery until it reached the anterior cerebral artery. The filament was located in the internal carotid artery for 60 min and then removed. Modafinil-coated AuNPs (100 mg/kg) or Modafinil (100 mg/kg) were given to the rats as an oral gavage, once a day in the morning time. Finally, infarct volume, BDNF (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor), GDNF (Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor), NeuN (neuronal nuclear protein) expression, and cell apoptosis in brain were analyzed. The brain infarct volume and apoptosis significantly decreased and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF, NeuN,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GDNF&lt;/em&gt; increased in C + MCAO, CM + MCAO, and CMN + MCAO groups compared to ischemia. CMN + MCAO groups did not show significant difference in these factors compared to control group. These results demonstrated that the administration of stem cells and Modafinil-coated AuNPs at the same time had a good effect on ischemic brain injuries. It happened through increasing neurotrophic factors and decreasing brain cell apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Metformin improves depressive-like symptoms in mice via inhibition of peripheral and central NF-κB-NLRP3 inflammation activation</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Emerging evidence indicates that NLRP3 inflammasome-induced inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression. Thus, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation may offer a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of depression. Metformin has been shown to have potential anti-inflammatory activity, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. We used a chronic mild stress model of depression and cultured primary macrophage to investigate the effects of metformin on depression and its underlying mechanisms. We demonstrated that metformin alleviated depressive-like behaviors in the chronic mild stress-induced anhedonia model of depression. We further found that metformin significantly suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation, subsequent caspase-1 cleavage, and interleukin-1β secretion in both peripheral macrophages and central hippocampus. Our findings reveal that metformin confers an antidepressant effect partly through inhibition of peripheral and central NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In light of metformin favorable properties, it should be evaluated in the treatment of depression and related neurologic disorders characterized by NLRP3 inflammasome activation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: The probability of choosing both hands depends on an interaction between motor capacity and limb-specific control in chronic stroke</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A goal of rehabilitation after stroke is to promote pre-stroke levels of arm use for every day, frequently bimanual, functional activities. We reasoned that, after a stroke, the choice to use one or both hands for bimanual tasks might depend not only on residual motor capacity, but also the specialized demands imposed by the task on the paretic hand. To capture spontaneous, task-specific choices, we covertly observed 50 pre-stroke right-handed chronic stroke survivors (25 each of left, LHD, and right-hemisphere damage, RHD) and 11 age-similar control adults and recorded their hand use strategies for two pairs of bimanual tasks with distinct demands: one with greater precision requirements (photo-album tasks), and another with greater stabilization requirements (letter-envelope tasks). The primary outcome was the choice to use one or both hands. Logistic regression was used to test the two hypotheses that the probability of choosing a bimanual strategy would be greater in those with less severe motor impairment and also in those with LHD. When collapsed across the four tasks, we found support for these hypotheses. Notably, however, the influence of these factors on bimanual choice varied based on task demands. For the photo–album pair, the probability of a bimanual strategy was greater for those with LHD compared to RHD, regardless of the degree of motor impairment. For the letter–envelope pair, we found a significant interaction between impairment and side of lesion in determining the likelihood of choosing both hands. Therefore, the manner in which side of lesion moderates the effect of impairment on hand use depends on the task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vessel damage is a general pathological process in many neurodegenerative disorders, as well as spinal cord injury, stroke, or trauma. Biomaterials can present novel tools to repair and regenerate damaged vessels. The aim of the present study is to test collagen hydrogels loaded with different angiogenic factors to study vessel repair in organotypic brain slice cultures. In the experimental set up I, we made a cut on the organotypic brain slice and tested re-growth of laminin + vessels. In the experimental set up II, we cultured two half brain slices with a gap with a collagen hydrogel placed in between to study endothelial cell migration. In the experimental set up I, we showed that the number of vessels crossing the cut was tendencially increased with the addition of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), vascular endothelial growth factor, or platelet-derived growth factor-BB compared to the control group. In the experimental set up II, we demonstrated that a collagen hydrogel loaded with FGF-2 resulted in a significantly increased number of migrated laminin + cells in the gap between the slices compared to the control hydrogel. Co-administration of several growth factors did not further potentiate the effects. Taken together, we show that organotypic brain slices are good models to study brain vessels and FGF-2 is a potent angiogenic factor for endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Our results provide evidence that the collagen hydrogels can be used as an extracellular matrix for the vascular endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Does strict validation criteria for individual motor units alter population-based regression models of the motor unit pool?</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine if the implementation of a strict validation procedure, designed to limit the inclusion of inaccuracies from the decomposition of surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals, affects population-based motor unit (MU) analyses. Four sEMG signals were obtained from the vastus lateralis of 59 participants during isometric contractions at different relative intensities [30%, 70%, and 100% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)], and its individual motor unit potential trains (MUPTs) were extracted. The MUPTs were then excluded (ISIval) based on the coefficient of variation and histogram of the interspike intervals (ISI), the absence of additional clusters that reveals missed or additional firings, and more. MU population-based regression models (i.e., modeling the entire motor unit pool) were performed between motor unit potential size (MUP&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SIZE&lt;/sub&gt;), mean firing rate (MFR), and recruitment threshold (RT%) separately for DSDC&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Only&lt;/sub&gt; (includes all MUPTs without the additional validation performed) and ISIval data at each contraction intensity. The only significant difference in regression coefficients between DSDC&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Only&lt;/sub&gt; and ISIval was for the intercepts of the MUP&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SIZE&lt;/sub&gt;/MFR at 100% MVC. The validation had no other significant effect on any of the other regression coefficients for each of the contraction intensities. Our findings suggest that even though the decomposition of surface signals leads to some inaccuracies, these errors have limited effects on the regression models used to estimate the behavior of the whole pool. Therefore, we propose that motor unit population-based regression models may be robust enough to overcome decomposition-induced errors at the individual MU level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mental imagery can induce audiovisual integration, but whether it can induce interactions in other modalities remains uncertain. It has been demonstrated that audiomotor interaction can be generated following training, but whether such audiomotor interaction can be induced by auditory imagery training remains unknown. The present study aims at determining whether auditory mental imagery could induce a multimodal association with postural control. We examined static postural control in the presence of a frequency-modulated sound in three groups of participants, prior to and following a short period of training designed to create an association between auditory mental imagery of sounds and postural swaying. Results suggest that mental imagery impacted performance, as a significant decrease in postural control was observed in the experimental group following mental imagery training. Results of the control groups confirmed that the effect of mental imagery was not due to response bias, but to a significant multimodal interaction following training. These findings are in accordance with previous studies suggesting that mental imagery stimuli can interact with perceptual stimuli of a different sensory modality and lead to multisensory integration. The results also confirm that audiomotor interaction can be generated a mental imagery training. However, the full extent of mental imagery influence on multimodal interaction remains to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As part of a larger study on the effects of fatigue on various attentional and behavioural measures, we had participants complete a modified version of Luna et al.’s (J Neurosci Methods 306:77–87, Luna et al., J Neurosci Methods 306:77–87, 2018) ANTI-Vea task (mANTI-Vea) at the beginning and end (pre/post) of each of two 8-h testing sessions. Between these administrations of the mANTI-Vea our participants spent ~ 6 h performing an intervening task. Our intent in this project was two-fold: first, to replicate the pattern of effects reported in Luna et al.’s original presentation of the ANTI-Vea; second, to assay the impact of fatigue on vigilance and attention by observing shifts in mANTI-Vea performance as a function of time on task and before versus after the intervening task. With time-on-task (the mANTI-Vea is divided into six sub-blocks) we observed that participants became increasingly conservative in their biases to respond towards infrequent targets, showed a decline in sensitivity, and lapsed in responding in the psychomotor vigilance task with greater frequency. In the pre/post comparison, we observed an increase in the proportion of lapses, but not in participants’ response biases. Attentional network scores were found to be somewhat insensitive to our fatigue manipulations; the effect of time-on-task was only significant for orienting scores on RT, and our pre/post comparison was only significant for RT derived executive functioning scores.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of hierarchical goal structure of a yet-to-be performed task on gait and eye fixation behavior while walking to the location of where the task was to be performed. Subjects performed different goal-directed tasks representing three hierarchical levels of planning. The first level of planning consisted of having the subject walk to a bookcase on which an object (a cup) was located in the middle of a shelf. The second level of planning consisted of walking to the bookcase and picking up the cup which was in the middle, on the right side, or on the left side of the bookcase shelf. The third level of planning consisted of walking to the bookcase, picking up the cup which was located in the middle of the bookcase shelf, and moving it to a higher shelf. Findings showed that hierarchal goals do affect center of mass velocity and eye fixation behavior. Center of mass velocity to the bookcase increased with an increase in the number of goals. Subjects decreased gait velocity as they approached the bookcase and adjusted their last steps to accommodate picking up the cup. The findings also demonstrated the important role of vision in controlling gait velocity in goal-directed tasks. Eye fixation duration was more important than the number of eye fixations in controlling gait velocity. Thus, the amount of information gained through object fixation duration is of greater importance than the number of fixations on the object for effective goal achievement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The Human Connectome Project (HCP) provides a rich dataset of quantitative and domain-specific behavioral measures from twins and extensive family structures. This makes the dataset a unique and a valuable resource to investigate heritability and determine individual differences. Using a set of measures of behavioral domains (motor, emotion, personality, sensory, and cognition), we estimated the intraclass correlations (ICCs) and heritability of 56 behavioral measures for 4 genetically identified groups of participants: monozygotic (MZ) twins, dizygotic (DZ) twins, non-twin siblings (SB), and unrelated individuals (NR). The ICCs range varied among behavioral domains but systematically so among the four genetic groups. We found the same rank order of ICCs, from the highest values for MZ twins, statistically significantly smaller for the DZ twins and sibling group (compared to MZ), and close to zero for NR. The mean heritability values of the five behavioral domains were: cognition &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.405, emotion &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.316, motor &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.138, personality &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.444, and sensory &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.193. These domains share overlapping brain networks. The heritability of motor domain was significantly smaller than cognitive, personality, and emotion domains. These findings provide new insight into the effect of genetics on the various diverse behavioral measures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Neck rotation modulates motor-evoked potential duration of proximal muscle cortical representations in healthy adults</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) produces motor-evoked potentials (MEP) used to infer changes in corticomotor excitability. In humans, neck rotation can probe reticulospinal input on corticomotor output. This study investigated the effect of neck rotation on MEP duration in a proximal and distal upper limb muscle and compared responses between rest and preactivation. Single-pulse TMS to motor cortex was used to evoke MEPs at two stimulus intensities in 18 healthy adults (20–40 years). Surface electromyography recorded MEPs from the non-dominant biceps brachii (BB) and first dorsal interosseous (FDI). Participants were seated with the target muscle at rest or 10% preactivated, and head rotated ipsilateral, contralateral, or in neutral position. The primary outcome was MEP tail, defined as the mean difference in MEP duration between active and rest trials. Secondary outcomes were MEP duration and amplitude. MEP tail was modulated by neck rotation in the proximal BB (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03) but not distal FDI (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.19), with shorter duration during ipsilateral or contralateral rotation relative to neutral. In a neutral neck position, MEP duration was prolonged by muscle preactivation and higher TMS intensities in the FDI and BB (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.03). Neck rotation attenuated the prolongation of MEP duration during preactivation in the BB, but not the FDI. Neck rotation had no effect on MEP amplitude for either muscle (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Modulation of the late portion of the MEP by rotation of the neck could indicate subcortical projections to alpha-motoneuron pools are stronger in proximal than distal upper limb muscles. These findings may have relevance for using MEP duration as a neural biomarker in neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Paired associative stimulation (PAS) can induce plasticity in the motor cortex, as measured by changes in corticospinal excitability (CSE). This effect is attenuated in older and less active individuals. Although a single bout of exercise enhances PAS-induced plasticity in young, physically inactive adults, it is not yet known if physical activity interventions affect PAS-induced neuroplasticity in middle-aged inactive individuals. Sixteen inactive middle-aged office workers participated in a randomized cross-over design investigating how CSE and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) were affected by PAS preceded by 3 h of sitting (SIT), 3 h of sitting interrupted every 30 min by 3 min of frequent short bouts of physical activity (FPA) and 2.5 h of sitting followed by 25 min of moderate-intensity exercise (EXE). Transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied over the primary motor cortex (M1) of the dominant abductor pollicis brevis to induce recruitment curves before and 5 min and 30 min post-PAS. Linear mixed models were used to compare changes in CSE using time and condition as fixed effects and subjects as random effects. There was a main effect of time on CSE and planned within-condition comparisons showed that CSE was significantly increased from baseline to 5 min and 30 min post-PAS, in the FPA condition, with no significant changes in the SIT or EXE conditions. SICI decreased from baseline to 5 min post-PAS, but this was not related to changes in CSE. Our findings suggest that in middle-aged inactive adults, FPAs may promote corticospinal neuroplasticity. Possible mechanisms are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Is it better to sit down, stand up or walk when performing memory and arithmetic activities?</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;It is now accepted that performing a cognitive task impacts postural control (Polskaia and Lajoie 2016; Vuillerme et al. Neurosci Lett 291: 77–80, 2000). However, the reverse impact of posture on cognitive performance is less documented. The present study investigated performance in two cognitive activities (memory and arithmetic) performed in three different postural conditions (sitting, standing, and walking). Overall, our data suggest that the posture adopted during a task can improve cognitive performance with a better answer for arithmetic in the sitting position than during walking but more correctly recalled words while walking. This study, thus, suggests that there could be preferential association between cognition and posture, i.e., memory cognitive performance can be improved when walking and mental arithmetic while sitting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The COVID-19 pandemic has motivated many open and collaborative analytical research projects with real-world impact. However, despite their value, such activities are generally overlooked by traditional academic metrics. Science is ultimately improved by analytical work, whether ensuring reproducible and well-documented code to accompany papers, developing and maintaining flexible tools, sharing and curating data, or disseminating analysis to wider audiences. To increase the impact and sustainability of modern science, it will be crucial to ensure these analytical activities—and the people who do them—are valued in academia.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ReMnGjGXiWI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Adaptive evolution shapes the present-day distribution of the thermal sensitivity of population growth rate</title>

Developing a thorough understanding of how ectotherm physiology adapts to different thermal environments is of crucial importance, especially in the face of global climate change. A key aspect of an organism’s thermal performance curve (TPC)—the relationship between fitness-related trait performance and temperature—is its thermal sensitivity, i.e., the rate at which trait values increase with temperature within its typically experienced thermal range. For a given trait, the distribution of thermal sensitivities across species, often quantified as “activation energy” values, is typically right-skewed. Currently, the mechanisms that generate this distribution are unclear, with considerable debate about the role of thermodynamic constraints versus adaptive evolution. Here, using a phylogenetic comparative approach, we study the evolution of the thermal sensitivity of population growth rate across phytoplankton (Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae) and prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), 2 microbial groups that play a major role in the global carbon cycle. We find that thermal sensitivity across these groups is moderately phylogenetically heritable, and that its distribution is shaped by repeated evolutionary convergence throughout its parameter space. More precisely, we detect bursts of adaptive evolution in thermal sensitivity, increasing the amount of overlap among its distributions in different clades. We obtain qualitatively similar results from evolutionary analyses of the thermal sensitivities of 2 physiological rates underlying growth rate: net photosynthesis and respiration of plants. Furthermore, we find that these episodes of evolutionary convergence are consistent with 2 opposing forces: decrease in thermal sensitivity due to environmental fluctuations and increase due to adaptation to stable environments. Overall, our results indicate that adaptation can lead to large and relatively rapid shifts in thermal sensitivity, especially in microbes for which rapid evolution can occur at short timescales. Thus, more attention needs to be paid to elucidating the implications of rapid evolution in organismal thermal sensitivity for ecosystem functioning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/hRVNeQwYVrk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Self-organization toward criticality by synaptic plasticity. (arXiv:2010.07888v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Self-organized criticality has been proposed to be a universal mechanism for
the emergence of scale-free dynamics in many complex systems, and possibly in
the brain. While such scale-free patterns were identified experimentally in
many different types of neural recordings, the biological principles behind
their emergence remained unknown. Utilizing different network models and
motivated by experimental observations, synaptic plasticity was proposed as a
possible mechanism to self-organize brain dynamics towards a critical point. In
this review, we discuss how various biologically plausible plasticity rules
operating across multiple timescales are implemented in the models and how they
alter the network's dynamical state through modification of number and strength
of the connections between the neurons. Some of these rules help to stabilize
criticality, some need additional mechanisms to prevent divergence from the
critical state. We propose that rules that are capable of bringing the network
to criticality can be classified by how long the near-critical dynamics
persists after their disabling. Finally, we discuss the role of
self-organization and criticality in computation. Overall, the concept of
criticality helps to shed light on brain function and self-organization, yet
the overall dynamics of living neural networks seem to harnesses not only
criticality for computation, but also deviations thereof.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic systems achieve high energy efficiency by computing with spikes,
in a brain-inspired way. However, finding spike-based learning algorithms that
can be implemented within the local constraints of neuromorphic systems, while
achieving high accuracy, remains a formidable challenge. Equilibrium
Propagation is a hardware-friendly counterpart of backpropagation which only
involves spatially local computations and applies to recurrent neural networks
with static inputs. So far, hardware-oriented studies of Equilibrium
Propagation focused on rate-based networks. In this work, we develop a spiking
neural network algorithm called EqSpike, compatible with neuromorphic systems,
which learns by Equilibrium Propagation. Through simulations, we obtain a test
recognition accuracy of 96.9% on MNIST, similar to rate-based Equilibrium
Propagation, and comparing favourably to alternative learning techniques for
spiking neural networks. We show that EqSpike implemented in silicon
neuromorphic technology could reduce the energy consumption of inference and
training by up to three orders of magnitude compared to GPUs. Finally, we also
show that during learning, EqSpike weight updates exhibit a form of Spike

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Training neural networks to perform different tasks is relevant across
various disciplines that go beyond Machine Learning. In particular, Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNN) are of great interest to different scientific
communities. Open-source frameworks dedicated to Machine Learning such as
Tensorflow \cite{chollet2015keras} and Keras \cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper}
has produced significative changes in the development of technologies that we
currently use. One relevant problem that can be approach is how to build the
models for the study of dynamical systems, and how to extract the relevant
information to be able to answer the scientific questions of interest. The
purpose of the present work is to contribute to this aim by using a temporal
processing task, in this case, a 3-bit Flip Flop memory, to show the modeling
procedure in every step: from equations to the software code, using Tensorflow
and Keras. The obtained networks are analyzed to describe the dynamics and to
show different visualization and analysis tools. The code developed in this
premier is provided to be used as a base for model other systems.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: A Bayesian method for inference of effective connectivity in brain networks for detecting the Mozart effect. (arXiv:2010.07801v1 [eess.SY])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Several studies claim that listening to Mozart music affects cognition and
can be used to treat neurological conditions like epilepsy. Research into this
Mozart effect has not addressed how dynamic interactions between brain
networks, i.e. effective connectivity, are affected. The Granger-causality
analysis is often used to infer effective connectivity. First, we investigate
if a new method, Bayesian topology identification, can be used as an
alternative. Both methods are evaluated on simulation data, where the Bayesian
method outperforms the Granger-causality analysis in the inference of
connectivity graphs of dynamic networks, especially for short data lengths. In
the second part, the Bayesian method is extended to enable the inference of
changes in effective connectivity between groups of subjects. Next, we apply
both methods to fMRI scans of 16 healthy subjects, who were scanned before and
after exposure to Mozart's sonata K448 at least 2 hours a day for 7 days. Here,
we investigate if the effective connectivity of the subjects significantly
changed after listening to Mozart music. The Bayesian method detected changes
in effective connectivity between networks related to cognitive processing and
control: First, in the connection from the central executive to the superior
sensori-motor network. Second, in the connection from the posterior default
mode to the fronto-parietal right network. Finally, in the connection from the
anterior default mode to the dorsal attention network, but only in a subgroup
of subjects with a longer listening duration. Only in this last connection an
effect was found by the Granger-causality analysis.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Social media has penetrated into multilingual societies, however most of them
use English to be a preferred language for communication. So it looks natural
for them to mix their cultural language with English during conversations
resulting in abundance of multilingual data, call this code-mixed data,
available in todays' world.Downstream NLP tasks using such data is challenging
due to the semantic nature of it being spread across multiple languages.One
such Natural Language Processing task is sentiment analysis, for this we use an
auto-regressive XLNet model to perform sentiment analysis on code-mixed
Tamil-English and Malayalam-English datasets.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Linking average- and worst-case perturbation robustness via class selectivity and dimensionality. (arXiv:2010.07693v1 [cs.LG])</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Representational sparsity is known to affect robustness to input
perturbations in deep neural networks (DNNs), but less is known about how the
semantic content of representations affects robustness. Class selectivity-the
variability of a unit's responses across data classes or dimensions-is one way
of quantifying the sparsity of semantic representations. Given recent evidence
that class selectivity may not be necessary for, and can even impair
generalization, we investigated whether it also confers robustness (or
vulnerability) to perturbations of input data. We found that class selectivity
leads to increased vulnerability to average-case (naturalistic) perturbations
in ResNet18 and ResNet20, as measured using Tiny ImageNetC and CIFAR10C,
respectively. Networks regularized to have lower levels of class selectivity
are more robust to average-case perturbations, while networks with higher class
selectivity are more vulnerable. In contrast, we found that class selectivity
increases robustness to worst-case (i.e. white box adversarial) perturbations,
suggesting that while decreasing class selectivity is helpful for average-case
robustness, it is harmful for worst-case robustness. To explain this
difference, we studied the dimensionality of the networks' representations: we
found that the dimensionality of early-layer representations is inversely
proportional to a network's class selectivity, and that adversarial samples
cause a larger increase in early-layer dimensionality than corrupted samples.
We also found that the input-unit gradient was more variable across samples and
units in high-selectivity networks compared to low-selectivity networks. These
results lead to the conclusion that units participate more consistently in
low-selectivity regimes compared to high-selectivity regimes, effectively
creating a larger attack surface and hence vulnerability to worst-case
perturbations.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07517</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This contribution introduces the GTOPX space mission benchmark collection,
which is an extension of GTOP database published by the European Space Agency
(ESA). GTOPX consists of ten individual benchmark instances representing
real-world interplanetary space trajectory design problems. In regard to the
original GTOP collection, GTOPX includes three new problem instances featuring
mixed-integer and multi-objective properties. GTOPX enables a simplified user
handling, unified benchmark function call and some minor bug corrections to the
original GTOP implementation. Furthermore, GTOPX is linked from it's original
C++ source code to Python and Matlab based on dynamic link libraries, assuring
computationally fast and accurate reproduction of the benchmark results in all
three programming languages. Space mission trajectory design problems as those
represented in GTOPX are known to be highly non-linear and difficult to solve.
The GTOPX collection, therefore, aims particularly at researchers wishing to
put advanced (meta)heuristic and hybrid optimization algorithms to the test.
The goal of this paper is to provide researchers with a manual and reference to
the newly available GTOPX benchmark software.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Anomaly detection of time series plays an important role in reliability
systems engineering. However, in practical application, there is no precisely
defined boundary between normal and anomalous behaviors in different
application scenarios. Therefore, different anomaly detection algorithms and
processes ought to be adopted for time series in different situation. Although
such strategy improve the accuracy of anomaly detection, it takes a lot of time
for practitioners to configure various algorithms to millions of series, which
greatly increases the development and maintenance cost of anomaly detection
processes. In this paper, we propose CRATOS which is a self-adapt algorithms
that extract features from time series, and then cluster series with similar
features into one group. For each group we utilize evolutionary algorithm to
search the best anomaly detection methods and processes. Our methods can
significantly reduce the cost of development and maintenance of anomaly
detection. According to experiments, our clustering methods achieves the
state-of-art results. The accuracy of the anomaly detection algorithms in this
paper is 85.1%.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A directed acyclic hypergraph is a generalized concept of a directed acyclic
graph, where each hyperedge can contain an arbitrary number of tails and heads.
Directed hypergraphs can be used to model data flow and execution dependencies
in streaming applications. Thus, hypergraph partitioning algorithms can be used
to obtain efficient parallelizations for multiprocessor architectures. However,
an acyclicity constraint on the partition is necessary when mapping streaming
applications to embedded multiprocessors due to resource restrictions on this
type of hardware. The acyclic hypergraph partitioning problem is to partition
the hypernodes of a directed acyclic hypergraph into a given number of blocks
of roughly equal size such that the corresponding quotient graph is acyclic
while minimizing an objective function on the partition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we contribute the first n-level algorithm for the acyclic hypergraph
partitioning problem. Our focus is on acyclic hypergraphs where hyperedges can
have one head and arbitrary many tails. Based on this, we engineer a memetic
algorithm to further reduce communication cost, as well as to improve
scheduling makespan on embedded multiprocessor architectures. Experiments
indicate that our algorithm outperforms previous algorithms that focus on the
directed acyclic graph case which have previously been employed in the
application domain. Moreover, our experiments indicate that using the directed
hypergraph model for this type of application yields a significantly smaller
makespan.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06276</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we introduce a biologically inspired Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) architecture called LGN-CNN that has a first convolutional layer
composed by a single filter that mimics the role of the Lateral Geniculate
Nucleus (LGN). The first layer of the neural network shows a rotationally
symmetric pattern justified by the structure of the net itself that turns up to
be an approximation of a Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG). The latter function is in
turn a good approximation of the receptive profiles (RPs) of the cells in the
LGN. The analogy with respect to the visual system structure is established,
emerging directly from the architecture of the neural network. A proof of
rotation invariance of the first layer is given on a fixed LGN-CNN architecture
and the computational results are shown. Thus, contrast invariance capability
of the LGN-CNN is investigated and a comparison between the Retinex effects of
the first layer of LGN-CNN and the Retinex effects of a LoG is provided on
different images. A statistical study is done on the filters of the second
convolutional layer with respect to biological data.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Differential Expression of DeltaFosB in Reward Processing Regions Between Binge Eating Prone and Resistant Female Rats</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.562154</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Binge eating (BE) is characterized by the consumption of large amounts of palatable food in a discrete period and compulsivity. Even though BE is a common symptom in bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), and some cases of other specified feeding or eating disorders, little is known about its pathophysiology. We aimed to identify brain regions and neuron subtypes implicated in the development of binge-like eating in a female rat model. We separated rats into binge eating prone (BEP) and binge eating resistant (BER) phenotypes based on the amount of sucrose they consumed following foot-shock stress. We quantified deltaFosB (ΔFosB) expression, a stably expressed Fos family member, in different brain regions involved in reward, taste, or stress processing, to assess their involvement in the development of the phenotype. The number of ΔFosB-expressing neurons was: (1) higher in BEP than BER rats in reward processing areas [medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (Acb), and ventral tegmental area (VTA)]; (2) similar in taste processing areas [insular cortex, IC and parabrachial nucleus (PBN)]; and (3) higher in the paraventricular nucleus of BEP than BER rats, but not different in the locus coeruleus (LC), which are stress processing structures. To study subtypes of ΔFosB-expressing neurons in the reward system, we performed in situ hybridization for glutamate decarboxylase 65 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA after ΔFosB immunohistochemistry. In the mPFC and Acb, the proportions of γ-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) and non-GABAergic ΔFosB-expressing neurons were similar in BER and BEP rats. In the VTA, while the proportion of dopaminergic ΔFosB-expressing neurons was similar in both phenotypes, the proportion of GABAergic ΔFosB-expressing neurons was higher in BER than BEP rats. Our results suggest that reward processing brain regions, particularly the VTA, are important for the development of binge-like eating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Degradation and Transmission of Tau by Autophagic-Endolysosomal Networks and Potential Therapeutic Targets for Tauopathy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.586731</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Tauopathies are a class of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD), and many others where microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT or tau) is hyperphosphorylated and aggregated to form insoluble paired helical filaments (PHFs) and ultimately neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Autophagic-endolysosomal networks (AELN) play important roles in tau clearance. Excessive soluble neurotoxic forms of tau and tau hyperphosphorylated at specific sites are cleared through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), Chaperon-mediated Autophagy (CMA), and endosomal microautophagy (e-MI). On the other hand, intra-neuronal insoluble tau aggregates are often degraded within lysosomes by macroautophagy. AELN defects have been observed in AD, FTD, CBD, and PSP, and lysosomal dysfunction was shown to promote the cleavage and neurotoxicity of tau. Moreover, several AD risk genes (e.g., PICALM, GRN, and BIN1) have been associated with dysregulation of AELN in the late-onset sporadic AD. Conversely, tau dissociation from microtubules interferes with retrograde transport of autophagosomes to lysosomes, and that tau fragments can also lead to lysosomal dysfunction. Recent studies suggest that tau is not merely an intra-neuronal protein, but it can be released to brain parenchyma via extracellular vesicles, like exosomes and ectosomes, and thus spread between neurons. Extracellular tau can also be taken up by microglial cells and astrocytes, either being degraded through AELN or propagated via exosomes. This article reviews the complex roles of AELN in the degradation and transmission of tau, potential diagnostic/therapeutic targets and strategies based on AELN-mediated tau clearance and propagation, and the current state of drug development targeting AELN and tau against tauopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Hepcidin Decreases Rotenone-Induced α-Synuclein Accumulation via Autophagy in SH-SY5Y Cells</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and the hallmarks of this disease include iron deposition and α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation. Hepcidin could reduce iron in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Here, we hypothesized that hepcidin could further decrease α-syn accumulation via reducing iron. Therefore, rotenone or α-syn was introduced into human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to imitate the pathological progress of PD in vitro. This study investigated the clearance effects of hepcidin on α-syn induced by a relatively low concentration of rotenone exposure or α-syn overexpression to elucidate the potential clearance pathway involved in this process. We demonstrated that SH-SY5Y cell viability was impaired after rotenone treatment in a dose-dependent manner. α-syn expression and iron content increased under a low concentration rotenone (25 nM for 3 days) treatment in SH-SY5Y cells. Pre-treatment with hepcidin peptide suppressed the abovementioned effects of rotenone. However, hepcidin did not affect treatment with rotenone under high iron conditions. Hepcidin also played a role in reducing α-syn accumulation in rotenone and α-syn overexpression conditions. We identified that the probable clearance effect of hepcidin on α-syn was mediated by the autophagy pathway using pretreatment with autophagy inhibitors (3-MA and CQ) and detection of autophagy protein markers (LC3II/I and p62). In conclusion, hepcidin eliminated α-syn expression via the autophagy pathway in rotenone-treated and α-syn overexpression SH-SY5Y cells. This study highlights that hepcidin may offer a potential therapeutic perspective in α-syn accumulation diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Systems Biology: On the Organization of the Locomotor CPG: Insights From Split-Belt Locomotion and Mathematical Modeling</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.598888</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Rhythmic limb movements during locomotion are controlled by central pattern generator (CPG) circuits located in the spinal cord. It is considered that these circuits are composed of individual rhythm generators (RGs) for each limb interacting with each other through multiple commissural and long propriospinal circuits. The organization and operation of each RG are not fully understood, and different competing theories exist about interactions between its flexor and extensor components, as well as about left–right commissural interactions between the RGs. The central idea of circuit organization proposed in this study is that with an increase of excitatory input to each RG (or an increase in locomotor speed) the rhythmogenic mechanism of the RGs changes from “flexor-driven” rhythmicity to a “classical half-center” mechanism. We test this hypothesis using our experimental data on changes in duration of stance and swing phases in the intact and spinal cats walking on the ground or tied-belt treadmills (symmetric conditions) or split-belt treadmills with different left and right belt speeds (asymmetric conditions). We compare these experimental data with the results of mathematical modeling, in which simulated CPG circuits operate in similar symmetric and asymmetric conditions with matching or differing control drives to the left and right RGs. The obtained results support the proposed concept of state-dependent changes in RG operation and specific commissural interactions between the RGs. The performed simulations and mathematical analysis of model operation under different conditions provide new insights into CPG network organization and limb coordination during locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Current Status of Stem Cell-Derived Therapies for Parkinson’s Disease: From Cell Assessment and Imaging Modalities to Clinical Trials</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Curative therapies or treatments reversing the progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD) have attracted considerable interest in the last few decades. PD is characterized by the gradual loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and decreased striatal dopamine levels. Current challenges include optimizing neuroprotective strategies, developing personalized drug therapy, and minimizing side effects from the long-term prescription of pharmacological drugs used to relieve short-term motor symptoms. Transplantation of DA cells into PD patients’ brains to replace degenerated DA has the potential to change the treatment paradigm. Herein, we provide updates on current progress in stem cell-derived DA neuron transplantation as a therapeutic alternative for PD. We briefly highlight cell sources for transplantation and focus on cell assessment methods such as identification of genetic markers, single-cell sequencing, and imaging modalities used to access cell survival and function. More importantly, we summarize clinical reports of patients who have undergone cell-derived transplantation in PD to better perceive lessons that can be drawn from past and present clinical outcomes. Modifying factors include (1) source of the stem cells, (2) quality of the stem cells, (3) age of the patient, (4) stage of disease progression at the time of cell therapy, (5) surgical technique/practices, and (6) the use of immunosuppression. We await the outcomes of joint efforts in clinical trials around the world such as NYSTEM and CiRA to further guide us in the selection of the most suitable parameters for cell-based neurotransplantation in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Upper Extremity Flexion Synergy Is Minimally Expressed in Young Individuals With Unilateral Cerebral Palsy Following an Early Brain Injury</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hemiparetic stroke in adulthood often results in the grouped movement pattern of the upper extremity flexion synergy thought to arise from an increased reliance on cortico-reticulospinal pathways due to a loss of lateral corticospinal projections. It is well established that the flexion synergy induces reaching constraints in individuals with adult-onset hemiplegia. The expression of the flexion synergy in individuals with brain injuries onset earlier in the lifespan is currently unknown. An early unilateral brain injury occurring prior to six months post full-term may preserve corticospinal projections which can be used for independent joint control and thus minimizing the expression of the flexion synergy. This study uses kinematics of a ballistic reaching task to evaluate the expression of the flexion synergy in individuals with pediatric hemiplegia (PH) ages six to seventeen years. Fifteen individuals with brain injuries before birth (n = 8) and around full-term (n = 7) and nine age-matched controls with no known neurological impairment completed a set of reaches in an admittance controlled robotic device. Descending drive, and the possible expression of the upper extremity flexion synergy, was modulated by increasing shoulder abduction loading. Individuals with early-onset PH achieved lower peak velocities when reaching with the paretic arm compared to controls; however, no differences in reaching distance were found between groups. Relative maintenance in reaching seen in individuals with early brain injuries highlights minimal expression of the flexion synergy. We interpret this conservation of independent control of the paretic shoulder and elbow as the use of more direct corticospinal projections instead of indirect cortico-reticulospinal pathways used in individuals with adult-onset hemiplegia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Myelin Water Imaging Demonstrates Lower Brain Myelination in Children and Adolescents With Poor Reading Ability</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.568395</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a means to non-invasively investigate the neurological links with dyslexia, a learning disability that affects one’s ability to read. Most previous brain MRI studies of dyslexia and reading skill have used structural or diffusion imaging to reveal regional brain abnormalities. However, volumetric and diffusion MRI lack specificity in their interpretation at the microstructural level. Myelin is a critical neural component for brain function and plasticity, and as such, deficits in myelin may impact reading ability. MRI can estimate myelin using myelin water fraction (MWF) imaging, which is based on evaluation of the proportion of short T2 myelin-associated water from multi-exponential T2 relaxation analysis, but has not yet been applied to the study of reading or dyslexia. In this study, MWF MRI, intelligence, and reading assessments were acquired in 20 participants aged 10–18 years with a wide range of reading ability to investigate the relationship between reading ability and myelination. Group comparisons showed markedly lower MWF by 16–69% in poor readers relative to good readers in the left and right thalamus, as well as the left posterior limb of the internal capsule, left/right anterior limb of the internal capsule, left/right centrum semiovale, and splenium of the corpus callosum. MWF over the entire group also correlated positively with three different reading scores in the bilateral thalamus as well as white matter, including the splenium of the corpus callosum, left posterior limb of the internal capsule, left anterior limb of the internal capsule, and left centrum semiovale. MWF imaging from T2 relaxation suggests that myelination, particularly in the bilateral thalamus, splenium, and left hemisphere white matter, plays a role in reading abilities. Myelin water imaging thus provides a potentially valuable in vivo imaging tool for the study of dyslexia and its remediation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Brain Networks Related to Creative Thinking</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human creative thinking is unique and capable of generating novel and valuable ideas. Recent research has clarified the contribution of different brain networks (default mode network, DN; executive control network; salience network) to creative thinking. However, the effects of brain stimulation on brain networks during creative thinking and on creative performance have not been clarified. The present study was designed to examine the changes in functional connectivity (FC) and effective connectivity (EC) of the large-scale brain network, and the ensuing changes in creative performance, induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Fourteen healthy male students underwent two tDCS sessions, one with actual stimulation and one with sham stimulation, on two separate days. Participants underwent tDCS (anode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC; cathode over the right inferior parietal lobule, IPL) for 20 min. Before and after the tDCS session, electroencephalography signals were acquired from 32 electrodes over the whole head during the creative thinking task. On FC analysis, the delta band FC between the posterior cingulate cortex and IPL significantly increased only after real stimulation. We also found that the change of flexibility score was significantly correlated with the change in: (i) delta band FC between mPFC and left lateral temporal cortex (LTC) and (ii) alpha band FC between IPL and right LTC. On EC analysis, decreased flow within the DN (from left LTC to right IPL) was observed. Our results reveal that tDCS could affect brain networks, particularly the DN, during creative thinking and modulate key FC in the generation of flexible creative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: C1q Regulates Horizontal Cell Neurite Confinement in the Outer Retina</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.583391</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.583391</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;During development, neurons generate excess processes which are then eliminated in concert with circuit maturation. C1q is the initiating protein in the complement cascade and has been implicated in this process, but whether C1q-mediated elimination is targeted to particular neural compartments is unclear. Using the murine retina, we identify C1q as a specific regulator of horizontal cell neurite confinement. Subsets of horizontal cell dendritic and axonal neurites extend into the outer retina suggesting that complement achieves both cellular and subcellular selectivity. These alterations emerge as outer retina synapses become mature. C1q expression is restricted to retina microglia, and the loss of C1q results in decreased microglia activation. This pathway appears independent of the C3a receptor (C3aR) and complement receptor 3 (CR3), as horizontal cells are normal when either protein is absent. Together, these data identify a new role for C1q in cell and neurite-specific confinement and implicate microglia-mediated phagocytosis in this process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) plays a critical role in stress resilience through top-down inhibition of key stress-sensitive limbic and hindbrain structures, including the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). In a model of experience-dependent stress resistance, socially dominant Syrian hamsters display fewer signs of anxiety following acute social defeat when compared to subordinate or control counterparts. Further, dominants activate vmPFC neurons to a greater degree during stress than do subordinates and become stress-vulnerable following pharmacological inhibition of the vmPFC. Dominants also display fewer stress-activated DRN neurons than subordinates do, suggesting that dominance experience gates activation of vmPFC neurons that inhibit the DRN during social defeat stress. To test whether social dominance alters stress-induced activity of a vmPFC-DRN pathway, we injected a retrograde tracer, cholera toxin B (CTB), into the DRN of dominant, subordinate, and control hamsters and used a dual-label immunohistochemical approach to identify vmPFC neurons co-labeled with CTB and the defeat-induced expression of an immediate early gene, cFos. Results indicate that dominant hamsters display more cFos+ and dual-labeled cells in layers V/VI of infralimbic and prelimbic subregions of the vmPFC compared to other animals. Furthermore, vmPFC-DRN activation corresponded directly with proactive behavioral strategies during defeat, which is indicative of stress resilience. Together, results suggest that recruiting the vmPFC-DRN pathway during acute stress corresponds with resistance to the effects of social defeat in dominant hamsters. Overall, these findings indicate that a monosynaptic vmPFC-DRN pathway can be engaged in an experience-dependent manner, which has implications for behavioral interventions aimed at alleviating stress-related psychopathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Astrocytic Calcium Dynamics Along the Pain Pathway</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes, once thought to be passive cells merely filling the space between neurons in the nervous system, are receiving attention as active modulators of the brain and spinal cord physiology by providing nutrients, maintaining homeostasis, and modulating synaptic transmission. Accumulating evidence indicates that astrocytes are critically involved in chronic pain regulation. Injury induces astrocytes to become reactive, and recent studies suggest that reactive astrocytes can have either neuroprotective or neurodegenerative effects. While the exact mechanisms underlying the transition from resting astrocytes to reactive astrocytes remain unknown, astrocytic calcium increase, coordinated by inflammatory molecules, has been suggested to trigger this transition. In this mini review article, we will discuss the roles of astrocytic calcium, channels contributing to calcium dynamics in astrocytes, astrocyte activations along the pain pathway, and possible relationships between astrocytic calcium dynamics and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Three-Week Treadmill Exercise Enhances Persistent Inward Currents, Facilitates Dendritic Plasticity, and Upregulates the Excitability of Dorsal Raphe Serotonin Neurons in ePet-EYFP Mice</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.575626</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Exercise plays a key role in preventing or treating mental or motor disorders caused by dysfunction of the serotonergic system. However, the electrophysiological and ionic channel mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of 3-week treadmill exercise on the electrophysiological and channel properties of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Serotonin (5-HT) neurons in ePet-EYFP mice, using whole-cell patch clamp recording. Treadmill exercise was induced in ePet-EYFP mice of P21–24 for 3 weeks, and whole-cell patch clamp recording was performed on EYFP-positive 5-HT neurons from DRN slices of P42–45 mice. Experiment data showed that 5-HT neurons in the DRN were a heterogeneous population with multiple firing patterns (single firing, phasic firing, and tonic firing). Persistent inward currents (PICs) with multiple patterns were expressed in 5-HT neurons and composed of Cav1.3 (Ca-PIC) and sodium (Na-PIC) components. Exercise hyperpolarized the voltage threshold for action potential (AP) by 3.1 ± 1.0 mV (control: n = 14, exercise: n = 18, p = 0.005) and increased the AP amplitude by 6.7 ± 3.0 mV (p = 0.031) and firing frequency by more than 22% especially within a range of current stimulation stronger than 70 pA. A 3-week treadmill exercise was sufficient to hyperpolarize PIC onset by 2.6 ± 1.3 mV (control: −53.4 ± 4.7 mV, n = 28; exercise: −56.0 ± 4.7 mV, n = 25, p = 0.050) and increase the PIC amplitude by 28% (control: 193.6 ± 81.8 pA; exercise: 248.5 ± 105.4 pA, p = 0.038). Furthermore, exercise hyperpolarized Na-PIC onset by 3.8 ± 1.8 mV (control: n = 8, exercise: n = 9, p = 0.049) and increased the Ca-PIC amplitude by 23% (p = 0.013). The exercise-induced enhancement of the PIC amplitude was mainly mediated by Ca-PIC and hyperpolarization of PIC onset by Na-PIC. Moreover, exercise facilitated dendritic plasticity, which was shown as the increased number of branch points by 1.5 ± 0.5 (p = 0.009) and dendritic branches by 2.1 ± 0.6 (n = 20, p = 0.001) and length by 732.0 ± 100.1 μm (p &amp;lt; 0.001) especially within the range of 50–200 μm from the soma. Functional analysis suggested that treadmill exercise enhanced Na-PIC for facilitation of spike initiation and Ca-PIC for regulation of repetitive firing. We concluded that PICs broadly existed in DRN 5-HT neurons and could influence serotonergic neurotransmission in juvenile mice and that 3-week treadmill exercise induced synaptic adaptations, enhanced PICs, and thus upregulated the excitability of the 5-HT neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cerebrospinal Fluid IgM Levels in Association With Inflammatory Pathways in Multiple Sclerosis Patients</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.569827</guid>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Intrathecal immunoglobulin M (IgM) synthesis has been demonstrated in the early disease stages of multiple sclerosis (MS) as a predictor factor of a worsening disease course. Similarly, increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) molecules related to B-cell intrathecal activity have been associated with a more severe MS progression. However, whether CSF levels of IgM are linked to specific inflammatory and clinical profile in MS patients at the time of diagnosis remains to be elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Using customized Bio-Plex assay, the protein levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, and of 34 other inflammatory molecules, related to B-cell, T-cell, and monocyte/macrophage activity, were analyzed in the CSF of 103 newly diagnosed relapsing–remitting MS patients and 36 patients with other neurological disorders. CSF IgM levels were also correlated with clinical and neuroradiological measures [advanced 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters], at diagnosis and after 2 years of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A 45.6% increase in CSF IgM levels was found in MS patients compared to controls (p = 0.013). CSF IgM levels correlated with higher CSF levels of CXCL13 (p = 0.039), CCL21 (p = 0.023), interleukin 10 (IL-10) (p = 0.025), IL-12p70 (p = 0.020), CX3CL1 (p = 0.036), and CHI3L1 (p = 0.048) and were associated with earlier age of patients at diagnosis (p = 0.008), white matter lesion (WML) number (p = 0.039) and disease activity (p = 0.033) after 2 years of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;IgMs are the immunoglobulins mostly expressed in the CSF of naive MS patients compared to other neurological conditions at the time of diagnosis. The association between increased CSF IgM levels and molecules related to both B-cell immunity (IL-10) and recruitment (CXCL13 and CCL21) and to macrophage/microglia activity (IL-12p70, CX3CL1, and CHI3L1) suggests possible correlation between humoral and innate intrathecal immunity in early disease stage. Furthermore, the association of IgM levels with WMLs and MS clinical and MRI activity after 2 years supports the idea of key role of IgM in the disease course.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Engineering Three-Dimensional Tumor Models to Study Glioma Cancer Stem Cells and Tumor Microenvironment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.558381</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and devastating primary brain tumor, leading to a uniform fatality after diagnosis. A major difficulty in eradicating GBM is the presence of microscopic residual infiltrating disease remaining after multimodality treatment. Glioma cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been pinpointed as the treatment-resistant tumor component that seeds ultimate tumor progression. Despite the key role of CSCs, the ideal preclinical model to study the genetic and epigenetic landmarks driving their malignant behavior while simulating an accurate interaction with the tumor microenvironment (TME) is still missing. The introduction of three-dimensional (3D) tumor platforms, such as organoids and 3D bioprinting, has allowed for a better representation of the pathophysiologic interactions between glioma CSCs and the TME. Thus, these technologies have enabled a more detailed study of glioma biology, tumor angiogenesis, treatment resistance, and even performing high-throughput screening assays of drug susceptibility. First, we will review the foundation of glioma biology and biomechanics of the TME, and then the most up-to-date insights about the applicability of these new tools in malignant glioma research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Pharmacological Targeting of CSF1R Inhibits Microglial Proliferation and Aggravates the Progression of Cerebral Ischemic Pathology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00267</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke can induce rapid activation of the microglia. It has been reported that the microglia’s survival is dependent on colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling and that pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R leads to morphological changes in the microglia in the healthy brain. However, the impact of CSF1R inhibition on neuronal structures and motor ability after ischemia–reperfusion remains unclear. In this study, we investigated microglial de-ramification, proliferation, and activation after inhibition of CSF1R by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ki20227) in a mouse model of global cerebral ischemia induced by bilateral common carotid artery ligation (BCAL). In addition to microglial morphology, we evaluated the mRNA expression of cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory receptors. Our results show that pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R in ischemic mice resulted in the blockade of microglial proliferation and a shift in microglial morphology reflected by excessive de-ramification and a more activated phenotype accompanied by an enhanced innate immune response. Furthermore, we show that pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R in ischemic mice resulted in the aggravation of neuronal degeneration and behavioral impairment. Intravital two-photon imaging revealed that although pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R did not affect the recovery of dendritic structures, it caused a significant increase in spine elimination during reperfusion in ischemic mice. These findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of CSF1R induces a blockade of microglial proliferation and causes acute activation of the microglia accompanied by a severe inflammatory response. It aggravates neuronal degeneration, loss of dendritic spines, and behavioral deficits after transient global cerebral ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Relationship Between Cognitive Status and Known Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Age-Related Macular Degeneration</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.586691</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.586691</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recent literature has reported a higher occurrence of cognitive impairment among individuals with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) compared to older adults with normal vision. This pilot study explored potential links between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AMD and cognitive status. Individuals with AMD (N = 21) and controls (N = 18) were genotyped for the SNPs CFHY402H, ARMS2A69S and FADS1 rs174547. Cognitive status was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The two groups differed significantly on which subscales were most difficult. The control group had difficulty with delayed recall while those with AMD had difficulty on delayed recall in addition to abstraction and orientation. Homozygous carriers of the FADS1 rs174547 SNP had significantly lower scores than heterozygotes or non-carriers on the MoCA. The results suggest that the FADS1 SNP may play a role in visual impairment/cognitive impairment comorbidity as reflected in the poorer cognitive scores among homozygotes with AMD compared to those carrying only one, or no copies of the SNP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Altered Functional Network Associated With Cognitive Performance in Early Parkinson Disease Measured by Eigenvector Centrality Mapping</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate relationships between whole-brain functional changes and the performance of multiple cognitive functions in early Parkinson’s disease (PD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In the current study, we evaluated resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) data and neuropsychological assessments for various cognitive functions in a cohort with 84 early PD patients from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Eigenvector centrality (EC) mapping based on rsfMRI was used to identify the functional connectivity of brain areas correlated with different neuropsychological scores at a whole-brain level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our study demonstrated that in the early PD patients, scores of Letter Number Sequencing (LNS) were positively correlated with EC in the left inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) and lingual gyrus. The immediate recall scores of Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) were positively correlated with EC in the left superior frontal gyrus. No correlation was found between the EC and other cognitive performance scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Functional alternations in the left occipital lobe (inferior occipital and lingual gyrus) and left superior frontal gyrus may account for the performance of working memory and immediate recall memory, respectively in early PD. These results may broaden the understanding of the potential mechanism of cognitive impairments in early PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Antagonistic coevolution with selfish genetic elements (SGEs) can drive evolution of host resistance. Here, we investigated host suppression of 2-micron (2m) plasmids, multicopy nuclear parasites that have co-evolved with budding yeasts. We developed SCAMPR (Single-Cell Assay for Measuring Plasmid Retention) to measure copy number heterogeneity and 2m plasmid loss in live cells. We identified three &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; strains that lack endogenous 2m plasmids and reproducibly inhibit mitotic plasmid stability. Focusing on the Y9 ragi strain, we determined that plasmid restriction is heritable and dominant. Using bulk segregant analysis, we identified a high-confidence Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) with a single variant of &lt;i&gt;MMS21&lt;/i&gt; associated with increased 2m instability&lt;i&gt;. MMS21&lt;/i&gt; encodes a SUMO E3 ligase and an essential component of the Smc5/6 complex, involved in sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair. Our analyses leverage natural variation to uncover a novel means by which budding yeasts can overcome highly successful genetic parasites.</description>

	<title>eLife: Modular metabolite assembly in C. elegans depends on carboxylesterases and formation of lysosome-related organelles</title>

	<description>Signaling molecules derived from attachment of diverse metabolic building blocks to ascarosides play a central role in the life history of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; and other nematodes; however, many aspects of their biogenesis remain unclear. Using comparative metabolomics, we show that a pathway mediating formation of intestinal lysosome-related organelles (LROs) is required for biosynthesis of most modular ascarosides as well as previously undescribed modular glucosides. Similar to modular ascarosides, the modular glucosides are derived from highly selective assembly of moieties from nucleoside, amino acid, neurotransmitter, and lipid metabolism, suggesting that modular glucosides, like the ascarosides, may serve signaling functions. We further show that carboxylesterases that localize to intestinal organelles are required for the assembly of both modular ascarosides and glucosides via ester and amide linkages. Further exploration of LRO function and carboxylesterase homologs in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; and other animals may reveal additional new compound families and signaling paradigms.</description>

	<description>Testosterone products are prescribed to males for a variety of possible health benefits, but causal effects are unclear. Evidence from randomized trials are difficult to obtain, particularly regarding effects on long-term or rare outcomes. Mendelian randomization analyses were performed to infer phenome-wide effects of free testosterone on 461 outcomes in 161,268 males from the UK Biobank study. Lifelong increased free testosterone had beneficial effects on increased bone mineral density, and decreased body fat; adverse effects on decreased HDL, and increased risks of prostate cancer, androgenic alopecia, spinal stenosis, and hypertension; and context-dependent effects on increased haematocrit and decreased C-reactive protein. No benefit was observed for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or cognitive outcomes. Mendelian randomization suggests benefits of long-term increased testosterone should be considered against adverse effects, notably increased prostate cancer and hypertension. Well-powered randomized trials are needed to conclusively address risks and benefits of testosterone treatment on these outcomes.</description>

	<description>Based on the joint investigation in 287 healthy volunteers (150 Left-Handers (LH)) of language task-induced asymmetries and intrinsic connectivity strength of the sentence-processing supramodal network, we show that individuals with atypical rightward language lateralization (N = 30, 25 LH) do not rely on an organization that simply mirrors that of typical leftward lateralized individuals. Actually, the resting-state organization in the atypicals showed that their sentence processing was underpinned by left and right networks both wired for language processing and highly interacting by strong interhemispheric intrinsic connectivity and larger corpus callosum volume. Such a loose hemispheric specialization for language permits the hosting of language in either the left and/or right hemisphere as assessed by a very high incidence of dissociations across various language task-induced asymmetries in this group.</description>

	<description>Mature connective tissues demonstrate highly specialised properties, remarkably adapted to meet their functional requirements. Tissue adaptation to environmental cues can occur throughout life and poor adaptation commonly results in injury. However, the temporal nature and drivers of functional adaptation remain undefined. Here, we explore functional adaptation and specialisation of mechanically loaded tissues using tendon; a simple aligned biological composite, in which the collagen (fascicle) and surrounding predominantly non-collagenous matrix (interfascicular matrix) can be interrogated independently. Using an equine model of late development, we report the first phase-specific analysis of biomechanical, structural and compositional changes seen in functional adaptation, demonstrating adaptation occurs postnatally, following mechanical loading, and is almost exclusively localised to the non-collagenous interfascicular matrix. These novel data redefine adaptation in connective tissue, highlighting the fundamental importance of non-collagenous matrix and suggesting that regenerative medicine strategies should change focus from the fibrous to the non-collagenous matrix of tissue.</description>

	<title>eLife: Macrophages promote endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition via MT1-MMP/TGFβ1 after myocardial infarction</title>

	<description>Macrophages (Mφs) produce factors that participate in cardiac repair and remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI); however, how these factors crosstalk with other cell types mediating repair is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrated that cardiac Mφs increased expression of &lt;i&gt;Mmp14&lt;/i&gt; (MT1-MMP) 7 days post-MI&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;We selectively inactivated the &lt;i&gt;Mmp14&lt;/i&gt; gene in Mφs using a genetic strategy (&lt;i&gt;Mmp14&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;f/f&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;i&gt;Lyz2&lt;/i&gt;-Cre). This conditional KO (MAC-Mmp14 KO) resulted in attenuated post-MI cardiac dysfunction, reduced fibrosis, and preserved cardiac capillary network. Mechanistically, we showed that MT1-MMP activates latent TGFβ1 in Mφs, leading to paracrine SMAD2-mediated signaling in endothelial cells (ECs) and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). Post-MI MAC-Mmp14 KO hearts contained fewer cells undergoing EndMT than their wild-type counterparts, and &lt;i&gt;Mmp14&lt;/i&gt;-deficient Mφs showed a reduced ability to induce EndMT in co-cultures with ECs. Our results indicate the contribution of EndMT to cardiac fibrosis and adverse remodeling post-MI and identify Mφ MT1-MMP as a key regulator of this process.</description>

	<description>Serotonin receptors (5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3A&lt;/sub&gt;R) play a crucial role in regulating gut movement, and are the principal target of setrons, a class of high-affinity competitive antagonists, used in the management of nausea and vomiting associated with radiation and chemotherapies. Structural insights into setron-binding poses and their inhibitory mechanisms are just beginning to emerge. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of full-length 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3A&lt;/sub&gt;R in complex with palonosetron, ondansetron, and alosetron. Molecular dynamic simulations of these structures embedded in a fully-hydrated lipid environment assessed the stability of ligand-binding poses and drug-target interactions over time. Together with simulation results of apo- and serotonin-bound 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3A&lt;/sub&gt;R, the study reveals a distinct interaction fingerprint between the various setrons and binding-pocket residues that may underlie their diverse affinities. In addition, varying degrees of conformational change in the setron-5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3A&lt;/sub&gt;R structures, throughout the channel and particularly along the channel activation pathway, suggests a novel mechanism of competitive inhibition.</description>

	<title>eLife: Weight loss, insulin resistance, and study design confound results in a meta-analysis of animal models of fatty liver</title>

	<description>The classical drug development pipeline necessitates studies using animal models of human disease to gauge future efficacy in humans, however there is a low conversion rate from success in animals to humans. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complex chronic disease without any established therapies and a major field of animal research. We performed a meta-analysis with meta-regression of 603 interventional rodent studies (10,364 animals) in NAFLD to assess which variables influenced treatment response. Weight loss and alleviation of insulin resistance were consistently associated with improvement in NAFLD. Multiple drug classes that do not affect weight in humans caused weight loss in animals. Other study design variables, such as age of animals and dietary composition, influenced the magnitude of treatment effect. Publication bias may have increased effect estimates by 37-79%. These findings help to explain the challenge of reproducibility and translation within the field of metabolism.</description>

	<title>eLife: Evolution of multicellularity by collective integration of spatial information</title>

	<description>At the origin of multicellularity, cells may have evolved aggregation in response to predation, for functional specialisation or to allow large-scale integration of environmental cues. These group-level properties emerged from the interactions between cells in a group, and determined the selection pressures experienced by these cells. We investigate the evolution of multicellularity with an evolutionary model where cells search for resources by chemotaxis in a shallow, noisy gradient. Cells can evolve their adhesion to others in a periodically changing environment, where a cell's fitness solely depends on its distance from the gradient source. We show that multicellular aggregates evolve because they perform chemotaxis more efficiently than single cells. Only when the environment changes too frequently, a unicellular state evolves which relies on cell dispersal. Both strategies prevent the invasion of the other through interference competition, creating evolutionary bi-stability. Therefore, collective behaviour can be an emergent selective driver for undifferentiated multicellularity.</description>

	<title>eLife: A virus-encoded protein suppresses methylation of the viral genome through its interaction with AGO4 in the Cajal body</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55542</link>
	<description>In plants, establishment of de novo DNA methylation is regulated by the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. RdDM machinery is known to concentrate in the Cajal body, but the biological significance of this localization has remained elusive. Here, we show that the antiviral methylation of the &lt;i&gt;Tomato yellow leaf curl virus&lt;/i&gt; (TYLCV) genome requires the Cajal body in &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana benthamiana&lt;/i&gt; cells. Methylation of the viral genome is countered by a virus-encoded protein, V2, which interacts with the central RdDM component AGO4, interfering with its binding to the viral DNA; Cajal body localization of the V2-AGO4 interaction is necessary for the viral protein to exert this function. Taken together, our results draw a long sought-after functional connection between RdDM, the Cajal body, and antiviral DNA methylation, paving the way for a deeper understanding of DNA methylation and antiviral defences in plants.</description>

	<title>eLife: Secondary ossification center induces and protects growth plate structure</title>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55212</link>
	<description>Growth plate and articular cartilage constitute a single anatomical entity early in development, but later separate into two distinct structures by the secondary ossification center (SOC). The reason for such separation remains unknown. We found that evolutionarily SOC appears in animals conquering the land - amniotes. Analysis of ossification pattern in mammals with specialized extremities (whales, bats, jerboa) revealed that SOC development correlates with the extent of mechanical loads. Mathematical modelling revealed that SOC reduces mechanical stress within the growth plate. Functional experiments revealed high vulnerability of hypertrophic chondrocytes to mechanical stress and showed that SOC protects these cells from apoptosis caused by extensive loading. Atomic force microscopy showed that hypertrophic chondrocytes are the least mechanically stiff cells within the growth plate. Altogether, these findings suggest that SOC has evolved to protect the hypertrophic chondrocytes from the high mechanical stress encountered in the terrestrial environment.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Removing independent noise in systems neuroscience data using DeepInterpolation</title>

	<description>Progress in nearly every scientific discipline is hindered by the presence of independent noise in spatiotemporally structured datasets. Three widespread technologies for measuring neural activity - calcium imaging, extracellular electrophysiology, and fMRI - all operate in domains in which shot noise and/or thermal noise deteriorate the quality of measured physiological signals. Current denoising approaches sacrifice spatial and/or temporal resolution to increase the Signal-to-Noise Ratio of weak neuronal events, leading to missed opportunities for scientific discovery. Here, we introduce DeepInterpolation, a general-purpose denoising algorithm that trains a nonlinear interpolation model using only noisy samples from the original raw data. Applying DeepInterpolation to in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging yields up to 6 times more segmented neuronal segments with a 15 fold increase in single pixel SNR, uncovering network dynamics at the single-trial level. In extracellular electrophysiology recordings, DeepInterpolation recovered 25% more high-quality spiking units compared to a standard data analysis pipeline. On fMRI datasets, DeepInterpolation increased the SNR of individual voxels 1.6-fold. All these improvements were attained without sacrificing spatial or temporal resolution. Techniques like DeepInterpolation could well have a similar impact in other domains for which independent noise is present in experimental data.</description>

	<description>The brain is capable of processing several streams of information that bear on different aspects of the same problem. Here we address the problem of making two decisions about one object, by studying difficult perceptual decisions about the color and motion of a dynamic random dot display. We find that the accuracy of one decision is unaffected by the difficulty of the other decision. However, the response times reveal that the two decisions do not form simultaneously. We show that both stimulus dimensions are acquired in parallel for the initial [~]0.1 s but are then incorporated serially in time-multiplexed bouts. Thus there is a bottleneck that precludes updating more than one decision at a time, and a buffer that stores samples of evidence while access to the decision is blocked. We suggest that this bottleneck is responsible for the long timescales of many cognitive operations framed as decisions.</description>

	<description>RTP801/REDD1 is a stress-regulated protein whose upregulation is necessary and sufficient to trigger neuronal death in in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases and is up regulated in compromised neurons in human postmortem brains of both neurodegenerative disorders. Indeed, in both Parkinson's and Huntington's disease mouse models, RTP801 knockdown alleviates motor-learning deficits. Here, we investigated the physiological role of RTP801 in neuronal plasticity. RTP801 is found in rat, mouse and human synapses. The absence of RTP801 enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission in both neuronal cultures and brain slices from RTP801 knock-out (KO) mice. Indeed, RTP801 KO mice showed improved motor learning, which correlated with lower spine density but increased basal filopodia and mushroom spines in the motor cortex layer V. This paralleled with higher levels of synaptosomal GluA1 and TrkB receptors in homogenates derived from KO mice motor cortex, proteins that are associated with synaptic strengthening. Altogether, these results indicate that RTP801 has an important role modulating neuronal plasticity in motor learning.</description>

	<description>Working memory and response inhibition are functions that mature relatively late in life, after adolescence, paralleling the maturation of the prefrontal cortex. The link between behavioral and neural maturation is not obvious, however, making it challenging to understand how neural activity underlies the maturation of cognitive function. To gain insights into the nature of observed changes in prefrontal activity between adolescence and adulthood, we investigated the progressive changes in unit activity of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as they were trained to perform working memory and response inhibition tasks. These included increased delay period activity during working memory tasks, and increased activation in antisaccade tasks. These findings reveal universal properties underlying the neuronal computations behind cognitive tasks and explicate the nature of changes that occur as the result of developmental maturation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Somatosensory evoked potentials indexing lateral inhibition are modulated according to the mode of perceptual processing: comparing or combining multi-digit tactile motion</title>

	<description>Many perceptual studies focus on the brain's capacity to discriminate between stimuli. However, our normal experience of the world also involves integrating multiple stimuli into a single perceptual event. Neural circuit mechanisms such as lateral inhibition are believed to enhance local differences between sensory inputs from nearby regions of the receptor surface. However, this mechanism would seem dysfunctional when sensory inputs need to be combined rather than contrasted. Here, we investigated whether the brain can strategically regulate the strength of suppressive interactions that underlie lateral inhibition between finger representations in human somatosensory processing. To do this, we compared sensory processing between conditions that required either comparing or combining information. We delivered two simultaneous tactile motion trajectories to index and middle fingertips of the right hand. Participants had to either compare the directions of the two stimuli, or to combine them to form their average direction. To reveal preparatory tuning of somatosensory cortex, we used an established event-related potential design to measure the interaction between cortical representations evoked by digital nerve shocks immediately before each tactile stimulus. Consistent with previous studies, we found a clear suppressive interaction between cortical activations when participants were preparing to compare the tactile motion directions. Importantly, this suppressive interaction was significantly reduced when participants had to combine the same stimuli. These findings suggest that the brain can strategically switch between a comparative and a combinative mode of somatosensory processing, according to the perceptual goal, by preparatorily adjusting the strength of a process akin to lateral inhibition.</description>

	<description>Humans are capable of acquiring multiple types of information presented in the same visual information stream. It has been suggested that at least two parallel learning processes are important during learning of sequential patterns: statistical learning and rule-based learning. Yet, the neurophysiological underpinnings of these parallel learning mechanisms in visual sequences are not fully understood. To differentiate between the simultaneous mechanisms at the single trial level, we apply a temporal EEG signal decomposition approach together with sLORETA source localization method to delineate whether distinct statistical and rule-based learning codes can be distinguished in EEG data and can be related to distinct functional neuroanatomical structures. We demonstrate that concomitant but distinct aspects of information coded in the N2 time window play a role in these mechanisms: mismatch detection and response control underlie statistical learning and rule-based learning, respectively, albeit with different levels of time-sensitivity. Moreover, the effects of the two learning mechanisms in the different temporally decomposed clusters of neural activity also differed from each other in neural sources. Importantly, the right inferior frontal cortex (BA44) was specifically implicated in statistical learning, confirming its role in the acquisition of transitional probabilities. In contrast, rule-based learning was associated with the prefrontal gyrus (BA6). The results show how simultaneous learning mechanisms operate at the neurophysiological level and are orchestrated by distinct prefrontal cortical areas. The current findings deepen our understanding on the mechanisms how humans are capable of learning multiple types of information from the same stimulus stream in a parallel fashion.</description>

A stochastic compartmental network model of SARS-CoV-2 spread explores the simultaneous effects of policy choices in three domains: social distancing, hospital triaging, and testing. Considering policy domains together provides insight into how different policy decisions interact. The model incorporates important characteristics of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, such as heterogeneous risk factors and asymptomatic transmission, and enables a reliable qualitative comparison of policy choices despite the current uncertainty in key virus and disease parameters. Results suggest possible refinements to current policies, including emphasizing the need to reduce random encounters more than personal contacts, and testing low-risk symptomatic individuals before high-risk symptomatic individuals. The strength of social distancing of symptomatic individuals affects the degree to which asymptomatic cases drive the epidemic as well as the level of population-wide contact reduction needed to keep hospitals below capacity. The relative importance of testing and triaging also depends on the overall level of social distancing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ji4JQTufgp8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Current computational models suggest that paranoia may be explained by stronger higher-order beliefs about others and increased sensitivity to environments. However, it is unclear whether this applies to social contexts, and whether it is specific to harmful intent attributions, the live expression of paranoia. We sought to fill this gap this by fitting a computational model to data (n = 1754) from a modified serial dictator game, to explore whether pre-existing paranoia could be accounted by specific alterations to cognitive parameters characterising harmful intent attributions. We constructed a ‘Bayesian brain’ model of others’ intent, which we fitted to harmful intent and self-interest attributions made over 18 trials, across three different partners. We found that pre-existing paranoia was associated with greater uncertainty about other’s actions. It moderated the relationship between learning rates and harmful intent attributions, making harmful intent attributions less reliant on prior interactions. Overall, the magnitude of harmful intent attributions was directly related to their uncertainty, and importantly, the opposite was true for self-interest attributions. Our results explain how pre-existing paranoia may be the result of an increased need to attend to immediate experiences in determining intentional threat, at the expense of what is already known, and more broadly, they suggest that environments that induce greater probabilities of harmful intent attributions may also induce states of uncertainty, potentially as an adaptive mechanism to better detect threatening others. Importantly, we suggest that if paranoia were able to be explained exclusively by core domain-general alterations we wouldn’t observe differential parameter estimates underlying harmful-intent and self-interest attributions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5H8h9fwkQT8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

It has extensively been documented that human memory exhibits a wide range of systematic distortions, which have been associated with resource constraints. Resource constraints on memory can be formalised in the normative framework of lossy compression, however traditional lossy compression algorithms result in qualitatively different distortions to those found in experiments with humans. We argue that the form of distortions is characteristic of relying on a generative model adapted to the environment for compression. We show that this semantic compression framework can provide a unifying explanation of a wide variety of memory phenomena. We harness recent advances in learning deep generative models, that yield powerful tools to approximate generative models of complex data. We use three datasets, chess games, natural text, and hand-drawn sketches, to demonstrate the effects of semantic compression on memory performance. Our model accounts for memory distortions related to domain expertise, gist-based distortions, contextual effects, and delayed recall.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tKt-sHQH9RQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

In computer science, reinforcement learning is a powerful framework with which artificial agents can learn to maximize their performance for any given Markov decision process (MDP). Advances over the last decade, in combination with deep neural networks, have enjoyed performance advantages over humans in many difficult task settings. However, such frameworks perform far less favorably when evaluated in their ability to generalize or transfer representations across different tasks. Existing algorithms that facilitate transfer typically are limited to cases in which the transition function or the optimal policy is portable to new contexts, but achieving “deep transfer” characteristic of human behavior has been elusive. Such transfer typically requires discovery of abstractions that permit analogical reuse of previously learned representations to superficially distinct tasks. Here, we demonstrate that abstractions that minimize error in predictions of reward outcomes generalize across tasks with different transition and reward functions. Such reward-predictive representations compress the state space of a task into a lower dimensional representation by combining states that are equivalent in terms of both the transition and reward functions. Because only state equivalences are considered, the resulting state representation is not tied to the transition and reward functions themselves and thus generalizes across tasks with different reward and transition functions. These results contrast with those using abstractions that myopically maximize reward in any given MDP and motivate further experiments in humans and animals to investigate if neural and cognitive systems involved in state representation perform abstractions that facilitate such equivalence relations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5Co9usdpMl0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Animals produce vocalizations that range in complexity from a single repeated call to hundreds of unique vocal elements patterned in sequences unfolding over hours. Characterizing complex vocalizations can require considerable effort and a deep intuition about each species’ vocal behavior. Even with a great deal of experience, human characterizations of animal communication can be affected by human perceptual biases. We present a set of computational methods for projecting animal vocalizations into low dimensional latent representational spaces that are directly learned from the spectrograms of vocal signals. We apply these methods to diverse datasets from over 20 species, including humans, bats, songbirds, mice, cetaceans, and nonhuman primates. Latent projections uncover complex features of data in visually intuitive and quantifiable ways, enabling high-powered comparative analyses of vocal acoustics. We introduce methods for analyzing vocalizations as both discrete sequences and as continuous latent variables. Each method can be used to disentangle complex spectro-temporal structure and observe long-timescale organization in communication.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vhqR04LaNoc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Clinical Features and Risk of Relapse in Children and Adults with Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody–Associated Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25909?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25909?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main objective was to compare clinical features, disease course, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody (Ab) dynamics between children and adults with MOG‐Ab–associated disease (MOGAD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This retrospective multicentric, national study included 98 children and 268 adults with MOGAD between January 2014 and September 2019. Cox regression model for recurrent time‐to‐event data and Kaplan–Meier curves for time to antibody negativity were performed for the objectives.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolated optic neuritis was the most frequent clinical presentation in both children (40.8%) and adults (55.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013), and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis syndrome was more frequent in children (36.7% vs 5.6%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Compared to adults, children displayed better recovery (Expanded Disability Status Scale ≥ 3.0 at last follow‐up reached only by 10 of 97 [10.3%] vs 66/247 [26.7%], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, adults were at higher risk of relapse than children (hazard ratio = 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12–1.78, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003). At 2 years, 64.2% (95% CI = 40.9–86.5) of nonrelapsing children became MOG‐Ab negative compared to 14.1% (95% CI = 4.7–38.3) of relapsing children (log‐rank &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), with no differences observed in adults (log‐rank &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.280).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOGAD patients differ in the clinical presentation at onset, showing an age‐related shift in the clinical features across age groups. Compared to children, adults have a higher risk of relapse and worse functional recovery. Finally, children with monophasic disease become MOG‐Ab negative earlier than relapsing children, but this is not true in adults. Considering these differences, management and treatment guidelines should be considered independently in children and adults. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Causal Associations Between Modifiable Risk Factors and the Alzheimer's Phenome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25918?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25918?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to infer causal relationships between 22 previously reported risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the “AD phenome”: AD, AD age of onset (AAOS), hippocampal volume, cortical surface area and thickness, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid‐β (Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;), tau, and ptau&lt;sub&gt;181&lt;/sub&gt;, and the neuropathological burden of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and vascular brain injury (VBI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for the 22 risk factors were computed in 26,431 AD cases/controls and the association with AD was evaluated using logistic regression. Two‐sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to infer the causal effect of risk factors on the AD phenome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRS for increased education and diastolic blood pressure were associated with reduced risk for AD. MR indicated that only education was causally associated with reduced risk of AD, delayed AAOS, and increased cortical surface area and thickness. Total‐ and LDL‐cholesterol levels were causally associated with increased neuritic plaque burden, although the effects were driven by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; locus. Diastolic blood pressure and pulse pressure are causally associated with increased risk of VBI. Furthermore, total cholesterol was associated with decreased hippocampal volume; smoking initiation with decreased cortical thickness; type 2 diabetes with an earlier AAOS; and sleep duration with increased cortical thickness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our comprehensive examination of the genetic evidence for the causal relationships between previously reported risk factors in AD using PRS and MR supports a causal role for education, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking, and diabetes with the AD phenome.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Infant vocal babbling strongly relies on jaw oscillations, especially at the
stage of canonical babbling, which underlies the syllabic structure of world
languages. In this paper, we propose, model and analyze an hypothesis to
explain this predominance of the jaw in early babbling. This hypothesis states
that general stochastic optimization principles, when applied to learning
sensorimotor control, automatically generate ordered babbling stages with a
predominant exploration of jaw movements in early stages. The reason is that
those movements impact the auditory effects more than other articulators. In
previous computational models, such general principles were shown to
selectively freeze and free degrees of freedom in a model reproducing the
proximo-distal development observed in infant arm reaching. The contribution of
this paper is to show how, using the same methods, we are able to explain such
patterns in vocal development. We present three experiments. The two first ones
show that the recruitment order of articulators emerging from stochastic
optimization depends on the target sound to be achieved but that on average the
jaw is largely chosen as the first recruited articulator. The third experiment
analyses in more detail how the emerging recruitment order is shaped by the
dynamics of the optimization process.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Deep brain stimulation for movement disorder treatment: Exploring frequency-dependent efficacy in a computational network model. (arXiv:2010.07162v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07162</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07162</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;A large scale computational model of the basal ganglia (BG) network is
proposed to describes movement disorder including deep brain stimulation (DBS).
The model of this complex network considers four areas of the basal ganglia
network: the subthalamic nucleus (STN) as target area of DBS, globus pallidus,
both pars externa and pars interna (GPe-GPi), and the thalamus (THA).
Parkinsonian conditions are simulated by assuming reduced dopaminergic input
and corresponding pronounced inhibitory or disinhibited projections to GPe and
GPi. Macroscopic quantities can be derived which correlate closely to thalamic
responses and hence motor programme fidelity. It can be demonstrated that
depending on different levels of striatal projections to the GPe and GPi, the
dynamics of these macroscopic quantities switch from normal conditions to
parkinsonian. Simulating DBS on the STN affects the dynamics of the entire
network, increasing the thalamic activity to levels close to normal, while
differing from both normal and parkinsonian dynamics. Using the mentioned
macroscopic quantities, the model proposes optimal DBS frequency ranges above
130 Hz.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A central question in neuroscience is how self-organizing dynamic
interactions in the brain emerge on their relatively static structural
backbone. Due to the complexity of spatial and temporal dependencies between
different brain areas, fully comprehending the interplay between structure and
function is still challenging and an area of intense research. In this paper we
present a graph neural network (GNN) framework, to describe functional
interactions based on the structural anatomical layout. A GNN allows us to
process graph-structured spatio-temporal signals, providing a possibility to
combine structural information derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with
temporal neural activity profiles, like observed in functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, dynamic interactions between different
brain regions learned by this data-driven approach can provide a multi-modal
measure of causal connectivity strength. We assess the proposed model's
accuracy by evaluating its capabilities to replicate empirically observed
neural activation profiles, and compare the performance to those of a vector
auto regression (VAR), like typically used in Granger causality. We show that
GNNs are able to capture long-term dependencies in data and also
computationally scale up to the analysis of large-scale networks. Finally we
confirm that features learned by a GNN can generalize across MRI scanner types
and acquisition protocols, by demonstrating that the performance on small
datasets can be improved by pre-training the GNN on data from an earlier and
different study. We conclude that the proposed multi-modal GNN framework can
provide a novel perspective on the structure-function relationship in the
brain. Therewith this approach can be promising for the characterization of the
information flow in brain networks.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Reservoir Computing and its Sensitivity to Symmetry in the Activation Function. (arXiv:2010.07103v1 [physics.data-an])</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07103</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07103</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Reservoir computing has repeatedly been shown to be extremely successful in
the prediction of nonlinear time-series. However, there is no complete
understanding of the proper design of a reservoir yet. We find that the
simplest popular setup has a harmful symmetry, which leads to the prediction of
what we call mirror-attractor. We prove this analytically. Similar problems can
arise in a general context, and we use them to explain the success or failure
of some designs. The symmetry is a direct consequence of the hyperbolic tangent
activation function. Further, four ways to break the symmetry are compared
numerically: A bias in the output, a shift in the input, a quadratic term in
the readout, and a mixture of even and odd activation functions. Firstly, we
test their susceptibility to the mirror-attractor. Secondly, we evaluate their
performance on the task of predicting Lorenz data with the mean shifted to
zero. The short-time prediction is measured with the forecast horizon while the
largest Lyapunov exponent and the correlation dimension are used to represent
the climate. Finally, the same analysis is repeated on a combined dataset of
the Lorenz attractor and the Halvorsen attractor, which we designed to reveal
potential problems with symmetry. We find that all methods except the output
bias are able to fully break the symmetry with input shift and quadratic
readout performing the best overall.

non-constrained implicit functions. These functions are parametrized by a set
of learnable weights and may optionally depend on some input; making them
perfectly suitable as learnable layer in a neural network. We demonstrate our
scheme on different applications: (i) neural ODEs with the implicit Euler
method, and (ii) system identification in model predictive control.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A synaptic theory of Working Memory (WM) has been developed in the last
decade as a possible alternative to the persistent spiking paradigm. In this
context, we have developed a neural mass model able to reproduce exactly the
dynamics of heterogeneous spiking neural networks encompassing realistic
cellular mechanisms for short-term synaptic plasticity. This population model
reproduces the macroscopic dynamics of the network in terms of the firing rate
and the mean membrane potential. The latter quantity allows us to get insight
on Local Field Potential and electroencephalographic signals measured during WM
tasks to characterize the brain activity. More specifically synaptic
facilitation and depression integrate each other to efficiently mimic WM
operations via either synaptic reactivation or persistent activity. Memory
access and loading are associated to stimulus-locked transient oscillations
followed by a steady-state activity in the $\beta-\gamma$ band, thus resembling
what observed in the cortex during vibrotactile stimuli in humans and object
recognition in monkeys. Memory juggling and competition emerge already by
loading only two items. However more items can be stored in WM by considering
neural architectures composed of multiple excitatory populations and a common
inhibitory pool. Memory capacity depends strongly on the presentation rate of
the items and it maximizes for an optimal frequency range. In particular we
provide an analytic expression for the maximal memory capacity. Furthermore,
the mean membrane potential turns out to be a suitable proxy to measure the
memory load, analogously to event driven potentials in experiments on humans.
Finally we show that the $\gamma$ power increases with the number of loaded
items, as reported in many experiments, while $\theta$ and $\beta$ power reveal
non monotonic behaviours.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06845</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We introduce two novel generalizations of the Koopman operator method of
nonlinear dynamic modeling. Each of these generalizations leads to greatly
improved predictive performance without sacrificing a unique trait of Koopman
methods: the potential for fast, globally optimal control of nonlinear,
nonconvex systems. The first generalization, Convex Koopman Models, uses convex
rather than linear dynamics in the lifted space. The second, Extended Koopman
Models, additionally introduces an invertible transformation of the control
signal which contributes to the lifted convex dynamics. We describe a deep
learning architecture for parameterizing these classes of models, and show
experimentally that each significantly outperforms traditional Koopman models
in trajectory prediction for two nonlinear, nonconvex dynamic systems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Raven's Progressive Matrices have been widely used for measuring abstract
reasoning and intelligence in humans. However for artificial learning systems,
abstract reasoning remains a challenging problem. In this paper we investigate
how neural networks augmented with biologically inspired spiking modules gain a
significant advantage in solving this problem. To illustrate this, we first
investigate the performance of our networks with supervised learning, then with
unsupervised learning. Experiments on the RAVEN dataset show that the overall
accuracy of our supervised networks surpass human-level performance, while our
unsupervised networks significantly outperform existing unsupervised methods.
Finally, our results from both supervised and unsupervised learning illustrate
that, unlike their non-augmented counterparts, networks with spiking modules
are able to extract and encode temporal features without any explicit
instruction, do not heavily rely on training data, and generalise more readily
to new problems. In summary, the results reported here indicate that artificial
neural networks with spiking modules are well suited to solving abstract
reasoning.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Current AI systems at the tactical edge lack the computational resources to
support in-situ training and inference for situational awareness, and it is not
always practical to leverage backhaul resources due to security, bandwidth, and
mission latency requirements. We propose a solution through Deep delay Loop
Reservoir Computing (DLR), a processing architecture supporting general machine
learning algorithms on compact mobile devices by leveraging delay-loop (DL)
reservoir computing in combination with innovative photonic hardware exploiting
the inherent speed, and spatial, temporal and wavelength-based processing
diversity of signals in the optical domain. DLR delivers reductions in form
factor, hardware complexity, power consumption and latency, compared to
State-of-the-Art . DLR can be implemented with a single photonic DL and a few
electro-optical components. In certain cases multiple DL layers increase
learning capacity of the DLR with no added latency. We demonstrate the
advantages of DLR on the application of RF Specific Emitter Identification.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;We present the Surrogate-gradient Online Error-triggered Learning (SOEL)
system for online few-shot learning on neuromorphic processors. The SOEL
learning system uses a combination of transfer learning and principles of
computational neuroscience and deep learning. We show that partially trained
deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) implemented on neuromorphic hardware can
rapidly adapt online to new classes of data within a domain. SOEL updates
trigger when an error occurs, enabling faster learning with fewer updates.
Using gesture recognition as a case study, we show SOEL can be used for online
few-shot learning of new classes of pre-recorded gesture data and rapid online
learning of new gestures from data streamed live from a Dynamic Active-pixel
Vision Sensor to an Intel Loihi neuromorphic research processor.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a stochastic neural network capable
of solving a variety of difficult tasks such as NP-Hard combinatorial
optimization problems and integer factorization. The RBM architecture is also
very compact; requiring very few weights and biases. This, along with its
simple, parallelizable sampling algorithm for finding the ground state of such
problems, makes the RBM amenable to hardware acceleration. However, training of
the RBM on these problems can pose a significant challenge, as the training
algorithm tends to fail for large problem sizes and efficient mappings can be
hard to find. Here, we propose a method of combining RBMs together that avoids
the need to train large problems in their full form. We also propose methods
for making the RBM more hardware amenable, allowing the algorithm to be
efficiently mapped to an FPGA-based accelerator. Using this accelerator, we are
able to show hardware accelerated factorization of 16 bit numbers with high
accuracy with a speed improvement of 10000x and a power improvement of 32x.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: How Turing parasites expand the computational landscape of digital life. (arXiv:1910.14339v3 [q-bio.PE] UPDATED)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14339</guid>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14339</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Why are living systems complex? Why does the biosphere contain living beings
with complexity features beyond those of the simplest replicators? What kind of
evolutionary pressures result in more complex life forms? These are key
questions that pervade the problem of how complexity arises in evolution. One
particular way of tackling this is grounded in an algorithmic description of
life: living organisms can be seen as systems that extract and process
information from their surroundings in order to reduce uncertainty. Here we
take this computational approach using a simple bit string model of coevolving
agents and their parasites. While agents try to predict their worlds, parasites
do the same with their hosts. The result of this process is that, in order to
escape their parasites, the host agents expand their computational complexity
despite the cost of maintaining it. This, in turn, is followed by increasingly
complex parasitic counterparts. Such arms races display several qualitative
phases, from monotonous to punctuated evolution or even ecological collapse.
Our minimal model illustrates the relevance of parasites in providing an active
mechanism for expanding living complexity beyond simple replicators, suggesting
that parasitic agents are likely to be a major evolutionary driver for
biological complexity.

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Brain regions such as the cerebellum (CB) have been neglected for a long time in the study of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. In reference to a new emerging hypothesis according to which there is an altered cerebellar synaptic processing in AD, we verified the possible role played by new biomarkers in the CB of AD patients compared with not-demented healthy control subjects (NDHS). Using a bioinformatics approach, we have collected several microarray datasets and obtained 626 cerebella sample biopsies belonging to subjects who did not die from causes related to neurological diseases and 199 cerebella belonging to AD. The analysis of logical relations between the transcriptome dataset highlighted guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein) gamma 13 (GNG13) as a potential new biomarker for Purkinje cells (PCs). We have correlated GNG13 expression levels with already widely existing bibliography of PC marker genes, such as Purkinje cell protein 2 (PCP2), Purkinje cell protein 4 (PCP4), and cerebellin 3 (CBLN3). We showed that expression levels of GNG13 and PCP2, PCP4, and CBLN3 were significantly correlated with each other in NDHS and in AD and significantly reduced in AD patients compared with NDHS subjects. In addition, we highlighted a negative correlation between the expression levels of PC biomarkers and age. From the outcome of our investigation, it is possible to conclude that the identification of GNG13 as a potentially biomarker in PCs represents also a state of health of CB, in association with the expression of PCP2, PCP4, and CBLN3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Over-Expression of Immune-Related lncRNAs in Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathies</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have crucial roles in the pathogenesis of immune-related disorders. However, their role in the pathobiology of inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathies remains unclear. In the current study, we measured peripheral expression of four lncRNAs, namely &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TUG1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FAS-AS1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NEAT1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GAS5&lt;/em&gt;, in patients with acute/chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathies (AIDP/CIDP) compared with healthy subjects. Notably, all lncRNAs were over-expressed in patients compared with controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001 for all lncRNAs). When assessing their expressions in AIDP and CIDP groups separately, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TUG1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NEAT1&lt;/em&gt; were up-regulated in both patient groups compared with controls, yet &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FAS-AS1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GAS5&lt;/em&gt; were only up-regulated in CIDP cases. There were remarkable pairwise correlations between expression levels of these lncRNAs in all study groups. Based on the above-mentioned data, we suggest participation of these for lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathies. Moreover, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;FAS-AS1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GAS5&lt;/em&gt; lncRNAs have type-specific roles in this regard. Future functional studies are needed to elaborate the molecular mechanisms of the contribution of these transcripts in AIDP/CIDP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Neuroinformatics: Deep Representational Similarity Learning for Analyzing Neural Signatures in Task-based fMRI Dataset</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12021-020-09494-4</guid>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Similarity analysis is one of the crucial steps in most fMRI studies. Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) can measure similarities of neural signatures generated by different cognitive states. This paper develops Deep Representational Similarity Learning (DRSL), a deep extension of RSA that is appropriate for analyzing similarities between various cognitive tasks in fMRI datasets with a large number of subjects, and high-dimensionality — such as whole-brain images. Unlike the previous methods, DRSL is not limited by a linear transformation or a restricted fixed nonlinear kernel function — such as Gaussian kernel. DRSL utilizes a multi-layer neural network for mapping neural responses to linear space, where this network can implement a customized nonlinear transformation for each subject separately. Furthermore, utilizing a gradient-based optimization in DRSL can significantly reduce runtime of analysis on large datasets because it uses a batch of samples in each iteration rather than all neural responses to find an optimal solution. Empirical studies on multi-subject fMRI datasets with various tasks — including visual stimuli, decision making, flavor, and working memory — confirm that the proposed method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art RSA algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Prolonged Targeted Cardiovascular Epidural Stimulation Improves Immunological Molecular Profile: A Case Report in Chronic Severe Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.571011</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In individuals with severe spinal cord injury (SCI), the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is affected leading to cardiovascular deficits, which include significant blood pressure instability, with the prevalence of systemic hypotension and orthostatic intolerance resulting in an increased risk of stroke. Additionally, persons with SCI rostral to thoracic vertebral level 5 (T5), where sympathetic nervous system fibers exit the spinal cord and innervate the immune system, have clinically significant systemic inflammation and increased infection risk. Our recent studies show that lumbosacral spinal cord epidural stimulation (scES), applied at the lumbosacral level using targeted configurations that promote cardiovascular stability (CV-scES), can safely and effectively normalize blood pressure in persons with chronic SCI. Herein we present a case report in a female (age 27 years) with chronic clinically motor complete cervical SCI demonstrating that 97-sessions of CV-scES, which increased systemic blood pressure, improved orthostatic tolerance in association with increased cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery, also promoted positive immunological changes in whole-blood gene expression. Specifically, there was evidence of the down-regulation of inflammatory pathways and the up-regulation of adaptative immune pathways. The findings of this case report suggest that the autonomic effects of epidural stimulation, targeted to promote cardiovascular homeostasis, also improves immune system function, which has a significant benefit to long-term cardiovascular and immunologic health in individuals with long-standing SCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT02307565.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Brain White-Matter Degeneration Due to Aging and Parkinson Disease as Revealed by Double Diffusion Encoding</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.584510</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Microstructure imaging by means of multidimensional diffusion encoding is increasingly applied in clinical research, with expectations that it yields a parameter that better correlates with clinical disability than current methods based on single diffusion encoding. Under the assumption that diffusion within a voxel can be well described by a collection of diffusion tensors, several parameters of this diffusion tensor distribution can be derived, including mean size, variance of sizes, orientational dispersion, and microscopic anisotropy. The information provided by multidimensional diffusion encoding also enables us to decompose the sources of the conventional fractional anisotropy and mean kurtosis. In this study, we explored the utility of the diffusion tensor distribution approach for characterizing white-matter degeneration in aging and in Parkinson disease by using double diffusion encoding. Data from 23 healthy older subjects and 27 patients with Parkinson disease were analyzed. Advanced age was associated with greater mean size and size variances, as well as smaller microscopic anisotropy. By analyzing the parameters underlying diffusion kurtosis, we found that the reductions of kurtosis in aging and Parkinson disease reported in the literature are likely driven by the reduction in microscopic anisotropy. Furthermore, microscopic anisotropy correlated with the severity of motor impairment in the patients with Parkinson disease. The present results support the use of multidimensional diffusion encoding in clinical studies and are encouraging for its future clinical implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Disrupted Patterns of Rich-Club and Diverse-Club Organizations in Subjective Cognitive Decline and Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>

	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) were considered to be a continuum of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) spectrum. The abnormal topological architecture and rich-club organization in the brain functional network can reveal the pathology of the AD spectrum. However, few studies have explored the disrupted patterns of diverse club organizations and the combination of rich- and diverse-club organizations in SCD and aMCI.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 19 SCDs, 29 aMCIs, and 28 healthy controls (HCs) from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Graph theory analysis was used to analyze the network metrics and rich- and diverse-club organizations simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with HC, the aMCI group showed altered small-world and network efficiency, whereas the SCD group remained relatively stable. The aMCI group showed reduced rich-club connectivity compared with the HC. In addition, the aMCI group showed significantly increased feeder connectivity and decreased local connectivity of the diverse club compared with the SCD group. The overlapping nodes of the rich club and diverse club showed a significant difference in nodal efficiency and shortest path length (L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) between groups. Notably, the L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; values of overlapping nodes in the SCD and aMCI groups were significantly associated with episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The present study demonstrates that the network properties of SCD and aMCI have varying degrees of damage. The combination of the rich club and the diverse club can provide a novel insight into the pathological mechanism of the AD spectrum. The altered patterns in overlapping nodes might be potential biomarkers in the diagnosis of the AD spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Insights Into Peptide Inhibition of Alpha-Synuclein Aggregation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.561462</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein (aSyn) aggregation is an attractive target for therapeutic development for a range of neurodegenerative conditions, collectively termed synucleinopathies. Here, we probe the mechanism of action of a peptide 4554W, (KDGIVNGVKA), previously identified through intracellular library screening, to prevent aSyn aggregation and associated toxicity. We utilize NMR to probe association and identify that 4554W associates with a “partially aggregated” form of aSyn, with enhanced association occurring over time. We also report the ability of 4554W to undergo modification through deamidation of the central asparagine residue, occurring on the same timescale as aSyn aggregation in vitro, with peptide modification enhancing its association with aSyn. Additionally, we report that 4554W can act to reduce fibril formation of five Parkinson’s disease associated aSyn mutants. Inhibitory peptide binding to partially aggregated forms of aSyn, as identified here, is particularly attractive from a therapeutic perspective, as it would eliminate the need to administer the therapy at pre-aggregation stages, which are difficult to diagnose. Taken together the data suggest that 4554W could be a suitable candidate for future therapeutic development against wild-type, and most mutant aSyn aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: In vivo Analysis of CRISPR/Cas9 Induced Atlastin Pathological Mutations in Drosophila</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly dynamic network whose shape is thought to be actively regulated by membrane resident proteins. Mutation of several such morphology regulators cause the neurological disorder Hereditary Sp astic Paraplegia (HSP), suggesting a critical role of ER shape maintenance in neuronal activity and function. Human Atlastin-1 mutations are responsible for SPG3A, the earliest onset and one of the more severe forms of dominant HSP. Atlastin has been initially identified in Drosophila as the GTPase responsible for the homotypic fusion of ER membrane. The majority of SPG3A-linked Atlastin-1 mutations map to the GTPase domain, potentially interfering with atlastin GTPase activity, and to the three-helix-bundle (3HB) domain, a region critical for homo-oligomerization. Here we have examined the in vivo effects of four pathogenetic missense mutations (two mapping to the GTPase domain and two to the 3HB domain) using two complementary approaches: CRISPR/Cas9 editing to introduce such variants in the endogenous atlastin gene and transgenesis to generate lines overexpressing atlastin carrying the same pathogenic variants. We found that all pathological mutations examined reduce atlastin activity in vivo although to different degrees of severity. Moreover, overexpression of the pathogenic variants in a wild type atlastin background does not give rise to the loss of function phenotypes expected for dominant negative mutations. These results indicate that the four pathological mutations investigated act through a loss of function mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: A Systemic Review of Available Low-Cost EEG Headsets Used for Drowsiness Detection</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.553352</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Drowsiness is a leading cause of traffic and industrial accidents, costing lives and productivity. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals can reflect awareness and attentiveness, and low-cost consumer EEG headsets are available on the market. The use of these devices as drowsiness detectors could increase the accessibility of safety and productivity-enhancing devices for small businesses and developing countries. We conducted a systemic review of currently available, low-cost, consumer EEG-based drowsiness detection systems. We sought to determine whether consumer EEG headsets could be reliably utilized as rudimentary drowsiness detection systems. We included documented cases describing successful drowsiness detection using consumer EEG-based devices, including the Neurosky MindWave, InteraXon Muse, Emotiv Epoc, Emotiv Insight, and OpenBCI. Of 46 relevant studies, ~27 reported an accuracy score. The lowest of these was the Neurosky Mindwave, with a minimum of 31%. The second lowest accuracy reported was 79.4% with an OpenBCI study. In many cases, algorithmic optimization remains necessary. Different methods for accuracy calculation, system calibration, and different definitions of drowsiness made direct comparisons problematic. However, even basic features, such as the power spectra of EEG bands, were able to consistently detect drowsiness. Each specific device has its own capabilities, tradeoffs, and limitations. Widely used spectral features can achieve successful drowsiness detection, even with low-cost consumer devices; however, reliability issues must still be addressed in an occupational context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Mental Effort When Playing, Listening, and Imagining Music in One Pianist’s Eyes and Brain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.576888</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.576888</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We investigated “musical effort” with an internationally renowned, classical, pianist while playing, listening, and imagining music. We used pupillometry as an objective measure of mental effort and fMRI as an exploratory method of effort with the same musical pieces. We also compared a group of non-professional pianists and non-musicians by the use of pupillometry and a small group of non-musicians with fMRI. This combined approach of psychophysiology and neuroimaging revealed the cognitive work during different musical activities. We found that pupil diameters were largest when “playing” (regardless of whether there was sound produced or not) compared to conditions with no movement (i.e., “listening” and “imagery”). We found positive correlations between pupil diameters of the professional pianist during different conditions with the same piano piece (i.e., normal playing, silenced playing, listen, imagining), which might indicate similar degrees of load on cognitive resources as well as an intimate link between the motor imagery of sound-producing body motions and gestures. We also confirmed that musical imagery had a strong commonality with music listening in both pianists and musically naïve individuals. Neuroimaging provided evidence for a relationship between noradrenergic (NE) activity and mental workload or attentional intensity within the domain of music cognition. We found effort related activity in the superior part of the locus coeruleus (LC) and, similarly to the pupil, the listening and imagery engaged less the LC–NE network than the motor condition. The pianists attended more intensively to the most difficult piece than the non-musicians since they showed larger pupils for the most difficult piece. Non-musicians were the most engaged by the music listening task, suggesting that the amount of attention allocated for the same task may follow a hierarchy of expertise demanding less attentional effort in expert or performers than in novices. In the professional pianist, we found only weak evidence for a commonality between subjective effort (as rated measure-by-measure) and the objective effort gauged with pupil diameter during listening. We suggest that psychophysiological methods like pupillometry can index mental effort in a manner that is not available to subjective awareness or introspection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Examining Sodium and Potassium Channel Conductances Involved in Hyperexcitability of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy: A Mathematical and Cell Culture-Based Study</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.564980</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.564980</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a prevalent, painful side effect which arises due to a number of chemotherapy agents. CIPN can have a prolonged effect on quality of life. Chemotherapy treatment is often reduced or stopped altogether because of the severe pain. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for CIPN partially due to its complex pathogenesis in multiple pathways involving a variety of channels, specifically, voltage-gated ion channels. One aspect of neuropathic pain in vitro is hyperexcitability in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) peripheral sensory neurons. Our study employs bifurcation theory to investigate the role of voltage-gated ion channels in inducing hyperexcitability as a consequence of spontaneous firing due to the common chemotherapy agent paclitaxel. Our mathematical investigation of a reductionist DRG neuron model comprised of sodium channel Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7, sodium channel Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.8, delayed rectifier potassium channel, A-type transient potassium channel, and a leak channel suggests that Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 and delayed rectifier potassium channel conductances are critical for hyperexcitability of small DRG neurons. Introducing paclitaxel into the model, our bifurcation analysis predicts that hyperexcitability is highest for a medium dose of paclitaxel, which is supported by multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings. Furthermore, our findings using MEA reveal that Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 blocker A-803467 and delayed rectifier potassium enhancer L-alpha-phosphatidyl-D-myo-inositol 4,5-diphosphate, dioctanoyl (PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can reduce paclitaxel-induced hyperexcitability of DRG neurons. Our approach can be readily extended and used to investigate various other contributors of hyperexcitability in CIPN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;High-frequency firing activity can be induced either naturally in a healthy brain as a result of the processing of sensory stimuli or as an uncontrolled synchronous activity characterizing epileptic seizures. As part of this work, we investigate how logic circuits that are engineered in neurons can be used to design spike filters, attenuating high-frequency activity in a neuronal network that can be used to minimize the effects of neurodegenerative disorders such as epilepsy. We propose a reconfigurable filter design built from small neuronal networks that behave as digital logic circuits. We developed a mathematical framework to obtain a transfer function derived from a linearization process of the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Our results suggest that individual gates working as the output of the logic circuits can be used as a reconfigurable filtering technique. Also, as part of the analysis, the analytical model showed similar levels of attenuation in the frequency domain when compared to computational simulations by fine-tuning the synaptic weight. The proposed approach can potentially lead to precise and tunable treatments for neurological conditions that are inspired by communication theory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Activity-Dependent Remodeling of Synaptic Protein Organization Revealed by High Throughput Analysis of STED Nanoscopy Images</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The organization of proteins in the apposed nanodomains of pre- and postsynaptic compartments is thought to play a pivotal role in synaptic strength and plasticity. As such, the alignment between pre- and postsynaptic proteins may regulate, for example, the rate of presynaptic release or the strength of postsynaptic signaling. However, the analysis of these structures has mainly been restricted to subsets of synapses, providing a limited view of the diversity of synaptic protein cluster remodeling during synaptic plasticity. To characterize changes in the organization of synaptic nanodomains during synaptic plasticity over a large population of synapses, we combined STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) nanoscopy with a Python-based statistical object distance analysis (pySODA), in dissociated cultured hippocampal circuits exposed to treatments driving different forms of synaptic plasticity. The nanoscale organization, characterized in terms of coupling properties, of presynaptic (Bassoon, RIM1/2) and postsynaptic (PSD95, Homer1c) scaffold proteins was differently altered in response to plasticity-inducing stimuli. For the Bassoon - PSD95 pair, treatments driving synaptic potentiation caused an increase in their coupling probability, whereas a stimulus driving synaptic depression had an opposite effect. To enrich the characterization of the synaptic cluster remodeling at the population level, we applied unsupervised machine learning approaches to include selected morphological features into a multidimensional analysis. This combined analysis revealed a large diversity of synaptic protein cluster subtypes exhibiting differential activity-dependent remodeling, yet with common features depending on the expected direction of plasticity. The expanded palette of synaptic features revealed by our unbiased approach should provide a basis to further explore the widely diverse molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cholinergic Modulation of Glial Function During Aging and Chronic Neuroinflammation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aging is a complex biological process that increases the risk of age-related cognitive degenerative diseases such as dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Even non-pathological aging of the brain can involve chronic oxidative and inflammatory stress, which disrupts the communication and balance between the brain and the immune system. There has been an increasingly strong connection found between chronic neuroinflammation and impaired memory, especially in AD. While microglia and astrocytes, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), exerting beneficial effects during the acute inflammatory phase, during chronic neuroinflammation they can become more detrimental. Central cholinergic circuits are involved in maintaining normal cognitive function and regulating signaling within the entire cerebral cortex. While neuronal-glial cholinergic signaling is anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative, central cholinergic neuronal degeneration is implicated in impaired learning, memory sleep regulation, and attention. Although there is evidence of cholinergic involvement in memory, fewer studies have linked the cholinergic anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant pathways to memory processes during development, normal aging, and disease states. This review will summarize the current knowledge of cholinergic effects on microglia and astroglia, and their role in both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant mechanisms, concerning normal aging and chronic neuroinflammation. We provided details on how stimulation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine (α7nACh) receptors can be neuroprotective by increasing amyloid-β phagocytosis, decreasing inflammation and reducing oxidative stress by promoting the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathways and decreasing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. There is also evidence for astroglial α7nACh receptor stimulation mediating anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects by inhibiting the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway and activating the Nrf2 pathway respectively. We conclude that targeting cholinergic glial interactions between neurons and glial cells via α7nACh receptors could regulate neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, relevant to the treatment of several neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Sex Differences of Microglia and Synapses in the Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus of Adult Mouse Offspring Exposed to Maternal Immune Activation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder affecting ∼1% of humans worldwide. It is earlier and more frequently diagnosed in men than woman, and men display more pronounced negative symptoms together with greater gray matter reductions. Our previous findings utilizing a maternal immune activation (mIA) mouse model of schizophrenia revealed exacerbated anxiety-like behavior and sensorimotor gating deficits in adult male offspring that were associated with increased microglial reactivity and inflammation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). However, both male and female adult offspring displayed stereotypy and impairment of sociability. We hypothesized that mIA may lead to sex-specific alterations in microglial pruning activity, resulting in abnormal synaptic connectivity in the DG. Using the same mIA model, we show in the current study sex-specific differences in microglia and synapses within the DG of adult offspring. Specifically, microglial levels of cluster of differentiation (CD)68 and CD11b were increased in mIA-exposed females. Sex-specific differences in excitatory and inhibitory synapse densities were also observed following mIA. Additionally, inhibitory synaptic tone was increased in DG granule cells of both males and females, while changes in excitatory synaptic transmission occurred only in females with mIA. These findings suggest that phagocytic and complement pathways may together contribute to a sexual dimorphism in synaptic pruning and neuronal dysfunction in mIA, and may propose sex-specific therapeutic targets to prevent schizophrenia-like behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Axonal Degeneration in AD: The Contribution of Aβ and Tau</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, affecting around 35 million people worldwide. Despite enormous efforts dedicated to AD research over decades, there is still no cure for the disease. Misfolding and accumulation of Aβ and tau proteins in the brain constitute a defining signature of AD neuropathology, and mounting evidence has documented a link between aggregation of these proteins and neuronal dysfunction. In this context, progressive axonal degeneration has been associated with early stages of AD and linked to Aβ and tau accumulation. As the axonal degeneration mechanism has been starting to be unveiled, it constitutes a promising target for neuroprotection in AD. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of axonal destruction in neurodegenerative conditions is therefore critical for the development of new therapies aimed to prevent axonal loss before irreversible neuronal death occurs in AD. Here, we review current evidence of the involvement of Aβ and tau pathologies in the activation of signaling cascades that can promote axonal demise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Gait Progression Over 6 Years in Parkinson’s Disease: Effects of Age, Medication, and Pathology</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.577435</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.577435</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Gait disturbance is an early, cardinal feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) associated with falls and reduced physical activity. Progression of gait impairment in Parkinson’s disease is not well characterized and a better understanding is imperative to mitigate impairment. Subtle gait impairments progress in early disease despite optimal dopaminergic medication. Evaluating gait disturbances over longer periods, accounting for typical aging and dopaminergic medication changes, will enable a better understanding of gait changes and inform targeted therapies for early disease. This study aimed to describe gait progression over the first 6 years of PD by delineating changes associated with aging, medication, and pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One-hundred and nine newly diagnosed PD participants and 130 controls completed at least two gait assessments. Gait was assessed at 18-month intervals for up to 6 years using an instrumented walkway to measure sixteen spatiotemporal gait characteristics. Linear mixed-effects models assessed progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Ten gait characteristics significantly progressed in PD, with changes in four of these characteristics attributable to disease progression. Age-related changes also contributed to gait progression; changes in another two characteristics reflected both aging and disease progression. Gait impairment progressed irrespective of dopaminergic medication change for all characteristics except step width variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Discrete gait impairments continue to progress in PD over 6 years, reflecting a combination of, and potential interaction between, disease-specific progression and age-related change. Gait changes were mostly unrelated to dopaminergic medication adjustments, highlighting limitations of current dopaminergic therapy and the need to improve interventions targeting gait decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) integrates incoming information to guide our actions. When motivation for food-seeking competes with avoidance, the PFC likely plays a role in selecting the optimal choice. In platform-mediated active avoidance, rats avoid a tone-signaled footshock by stepping onto a nearby platform, delaying access to sucrose pellets. This avoidance requires prelimbic (PL) prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala (BLA), and ventral striatum (VS). We previously showed that inhibitory tone responses of PL neurons correlate with avoidability of shock (Diehl&lt;i&gt; et al.&lt;/i&gt;, 2018). Here, we optogenetically modulated PL terminals in VS and BLA to identify PL outputs regulating avoidance. Photoactivating PL-VS projections reduced avoidance, whereas photoactivating PL-BLA projections increased avoidance. Moreover, photosilencing PL-BLA or BLA-VS projections reduced avoidance, suggesting that VS receives opposing inputs from PL and BLA. Bidirectional modulation of avoidance by PL projections to VS and BLA enables the animal to make appropriate decisions when faced with competing drives.</description>

	<description>TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) is a protein kinase that coordinates eukaryotic metabolism. In mammals, TOR specifically promotes translation of ribosomal protein mRNAs when amino acids are available to support protein synthesis. The mechanisms controlling translation downstream from TOR remain contested, however, and are largely unexplored in plants. To define these mechanisms in plants, we globally profiled the plant TOR-regulated transcriptome, translatome, proteome, and phosphoproteome. We found that TOR regulates ribosome biogenesis in plants at multiple levels, but through mechanisms that do not directly depend on 5′ oligopyrimidine tract motifs (5′TOPs) found in mammalian ribosomal protein mRNAs. We then show that the TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling axis is conserved in plants and regulates expression of a core set of eukaryotic 5′TOP mRNAs, as well as new, plant-specific 5′TOP mRNAs. Our study illuminates ancestral roles of the TOR-LARP1-5′TOP metabolic regulatory network and provides evolutionary context for ongoing debates about the molecular function of LARP1.</description>

	<description>Damaging&lt;i&gt; GATA6&lt;/i&gt; variants cause cardiac outflow tract defects, sometimes with pancreatic and diaphragmic malformations. To define molecular mechanisms for these diverse developmental defects, we studied transcriptional and epigenetic responses to &lt;i&gt;GATA6&lt;/i&gt; loss of function and missense variants during cardiomyocyte differentiation of isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells. We show that GATA6 is a pioneer factor in cardiac development, regulating &lt;i&gt;SMYD1 &lt;/i&gt;that activates &lt;i&gt;HAND2, &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; KDR&lt;/i&gt; that with &lt;i&gt;HAND2 &lt;/i&gt;orchestrates outflow tract formation. Loss of function variants perturbed cardiac genes and also endoderm lineage genes that direct&lt;i&gt; PDX1&lt;/i&gt; expression and pancreatic development&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;Remarkably, an exon 4 &lt;i&gt;GATA6&lt;/i&gt; missense variant, highly associated with extra-cardiac malformations, caused ectopic pioneer activities, profoundly diminishing &lt;i&gt;GATA4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;FOXA1/2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PDX1 &lt;/i&gt;expression and increasing normal retinoic acid signaling that promotes diaphragm development. These aberrant epigenetic and transcriptional signatures illuminate the molecular mechanisms for cardiovascular malformations, pancreas and diaphragm dysgenesis that arise in patients with distinct &lt;i&gt;GATA6&lt;/i&gt; variants.</description>

	<title>eLife: A MAC2-positive progenitor-like microglial population is resistant to CSF1R inhibition in adult mouse brain</title>

	<description>Microglia are the resident myeloid cells in the central nervous system (CNS). The majority of microglia rely on CSF1R signaling for survival. However, a small subset of microglia in mouse brains can survive without CSF1R signaling and reestablish the microglial homeostatic population after CSF1R signaling returns. Using single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we characterized the heterogeneous microglial populations under CSF1R inhibition, including microglia with reduced homeostatic markers and elevated markers of inflammatory chemokines and proliferation. Importantly, MAC2/&lt;i&gt;Lgals3&lt;/i&gt; was upregulated under CSF1R inhibition, and shared striking similarities with microglial progenitors in the yolk sac and immature microglia in early embryos. Lineage-tracing studies revealed that these MAC2+ cells were of microglial origin. MAC2+ microglia were also present in non-treated adult mouse brains and exhibited immature transcriptomic signatures indistinguishable from those that survived CSF1R inhibition, supporting the notion that MAC2+ progenitor-like cells are present among adult microglia.</description>

	<description>Extracting shared structure across our experiences allows us to generalize our knowledge to novel contexts. How do different brain states influence this ability to generalize? Using a novel category learning paradigm, we assess the effect of both sleep and time of day on generalization that depends on the flexible integration of recent information. Counter to our expectations, we found no evidence that this form of generalization is better after a night of sleep relative to a day awake. Instead, we observed an effect of time of day, with better generalization in the morning than the evening. This effect also manifested as increased false memory for generalized information. In a nap experiment, we found that generalization did not benefit from having slept recently, suggesting a role for circadian rhythms apart from sleep. We found, however, that this time of day effect appears to be sensitive to category structure and to task engagement more generally. We propose that a state of lowered inhibition in the morning may facilitate spreading activation between otherwise separate memories, promoting this form of generalization.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: On the complex interplay between spectral harmonicity and different types of cross frequency couplings in non linear oscillators and biologically plausible neural network models</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.341800v1?rss=1</guid>

	<description>Background: Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) refers to the non linear interaction between oscillations in different frequency bands, and it is a rather ubiquitous phenomenon that has been observed in a variety of physical and biophysical systems. In particular, the coupling between the phase of slow oscillations and the amplitude of fast oscillations, referred as phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), has been intensively explored in the brain activity recorded from animals and humans. However, the interpretation of these CFC patterns remains challenging since harmonic spectral correlations characterizing non sinusoidal oscillatory dynamics can act as a confounding factor. Methods: Specialized signal processing techniques are proposed to address the complex interplay between spectral harmonicity and different types of CFC, not restricted only to PAC. For this, we provide an in-depth characterization of the Time Locked Index (TLI) as a novel tool aimed to efficiently quantify the harmonic content of noisy time series. It is shown that the proposed TLI measure is more robust and outperform traditional phase coherence metrics (e.g. Phase Locking Value) in several aspects. Results: We found that a non linear oscillator under the effect of additive noise can produce spurious CFC with low spectral harmonic content. On the other hand, two coupled oscillatory dynamics with independent fundamental frequencies can produce true CFC with high spectral harmonic content via a rectification mechanism or other post-interaction nonlinear processing mechanisms. These results reveal a complex interplay between CFC and harmonicity emerging from biologically plausible neural network models and more generic non linear and parametric oscillators, which in turn suggests that the harmonicity-CFC interplay is more complex than previously thought. Conclusions: We show that, contrary to what is usually assumed in the literature, the high harmonic content observed in non sinusoidal oscillatory dynamics, is neither sufficient nor necessary condition to interpret the associated CFC patterns as epiphenomenal. There is mounting evidence suggesting that the combination of multimodal recordings, specialized signal processing techniques and theoretical modeling is becoming a required step to completely understand CFC patterns observed in oscillatory rich dynamics of physical and biophysical systems.</description>

	<description>Distributed population codes are ubiquitous in the brain and pose a challenge to downstream neurons that must learn an appropriate readout. Here we explore the possibility that this learning problem is simplified through inductive biases implemented through stimulus-independent noise correlations that constrain learning to task-relevant dimensions. We test this idea with a neural network model of a perceptual discrimination task in which the correlation among similarly tuned units can be manipulated independently of overall population signal-to-noise ratio. Higher noise correlations among similarly tuned units led to faster and more robust learning favoring homogenous weights assigned to neurons within a functionally similar pool and could emerge naturally with Hebbian learning. When multiple discriminations were learned simultaneously, noise correlations across relevant feature dimensions sped learning whereas those across irrelevant feature dimensions slowed it. These results suggest that noise correlations may serve constrain learning to appropriate dimensions to optimize readout learning.</description>

	<description>The analysis of brain-imaging data requires complex and often non-linear transformations to support findings on brain function or pathologies. And yet, recent work has shown that variability in the choices that one makes when analyzing data can lead to quantitatively and qualitatively different results, endangering the trust in conclusions. Even within a given method or analytical technique, numerical instabilities could compromise findings. We instrumented a structural-connectome estimation pipeline with Monte Carlo Arithmetic, a technique to introduce random noise in floating-point computations, and evaluated the stability of the derived connectomes, their features, and the impact on a downstream analysis. The stability of results was found to be highly dependent upon which features of the connectomes were evaluated, and ranged from perfectly stable (i.e. no observed variability across executions) to highly unstable (i.e. the results contained no trustworthy significant information). While the extreme range and variability in results presented here could severely hamper our understanding of brain organization in brain-imaging studies, it also leads to an increase in the reliability of datasets. This paper highlights the potential of leveraging the induced variance in estimates of brain connectivity to reduce the bias in networks alongside increasing the robustness of their applications in the detection or classification of individual differences. This paper demonstrates that stability evaluations are necessary for understanding error and bias inherent to scientific computing, and that they should be a component of typical analytical workflows.</description>

	<description>Since Odysseus committed to resisting the Sirens, mechanisms to limit self-control failure have been a central feature of human behavior. Psychologists have long argued that the use of self-control is an effortful process and, more recently, that its failure arises when the cognitive costs of self-control outweigh its perceived benefits. In a similar way, economists have argued that sophisticated choosers can adopt pre-commitment strategies that that tie the hands of their future selves in order to reduce these costs. Yet, we still lack an empirical tool to quantify and demonstrate the cost of self-control. Here, we develop and validate a novel economic decision-making task to quantify the subjective cost of self-control by determining the monetary cost a person is willing to incur in order to eliminate the need for self-control. We find that humans will pay to avoid having to exert self-control in a way that scales with increasing levels of temptation and that these costs are modulated both by motivational incentives and stress exposure. Our psychophysical approach allows us to index moment-to-moment self-control costs at the within-subject level, validating important theoretical work across multiple disciplines and opening new avenues of self-control research in healthy and clinical populations.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Cortical synaptic diversity naturally arises with heterogeneous neural populations</title>

	<description>Synaptic inputs onto single cortical neurons in vivo exhibit substantial functional diversity with respect to sensory-driven activity. However, it is unclear what this diversity reflects, appearing counter-productive in generating tuned responses to specific stimuli. We propose that functional diversity naturally arises if neurons extract information encoded from noisy input populations. Focusing on a single sensory variable, orientation, we construct a probabilistic decoder that estimates orientation from the responses of a realistic hypothetical input population of neurons. Analytically derived weights exhibit diversity when input populations consist of noisy, correlated, and heterogeneous neurons. Weight diversity was necessary to accurately decode orientation. Further, in silico weight diversity matched the functional heterogeneity of dendritic spines imaged in vivo. This suggests that synaptic diversity is expected when information is extracted from realistic input populations, highlighting the importance of studying weighting structures in population coding theory and consideration in pursuits of the cortical connectome.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Androgen regulation of bowel function in mice and humans</title>

	<description>Many digestive disorders have prominent sex differences in incidence, symptomatology, and treatment response that are not well understood. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), for example, affects approximately 10% of the population worldwide and tends to have different manifestations in males and females. Androgens are steroid hormones present at much higher levels in post-pubertal males than females and could be involved in these sex differences, but their normal functions in the bowel are largely unknown. Here, we show that gonadal androgens are required for normal gastrointestinal motility in vivo. In the healthy mouse gut, we detected androgen receptors in smooth muscle cells and a subset of enteric neurons. Surgical or genetic disruption of androgen signaling in adult mice selectively and reversibly altered colonic motility by affecting neurons rather than smooth muscle. To determine if androgens also influence human bowel function, we measured androgen levels in 208 adults with IBS. Free testosterone levels were lower in patients with IBS compared to healthy controls and inversely correlated with symptom severity. Taken together, these observations establish a role for androgens in the regulation of colonic motility and link altered androgen signaling with a common digestive disorder. These findings advance the fundamental understanding of gut motility, with implications for normal aging and disorders involving the gut-brain axis.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Indirect Vibration of the Upper Limbs Alters Transmission Along Spinal but not Corticospinal Pathways</title>

	<description>The aim of this study was to investigate whether indirect upper limb vibration (ULV) modulates transmission along spinal and corticospinal pathways that control the human forearm. All measures were assessed under CONTROL (no vibration) and ULV (30 Hz; 0.4 mm displacement) conditions while participants maintained a small contraction of the right flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle. To assess spinal pathways, Hoffmann reflexes (H-reflexes) elicited by stimulation of the median nerve were recorded from FCR with motor response (M-wave) amplitudes matched between conditions. An H-reflex conditioning paradigm was also used to assess changes in presynaptic inhibition by stimulating the superficial radial (SR) nerve (5 pulses at 300Hz) 37 ms prior to median nerve stimulation. Cutaneous reflexes in FCR elicited by stimulation of the SR nerve at the wrist were also recorded. To assess corticospinal pathways, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex were recorded from the right FCR and biceps brachii (BB). ULV significantly reduced H-reflex amplitude by 15.7% for both conditioned and unconditioned reflexes (24.0 +/- 15.7 vs 18.4 +/- 11.2 % Mmax; p&amp;lt;0.05). Middle latency cutaneous reflexes were also significantly reduced by 20.0% from CONTROL (-1.50 +/- 2.1 % Mmax) to ULV (-1.73 +/- 2.2 % Mmax; p&amp;lt;0.05). There was no significant effect of ULV on MEP amplitude (p&amp;gt;0.05). Therefore, ULV inhibits cutaneous and H-reflex transmission without influencing corticospinal excitability of the forearm flexors suggesting increased presynaptic inhibition of afferent transmission as a likely mechanism. A general increase in inhibition of spinal pathways with ULV may have important implications for improving rehabilitation for individuals with spasticity (SCI, stroke, MS, etc).</description>

	<description>Ubiquitin specific peptidase 2 (USP2) is a deubiquitinating enzyme expressed almost ubiquitously in the body, including in multiple brain regions. We previously showed that mice lacking USP2 present altered locomotor activity rhythms and response of the clock to light. However, the possible implication of USP2 in regulating other behaviors has yet to be tested. To address this, we ran a battery of behavioral tests on Usp2   KO mice. Firstly, we confirmed our prior findings of increased daily activity and reduced activity fragmentation in Usp2 KO mice. Further, mice lacking USP2 showed impaired motor coordination and equilibrium, a decrease in anxiety-like behavior, a deficit in short-term recognition memory and in sensorimotor gating. On the other hand, no effects of Usp2 gene deletion were found on spatial memory. Hence, our data uncover the implication of USP2 in different behaviors and expands the range of the known functions of this deubiquitinase.</description>

	<description>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by substantial, yet highly heterogeneous abnormalities in functional brain connectivity. However, the origin and significance of this phenomenon remain unclear. To unravel ASD connectopathy and relate it to underlying etiological heterogeneity, we carried out a bi-center cross-etiological investigation of fMRI-based connectivity in the mouse, in which specific ASD-relevant mutations can be isolated and modelled minimizing environmental contributions. By performing brain-wide connectivity mapping across 16 mouse mutants, we show that different ASD-associated etiologies cause a broad spectrum of connectional abnormalities in which diverse, often diverging, connectivity signatures are recognizable. Despite this heterogeneity, the identified connectivity alterations could be classified into four subtypes characterized by discrete signatures of network dysfunction. Our findings show that etiological variability is a key determinant of connectivity heterogeneity in ASD, hence reconciling conflicting findings in clinical populations. The identification of etiologically-relevant connectivity subtypes could improve diagnostic label accuracy in the non-syndromic ASD population and paves the way for personalized treatment approaches.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Neuroprotective pentapeptide, CN-105, improves outcomes in translational models of intracerebral hemorrhage</title>

	<description>Background: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating form of cerebrovascular disease for which there are no approved pharmacological interventions that improve outcomes. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) has emerged as a promising therapeutic target given its neuroprotective properties and ability to modify neuroinflammatory responses. We developed a 5-amino acid peptide, CN-105, that mimics the polar face of the apoE helical domain involved in receptor interactions, readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, and improves outcomes in well-established preclinical ICH models. In the current study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of CN-105 in translational ICH models that account for hypertensive comorbidity, sex, species, and age. Methods: In three separate experiments, we delivered three intravenous doses of CN-105 (up to 0.20 mg/kg) or vehicle to hypertensive male BPH/2J mice, spontaneously hypertensive female rats, or 11-month old male mice within 24-hours of ICH. Neuropathological and neurobehavioral outcomes were determined over 3, 7, and 9 days, respectively. Results: In spontaneously hypertensive male mice, there was a significant dose-dependent effect of CN-105 on vestibulomotor function at 0.05 and 0.20 mg/kg doses (p &amp;lt; 0.05; 95% CI: 0.91 - 153.70 and p &amp;lt; 0.001; 95% CI: 49.54 - 205.62), while 0.20 mg/kg also improved neuroseverity scores (p &amp;lt; 0.05; 95% CI: 0.27 - 11.00) and reduced ipsilateral brain edema (p &amp;lt; 0.05; 95% CI: -0.037 - -0.001). In spontaneously hypertensive female rats, CN-105 (0.05 mg/kg) had a significant effect on vestibulomotor function (p &amp;lt; 0.01; {eta}2 = 0.093) and neuroseverity scores (p &amp;lt; 0.05; {eta}2 = 0.083), and reduced contralateral edema expansion (p &amp;lt; 0.01; 95% CI: -1.41 - -0.39). In 11-month old male mice, CN-105 had a significant effect on vestibulomotor function (p &amp;lt; 0.001; {eta}2 = 0.111) but not neuroseverity scores (p &amp;gt; 0.05; {eta}2 = 0.034). Conclusions: Acute treatment with CN-105 improves outcomes in translational ICH models independent of sex, species, age, or hypertensive comorbidity.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Impulsivity and Thought Suppression in Behavioral Addiction: Associated Neural Connectivity and Neural Networks</title>

	<description>Impulsivity and thought suppression are two psychological traits that have great variation in healthy population. In extreme cases, both are closely related to mental illness and play an important role in behavioral addiction. We have known the role of the top-down mechanism in impulsivity and thought suppression, but we do not know how the related neural nuclei are functionally connected and interact with each other. In the study, we selected excessive internet users (EIU) as our target population and investigated the relationship between thought suppression and impulsivity in the following aspects: their correlations to psychological symptoms; the associated neural networks; and the associated brain morphometric changes. We acquired data from 131 excessive internet users, with their psychological, resting-state fMRI and T1-MRI data collected. With the whole brain analysis, graph theory analysis, replication with additional brain atlas, replication with additional MRI data, and analysis of brain structure, we found that: (i) implusivity and thought suppression shared common neural connections in the top-down mechanism; (ii) thought suppression was associated with the neural network that connected to the occipital lobe in the resting-state brain but not the morphometric change of the occipital lobe. The study confirmed the overlap between impulsivity and thought suppression in terms of neural connectivity and suggested the role of thought suppression and the occipital network in behavioral addiction. Studying thought suppression provided a new insight into behavioral addiction research. The neural network study helped further understanding of behavioral addiction in terms of information interaction in the brain.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Attention recruits frontal cortex in human infants</title>

	<description>Young infants learn about the world by overtly shifting their attention to perceptually salient events. In adults, attention recruits several brain regions spanning the frontal and parietal lobes. However, these regions are thought to have a protracted maturation and so it is unclear whether they are recruited in infancy and, more generally, how infant attention is supported by the brain. We used event-related fMRI with 24 awake behaving infants 3-12 months old while they performed a child-friendly attentional cuing task. A target was presented to either the left or right of the infant's fixation and eye-tracking was used to measure the latency with which they saccaded to the target. To manipulate attention, a brief cue was presented before the target in three conditions: on the same side as the upcoming target (valid), on the other side (invalid), or on both sides (neutral). All infants were faster to look at the target on valid versus invalid trials, with valid faster than neutral and invalid slower than neutral, indicating that the cues effectively captured attention. We then compared the fMRI activity evoked by these trial types. Regions of adult attention networks activated more strongly for invalid than valid trials, particularly frontal regions such as anterior cingulate cortex. Neither behavioral nor neural effects varied by infant age within the first year, suggesting that these regions may function early in development to support the reorienting of attention. Together, this furthers our mechanistic understanding of how the infant brain controls the allocation of attention.</description>

	<description>In presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD), beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles accumulate in distinct spatiotemporal patterns within the brain, tracking closely with episodic memory decline. Here, we tested whether age-related changes in the segregation of the brain's functional episodic memory networks - anterior-temporal (AT) and posterior-medial (PM) networks - are associated with the accumulation of beta-amyloid, tau and memory decline using fMRI and PET. We found that AT and PM networks were less segregated in older than younger adults and this reduced specialization was associated with more tau and beta-amyloid in the same regions. The effect of network dedifferentiation on memory depended on the amount of beta-amyloid and tau, with low segregation and pathology associated with better performance at baseline and low segregation and high pathology related to worse performance over time. This pattern suggests a compensation phase followed by a degenerative phase in the early, preclinical phase of AD.</description>

	<description>Learning requires changing the brain. This typically occurs through experience, study, or instruction. We report a new way of acquiring conceptual knowledge by directly sculpting activity patterns in the human brain. We used a non-invasive technique (closed-loop real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging) to create novel categories of visual objects in the brain. After training, participants exhibited behavioral and neural biases for the sculpted, but not control categories. The ability to sculpt new conceptual distinctions in the human brain, applied here to perception, has broad relevance to other domains of cognition such as decision-making, memory, and motor control. As such, the work opens up new frontiers in brain-machine interface design, neuroprosthetics, and neurorehabilitation.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Bayesian Encoding and Decoding as Distinct Perspectives on Neural Coding</title>

	<description>The Bayesian Brain hypothesis, according to which the brain implements statistical algorithms, is one of the leading theoretical frameworks in neuroscience. There are two distinct underlying philosophies: one in which the brain recovers structures that exist in the world from sensory neural activity (decoding), and another in which it represents latent quantities in an internal model (encoding). We argue that an implicit disagreement on this point underlies much of the vigorous debate surrounding the neural implementation of statistical algorithms, in particular the difference between sampling-based and parametric distributional codes. To demonstrate the complementary nature of the two approaches, we have shown mathematically that encoding by sampling can be equivalently interpreted as decoding task variables in a manner consistent with linear probabilistic population codes (PPCs), a popular decoding approach. Ongoing research on the nature of Bayesian inference in the brain will benefit from making their philosophical stance explicit in order to avoid misunderstandings and false dichotomies.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Hand-selective visual regions represent how to grasp 3D tools for use: brain decoding during real actions</title>

	<description>Most neuroimaging experiments that investigate how tools and their associated actions are represented in the brain use visual paradigms where objects and body parts are displayed as 2D images and no real movements are performed. These studies have discovered a tight relationship between hand- and tool-selective areas in LOTC and IPS, thought to reflect action-related processing but this claim has never been directly investigated. Here we addressed this by testing whether independently visually-defined category-selective areas were sensitive to real action properties involving 3D tools. Specifically, using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we tested if brain activity patterns would differ depending on whether grasping was consistent or inconsistent with how tools are typically grasped for use (e.g. grasp knife by handle rather than by its serrated edge). In a block-design fMRI paradigm, participants grasped the left or right sides of 3D tools (kitchen utensils) and 3D non-tools (bar-shaped objects) with the right-hand. Importantly, and unknown to participants, by varying movement direction (right/left) the tool grasps were performed in either a typical (by the handle) or atypical (by the functional-end) manner. We found that representations about whether a 3D tool is being grasped appropriately for use were decodable from hand-selective areas (LOTC-Hand and IPS-Hand), but not from tool-, object-, or body-selective areas, even if partially overlapping. These findings indicate that representations of how to grasp tools for use are automatically evoked in visual regions specialised for representing the human hand.</description>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Convergence of peptidergic and non-peptidergic protein markers in the human dorsal root ganglion and spinal dorsal horn</title>

	<description>Peripheral sensory neurons are characterized by their size, molecular profiles, and physiological responses to specific stimuli. In mouse, the peptidergic and non-peptidergic subsets of nociceptors are distinct and innervate different lamina of the spinal dorsal horn. The unique molecular signature and neuroanatomical organization of these neurons supports a labeled line theory for certain types of nociceptive stimuli. However, long standing evidence supports the polymodal nature of nociceptors in many species. We have recently shown that the peptidergic marker, CGRP, and the non-peptidergic marker, P2X3R, show largely overlapping expression at the mRNA level in human dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Herein, our aim was to assess the protein distribution of nociceptor markers, including their central projections, in the human DRG and spinal cord. Using DRGs obtained from organ donors, we observed that CGRP and P2X3R were co-expressed by approximately 33% of human DRG neurons and TrpV1 was expressed in ~60% of human DRG neurons. In the dorsal spinal cord, CGRP, P2X3R, TrpV1 and Nav1.7 protein stained the entirety of lamina II, with only P2XR3 showing a gradient of expression. This was confirmed by measuring the size of the substantia gelatinosa using Hematoxylin and Eosin staining of adjacent sections. Our findings are consistent with the known polymodal nature of most primate nociceptors and indicate that the central projection patterns of nociceptors are different between mice and humans. Elucidating how human nociceptors connect to subsets of dorsal horn neurons will be important for understanding the physiological consequences of these species differences.</description>

	<description>In various mental disorders, dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex contributes to cognitive deficits. Here we studied how the claustrum (CLA), a nucleus sharing reciprocal connections with the cortex, may participate in these cognitive impairments. We show that specific ensembles of CLA and of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons are activated during a task requiring cognitive control such as attentional set-shifting, i.e. the ability to shift attention towards newly relevant stimulus-reward associations while disengaging from irrelevant ones. CLA neurons exert a direct excitatory input on mPFC pyramidal cells, and chemogenetic inhibition of CLA neurons suppresses the formation of specific mPFC assemblies during attentional set-shifting. Furthermore, impairing the recruitment of specific CLA assemblies through opto/chemogenetic manipulations prevents attentional set-shifting. In conclusion, we propose that the CLA controls the reorganization of mPFC ensembles to enable attentional set-shifting, emphasizing a potential role of the CLA-mPFC network in attentional dysfunctions.</description>

	<description>Prior research has shown that structures of the mesiotemporal lobe, particularly the hippocampal-parahippocampal complex, are engaged in different forms of spatial cognition. Here, we developed a new paradigm, the Conformational Shift Spatial task (CSST), which examines the ability to encode and retrieve spatial relations between three unrelated items. This task is short, uses symbolic cues, and incorporates two difficulty levels and can be administered inside and outside the scanner. A cohort of 48 healthy young adults underwent the CSST, together with a set of validated behavioral measures and multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Interindividual differences in CSST performance correlated with scores on an established spatial memory paradigm, but neither with episodic memory nor pattern separation performance, highlighting the specificity of the new measure. Analyzing high resolution structural MRI data, individuals with better spatial memory showed thicker medial as well as lateral temporal cortices. Functional relevance of these findings was supported by task-based functional MRI analysis in the same participants and ad hoc meta-analysis. Exploratory resting-state functional MRI analyses centered on clusters of morphological effects revealed additional modulation of intrinsic network integration, particularly between lateral and medial temporal structures.

	<description>The development of the visual system is known to be shaped by early-life experience. To identify response properties that contribute to enhanced natural scene representation, we performed calcium imaging of excitatory neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake mice raised in three different conditions (standard-reared, dark-reared, and delayed-visual experience) and compared neuronal responses to natural scene features relative to simpler grating stimuli that varied in orientation and spatial frequency. We assessed population selectivity in V1 using decoding methods and found that natural scene discriminability increased by 75% between the ages of 4 to 6 weeks. Both natural scene and grating discriminability were higher in standard-reared animals compared to those raised in the dark. This increase in discriminability was accompanied by a reduction in the number of neurons that responded to low-spatial frequency gratings. At the same time there was an increase in neuronal preference for natural scenes. Light exposure restricted to a 2-4 week window during adulthood did not induce improvements in natural scene nor in grating stimulus discriminability. Our results demonstrate that experience reduces the number of neurons required to effectively encode grating stimuli and that early visual experience enhances natural scene discriminability by directly increasing responsiveness to natural scene features.</description>

	<description>Past research on the brain correlates of trait anger has been limited by small sample sizes, a focus on relatively few regions-of-interest, and poor test-retest reliability of functional brain measures. To address these limitations, we conducted a data-driven analysis of variability in connectome-wide general functional connectivity, which has good test-retest reliability, in a sample of 1,048 young adult volunteers. Multi-dimensional matrix regression analysis showed that individual differences in self-reported trait anger maps onto variability in the whole-brain functional connectivity patterns of three brain regions that serve action-related functions: bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA) and the right lateral frontal pole. Follow-up seed-based analysis confirmed that high trait anger is associated with hyperconnectivity between these three regions and the somatomotor network as well as hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity between SMA and default mode and visual networks, respectively. Supplementary targeted analyses based on theoretical and empirical grounds further revealed that high trait anger is associated with hyperconnectivity between the amygdala and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and striatum. These patterns suggest that the dispositional tendency to more easily experience frustration and anger is associated with variability in the functional connectivity of brain networks supporting somatomotor, affective, self-referential, and visual information processes. The emergence of action-related brain regions from our connectome-wide analysis is consistent with trait anger as reflecting a greater propensity to provoked action.</description>

	<description>Developing coordinated motor control is essential for competent interactions with the surrounding world, and requires a balanced multisensory integration. This integration can be challenged under altered sensory feedback, as is the case for vision in immersive virtual reality (VR). While recent works suggest that a virtual sensory environment alters visuomotor integration in healthy adults, little is known about the effects on younger individuals. Here, we assessed the development of head-trunk coordination in children aged 6 to 10 years and young adults using an immersive flight simulation and a virtual joint angle reproduction task. Contrarily to previous results, when vision was decoupled from the steering body part, only older children and adults displayed a joint ('en-bloc') head-torso operation mode. Our results reveal that immersive VR affects the coordination strategy in younger children, and highlight the immaturity of postural control through the inability to implement a simplified coordination strategy. These findings have implications for pediatric applications of immersive VR, and reveal its usability as an investigation tool for sensorimotor maturation.</description>

	<description>Our understanding of the nervous system has been fundamentally advanced by light- and small molecule-sensitive proteins that can be used to modify neuronal excitability. However, optogenetics requires invasive instrumentation while chemogenetics lacks temporal control. Here, we identify a candidate channel that confers sensitivity to non-invasive ultrasound on millisecond timescales. Using a functional screen, we find that human Transient Receptor Potential A1 (hsTRPA1) increases ultrasound-evoked intracellular calcium levels and membrane potentials. Ultrasound, but not agonist, -evoked, gating of hsTRPA1, requires the N-terminal tip region, intact actin cytoskeleton, and cholesterol, implicating these features in the sonogenetic mechanism. We then use calcium imaging and electrophysiology to confirm that ultrasound-evoked responses of primary neurons are potentiated by hsTRPA1. We also show that unilateral expression of hsTRPA1 in mouse layer V motor cortical neurons leads to ultrasound-evoked contralateral limb responses to ultrasound delivered through an intact skull. Finally, ultrasound induces c-fos in hsTRPA1-expressing neurons, suggesting that our approach can be used for targeted activation of neural circuits. Together, our results demonstrate that hsTRPA1-based sonogenetics can effectively and non-invasively modulate neurons within the intact mammalian brain, a method that could be extended to other cell types across species.</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Anton Chizhov, Natalia Merkulyeva&lt;/p&gt;

A biophysically detailed description of the mechanisms of the primary vision is still being developed. We have incorporated a simplified, filter-based description of retino-thalamic visual signal processing into the detailed, conductance-based refractory density description of the neuronal population activity of the primary visual cortex. We compared four mechanisms of the direction selectivity (DS), three of them being based on asymmetrical projections of different types of thalamic neurons to the cortex, distinguishing between (i) lagged and nonlagged, (ii) transient and sustained, and (iii) On and Off neurons. The fourth mechanism implies a lack of subcortical bias and is an epiphenomenon of intracortical interactions between orientation columns. The simulations of the cortical response to moving gratings have verified that first three mechanisms provide DS to an extent compared with experimental data and that the biophysical model realistically reproduces characteristics of the visual cortex activity, such as membrane potential, firing rate, and synaptic conductances. The proposed model reveals the difference between the mechanisms of both the intact and the silenced cortex, favoring the second mechanism. In the fourth case, DS is weaker but significant; it completely vanishes in the silenced cortex.DS in the On-Off mechanism derives from the nonlinear interactions within the orientation map. Results of simulations can help to identify a prevailing mechanism of DS in V1. This is a step towards a comprehensive biophysical modeling of the primary visual system in the frameworks of the population rate coding concept.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xBo45prYMsk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Past work has shown that models incorporating human travel can improve the quality of influenza forecasts. Here, we develop and validate a metapopulation model of twelve European countries, in which international translocation of virus is driven by observed commuting and air travel flows, and use this model to generate influenza forecasts in conjunction with incidence data from the World Health Organization. We find that, although the metapopulation model fits the data well, it offers no improvement over isolated models in forecast quality. We discuss several potential reasons for these results. In particular, we note the need for data that are more comparable from country to country, and offer suggestions as to how surveillance systems might be improved to achieve this goal.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ALqFUQMwvak&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Characterization of circadian systems at the organism level—a top-down approach—has led to definition of unifying properties, a hallmark of the science of chronobiology. The next challenge is to use a bottom-up approach to show how the molecular workings of the cellular circadian clock work as building blocks of those properties. We review new studies, including a recently published &lt;i&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/i&gt; paper by Nikhil and colleagues, that show how programmed but also stochastic generation of variation in cellular circadian period explain important adaptive features of entrained circadian phase.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/WKLtcSdUFq8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for calbindin reveals a variety regions of the ventral hippocampus within the brain of the banded mongoose. These regions include the dentate gyrus (DG), cornu Ammonis regions 3 (CA3) and 1 (CA1), the ventral subiculum (VS), presubiculum (PrS), and parasubiculum (PaS). Scale bar = 1 mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing cyto‐, myelo‐, and chemoarchitectural staining techniques, we analyzed the structure of the hippocampal formation in the banded mongoose and domestic ferret, species belonging to the two carnivoran superfamilies, which have had independent evolutionary trajectories for the past 55 million years. Our observations indicate that, despite the time since sharing a last common ancestor, these species show extensive similarities. The four major portions of the hippocampal formation (cornu Ammonis, dentate gyrus, subicular complex, and entorhinal cortex) were readily observed, contained the same internal subdivisions, and maintained the topological relationships of these subdivisions that could be considered typically mammalian. In addition, adult hippocampal neurogenesis was observed in both species, occurring at a rate similar to that observed in other mammals. Despite the overall similarities, several differences to each other, and to other mammalian species, were observed. We could not find evidence for the presence of the CA2 and CA4 fields of the cornu Ammonis region. In the banded mongoose the dentate gyrus appears to be comprised of up to seven lamina, through the sublamination of the molecular and granule cell layers, which is not observed in the domestic ferret. In addition, numerous subtle variations in chemoarchitecture between the two species were observed. These differences may contribute to an overall variation in the functionality of the hippocampal formation between the species, and in comparison to other mammalian species. These similarities and variations are important to understanding to what extent phylogenetic affinities and constraints affect potential adaptive evolutionary plasticity of the hippocampal formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep-learning vision models have shown intriguing similarities and
differences with respect to human vision. We investigate how to bring machine
visual representations into better alignment with human representations. Human
representations are often inferred from behavioral evidence such as the
selection of an image most similar to a query image. We find that with
appropriate linear transformations of deep embeddings, we can improve
prediction of human binary choice on a data set of bird images from 72% at
baseline to 89%. We hypothesized that deep embeddings have redundant, high
(4096) dimensional representations; however, reducing the rank of these
representations results in a loss of explanatory power. We hypothesized that
the dilation transformation of representations explored in past research is too
restrictive, and indeed we found that model explanatory power can be
significantly improved with a more expressive linear transform. Most surprising
and exciting, we found that, consistent with classic psychological literature,
human similarity judgments are asymmetric: the similarity of X to Y is not
necessarily equal to the similarity of Y to X, and allowing models to express
this asymmetry improves explanatory power.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Models in systems biology are mathematical descriptions of biological
processes that are used to answer questions and gain a better understanding of
biological phenomena. Dynamic models represent the network through rates of the
production and consumption for the individual species. The ordinary
differential equations that describe rates of the reactions in the model
include a set of parameters. The parameters are important quantities to
understand and analyze biological systems. Moreover, the perturbation of the
kinetic parameters are correlated with upregulation of the system by
cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors, including mutations and the
environment changes. Here, we aim at using well-established models of
biological pathways to identify parameter values and point their potential
perturbation/deviation. We present our population-based optimization framework
that is able to identify kinetic parameters in the dynamic model based on only
input and output data (i.e., timecourses of selected metabolites). Our approach
can deal with the identification of the non-measurable parameters as well as
with discovering deviation of the parameters. We present our proposed
optimization framework on the example of the well-studied glycolytic pathway in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Genetic algorithms have been developed for decades by researchers in academia
and perform well in engineering applications, yet their uptake in industry
remains limited. In order to understand why this is the case, the opinions of
users of engineering design tools were gathered. The results from a survey
showing the attitudes of engineers and students with design experience with
respect to optimisation algorithms are presented. A survey was designed to
answer two research questions: To what extent is there a pre-existing sentiment
(negative or positive) among students, engineers, and managers towards genetic
algorithm-based design? and What are the requirements of practitioners with
regards to design optimisation and the design optimisation process? A total of
23 participants (N = 23) took part in the 3-part mixed methods survey. Thematic
analysis was conducted on the open-ended questions. A common thread throughout
participants responses is that there is a question of trust towards genetic
algorithms within industry. Perhaps surprising is that the key to gaining this
trust is not producing good results, but creating algorithms which explain the
process they take in reaching a result. Participants have expressed a desire to
continue to remain in the design loop. This is at odds with the motivation of a
portion of the genetic algorithms community of removing humans from the loop.
It is clear we need to take a different approach to increase industrial uptake.
Based on this, the following recommendations have been made to increase their
use in industry: an increase of transparency and explainability of genetic
algorithms, an increased focus on user experience, better communication between
developers and engineers, and visualising algorithm behaviour.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The existing convolutional neural network pruning algorithms can be divided
into two categories: coarse-grained clipping and fine-grained clipping. This
paper proposes a coarse and fine-grained automatic pruning algorithm, which can
achieve more efficient and accurate compression acceleration for convolutional
neural networks. First, cluster the intermediate feature maps of the
convolutional neural network to obtain the network structure after
coarse-grained clipping, and then use the particle swarm optimization algorithm
to iteratively search and optimize the structure. Finally, the optimal network
tailoring substructure is obtained.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Running title: Frontoparietal anodal tDCS reduces ketamine-induced
oscillopathies.Abstract: During the prodromal phase of schizophrenia with its
complex and insidious clinical picture, electroencephalographic recordings
detect widespread oscillation disturbances (or oscillopathies). Neural
oscillations are electro-biomarkers of the connectivity state within systems. A
single systemic administration of ketamine, a non-competitive NMDA glutamate
receptor antagonist, transiently reproduces the oscillopathies with a clinical
picture reminiscent of the psychosis prodrome. This acute pharmacological model
may help the research and development of innovative treatments against the
psychotic transition. Transcranial electrical stimulation is recognized as an
appropriate non-invasive therapeutic modality since it can increase cognitive
performance and modulate neural oscillations with little or no side effects.
Therefore, our objective was to set up, in the sedated adult rat, a stimulation
method able to normalize the ketamine-induced oscillopathies. Unilateral
transcranial frontoparietal anodal stimulation by direct current (&amp;lt;+1 mA) was
applied in ketamine-treated rats. A concomitant electroencephalographic
recording of the parietal cortex measured the stimulation effects on its
spontaneously-occurring oscillations. A 5-min bipolar anodal tDCS immediately
and quickly reduced, significantly with an intensity-effect relationship, the
ketamine-induced oscillopathies at least in the bilateral parietal cortex. A
duration effect was also recorded. These preliminary neurophysiological
findings are promising for developing a therapeutic proof-of-concept against
neuropsychiatric disorders.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a collection of methods to craft the way
neural networks are built. We apply this idea to Federated Learning (FL),
wherein predefined neural network models are trained on the client/device data.
This approach is not optimal as the model developers can't observe the local
data, and hence, are unable to build highly accurate and efficient models. NAS
is promising for FL which can search for global and personalized models
automatically for the non-IID data. Most NAS methods are computationally
expensive and require fine-tuning after the search, making it a two-stage
complex process with possible human intervention. Thus there is a need for
end-to-end NAS which can run on the heterogeneous data and resource
distribution typically seen in the FL scenario. In this paper, we present an
effective approach for direct federated NAS which is hardware agnostic,
computationally lightweight, and a one-stage method to search for
ready-to-deploy neural network models. Our results show an order of magnitude
reduction in resource consumption while edging out prior art in accuracy. This
opens up a window of opportunity to create optimized and computationally
efficient federated learning systems.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The recently proposed Activation Relaxation (AR) algorithm provides a simple
and robust approach for approximating the backpropagation of error algorithm
using only local learning rules. Unlike competing schemes, it converges to the
exact backpropagation gradients, and utilises only a single type of
computational unit and a single backwards relaxation phase. We have previously
shown that the algorithm can be further simplified and made more biologically
plausible by (i) introducing a learnable set of backwards weights, which
overcomes the weight-transport problem, and (ii) avoiding the computation of
nonlinear derivatives at each neuron. However, tthe efficacy of these
simplifications has, so far, only been tested on simple multi-layer-perceptron
(MLP) networks. Here, we show that these simplifications still maintain
performance using more complex CNN architectures and challenging datasets,
which have proven difficult for other biologically-plausible schemes to scale
to. We also investigate whether another biologically implausible assumption of
the original AR algorithm -- the frozen feedforward pass -- can be relaxed
without damaging performance.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep Reservoir Computing has emerged as a new paradigm for deep learning,
which is based around the reservoir computing principle of maintaining random
pools of neurons combined with hierarchical deep learning. The reservoir
paradigm reflects and respects the high degree of recurrence in biological
brains, and the role that neuronal dynamics play in learning. However, one
issue hampering deep reservoir network development is that one cannot
backpropagate through the reservoir layers. Recent deep reservoir architectures
do not learn hidden or hierarchical representations in the same manner as deep
artificial neural networks, but rather concatenate all hidden reservoirs
together to perform traditional regression. Here we present a novel Deep
Reservoir Network for time series prediction and classification that learns
through the non-differentiable hidden reservoir layers using a
biologically-inspired backpropagation alternative called Direct Feedback
Alignment, which resembles global dopamine signal broadcasting in the brain. We
demonstrate its efficacy on two real world multidimensional time series

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies (anti-MOG), directed against a component of the myelin sheath, are sometimes detected in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with acute demyelinating conditions. Cortical encephalitic presentations in anti-MOG-antibody-positive patients are recognized but rare, and few pediatric cases have been described.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We describe clinical, biochemical, and MRI findings in two children presenting with generalized seizures due to cortical encephalitis, and review potential underlying immunological processes.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In both patients, anti-MOG antibodies were detected. Both underwent MRI scans which demonstrated bilateral cortical swelling and T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity with corresponding regions of reduced diffusion.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Early detection of anti-MOG antibodies in patients with a similar presentation and imaging features would enable rapid institution of appropriate treatment, and potentially reduce the need for invasive diagnostic procedures such as brain biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Changes in Day/Night Activity in the 6-OHDA-Induced Experimental Model of Parkinson’s Disease: Exploring Prodromal Biomarkers</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.590029</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The search for experimental models mimicking an early stage of Parkinson’s disease (PD) before motor manifestations is fundamental in order to explore early signs and get a better prognosis. Interestingly, our previous studies have indicated that 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) is a suitable model to induce an early degeneration of the nigrostriatal system without any gross motor impairment. Considering our previous findings, we aim to implement a novel system to monitor rats after intrastriatal injection of 6-OHDA to detect and analyze physiological changes underlying prodromal PD. Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats were unilaterally injected with 6-OHDA (n = 10) or saline solution (n = 10) into the right striatum and placed in enriched environment cages where the activity was monitored. After 2 weeks, the amphetamine test was performed before the sacrifice. Immunohistochemistry was developed for the morphological evaluation and western blot analysis to assess molecular changes. Home-cage monitoring revealed behavioral changes in response to 6-OHDA administration including significant hyperactivity and hypoactivity during the light and dark phase, respectively, turning out in a change of the circadian timing. A preclinical stage of PD was functionally confirmed with the amphetamine test. Moreover, the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase expression was significantly correlated with the motor results, and 6-OHDA induced early proapoptotic events. Our findings provide evidence for a novel prodromal 6-OHDA model following a customized monitoring system that could give insights to detect non-motor deficits and molecular targets to test neuroprotective/neurorestorative agents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Investigating the Relationship Between Neuronal Cell Death and Early DNA Methylation After Ischemic Injury</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.581915</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral ischemia induces neuronal cell death and causes various kinds of brain dysfunction. Therefore, prevention of neuronal cell death is most essential for protection of the brain. On the other hand, it has been reported that epigenetics including DNA methylation plays a pivotal role in pathogenesis of some diseases such as cancer. Accumulating evidences indicate that aberrant DNA methylation is related to cell death. However, DNA methylation after cerebral ischemia has not been fully understood yet. The aim of this present study was to investigate the relationships between DNA methylation and neuronal cell death after cerebral ischemia. We examined DNA methylation under the ischemic condition by using transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) model rats and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)–treated cortical neurons in primary culture. In this study, we demonstrated that DNA methylation increased in these neurons 24 h after MCAO/R and that DNA methylation, possibly through activation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) 3a, increased in such neurons immediately after NMDA treatment. Furthermore, NMDA-treated neurons were protected by treatment with a DNMT inhibitor that were accompanied by inhibition of DNA methylation. Our results showed that DNA methylation would be an initiation factor of neuronal cell death and that inhibition of such methylation could become an effective therapeutic strategy for stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Current Techniques for Investigating the Brain Extracellular Space</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.570750</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The brain extracellular space (ECS) is a continuous reticular compartment that lies between the cells of the brain. It is vast in extent relative to its resident cells, yet, at the same time the nano- to micrometer dimensions of its channels and reservoirs are commonly finer than the smallest cellular structures. Our conventional view of this compartment as largely static and of secondary importance for brain function is rapidly changing, and its active dynamic roles in signaling and metabolite clearance have come to the fore. It is further emerging that ECS microarchitecture is highly heterogeneous and dynamic and that ECS geometry and diffusional properties directly modulate local diffusional transport, down to the nanoscale around individual synapses. The ECS can therefore be considered an extremely complex and diverse compartment, where numerous physiological events are unfolding in parallel on spatial and temporal scales that span orders of magnitude, from milliseconds to hours, and from nanometers to centimeters. To further understand the physiological roles of the ECS and identify new ones, researchers can choose from a wide array of experimental techniques, which differ greatly in their applicability to a given sample and the type of data they produce. Here, we aim to provide a basic introduction to the available experimental techniques that have been applied to address the brain ECS, highlighting their main characteristics. We include current gold-standard techniques, as well as emerging cutting-edge modalities based on recent super-resolution microscopy. It is clear that each technique comes with unique strengths and limitations and that no single experimental method can unravel the unknown physiological roles of the brain ECS on its own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Cross-Subject Commonality of Emotion Representations in Dorsal Motion-Sensitive Areas</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Emotion perception is a crucial question in cognitive neuroscience and the underlying neural substrates have been the subject of intense study. One of our previous studies demonstrated that motion-sensitive areas are involved in the perception of facial expressions. However, it remains unclear whether emotions perceived from whole-person stimuli can be decoded from the motion-sensitive areas. In addition, if emotions are represented in the motion-sensitive areas, we may further ask whether the representations of emotions in the motion-sensitive areas can be shared across individual subjects. To address these questions, this study collected neural images while participants viewed emotions (joy, anger, and fear) from videos of whole-person expressions (contained both face and body parts) in a block-design functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was conducted to explore the emotion decoding performance in individual-defined dorsal motion-sensitive regions of interest (ROIs). Results revealed that emotions could be successfully decoded from motion-sensitive ROIs with statistically significant classification accuracies for three emotions as well as positive versus negative emotions. Moreover, results from the cross-subject classification analysis showed that a person’s emotion representation could be robustly predicted by others’ emotion representations in motion-sensitive areas. Together, these results reveal that emotions are represented in dorsal motion-sensitive areas and that the representation of emotions is consistent across subjects. Our findings provide new evidence of the involvement of motion-sensitive areas in the emotion decoding, and further suggest that there exists a common emotion code in the motion-sensitive areas across individual subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accurate simulations of brain structures is a major problem in neuroscience. Many works are dedicated to design better models or to develop more efficient simulation schemes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid simulation scheme that combines time-stepping second-order integration of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) type neurons with event-driven updating of the synaptic currents. As the HH model is a continuous model, there is no explicit spike events. Thus, in order to preserve the accuracy of the integration method, a spike detection algorithm is developed that accurately determines spike times. This approach allows us to regenerate the outgoing connections at each event, thereby avoiding the storage of the connectivity. Consequently, memory consumption is significantly reduced while preserving execution time and accuracy of the simulations, especially the spike times of detailed point neuron models. The efficiency of the method, implemented in the SiReNe software&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, is demonstrated by the simulation of a striatum model which consists of more than 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; synapses (each neuron has a fan-out of 504 post-synaptic neurons), under normal and Parkinson's conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Neural Network Model With Gap Junction for Topological Detection</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual information processing in the brain goes from global to local. A large volume of experimental studies has suggested that among global features, the brain perceives the topological information of an image first. Here, we propose a neural network model to elucidate the underlying computational mechanism. The model consists of two parts. The first part is a neural network in which neurons are coupled through gap junctions, mimicking the neural circuit formed by alpha ganglion cells in the retina. Gap junction plays a key role in the model, which, on one hand, facilitates the synchronized firing of a neuron group covering a connected region of an image, and on the other hand, staggers the firing moments of different neuron groups covering disconnected regions of the image. These two properties endow the network with the capacity of detecting the connectivity and closure of images. The second part of the model is a read-out neuron, which reads out the topological information that has been converted into the number of synchronized firings in the retina network. Our model provides a simple yet effective mechanism for the neural system to detect the topological information of images in ultra-speed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Unsupervised Few-Shot Feature Learning via Self-Supervised Training</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning from limited exemplars (few-shot learning) is a fundamental, unsolved problem that has been laboriously explored in the machine learning community. However, current few-shot learners are mostly supervised and rely heavily on a large amount of labeled examples. Unsupervised learning is a more natural procedure for cognitive mammals and has produced promising results in many machine learning tasks. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised feature learning method for few-shot learning. The proposed model consists of two alternate processes, progressive clustering and episodic training. The former generates pseudo-labeled training examples for constructing episodic tasks; and the later trains the few-shot learner using the generated episodic tasks which further optimizes the feature representations of data. The two processes facilitate each other, and eventually produce a high quality few-shot learner. In our experiments, our model achieves good generalization performance in a variety of downstream few-shot learning tasks on Omniglot and MiniImageNet. We also construct a new few-shot person re-identification dataset FS-Market1501 to demonstrate the feasibility of our model to a real-world application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;New technologies for recording the activity of large neural populations during complex behavior provide exciting opportunities for investigating the neural computations that underlie perception, cognition, and decision-making. Non-linear state space models provide an interpretable signal processing framework by combining an intuitive dynamical system with a probabilistic observation model, which can provide insights into neural dynamics, neural computation, and development of neural prosthetics and treatment through feedback control. This brings with it the challenge of learning both latent neural state and the underlying dynamical system because neither are known for neural systems a priori. We developed a flexible online learning framework for latent non-linear state dynamics and filtered latent states. Using the stochastic gradient variational Bayes approach, our method jointly optimizes the parameters of the non-linear dynamical system, the observation model, and the black-box recognition model. Unlike previous approaches, our framework can incorporate non-trivial distributions of observation noise and has constant time and space complexity. These features make our approach amenable to real-time applications and the potential to automate analysis and experimental design in ways that testably track and modify behavior using stimuli designed to influence learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Transducin Partners Outside the Phototransduction Pathway</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.589494</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transducin mediates signal transduction in a classical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) phototransduction cascade. Interactions of transducin with the receptor and the effector molecules had been extensively investigated and are currently defined at the atomic level. However, partners and functions of rod transducin α (Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and βγ (Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) outside the visual pathway are not well-understood. In particular, light-induced redistribution of rod transducin from the outer segment to the inner segment and synaptic terminal (IS/ST) allows Gα&lt;sub&gt;t1&lt;/sub&gt; and/or Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to modulate synaptic transmission from rods to rod bipolar cells (RBCs). Protein-protein interactions underlying this modulation are largely unknown. We discuss known interactors of transducin in the rod IS/ST compartment and potential pathways leading to the synaptic effects of light-dispersed Gα&lt;sub&gt;t1&lt;/sub&gt; and Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, we show that a prominent non-GPCR guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and a chaperone of Gα subunits, resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 8A (Ric-8A) protein, is expressed throughout the retina including photoreceptor cells. Recent structures of Ric-8A alone and in complexes with Gα subunits have illuminated the structural underpinnings of the Ric-8A activities. We generated a mouse model with conditional knockout of Ric-8A in rods in order to begin defining the functional roles of the protein in rod photoreceptors and the retina. Our analysis suggests that Ric-8A is not an obligate chaperone of Gα&lt;sub&gt;t1&lt;/sub&gt;. Further research is needed to investigate probable roles of Ric-8A as a GEF, trafficking chaperone, or a mediator of the synaptic effects of Gα&lt;sub&gt;t1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Alterations in Intrinsic and Synaptic Properties of Hippocampal CA1 VIP Interneurons During Aging</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.554405</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning and memory deficits are hallmarks of the aging brain, with cortical neuronal circuits representing the main target in cognitive deterioration. While GABAergic inhibitory and disinhibitory circuits are critical in supporting cognitive processes, their roles in age-related cognitive decline remain largely unknown. Here, we examined the morphological and physiological properties of the hippocampal CA1 vasoactive intestinal peptide/calretinin-expressing (VIP+/CR+) type 3 interneuron-specific (I-S3) cells across mouse lifespan. Our data showed that while the number and morphological features of I-S3 cells remained unchanged, their firing and synaptic properties were significantly altered in old animals. In particular, the action potential duration and the level of steady-state depolarization were significantly increased in old animals in parallel with a significant decrease in the maximal firing frequency. Reducing the fast-delayed rectifier potassium or transient sodium conductances in I-S3 cell computational models could reproduce the age-related changes in I-S3 cell firing properties. However, experimental data revealed no difference in the activation properties of the Kv3.1 and A-type potassium currents, indicating that transient sodium together with other ion conductances may be responsible for the observed phenomena. Furthermore, I-S3 cells in aged mice received a stronger inhibitory drive due to concomitant increase in the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous inhibitory currents. These age-associated changes in the I-S3 cell properties occurred in parallel with an increased inhibition of their target interneurons and were associated with spatial memory deficits and increased anxiety. Taken together, these data indicate that VIP+/CR+ interneurons responsible for local circuit disinhibition survive during aging but exhibit significantly altered physiological properties, which may result in the increased inhibition of hippocampal interneurons and distorted mnemonic functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neural Stimulation and Molecular Mechanisms of Plasticity and Regeneration: A Review</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00271</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00271</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neural stimulation modulates the depolarization of neurons, thereby triggering activity-associated mechanisms of neuronal plasticity. Activity-associated mechanisms in turn play a major role in post-mitotic structure and function of adult neurons. Our understanding of the interactions between neuronal behavior, patterns of neural activity, and the surrounding environment is evolving at a rapid pace. Brain derived neurotrophic factor is a critical mediator of activity-associated plasticity, while multiple immediate early genes mediate plasticity of neurons following bouts of neural activity. New research has uncovered genetic mechanisms that govern the expression of DNA following changes in neural activity patterns, including RNAPII pause-release and activity-associated double stranded breaks. Discovery of novel mechanisms governing activity-associated plasticity of neurons hints at a layered and complex molecular control of neuronal response to depolarization. Importantly, patterns of depolarization in neurons are shown to be important mediators of genetic expression patterns and molecular responses. More research is needed to fully uncover the molecular response of different types of neurons-to-activity patterns; however, known responses might be leveraged to facilitate recovery after neural damage. Physical rehabilitation through passive or active exercise modulates neurotrophic factor expression in the brain and spinal cord and can initiate cortical plasticity commensurate with functional recovery. Rehabilitation likely relies on activity-associated mechanisms; however, it may be limited in its application. Electrical and magnetic stimulation direct specific activity patterns not accessible through passive or active exercise and work synergistically to improve standing, walking, and forelimb use after injury. Here, we review emerging concepts in the molecular mechanisms of activity-derived plasticity in order to highlight opportunities that could add value to therapeutic protocols for promoting recovery of function after trauma, disease, or age-related functional decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: A Systematic Review on Predictors of Working Memory Training Responsiveness in Healthy Older Adults: Methodological Challenges and Future Directions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.575804</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.575804</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Research on predictors of working memory training responsiveness, which could help tailor cognitive interventions individually, is a timely topic in healthy aging. However, the findings are highly heterogeneous, reporting partly conflicting results following a broad spectrum of methodological approaches to answer the question “who benefits most” from working memory training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: The present systematic review aimed to systematically investigate prognostic factors and models for working memory training responsiveness in healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Four online databases were searched up to October 2019 (MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO). The inclusion criteria for full texts were publication in a peer-reviewed journal in English/German, inclusion of healthy older individuals aged ≥55 years without any neurological and/or psychiatric diseases including cognitive impairment, and the investigation of prognostic factors and/or models for training responsiveness after targeted working memory training in terms of direct training effects, near-transfer effects to verbal and visuospatial working memory as well as far-transfer effects to other cognitive domains and behavioral variables. The study design was not limited to randomized controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 16 studies including n = 675 healthy older individuals with a mean age of 63.0–86.8 years were included in this review. Within these studies, five prognostic model approaches and 18 factor finding approaches were reported. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies checklist, indicating that important information, especially regarding the domains study attrition, study confounding, and statistical analysis and reporting, was lacking throughout many of the investigated studies. Age, education, intelligence, and baseline performance in working memory or other cognitive domains were frequently investigated predictors across studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Given the methodological shortcomings of the included studies, no clear conclusions can be drawn, and emerging patterns of prognostic effects will have to survive sound methodological replication in future attempts to promote precision medicine approaches in the context of working memory training. Methodological considerations are discussed, and our findings are embedded to the cognitive aging literature, considering, for example, the cognitive reserve framework and the compensation vs. magnification account. The need for personalized cognitive prevention and intervention methods to counteract cognitive decline in the aging population is high and the potential enormous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registration: PROSPERO, ID CRD42019142750.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Compromised Behavior and Gamma Power During Working Memory in Cognitively Healthy Individuals With Abnormal CSF Amyloid/Tau</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.574214</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Research shows that gamma activity changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), revealing synaptic pathology and potential therapeutic applications. We aim to explore whether cognitive challenge combined with quantitative EEG (qEEG) can unmask abnormal gamma frequency power in healthy individuals at high risk of developing AD. We analyzed low (30–50 Hz) and high gamma (50–80 Hz) power over six brain regions at EEG sensor level (frontal/central/parietal/left temporal/right temporal/occipital) in a dataset collected from an aging cohort during N-back working memory (WM) testing at two different load conditions (N = 0 or 2). Cognitively healthy (CH) study participants (≥60 years old) of both sexes were divided into two subgroups: normal amyloid/tau ratios (CH-NAT, n = 10) or pathological amyloid/tau (CH-PAT, n = 14) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). During low load (0-back) challenge, low gamma is higher in CH-PATs than CH-NATs over frontal and central regions (p = 0.014∼0.032, effect size (Cohen’s d) = 0.95∼1.11). However, during high load (2-back) challenge, low gamma is lower in CH-PATs compared to CH-NATs over the left temporal region (p = 0.045, Cohen’s d = −0.96), and high gamma is lower over the parietal region (p = 0.035, Cohen’s d = −1.02). Overall, our studies show a medium to large negative effect size across the scalp (Cohen’s d = −0.51∼−1.02). In addition, low gamma during 2-back is positively correlated with 0-back accuracy over all regions except the occipital region only in CH-NATs (r = 0.69∼0.77, p = 0.0098∼0.027); high gamma during 2-back correlated positively with 0-back accuracy over all regions in CH-NATs (r = 0.68∼0.78, p = 0.007∼0.030); high gamma during 2-back negatively correlated with 0-back response time over parietal, right temporal, and occipital regions in CH-NATs (r = −0.70∼−0.66, p = 0.025∼0.037). We interpret these preliminary results to show: (1) gamma power is compromised in AD-biomarker positive individuals, who are otherwise cognitively healthy (CH-PATs); (2) gamma is associated with WM performance in normal aging (CH-NATs) (most significantly in the frontoparietal region). Our pilot findings encourage further investigations in combining cognitive challenges and qEEG in developing neurophysiology-based markers for identifying individuals in the prodromal stage, to help improving our understanding of AD pathophysiology and the contributions of low- and high-frequency gamma oscillations in cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>ATP is essential for all living cells. However, how dead cells lose ATP has not been well investigated. In this study, we developed new FRET biosensors for dual imaging of intracellular ATP level and caspase-3 activity in single apoptotic cultured human cells. We show that the cytosolic ATP level starts to decrease immediately after the activation of caspase-3, and this process is completed typically within 2 hr. The ATP decrease was facilitated by caspase-dependent cleavage of the plasma membrane channel pannexin-1, indicating that the intracellular decrease of the apoptotic cell is a ‘programmed’ process. Apoptotic cells deficient of pannexin-1 sustained the ability to produce ATP through glycolysis and to consume ATP, and did not stop wasting glucose much longer period than normal apoptotic cells. Thus, the pannexin-1 plays a role in arresting the metabolic activity of dead apoptotic cells, most likely through facilitating the loss of intracellular ATP.</description>

	<description>Our recent work characterized the movement of single blood cells within the retinal vasculature (Joseph et al. 2019) using adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy. Here, we apply this technique to the context of acute inflammation and discover both infiltrating and tissue-resident immune cells to be visible without any labeling in the living mouse retina using near-infrared light alone. Intravital imaging of immune cells can be negatively impacted by surgical manipulation, exogenous dyes, transgenic manipulation and phototoxicity. These confounds are now overcome, using phase contrast and time-lapse videography to reveal the dynamic behavior of myeloid cells as they interact, extravasate and survey the mouse retina. Cellular motility and differential vascular responses were measured noninvasively and in vivo across hours to months at the same retinal location, from initiation to the resolution of inflammation. As comparable systems are already available for clinical research, this approach could be readily translated to human application.</description>

	<description>Measuring nascent macromolecular synthesis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; is key to understanding how cells and tissues progress through development and respond to external cues. Here, we perform &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; injection of alkyne- or azide-modified analogs of thymidine, uridine, methionine, and glucosamine to label nascent synthesis of DNA, RNA, protein, and glycosylation. Three-dimensional volumetric imaging of nascent macromolecule synthesis was performed in axolotl salamander tissue using whole mount click chemistry-based fluorescent staining followed by light sheet fluorescent microscopy. We also developed an image processing pipeline for segmentation and classification of morphological regions of interest and individual cells, and we apply this pipeline to the regenerating humerus. We demonstrate our approach is sensitive to biological perturbations by measuring changes in DNA synthesis after limb denervation. This method provides a powerful means to quantitatively interrogate macromolecule synthesis in heterogenous tissues at the organ, cellular, and molecular levels of organization.</description>

	<title>eLife: Diffusion vs direct transport in the precision of morphogen readout</title>

	<description>Morphogen profiles allow cells to determine their position within a developing organism, but not all morphogen profiles form by the same mechanism. Here we derive fundamental limits to the precision of morphogen concentration sensing for two canonical mechanisms: the diffusion of morphogen through extracellular space and the direct transport of morphogen from source cell to target cell, e.g., via cytonemes. We find that direct transport establishes a morphogen profile without adding noise in the process. Despite this advantage, we find that for sufficiently large values of profile length, the diffusion mechanism is many times more precise due to a higher refresh rate of morphogen molecules. We predict a profile lengthscale below which direct transport is more precise, and above which diffusion is more precise. This prediction is supported by data from a wide variety of morphogens in developing &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and zebrafish.</description>

	<description>Multiple nuclei sharing a common cytoplasm are found in diverse tissues, organisms, and diseases. Yet, multinucleation remains a poorly understood biological property. Cytoplasm sharing invariably involves plasma membrane breaches. In contrast, we discovered cytoplasm sharing without membrane breaching in highly resorptive &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;rectal papillae. During a six-hour developmental window, 100 individual papillar cells assemble a multinucleate cytoplasm, allowing passage of proteins of at least 62kDa throughout papillar tissue. Papillar cytoplasm sharing does not employ canonical mechanisms such as incomplete cytokinesis or muscle fusion pore regulators. Instead, sharing requires gap junction proteins (normally associated with transport of molecules &amp;lt;1kDa), which are positioned by membrane remodeling GTPases. Our work reveals a new role for apical membrane remodeling in converting a multicellular epithelium into a giant multinucleate cytoplasm.</description>

	<description>WNK1, a kinase that controls kidney salt homeostasis, also regulates adhesion and migration in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. &lt;i&gt;Wnk1&lt;/i&gt; is highly expressed in thymocytes, and since migration is important for thymocyte maturation, we investigated a role for WNK1 in mouse thymocyte development. We find that WNK1 is required for the transition of double negative (DN) thymocytes through the b-selection checkpoint and subsequent proliferation and differentiation into double positive (DP) thymocytes. Furthermore, we show that WNK1 negatively regulates LFA1-mediated adhesion and positively regulates CXCL12-induced migration in DN thymocytes. Despite this, migration defects of WNK1-deficient thymocytes do not account for the developmental arrest. Instead, we show that in DN thymocytes WNK1 transduces pre-TCR signals via OXSR1 and STK39 kinases and the SLC12A2 ion co-transporter that are required for post-transcriptional upregulation of MYC and subsequent proliferation and differentiation into DP thymocytes. Thus, a pathway regulating ion homeostasis is a critical regulator of thymocyte development.</description>

	<title>eLife: Cytoprotection by a naturally occurring variant of ATP5G1 in Arctic ground squirrel neural progenitor cells</title>

	<description>Many organisms in nature have evolved mechanisms to tolerate severe hypoxia or ischemia, including the hibernation-capable Arctic ground squirrel (AGS). Although hypoxic or ischemia tolerance in AGS involves physiological adaptations, little is known about the critical cellular mechanisms underlying intrinsic AGS cell resilience to metabolic stress. Through cell survival-based cDNA expression screens in neural progenitor cells, we identify a genetic variant of AGS &lt;i&gt;Atp5g1&lt;/i&gt; that confers cell resilience to metabolic stress. &lt;i&gt;Atp5g1&lt;/i&gt; encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. Ectopic expression in mouse cells and CRISPR/Cas9 base editing of endogenous AGS loci revealed causal roles of one AGS-specific amino acid substitution in mediating cytoprotection by AGS ATP5G1. AGS ATP5G1 promotes metabolic stress resilience by modulating mitochondrial morphological change and metabolic functions. Our results identify a naturally occurring variant of ATP5G1 from a mammalian hibernator that critically contributes to intrinsic cytoprotection against metabolic stress.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Exploring the sequence fitness landscape of a bridge between protein folds</title>

Most foldable protein sequences adopt only a single native fold. Recent protein design studies have, however, created protein sequences which fold into different structures apon changes of environment, or single point mutation, the best characterized example being the switch between the folds of the GA and GB binding domains of streptococcal protein G. To obtain further insight into the design of sequences which can switch folds, we have used a computational model for the fitness landscape of a single fold, built from the observed sequence variation of protein homologues. We have recently shown that such coevolutionary models can be used to design novel foldable sequences. By appropriately combining two of these models to describe the joint fitness landscape of GA and GB, we are able to describe the propensity of a given sequence for each of the two folds. We have successfully tested the combined model against the known series of designed GA/GB hybrids. Using Monte Carlo simulations on this landscape, we are able to identify pathways of mutations connecting the two folds. In the absence of a requirement for domain stability, the most frequent paths go via sequences in which neither domain is stably folded, reminiscent of the propensity for certain intrinsically disordered proteins to fold into different structures according to context. Even if the folded state is required to be stable, we find that there is nonetheless still a wide range of sequences which are close to the transition region and therefore likely fold switches, consistent with recent estimates that fold switching may be more widespread than had been thought.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pwH3Evehv4k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Returning home is a crucial task accomplished daily by many animals, including humans. Because of their tiny brains, insects, like bees or ants, are good study models for efficient navigation strategies. Bees and ants are known to rely mainly on learned visual information about the nest surroundings to pinpoint their barely visible nest-entrance. During the return, when the actual sight of the insect matches the learned information, the insect is easily guided home. Occasionally, modifications to the visual environment may take place while the insect is on a foraging trip. Here, we addressed the ecologically relevant question of how bumblebees’ homing is affected by such a situation. In an artificial setting, we habituated bees to be guided to their nest by two constellations of visual cues. After habituation, these cues were displaced during foraging trips into a conflict situation. We recorded bumblebees’ return flights in such circumstances and investigated where they search for their nest entrance following the degree of displacement between the two visually relevant cues. Bumblebees mostly searched at the fictive nest location as indicated by either cue constellation, but never at a compromise location between them. We compared these experimental results to the predictions of different types of homing models. We found that models guiding an agent by a single holistic view of the nest surroundings could not account for the bumblebees’ search behaviour in cue-conflict situations. Instead, homing models relying on multiple views were sufficient. We could further show that homing models required fewer views and got more robust to height changes if optic flow-based spatial information was encoded and learned, rather than just brightness information.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t0GW-wD3XXc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s are associated with the prion-like propagation and aggregation of toxic proteins. A long standing hypothesis that amyloid-beta drives Alzheimer’s disease has proven the subject of contemporary controversy; leading to new research in both the role of tau protein and its interaction with amyloid-beta. Conversely, recent work in mathematical modeling has demonstrated the relevance of nonlinear reaction-diffusion type equations to capture essential features of the disease. Such approaches have been further simplified, to network-based models, and offer researchers a powerful set of computationally tractable tools with which to investigate neurodegenerative disease dynamics. Here, we propose a novel, coupled network-based model for a two-protein system that includes an enzymatic interaction term alongside a simple model of aggregate transneuronal damage. We apply this theoretical model to test the possible interactions between tau proteins and amyloid-beta and study the resulting coupled behavior between toxic protein clearance and proteopathic phenomenology. Our analysis reveals ways in which amyloid-beta and tau proteins may conspire with each other to enhance the nucleation and propagation of different diseases, thus shedding new light on the importance of protein clearance and protein interaction mechanisms in prion-like models of neurodegenerative disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KLXNjOQrBgw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Systematic modelling of the development of laminar projection origins in the cerebral cortex: Interactions of spatio-temporal patterns of neurogenesis and cellular heterogeneity</title>

The architectonic type principle conceptualizes structural connections between brain areas in terms of the relative architectonic differentiation of connected areas. It has previously been shown that spatio-temporal interactions between the time and place of neurogenesis could underlie multiple features of empirical mammalian connectomes, such as projection existence and the distribution of projection strengths. However, so far no mechanistic explanation for the emergence of typically observed laminar patterns of projection origins and terminations has been tested. Here, we expand an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; model of the developing cortical sheet to explore which factors could potentially constrain the development of laminar projection patterns. We show that manipulations which rely solely on spatio-temporal interactions, namely the relative density of laminar compartments, a delay in the neurogenesis of infragranular layers relative to layer 1, and a delay in the neurogenesis of supragranular layers relative to infragranular layers, do not result in the striking correlation between supragranular contribution to projections and the relative differentiation of areas that is typically observed in the mammalian cortex. In contrast, we find that if we introduce systematic variation in cell-intrinsic properties, coupling them with architectonic differentiation, the resulting laminar projection patterns closely mirror the empirically observed patterns. We also find that the spatio-temporal interactions posited to occur during neurogenesis are necessary for the formation of the characteristic laminar patterns. Hence, our results indicate that the specification of the laminar patterns of projection origins may result from systematic variation in a number of cell-intrinsic properties, superimposed on the previously identified spatio-temporal interactions which are sufficient for the emergence of the architectonic type principle on the level of inter-areal connectivity &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9VZgkBWsJfs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Bacteriophages (phages) are critical players in the dynamics and function of microbial communities and drive processes as diverse as global biogeochemical cycles and human health. Phages tend to be predators finely tuned to attack specific hosts, even down to the strain level, which in turn defend themselves using an array of mechanisms. However, to date, efforts to rapidly and comprehensively identify bacterial host factors important in phage infection and resistance have yet to be fully realized. Here, we globally map the host genetic determinants involved in resistance to 14 phylogenetically diverse double-stranded DNA phages using two model &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; strains (K-12 and BL21) with known sequence divergence to demonstrate strain-specific differences. Using genome-wide loss-of-function and gain-of-function genetic technologies, we are able to confirm previously described phage receptors as well as uncover a number of previously unknown host factors that confer resistance to one or more of these phages. We uncover differences in resistance factors that strongly align with the susceptibility of K-12 and BL21 to specific phage. We also identify both phage-specific mechanisms, such as the unexpected role of cyclic-di-GMP in host sensitivity to phage N4, and more generic defenses, such as the overproduction of colanic acid capsular polysaccharide that defends against a wide array of phages. Our results indicate that host responses to phages can occur via diverse cellular mechanisms. Our systematic and high-throughput genetic workflow to characterize phage-host interaction determinants can be extended to diverse bacteria to generate datasets that allow predictive models of how phage-mediated selection will shape bacterial phenotype and evolution. The results of this study and future efforts to map the phage resistance landscape will lead to new insights into the coevolution of hosts and their phage, which can ultimately be used to design better phage therapeutic treatments and tools for precision microbiome engineering.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iHWP51nHehA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Neural activity during a simple reaching task in macaques is counter to gating and rebound in basal ganglia–thalamic communication</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Bettina C. Schwab, Daisuke Kase, Andrew Zimnik, Robert Rosenbaum, Marcello G. Codianni, Jonathan E. Rubin, Robert S. Turner&lt;/p&gt;

Task-related activity in the ventral thalamus, a major target of basal ganglia output, is often assumed to be permitted or triggered by changes in basal ganglia activity through gating- or rebound-like mechanisms. To test those hypotheses, we sampled single-unit activity from connected basal ganglia output and thalamic nuclei (globus pallidus-internus [GPi] and ventrolateral anterior nucleus [VLa]) in monkeys performing a reaching task. Rate increases were the most common peri-movement change in both nuclei. Moreover, peri-movement changes generally began earlier in VLa than in GPi. Simultaneously recorded GPi-VLa pairs rarely showed short-time-scale spike-to-spike correlations or slow across-trials covariations, and both were equally positive and negative. Finally, spontaneous GPi bursts and pauses were both followed by small, slow reductions in VLa rate. These results appear incompatible with standard gating and rebound models. Still, gating or rebound may be possible in other physiological situations: simulations show how GPi-VLa communication can scale with GPi synchrony and GPi-to-VLa convergence, illuminating how synchrony of basal ganglia output during motor learning or in pathological conditions may render this pathway effective. Thus, in the healthy state, basal ganglia-thalamic communication during learned movement is more subtle than expected, with changes in firing rates possibly being dominated by a common external source.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iBXCAHu-EVs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current understanding of the neuromodulatory effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on large‐scale brain networks remains elusive, largely due to the lack of techniques that can reveal DBS‐induced activity at the whole‐brain level. Using a novel 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)‐compatible stimulator, we investigated whole‐brain effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation in patients with Parkinson disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen patients received STN‐DBS treatment and participated in a block‐design functional MRI (fMRI) experiment, wherein stimulations were delivered during “ON” blocks interleaved with “OFF” blocks. fMRI responses to low‐frequency (60Hz) and high‐frequency(130Hz) STN‐DBS were measured 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postsurgery. To ensure reliability, multiple runs (48 minutes) of fMRI data were acquired at each postsurgical visit. Presurgical resting‐state fMRI (30 minutes) data were also acquired.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two neurocircuits showed highly replicable, but distinct responses to STN‐DBS. A circuit involving the globus pallidus internus (GPi), thalamus, and deep cerebellar nuclei was significantly activated, whereas another circuit involving the primary motor cortex (M1), putamen, and cerebellum showed DBS‐induced deactivation. These 2 circuits were dissociable in terms of their DBS‐induced responses and resting‐state functional connectivity. The GPi circuit was frequency‐dependent, selectively responding to high‐frequency stimulation, whereas the M1 circuit was responsive in a time‐dependent manner, showing enhanced deactivation over time. Finally, activation of the GPi circuit was associated with overall motor improvement, whereas M1 circuit deactivation was related to reduced bradykinesia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concurrent DBS‐fMRI using 3T revealed 2 distinct circuits that responded differentially to STN‐DBS and were related to divergent symptoms, a finding that may provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying DBS. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>All animals can perform certain survival behaviors without prior experience, suggesting a “hard wiring” of underlying neural circuits. Experience, however, can alter the expression of innate behaviors. Where in the brain and how such plasticity occurs remains largely unknown. Previous studies have established the phenomenon of “aggression training,” in which...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/zXDxVY4x6iQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Increased Purkinje Cell Complex Spike and Deep Cerebellar Nucleus Synchrony as a Potential Basis for Syndromic Essential Tremor. A Review and Synthesis of the Literature</title>

	<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We review advances in understanding Purkinje cell (PC) complex spike (CS) physiology that suggest increased CS synchrony underlies syndromic essential tremor (ET). We searched PubMed for papers describing factors that affect CS synchrony or cerebellar circuits potentially related to tremor. Inferior olivary (IO) neurons are electrically coupled, with the degree of coupling controlled by excitatory and GABAergic inputs. Clusters of coupled IO neurons synchronize CSs within parasagittal bands via climbing fibers (Cfs). When motor cortex is stimulated in rats at varying frequencies, whisker movement occurs at ~10 Hz, correlated with synchronous CSs, indicating that the IO/CS oscillatory rhythm gates movement frequency. Intra-IO injection of the GABA&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist picrotoxin increases CS synchrony, increases whisker movement amplitude, and induces tremor. Harmaline and 5-HT&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation also increase IO coupling and CS synchrony and induce tremor. The &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;hotfoot17&lt;/em&gt; mouse displays features found in ET brains, including cerebellar GluRδ2 deficiency and abnormal PC Cf innervation, with IO- and PC-dependent cerebellar oscillations and tremor likely due to enhanced CS synchrony. Heightened coupling within the IO oscillator leads, through its dynamic control of CS synchrony, to increased movement amplitude and, when sufficiently intense, action tremor. Increased CS synchrony secondary to aberrant Cf innervation of multiple PCs likely also underlies &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;hotfoot17&lt;/em&gt; tremor. Deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) hypersynchrony may occur secondary to increased CS synchrony but might also occur from PC axonal terminal sprouting during partial PC loss. Through these combined mechanisms, increased CS/DCN synchrony may plausibly underlie syndromic ET.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61026</link>
	<description>Mutational activation of the &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt; proto-oncogene in melanocytes reliably produces benign nevi (pigmented ‘moles’), yet the same change is the most common driver mutation in melanoma. The reason nevi stop growing, and do not progress to melanoma, is widely attributed to a cell-autonomous process of ‘oncogene-induced senescence’. Using a mouse model of Braf-driven nevus formation, analyzing both proliferative dynamics and single-cell gene expression, we found no evidence that nevus cells are senescent, either compared with other skin cells, or other melanocytes. We also found that nevus size distributions could not be fit by any simple cell-autonomous model of growth arrest, yet were easily fit by models based on collective cell behavior, for example in which arresting cells release an arrest-promoting factor. We suggest that nevus growth arrest is more likely related to the cell interactions that mediate size control in normal tissues, than to any cell-autonomous, ‘oncogene-induced’ program of senescence.</description>

	<description>Parasites from the genus Plasmodium are the causative agents of malaria. The mobility, infectivity, and ultimately pathogenesis of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; rely on a macromolecular complex, called the glideosome. At the core of the glideosome is an essential and divergent Myosin A motor (PfMyoA), a first order drug target against malaria. Here, we present the full-length structure of PfMyoA in two states of its motor cycle. We report novel interactions that are essential for motor priming and the mode of recognition of its two light chains (PfELC and MTIP) by two degenerate IQ motifs. Kinetic and motility assays using PfMyoA variants, along with molecular dynamics, demonstrate how specific priming and atypical sequence adaptations tune the motor’s mechano-chemical properties. Supported by evidence for an essential role of the PfELC in malaria pathogenesis, these structures provide a blueprint for the design of future anti-malarials targeting both the glideosome motor and its regulatory elements.</description>

	<description>Using computer simulations, we generate cell-specific 3D chromosomal structures and compare them to recently published chromatin structures obtained through microscopy. We demonstrate using machine learning and polymer physics simulations that epigenetic information can be used to predict the structural ensembles of multiple human cell lines. Theory predicts that chromosome structures are fluid and can only be described by an ensemble, which is consistent with the observation that chromosomes exhibit no unique fold. Nevertheless, our analysis of both structures from simulation and microscopy reveals that short segments of chromatin make two-state transitions between closed conformations and open dumbbell conformations. Finally, we study the conformational changes associated with the switching of genomic compartments observed in human cell lines. The formation of genomic compartments resembles hydrophobic collapse in protein folding, with the aggregation of denser and predominantly inactive chromatin driving the positioning of active chromatin toward the surface of individual chromosomal territories.</description>

	<description>Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that detect intracellular danger signals and stimulate powerful immune responses. DPP8/9 inhibitors activate the CARD8 inflammasome through an unknown mechanism. Here, Chui et al. show that DPP8/9 inhibitors induce the degradation of many disordered and misfolded proteins. CARD8 has an N-terminal disordered region that is degraded upon DPP8/9 inhibition, triggering inflammasome formation.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The synergy of damage repair and retention promotes rejuvenation and prolongs healthy lifespans in cell lineages</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Barbara Schnitzer, Johannes Borgqvist, Marija Cvijovic&lt;/p&gt;

Damaged proteins are inherited asymmetrically during cell division in the yeast &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, such that most damage is retained within the mother cell. The consequence is an ageing mother and a rejuvenated daughter cell with full replicative potential. Daughters of old and damaged mothers are however born with increasing levels of damage resulting in lowered replicative lifespans. Remarkably, these prematurely old daughters can give rise to rejuvenated cells with low damage levels and recovered lifespans, called second-degree rejuvenation. We aimed to investigate how damage repair and retention together can promote rejuvenation and at the same time ensure low damage levels in mother cells, reflected in longer health spans. We developed a dynamic model for damage accumulation over successive divisions in individual cells as part of a dynamically growing cell lineage. With detailed knowledge about single-cell dynamics and relationships between all cells in the lineage, we can infer how individual damage repair and retention strategies affect the propagation of damage in the population. We show that damage retention lowers damage levels in the population by reducing the variability across the lineage, and results in larger population sizes. Repairing damage efficiently in early life, as opposed to investing in repair when damage has already accumulated, counteracts accelerated ageing caused by damage retention. It prolongs the health span of individual cells which are moreover less prone to stress. In combination, damage retention and early investment in repair are beneficial for healthy ageing in yeast cell populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mXRoa-zjcos&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Time varying methods to infer extremes in dengue transmission dynamics</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jue Tao Lim, Yi Ting Han, Borame Sue Lee Dickens, Lee Ching Ng, Alex R. Cook&lt;/p&gt;

Dengue is an arbovirus affecting global populations. Frequent outbreaks occur, especially in equatorial cities such as Singapore, where year-round tropical climate, large daily influx of travelers and population density provide the ideal conditions for dengue to transmit. Little work has, however, quantified the peaks of dengue outbreaks, when health systems are likely to be most stretched. Nor have methods been developed to infer differences in exogenous factors which lead to the rise and fall of dengue case counts across extreme and non-extreme periods. In this paper, we developed time varying extreme mixture (tvEM) methods to account for the temporal dependence of dengue case counts across extreme and non-extreme periods. This approach permits inference of differences in climatic forcing across non-extreme and extreme periods of dengue case counts, quantification of their temporal dependence as well as estimation of thresholds with associated uncertainties to determine dengue case count extremities. Using tvEM, we found no evidence that weather affects dengue case counts in the near term for non-extreme periods, but that it has non-linear and mixed signals in influencing dengue through tvEM parameters in the extreme periods. Using the most appropriate tvEM specification, we found that a threshold at the 70&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; (95% credible interval 41.1, 83.8) quantile is optimal, with extreme events of 526.6, 1052.2 and 1183.6 weekly case counts expected at return periods of 5, 50 and 75 years. Weather parameters at a 1% scaled increase was found to decrease the long-run expected case counts, but larger increases would lead to a drastic expected rise from the baseline correspondingly. The tvEM approach can provide valuable inference on the extremes of time series, which in the case of infectious disease notifications, allows public health officials to understand the likely scale of outbreaks in the long run.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I3cXdvxQa64&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

We show how highly-diverse ecological communities may display persistent abundance fluctuations, when interacting through resource competition and subjected to migration from a species pool. These fluctuations appear, robustly and predictably, in certain regimes of parameter space. Their origin is closely tied to the ratio of realized species diversity to the number of resources. This ratio is set by competition, through the balance between species being pushed out and invading. When this ratio is smaller than one, dynamics will reach stable equilibria. When this ratio is larger than one, the competitive exclusion principle dictates that fixed-points are either unstable or marginally stable. If they are unstable, the system is repelled from fixed points, and abundances forever fluctuate. While marginally-stable fixed points are in principle allowed and predicted by some models, they become structurally unstable at high diversity. This means that even small changes to the model, such as non-linearities in how resources combine to generate species’ growth, will result in persistent abundance fluctuations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-YwQ_ZWKQz0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Learning in neuronal networks has developed in many directions, in particular to reproduce cognitive tasks like image recognition and speech processing. Implementations have been inspired by stereotypical neuronal responses like tuning curves in the visual system, where, for example, ON/OFF cells fire or not depending on the contrast in their receptive fields. Classical models of neuronal networks therefore map a set of input signals to a set of activity levels in the output of the network. Each category of inputs is thereby predominantly characterized by its mean. In the case of time series, fluctuations around this mean constitute noise in this view. For this paradigm, the high variability exhibited by the cortical activity may thus imply limitations or constraints, which have been discussed for many years. For example, the need for averaging neuronal activity over long periods or large groups of cells to assess a robust mean and to diminish the effect of noise correlations. To reconcile robust computations with variable neuronal activity, we here propose a conceptual change of perspective by employing variability of activity as the basis for stimulus-related information to be learned by neurons, rather than merely being the noise that corrupts the mean signal. In this new paradigm both afferent and recurrent weights in a network are tuned to shape the input-output mapping for covariances, the second-order statistics of the fluctuating activity. When including time lags, covariance patterns define a natural metric for time series that capture their propagating nature. We develop the theory for classification of time series based on their spatio-temporal covariances, which reflect dynamical properties. We demonstrate that recurrent connectivity is able to transform information contained in the temporal structure of the signal into spatial covariances. Finally, we use the MNIST database to show how the covariance perceptron can capture specific second-order statistical patterns generated by moving digits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S4krP42eumQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Estimating effective population size changes from preferentially sampled genetic sequences</title>

Coalescent theory combined with statistical modeling allows us to estimate effective population size fluctuations from molecular sequences of individuals sampled from a population of interest. When sequences are sampled serially through time and the distribution of the sampling times depends on the effective population size, explicit statistical modeling of sampling times improves population size estimation. Previous work assumed that the genealogy relating sampled sequences is known and modeled sampling times as an inhomogeneous Poisson process with log-intensity equal to a linear function of the log-transformed effective population size. We improve this approach in two ways. First, we extend the method to allow for joint Bayesian estimation of the genealogy, effective population size trajectory, and other model parameters. Next, we improve the sampling time model by incorporating additional sources of information in the form of time-varying covariates. We validate our new modeling framework using a simulation study and apply our new methodology to analyses of population dynamics of seasonal influenza and to the recent Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XIZaWF6dlYo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Optimising risk-based surveillance for early detection of invasive plant pathogens</title>

Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) of plants continue to devastate ecosystems and livelihoods worldwide. Effective management requires surveillance to detect epidemics at an early stage. However, despite the increasing use of risk-based surveillance programs in plant health, it remains unclear how best to target surveillance resources to achieve this. We combine a spatially explicit model of pathogen entry and spread with a statistical model of detection and use a stochastic optimisation routine to identify which arrangement of surveillance sites maximises the probability of detecting an invading epidemic. Our approach reveals that it is not always optimal to target the highest-risk sites and that the optimal strategy differs depending on not only patterns of pathogen entry and spread but also the choice of detection method. That is, we find that spatial correlation in risk can make it suboptimal to focus solely on the highest-risk sites, meaning that it is best to avoid ‘putting all your eggs in one basket’. However, this depends on an interplay with other factors, such as the sensitivity of available detection methods. Using the economically important arboreal disease huanglongbing (HLB), we demonstrate how our approach leads to a significant performance gain and cost saving in comparison with conventional methods to targeted surveillance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dZ_K3scbbW8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Pharmacological evidence for the implication of noradrenaline in effort</title>

The trade-off between effort and reward is one of the main determinants of behavior, and its alteration is at the heart of major disorders such as depression or Parkinson’s disease. Monoaminergic neuromodulators are thought to play a key role in this trade-off, but their relative contribution remains unclear. Rhesus monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) performed a choice task requiring a trade-off between the volume of fluid reward and the amount of force to be exerted on a grip. In line with a causal role of noradrenaline in effort, decreasing noradrenaline levels with systemic clonidine injections (0.01 mg/kg) decreased exerted force and enhanced the weight of upcoming force on choices, without any effect on reward sensitivity. Using computational modeling, we showed that a single variable (“effort”) could capture the amount of resources necessary for action and control both choices (as a variable for decision) and force production (as a driving force). Critically, the multiple effects of noradrenaline manipulation on behavior could be captured by a specific modulation of this single variable. Thus, our data strongly support noradrenaline’s implication in effort processing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/y7pI-Dljj44&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Sex‐specific behavioral and neurogenic responses to cocaine in mice lacking and blocking dopamine D1 or dopamine D2 receptors&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9fc3f027-dc16-4ef6-aafb-7a4d035a380b/cne25052-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex‐specific role of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in cocaine effects on adult neurogenesis has been studied. Results indicate that: 1) Cocaine hyperactivity decreases neurogenesis (males) or neuronal maturity (females), and correlates with BDNF. 2) Cocaine does not increase hyperactivity in D1ko females, but increases neuronal maturity and BDNF. 3) Cocaine increases hypoactivity in D2ko males, and increases neurogenesis and BDNF in D2ko females. 4) SCH23390 reduces cocaine hyperactivity, and correlates with BDNF. 5) Raclopride increases cocaine hyperactivity in females, and neurogenesis and BDNF in both sexes. Sex‐specific D1 and D2 signaling on proliferation and neuronal maturity is differentially perturbed by cocaine, and BDNF may contribute to D2 neuroplasticity in cocaine addiction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult neurogenesis in rodents is modulated by dopaminergic signaling and inhibited by cocaine. However, the sex‐specific role of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors (D1R, D2R) in the deleterious effect of cocaine on adult neurogenesis has not been described yet. Here, we explored sex differences in a) cell proliferation (BrdU), b) neural precursor (nestin), c) neuronal phenotype (BrdU/β3‐tubulin), and d) neuronal maturity (NeuN) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and striatum of mice with genetic deletion (D1&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt;, D2&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt;) or pharmacological blockage (SCH23390: 0.1 mg/kg/day/5 days; Raclopride: 0.3 mg/kg/day/5 days) of D1R and D2R, and treated (10 mg/kg/day/5 days) and then challenged (5 mg/kg, 48 h later) with cocaine. Results indicated that hyperactivity responses to cocaine were absent in D1&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mice and reduced in SCH23390‐treated mice. Activity responses to cocaine were reduced in D2&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; males, but absent in D2&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; females and increased in Raclopride‐treated females. D1R deletion blocked the deleterious effect of cocaine on SVZ cell proliferation in males. Cocaine‐exposed D1&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; males also had reduced neuronal phenotype of SVZ newborn cells and increased striatal neuronal maturity. D2&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mice had lower proliferative and neural precursor responses. Cocaine in D2&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; females or co‐administered with Raclopride in WT females improved SVZ cell proliferation, an effect that positively correlated with plasma brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations. In conclusion, the sex‐specific D1R and D2R signaling on SVZ cell proliferation, neural progenitor and neuronal maturity is differentially perturbed by cocaine, and BDNF may be required to link D2R to neuroplasticity in cocaine addiction in females.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Working Memory: Change in Functional Connectivity Between the Dorsal Attention, Default Mode, and Fronto-Parietal Networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00360</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00360</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep deprivation (SD) is very common in modern society and has a profound effect on cognitive function, in particular on working memory (WM). This type of memory is required for completion of many tasks and is adversely affected by SD. However, the cognitive neural mechanism by which SD affects WM, remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the changes in the brain network involved in WM after SD. Twenty-two healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scan while in a state of resting wakefulness and again after 36 h of total SD and performed a WM task before each scanning session. Nineteen main nodes of the default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), fronto-parietal network (FPN), salience network (SN), and other networks were selected for functional analysis of brain network connections. Functional connectivity measures were computed between seed areas for region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI analysis and to identify patterns of ROI-to-ROI connectivity. The relationship between the significant changes in functional connectivity in the brain network and WM performance were then examined by Pearson’s correlation analysis. WM performance declined significantly after SD. Compared with the awake state, the functional connectivity between DAN and DMN significantly increased after SD while that between FPN and DMN significantly decreased. Correlation analysis showed that the enhanced functional connectivity between DAN and DMN was negatively correlated with the decline in WM performance and that the decline in functional connectivity between FPN and DMN was positively correlated with decreased WM performance. These findings suggested that SD may affect WM by altering the functional connectivity among DMN, DAN, and FPN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Keratinocytes Communicate with Sensory Neurons via Synaptic‐like Contacts</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25912?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25912?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain, temperature, and itch are conventionally thought to be exclusively transduced by the intraepidermal nerve endings. Although recent studies have shown that epidermal keratinocytes also participate in sensory transduction, the mechanism underlying keratinocyte communication with intraepidermal nerve endings remains poorly understood. We sought to demonstrate the synaptic character of the contacts between keratinocytes and sensory neurons and their involvement in sensory communication between keratinocytes and sensory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contacts were explored by morphological, molecular, and functional approaches in cocultures of epidermal keratinocytes and sensory neurons. To interrogate whether structures observed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; were also present in the human epidermis, &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; correlative light electron microscopy was performed on human skin biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidermal keratinocytes dialogue with sensory neurons through en passant synaptic‐like contacts. These contacts have the ultrastructural features and molecular hallmarks of chemical synaptic‐like contacts: narrow intercellular cleft, keratinocyte synaptic vesicles expressing synaptophysin and synaptotagmin 1, and sensory information transmitted from keratinocytes to sensory neurons through SNARE‐mediated (syntaxin1) vesicle release.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing selective communication between keratinocytes and sensory neurons, synaptic‐like contacts are the hubs of a 2‐site receptor. The permanent epidermal turnover, implying a specific &lt;i&gt;en passant&lt;/i&gt; structure and high plasticity, may have delayed their identification, thereby contributing to the long‐held concept of nerve endings passing freely between keratinocytes. The discovery of keratinocyte–sensory neuron synaptic‐like contacts may call for a reassessment of basic assumptions in cutaneous sensory perception and sheds new light on the pathophysiology of pain and itch as well as the physiology of touch.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neuroinflammation and Tau Colocalize in vivo in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25911?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25911?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We examined the relationship between tau pathology and neuroinflammation using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV‐1451 PET in 17 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) Richardson's syndrome. We tested the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and tau protein aggregation colocalize macroscopically, and correlate with clinical severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nondisplaceable binding potential (BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt;) for each ligand was quantified in 83 regions of interest (ROIs). The [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV‐1451 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; values were correlated across all regions. The spatial distributions of [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV‐1451 binding were determined by principal component analyses (PCAs), and the loading of each spatial component compared against the patients’ clinical severity (using the PSP rating scale).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV‐1451 binding were positively correlated (R = 0.577, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). The PCA identified 4 components for each ligand, reflecting the relative expression of tau pathology or neuroinflammation in distinct groups of brain regions. Positive associations between [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV‐1451 components’ loadings were found in both subcortical (R = 0.769, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and cortical regions (R = 0.836, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). There were positive correlations between clinical severity and both subcortical tau pathology (R = 0.667, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003) and neuroinflammation (R = 0.788, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that tau pathology and neuroinflammation colocalize in PSP, and that individual differences in subcortical tau pathology and neuroinflammation are linked to clinical severity. Although longitudinal studies are needed to determine causal associations between these molecular pathologies, we suggest that the combination of tau‐ and immune‐oriented strategies may be useful for effective disease‐modifying treatments in PSP.

	<title>Hippocampus: Adult neurogenesis alters response to an aversive distractor in a labyrinth maze without affecting spatial learning or memory</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23267?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23267?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult neurogenesis has been implicated in learning and memory of complex spatial environments. However, new neurons also play a role in nonmnemonic behavior, including the stress response and attention shifting. Many commonly used spatial tasks are very simple, and unsuitable for detecting neurogenesis effects, or are aversively motivated, making it difficult to dissociate effects on spatial learning and memory from effects on stress. We have therefore created a novel complex spatial environment, the flex maze, to enable reward‐mediated testing of spatial learning in a flexibly configurable labyrinth. Using a pharmacogenetic method to completely inhibit neurogenesis in adulthood, we found that rats lacking new neurons (TK rats) and wild type controls completed and remembered most mazes equally well. However, control rats were slower to complete peppermint‐scented mazes than other mazes, while neurogenesis‐deficient rats showed no effect of mint on maze behavior, completing these mazes significantly faster than control rats. Additional testing found that wild type and TK rats showed similar detection of, avoidance of, and glucocorticoid response to the mint odor. These results suggest that spatial learning and memory in a labyrinth task is unaffected by the loss of new neurons, but that these cells affect the ability of an aversive stimulus to distract rats from completing the maze.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Multi‐omics analysis suggests enhanced epileptogenesis in the Cornu Ammonis 3 of the pilocarpine model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23268?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23268?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by the occurrence of seizures, and histopathological abnormalities in the mesial temporal lobe structures, mainly hippocampal sclerosis (HS). We used a multi‐omics approach to determine the profile of transcript and protein expression in the dorsal and ventral hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and &lt;i&gt;Cornu Ammonis&lt;/i&gt; 3 (CA3) in an animal model of MTLE induced by pilocarpine. We performed label‐free proteomics and RNAseq from laser‐microdissected tissue isolated from pilocarpine‐induced Wistar rats. We divided the DG and CA3 into dorsal and ventral areas and analyzed them separately. We performed a data integration analysis and evaluated enriched signaling pathways, as well as the integrated networks generated based on the gene ontology processes. Our results indicate differences in the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles among the DG and the CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. Moreover, our data suggest that epileptogenesis is enhanced in the CA3 region when compared to the DG, with most abnormalities in transcript and protein levels occurring in the CA3. Furthermore, our results show that the epileptogenesis in the pilocarpine model involves predominantly abnormal regulation of excitatory neuronal mechanisms mediated by N‐methyl D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors, changes in the serotonin signaling, and neuronal activity controlled by calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase (CaMK) regulation and leucine‐rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)/WNT signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Circulating Lipoprotein Lipids, Apolipoproteins and Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25916?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25916?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to disentangle the comparative effects of lipids and apolipoproteins on ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single‐nucleotide polymorphisms associated with low‐ and high‐density lipoprotein (LDL and HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein A‐I and B (apoA‐I and apoB) at the level of genomewide significance (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;) in the UK Biobank were used as instrumental variables. Summary‐level data for ischemic stroke and its subtypes were obtained from the MEGASTROKE consortium with 514,791 individuals (60,341 ischemic stroke cases, and 454,450 non‐cases).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased levels of apoB, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were associated with higher risk of any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, and small vessel stroke in the main and sensitivity univariable MR analyses. In multivariable MR analysis including apoB, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in the same model, apoB retained a robust effect (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), whereas the estimate for LDL cholesterol was reversed, and that for triglycerides largely attenuated. Decreased levels of apoA‐I and HDL cholesterol were robustly associated with increased risk of any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, and small vessel stroke in all univariable MR analyses, but the association for apoA‐I was attenuated to the null after mutual adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present MR study reveals that apoB is the predominant trait that accounts for the etiological basis of apoB, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in relation to ischemic stroke, in particular large artery and small vessel stroke. Whether HDL cholesterol exerts a protective effect on ischemic stroke independent of apoA‐I needs further investigation. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Behavior is the neuronally controlled, voluntary or involuntary response of an organism to its environment. An increasing body of evidence indicates that microbes, which live closely associated with animals or in their immediate surroundings, significantly influence animals’ behavior. The extreme complexity of the nervous system of animals, combined with the extraordinary microbial diversity, are two major obstacles to understand, at the molecular level, how microbes modulate animal behavior. In this review, we discuss recent advances in dissecting the impact that bacteria have on the nervous system of two genetically tractable invertebrate models, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Nuclear plasticity increases susceptibility to damage during confined migration</title>

Large nuclear deformations during migration through confined spaces have been associated with nuclear membrane rupture and DNA damage. However, the stresses associated with nuclear damage remain unclear. Here, using a quasi-static plane strain finite element model, we map evolution of nuclear shape and stresses during confined migration of a cell through a deformable matrix. Plastic deformation of the nucleus observed for a cell with stiff nucleus transiting through a stiffer matrix lowered nuclear stresses, but also led to kinking of the nuclear membrane. In line with model predictions, transwell migration experiments with fibrosarcoma cells showed that while nuclear softening increased invasiveness, nuclear stiffening led to plastic deformation and higher levels of DNA damage. In addition to highlighting the advantage of nuclear softening during confined migration, our results suggest that plastic deformations of the nucleus during transit through stiff tissues may lead to bending-induced nuclear membrane disruption and subsequent DNA damage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KHpEjGEbJ5A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Likelihood-free nested sampling for parameter inference of biochemical reaction networks</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008264</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Jan Mikelson, Mustafa Khammash&lt;/p&gt;

The development of mechanistic models of biological systems is a central part of Systems Biology. One major challenge in developing these models is the accurate inference of model parameters. In recent years, nested sampling methods have gained increased attention in the Systems Biology community due to the fact that they are parallelizable and provide error estimates with no additional computations. One drawback that severely limits the usability of these methods, however, is that they require the likelihood function to be available, and thus cannot be applied to systems with intractable likelihoods, such as stochastic models. Here we present a likelihood-free nested sampling method for parameter inference which overcomes these drawbacks. This method gives an unbiased estimator of the Bayesian evidence as well as samples from the posterior. We derive a lower bound on the estimators variance which we use to formulate a novel termination criterion for nested sampling. The presented method enables not only the reliable inference of the posterior of parameters for stochastic systems of a size and complexity that is challenging for traditional methods, but it also provides an estimate of the obtained variance. We illustrate our approach by applying it to several realistically sized models with simulated data as well as recently published biological data. We also compare our developed method with the two most popular other likeliood-free approaches: pMCMC and ABC-SMC. The C++ code of the proposed methods, together with test data, is available at the github web page https://github.com/Mijan/LFNS_paper.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8-zw79YnMRI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Comparative genomics studies may be used to acquire new knowledge regarding genome architecture, which defines the rules for combining sets of genes in the genome of living organisms. Hundreds of thousands of prokaryotic genomes have been sequenced and assembled. However, computational tools capable of simultaneously comparing large numbers of genomes are lacking. We developed the Genome Complexity Browser, a tool that allows the visualization of gene contexts, in a graph-based format, and the quantification of variability for different segments of a genome. The graph-based visualization allows the inspection of changes in gene contents and neighborhoods across hundreds of genomes, simultaneously, which may facilitate the identification of conserved and variable segments of operons or the estimation of the overall variability associated with a particular genome locus. We introduced a measure called complexity, to quantify genome variability. Intraspecies and interspecies comparisons revealed that regions with high complexity values tended to be located in areas that are conserved across different strains and species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gJNe7HEdoqU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Identification of mutations of the genes that give cancer a selective advantage is an important step towards research and clinical objectives. As such, there has been a growing interest in developing methods for identification of driver genes and their temporal order within a single patient (intra-tumor) as well as across a cohort of patients (inter-tumor). In this paper, we develop a probabilistic model for tumor progression, in which the driver genes are clustered into several ordered driver pathways. We develop an efficient inference algorithm that exhibits favorable scalability to the number of genes and samples compared to a previously introduced ILP-based method. Adopting a probabilistic approach also allows principled approaches to model selection and uncertainty quantification. Using a large set of experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate our superior performance compared to the ILP-based method. We also analyze two biological datasets of colorectal and glioblastoma cancers. We emphasize that while the ILP-based method puts many seemingly passenger genes in the driver pathways, our algorithm keeps focused on truly driver genes and outputs more accurate models for cancer progression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YJD8RczkOVI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Predicting three-dimensional protein structure and assembling protein complexes using sequence information belongs to the most prominent tasks in computational biology. Recently substantial progress has been obtained in the case of single proteins using a combination of unsupervised coevolutionary sequence analysis with structurally supervised deep learning. While reaching impressive accuracies in predicting residue-residue contacts, deep learning has a number of disadvantages. The need for large structural training sets limits the applicability to multi-protein complexes; and their deep architecture makes the interpretability of the convolutional neural networks intrinsically hard. Here we introduce FilterDCA, a simpler supervised predictor for inter-domain and inter-protein contacts. It is based on the fact that contact maps of proteins show typical contact patterns, which results from secondary structure and are reflected by patterns in coevolutionary analysis. We explicitly integrate averaged contacts patterns with coevolutionary scores derived by Direct Coupling Analysis, improving performance over standard coevolutionary analysis, while remaining fully transparent and interpretable. The FilterDCA code is available at http://gitlab.lcqb.upmc.fr/muscat/FilterDCA.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8fIdWF2neq8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The success of clinical trials of selective B‐cell depletion in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS) have led to a conceptual shift in the understanding of MS pathogenesis, away from the classical model in which T cells were the sole central actors, and towards a more complex paradigm with B cells having an essential role in both the inflammatory and neurodegenerative components of the disease process. The role of B cells in MS was selected as the topic of the 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Annual meeting of the European Charcot Foundation. Results of the meeting are presented in this concise review which recaps current concepts underlying the biology and therapeutic rationale behind B‐cell directed therapeutics in MS, as well as proposes strategies to optimise the use of existing anti‐B‐cell treatments and provide future directions for research in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alzheimer‐Related Cerebrovascular Disease in Down Syndrome</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25905?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults with Down syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology by their 5th decade. Compared with the general population, traditional vascular risks in adults with DS are rare, allowing examination of cerebrovascular disease in this population and insight into its role in AD without the confound of vascular risk factors. We examined in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)‐based biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathology in adults with DS, and determined their cross‐sectional relationship with age, beta‐amyloid pathology, and mild cognitive impairment or clinical AD diagnostic status.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants from the Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome study (n = 138, 50 ± 7 years, 39% women) with MRI data and a subset (n = 90) with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) were included. We derived MRI‐based biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathology, including white matter hyperintensities (WMH), infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), as well as PET‐based biomarkers of amyloid burden. Participants were characterized as cognitively stable (CS), mild cognitive impairment–DS (MCI‐DS), possible AD dementia, or definite AD dementia based on in‐depth assessments of cognition, function, and health status.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were detectable WMH, enlarged PVS, infarcts, and microbleeds as early as the 5th decade of life. There was a monotonic increase in WMH volume, enlarged PVS, and presence of infarcts across diagnostic groups (CS &amp;lt; MCI‐DS &amp;lt; possible AD dementia &amp;lt; definite AD dementia). Higher amyloid burden was associated with a higher likelihood of an infarct.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease in adults with DS and add to a growing body of evidence that implicates cerebrovascular disease as a core feature of AD and not simply a comorbidity. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Mapping of the Spinal Sensorimotor Network by Transvertebral and Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.555593</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.555593</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Transcutaneous stimulation is a neuromodulation method that is efficiently used for recovery after spinal cord injury and other disorders that are accompanied by motor and sensory deficits. Multiple aspects of transcutaneous stimulation optimization still require testing in animal experiments including the use of pharmacological agents, spinal lesions, cell recording, etc. This need initially motivated us to develop a new approach of transvertebral spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and to test its feasibility in acute and chronic experiments on rats. The aims of the current work were to study the selectivity of muscle activation over the lower thoracic and lumbosacral spinal cord when the stimulating electrode was located intravertebrally and to compare its effectiveness to that of the clinically used transcutaneous stimulation. In decerebrated rats, electromyographic activity was recorded in the muscles of the back (m. longissimus dorsi), tail (m. abductor caudae dorsalis), and hindlimb (mm. iliacus, adductor magnus, vastus lateralis, semitendinosus, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius medialis, soleus, and flexor hallucis longus) during SCS with an electrode placed alternately in one of the spinous processes of the VT12–VS1 vertebrae. The recruitment curves for motor and sensory components of the evoked potentials (separated from each other by means of double-pulse stimulation) were plotted for each muscle; their slopes characterized the effectiveness of the muscle activation. The electrophysiological mapping demonstrated that transvertebral SCS has specific effects to the rostrocaudally distributed sensorimotor network of the lower thoracic and lumbosacral cord, mainly by stimulation of the roots that carry the sensory and motor spinal pathways. These effects were compared in the same animals when mapping was performed by transcutaneous stimulation, and similar distribution of muscle activity and underlying neuroanatomical mechanisms were found. The experiments on chronic rats validated the feasibility of the proposed stimulation approach of transvertebral SCS for further studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Neuroprotective Effect of Optogenetics Varies With Distance From Channelrhodopsin-2 Expression in an Amyloid-β-Injected Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.583628</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is the most common cause of dementia. Optogenetics uses a combination of genetic engineering and light to activate or inhibit specific neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the effect of activation of glutamatergic neurons in the hippocampus of mice injected with Aβ1-42 on memory function and biomarkers of neuroinflammation and neuroprotection in the brain to elucidate the clinical utility of optogenetic neuromodulation in AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: AAV5–CaMKII–channelrhodopsin-2 (CHR2)–mCherry (Aβ-CHR2 mice) or AAV5—CaMKII–mCherry (Aβ-non-CHR2 mice) was injected into the dentate gyrus (DG) of the bilateral hippocampus of an Aβ1-42-injected mouse model of AD. The novel object recognition test was used to investigate working memory (M1), short-term memory (M2), and long-term memory (M3) after Aβ1-42 injection. Hippocampus tissues were collected for immunohistochemical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared to controls, M1 and M2 were significantly higher in Aβ-CHR2 mice, but there was no significant difference in M3; NeuN and synapsin expression were significantly increased in the DG of Aβ-CHR2 mice, but not in CA1, CA3, the subventricular zone (SVZ), or the entorhinal cortex (ENT); GluR2 and IL-10 expressions were significantly increased, and GFAP expression was significantly decreased, in CA1, CA3, the DG, and the SVZ of Aβ-CHR2 mice, but not in the ENT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Activation of glutamatergic neurons by optogenetics in the bilateral DG of an Aβ-injected mouse model of AD improved M1 and M2, but not M3. A single-target optogenetics strategy has spatial limitations; therefore, a multiple targeted optogenetics approach to AD therapy should be explored.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: The Genetic Programs Specifying Kolmer–Agduhr Interneurons</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Kolmer–Agduhr (KA) cells are a subgroup of interneurons positioned adjacent to the neurocoele with cilia on the apical surface protruding into the central canal of the spinal cord. Although KA cells were identified almost a century ago, their development and functions are only beginning to be unfolded. Recent studies have revealed the characteristics of KA cells in greater detail, including their spatial distribution, the timing of their differentiation, and their specification via extrinsic signaling and a unique combination of transcription factors in zebrafish and mouse. Cell lineage-tracing experiments have demonstrated that two subsets of KA cells, named KA’ and KA” cells, differentiate from motoneuronal progenitors and floor-plate precursors, respectively, in both zebrafish and mouse. Although KA’ and KA” cells originate from different progenitors/precursors, they each share a common set of transcription factors. Intriguingly, the combination of transcription factors that promote the acquisition of KA’ cell characteristics differs from those that promote a KA” cell identity. In addition, KA’ and KA” cells exhibit separable neuronal targets and differential responses to bending of the spinal cord. In this review, we summarize what is currently known about the genetic programs defining the identities of KA’ and KA” cell identities. We then discuss how these two subgroups of KA cells are genetically specified.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Excitation of the Pre-frontal and Primary Visual Cortex in Response to Transcorneal Electrical Stimulation in Retinal Degeneration Mice</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Retinal degeneration (rd) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the modern world today. Various strategies including electrical stimulation are being researched for the restoration of partial or complete vision. Previous studies have demonstrated that the effectiveness of electrical stimulation in somatosensory, frontal and visual cortices is dependent on stimulation parameters including stimulation frequency and brain states. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of applying a prolonged electrical stimulation on the eye of rd mice with various stimulation frequencies, in awake and anesthetized brain states. We recorded spontaneous electrocorticogram (ECoG) neural activity in prefrontal cortex and primary visual cortex in a mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) after prolonged (5-day) transcorneal electrical stimulation (pTES) at various frequencies (2, 10, and 20 Hz). We evaluated the absolute power and coherence of spontaneous ECoG neural activities in contralateral primary visual cortex (contra Vcx) and contralateral pre-frontal cortex (contra PFx). Under the awake state, the absolute power of theta, alpha and beta oscillations in contra Vcx, at 10 Hz stimulation, was higher than in the sham group. Under the anesthetized state, the absolute power of medium-, high-, and ultra-high gamma oscillations in the contra PFx, at 2 Hz stimulation, was higher than in the sham group. We also observed that the ultra-high gamma band coherence in contra Vcx-contra PFx was higher than in the sham group, with both 10 and 20 Hz stimulation frequencies. Our results showed that pTES modulates rd brain oscillations in a frequency and brain state-dependent manner. These findings suggest that non-invasive electrical stimulation of retina changes patterns of neural oscillations in the brain circuitry. This also provides a starting point for investigating the sustained effect of electrical stimulation of the retina to brain activities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Systematic Evaluation of DBS Parameters in the Hemi-Parkinsonian Rat Model</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is clinically employed to ameliorate several symptoms of manifest Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Stimulation parameters utilized by chronically implanted pulse generators comprise biphasic rectangular short (60–100 μs) pulses with a repetition frequency between 130 and 180 Hz. A better insight into the effect of electrical stimulation parameters could potentially reveal new possibilities for the improvement of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a treatment. To this end, we employed single-sided 6-hydroxidopamine (6-OHDA) lesioning of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) in rats to systematically investigate alternative stimulation parameters. These hemi-parkinsonian (hemi-PD) rats underwent individualized, ipsilateral electrical stimulation to the STN of the lesioned hemisphere, while the transiently induced contralateral rotational behavior was quantified to assess the effect of DBS parameter variations. The number of induced rotations during 30 s of stimulation was strongly correlated with the amplitude of the stimulation pulses. Despite a general linear relation between DBS frequency and rotational characteristics, a plateau effect was observed in the rotation count throughout the clinically used frequency range. Alternative waveforms to the conventional biphasic rectangular (Rect) pulse shapes [Triangular (Tri), Sinusoidal (Sine), and Sawtooth (Lin.Dec.)] required higher charges per phase to display similar behavior in rats as compared to the conventional pulse shape. The Euclidean Distance (ED) was used to quantify similarities between different angular trajectories. Overall, our study confirmed that the effect of different amplitude and frequency parameters of STN-DBS in the hemi-PD rat model was similar to those in human PD patients. This shows that induced contralateral rotation is a valuable readout in testing stimulation parameters. Our study supports the call for more pre-clinical studies using this measurement to assess the effect of other DBS parameters such as pulse-width and interphase intervals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Sensitivity of Neuroimaging Indicators in Monitoring the Effects of Interferon Gamma Treatment in Friedreich’s Ataxia</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The identification of efficient markers of disease progression and response to possibly effective treatments is a key priority for slowly progressive, rare and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Friedreich’s ataxia. Various imaging modalities have documented specific abnormalities in Friedreich’s ataxia that could be tracked to provide useful indicators of efficacy in clinical trials. Advanced MRI imaging (diffusion tensor imaging, DTI; functional MRI, fMRI; and resting-state fMRI, rs-fMRI) and retinal imaging (optical coherence tomography, OCT) were tested longitudinally in a small group of Friedreich’s ataxia patients participating in an open-label clinical trial testing the safety and the efficacy of 6-month treatment with interferon gamma. While the DTI indices documented the slow progression of fractional anisotropy loss, fMRI and rs-fMRI were significantly modified during and after treatment. The fMRI changes significantly correlated with the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia, which is used to monitor clinical response. OCT documented the known thickness reduction of the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, but there was no change over time. This pilot study provides indications for the potential utility of fMRI and rs-fMRI as ancillary measures in clinical trials for Friedreich’s ataxia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Decoding the Temporal Dynamics of Covert Spatial Attention Using Multivariate EEG Analysis: Contributions of Raw Amplitude and Alpha Power</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Attention can be oriented in space covertly without the need of eye movements. We used multivariate pattern classification analyses (MVPA) to investigate whether the time course of the deployment of covert spatial attention leading up to the observer’s perceptual decision can be decoded from both EEG alpha power and raw activity traces. Decoding attention from these signals can help determine whether raw EEG signals and alpha power reflect the same or distinct features of attentional selection. Using a classical cueing task, we showed that the orientation of covert spatial attention can be decoded by both signals. However, raw activity and alpha power may reflect different features of spatial attention, with alpha power more associated with the orientation of covert attention in space and raw activity with the influence of attention on perceptual processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Much of the information regarding neuronal correlates of visual processing has been derived from functional imaging studies, which have identified a variety of brain areas contributing to visual analysis, recognition, and processing of objects and scenes. However, only two of these areas, namely the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and the lateral occipital complex (LOC), were verified and further characterized by intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG). iEEG is a unique measurement technique that samples a local neuronal population with high temporal and anatomical resolution. In the present study, we aimed to expand on previous reports and examine brain activity for selectivity of scenes and objects in the broadband high-gamma frequency range (50–150 Hz). We collected iEEG data from 27 epileptic patients while they watched a series of images, containing objects and scenes, and we identified 375 bipolar channels responding to at least one of these two categories. Using K-means clustering, we delineated their brain localization. In addition to the two areas described previously, we detected significant responses in two other scene-selective areas, not yet reported by any electrophysiological studies; namely the occipital place area (OPA) and the retrosplenial complex. Moreover, using iEEG we revealed a much broader network underlying visual processing than that described to date, using specialized functional imaging experimental designs. Here, we report the selective brain areas for scene processing include the posterior collateral sulcus and the anterior temporal region, which were already shown to be related to scene novelty and landmark naming. The object-selective responses appeared in the parietal, frontal, and temporal regions connected with tool use and object recognition. The temporal analyses specified the time course of the category selectivity through the dorsal and ventral visual streams. The receiver operating characteristic analyses identified the PPA and the fusiform portion of the LOC as being the most selective for scenes and objects, respectively. Our findings represent a valuable overview of visual processing selectivity for scenes and objects based on iEEG analyses and thus, contribute to a better understanding of visual processing in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sensory-to-Motor Overflow: Cooling Foot Soles Impedes Squat Jump Performance</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.549880</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evidence from recent studies on animals and humans suggest that neural overflow from the primary sensory cortex (S1) to the primary motor cortex (M1) may play a critical role in motor control. However, it is unclear if whole-body maximal motor tasks are also governed by this mechanism. Maximum vertical squat jumps were performed by 15 young adults before cooling, then immediately following a 15-min cooling period using an ice-water bath for the foot soles, and finally immediately following a 15-min period of natural recovery from cooling. Jump heights were, on average, 3.1 cm lower immediately following cooling compared to before cooling (p = 3.39 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;) and 1.9 cm lower following natural recovery from cooling (p = 0.00124). The average vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) was also lower by 78.2 N in the condition immediately following cooling compared to before cooling (p = 8.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;) and 56.7N lower following natural recovery from cooling (p = 0.0043). The current study supports the S1-to-M1 overflow mechanism in a whole-body dynamic jump.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Variance and Scale-Free Properties of Resting-State Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent Signal After Fear Memory Acquisition and Extinction</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.509075</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the dynamic properties of brain activity rather than its stationary values have attracted more interest in clinical applications. It has been shown that brain signals exhibit scale-free dynamics or long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) that differ between rest and cognitive tasks in healthy controls and clinical groups. Little is known about how fear-inducing tasks may influence dispersion and the LRTC of subsequent resting-state brain activity. In this study, we aimed to explore the changes in the variance and scale-free properties of the brain’s blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal during the resting-state sessions before and after fear learning and fear memory extinction. During a 1-h break between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, 23 healthy, right-handed volunteers experienced a fear extinction procedure, followed by Pavlovian fear conditioning that included partial reinforcement using mild electrical stimulation. We extracted the average time course of the BOLD signal from 245 regions of interest (ROIs) taken from the resting-state functional atlas. The variance of the BOLD signal and the Hurst exponent (H), which reflects the scale-free dynamic, were compared in the resting states before and after fear learning and fear memory extinction. After fear extinction, six ROIs showed a difference in H at the uncorrected level of significance, including areas associated with fear processing. H decreased during fear extinction but then became higher than before fear learning, specifically in areas related to the fear extinction network (FEN). However, activity in the other ROIs restored the H to its initial level. The variance of the BOLD signal in six ROIs demonstrated a significant increase from initial rest to the post-task rest. A limited number of ROIs showed changes in both H and variance. Our results imply that the variability and scale-free properties of the BOLD signal might serve as additional indicators of changes in spontaneous brain activity related to recent experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Improved Separation of Odor Responses in Granule Cells of the Olfactory Bulb During Odor Discrimination Learning</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.579349</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the olfactory bulb, olfactory information is translated into ensemble representations by mitral/tufted cells, and these representations change dynamically in a context-dependent manner. In particular, odor representations in mitral/tufted cells display pattern separation during odor discrimination learning. Although granule cells provide major inhibitory input to mitral/tufted cells and play an important role in pattern separation and olfactory learning, the dynamics of odor responses in granule cells during odor discrimination learning remain largely unknown. Here, we studied odor responses in granule cells of the olfactory bulb using fiber photometry recordings in awake behaving mice. We found that odors evoked reliable, excitatory responses in the granule cell population. Intriguingly, during odor discrimination learning, odor responses in granule cells exhibited improved separation and contained information about odor value. In conclusion, we show that granule cells in the olfactory bulb display learning-related plasticity, suggesting that they may mediate pattern separation in mitral/tufted cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Gas6 Inhibits Toll-Like Receptor-Mediated Inflammatory Pathways in Mouse Microglia via Axl and Mer</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.576650</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.576650</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Microglia are well known key regulators of neuroinflammation which feature in multiple neurodegenerative disorders. These cells survey the CNS and, under inflammatory conditions, become “activated” through stimulation of toll-like receptors (TLRs), resulting in changes in morphology and production and release of cytokines. In the present study, we examined the roles of the related TAM receptors, Mer and Axl, and of their ligand, Gas6, in the regulation of microglial pro-inflammatory TNF-α production and microglial morphology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Primary cultures of murine microglia of wild-type (WT), Mer&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; and Axl&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; backgrounds were stimulated by the TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without pre-treatment with Gas6. Gene expression of TNF-α, Mer, and Axl was examined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure TNF-α release from microglia. Immunofluorescence staining of β-actin and the microglial marker Iba1 was performed to reveal microglial morphological changes, with cellular characteristics (area, perimeter, Feret’s diameter, minimum Feret, roundness, and aspect ratio) being quantified using ImageJ software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Under basal conditions, TNF-α gene expression was significantly lower in Axl&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; microglia compared to WT cells. However, all microglial cultures robustly responded to LPS stimulation with the upregulation of TNF-α expression to similar degrees. Furthermore, Mer receptor expression was less responsive to LPS stimulation when in Axl knockout cells. The presence of Gas6 consistently inhibited the LPS-induced upregulation of TNF-α in WT, Mer&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; and Axl&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; microglia. Moreover, Gas6 also inhibited LPS-induced changes in the microglial area, perimeter length, and cell roundness in wild-type cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Gas6 can negatively regulate the microglial pro-inflammatory response to LPS as well as via stimulation of other TLRs, acting through either of the TAM receptors, Axl and Mer. This finding indicates an interaction between TLR and TAM receptor signaling pathways and reveals an anti-inflammatory role for the TAM ligand, Gas6, which could have therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Functional MRI-Specific Alterations in Executive Control Network in Mild Cognitive Impairment: An ALE Meta-Analysis</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.578863</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.578863</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is regarded as a transitional stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. MCI individuals with deficits in executive function are at higher risk for progressing to AD dementia. Currently, there is no consistent result for alterations in the executive control network (ECN) in MCI, which makes early prediction of AD conversion difficult. The aim of the study was to find functional MRI-specific alterations in ECN in MCI patients by expounding on the convergence of brain regions with functional abnormalities in ECN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify neuroimaging studies using methods including the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation/fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, regional homogeneity, and functional connectivity in MCI patients. Based on the Activation Likelihood Estimation algorithm, the coordinate-based meta-analysis and functional meta-analytic connectivity modeling were conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 25 functional imaging studies with MCI patients were included in a quantitative meta-analysis. By summarizing the included articles, we obtained specific brain region changes, mainly including precuneus, cuneus, lingual gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum posterior lobe, in the ECN based on these three methods. The specific abnormal brain regions indicated that there were interactions between the ECN and other networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This study confirms functional imaging specific abnormal markers in ECN and its interaction with other networks in MCI. It provides novel targets and pathways for individualized and precise interventions to delay the progression of MCI to AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Modeling Analysis</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Mehrshad Sadria, Anita T. Layton&lt;/p&gt;

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are frequently prescribed for a range of diseases including hypertension, proteinuric chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. There is evidence indicating that these drugs upregulate ACE2, a key component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and is found on the cells of a number of tissues, including the epithelial cells in the lungs. While ACE2 has a beneficial role in many diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, it also serves as a receptor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 via binding with the spike protein of the virus, thereby allowing it entry into host cells. Thus, it has been suggested that these therapies can theoretically increase the risk of SARS- CoV-2 infection and cause more severe COVID-19. Given the success of ACEi and ARBs in cardiovascular diseases, we seek to gain insights into the implications of these medications in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. To that end, we have developed a mathematical model that represents the RAS, binding of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent cell entry, and the host’s acute inflammatory response. The model can simulate different levels of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and represent the effect of commonly prescribed anti-hypertensive medications, ACEi and ARB, and predict tissue damage. Model simulations indicate that whether the extent of tissue damage may be exacerbated by ACEi or ARB treatment depends on a number of factors, including the level of existing inflammation, dosage, and the effect of the drugs on ACE2 protein abundance. The findings of this study can serve as the first step in the development of appropriate and more comprehensive guidelines for the prescription of ACEi and ARB in the current and future coronavirus pandemics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QDTmdHbBMK4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Uncovering drivers of dose-dependence and individual variation in malaria infection outcomes</title>

To understand why some hosts get sicker than others from the same type of infection, it is essential to explain how key processes, such as host responses to infection and parasite growth, are influenced by various biotic and abiotic factors. In many disease systems, the initial infection dose impacts host morbidity and mortality. To explore drivers of dose-dependence and individual variation in infection outcomes, we devised a mathematical model of malaria infection that allowed host and parasite traits to be linear functions (reaction norms) of the initial dose. We fitted the model, using a hierarchical Bayesian approach, to experimental time-series data of acute &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium chabaudi&lt;/i&gt; infection across doses spanning seven orders of magnitude. We found evidence for both dose-dependent facilitation and debilitation of host responses. Most importantly, increasing dose reduced the strength of activation of indiscriminate host clearance of red blood cells while increasing the half-life of that response, leading to the maximal response at an intermediate dose. We also explored the causes of diverse infection outcomes across replicate mice receiving the same dose. Besides random noise in the injected dose, we found variation in peak parasite load was due to unobserved individual variation in host responses to clear infected cells. Individual variation in anaemia was likely driven by random variation in parasite burst size, which is linked to the rate of host cells lost to malaria infection. General host vigour in the absence of infection was also correlated with host health during malaria infection. Our work demonstrates that the reaction norm approach provides a useful quantitative framework for examining the impact of a continuous external factor on within-host infection processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/B7KSyafyguM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Adaptive immunity selects against malaria infection blocking mutations</title>

The mutation responsible for Duffy negativity, which impedes &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt; infection, has reached high frequencies in certain human populations. Conversely, mutations capable of blocking the more lethal &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; have not succeeded in malarious zones. Here we present an evolutionary-epidemiological model of malaria which demonstrates that if adaptive immunity against the most virulent effects of malaria is gained rapidly by the host, mutations which prevent infection &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; are unlikely to succeed. Our results (i) explain the rarity of strain-transcending &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; infection blocking adaptations in humans; (ii) make the surprising prediction that mutations which block &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; infection are most likely to be found in populations experiencing low or infrequent malaria transmission, and (iii) predict that immunity against some of the virulent effects of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; malaria may be built up over the course of many infections.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UL9ghmjx9V0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Network analysis of transcriptomic diversity amongst resident tissue macrophages and dendritic cells in the mouse mononuclear phagocyte system</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Kim M. Summers, Stephen J. Bush, David A. Hume&lt;/p&gt;

The mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) is a family of cells including progenitors, circulating blood monocytes, resident tissue macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) present in every tissue in the body. To test the relationships between markers and transcriptomic diversity in the MPS, we collected from National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI-GEO) a total of 466 quality RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data sets generated from mouse MPS cells isolated from bone marrow, blood, and multiple tissues. The primary data were randomly downsized to a depth of 10 million reads and requantified. The resulting data set was clustered using the network analysis tool &lt;i&gt;BioLayout&lt;/i&gt;. A sample-to-sample matrix revealed that MPS populations could be separated based upon tissue of origin. Cells identified as classical DC subsets, cDC1s and cDC2s, and lacking &lt;i&gt;Fcgr1&lt;/i&gt; (encoding the protein CD64) were contained within the MPS cluster, no more distinct than other MPS cells. A gene-to-gene correlation matrix identified large generic coexpression clusters associated with MPS maturation and innate immune function. Smaller coexpression gene clusters, including the transcription factors that drive them, showed higher expression within defined isolated cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and DCs isolated from specific tissues. They include a cluster containing &lt;i&gt;Lyve1&lt;/i&gt; that implies a function in endothelial cell (EC) homeostasis, a cluster of transcripts enriched in intestinal macrophages, and a generic lymphoid tissue cDC cluster associated with &lt;i&gt;Ccr7&lt;/i&gt;. However, transcripts encoding &lt;i&gt;Adgre1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Itgax&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Itgam&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Clec9a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cd163&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mertk&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mrc1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Retnla&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;H2-a/e&lt;/i&gt; (encoding class II major histocompatibility complex [MHC] proteins) and many other proposed macrophage subset and DC lineage markers each had idiosyncratic expression profiles. Coexpression of immediate early genes (for example, &lt;i&gt;Egr1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dusp1&lt;/i&gt;) and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (tumour necrosis factor [&lt;i&gt;Tnf&lt;/i&gt;], &lt;i&gt;Il1b&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ccl3/4&lt;/i&gt;) indicated that all tissue disaggregation and separation protocols activate MPS cells. Tissue-specific expression clusters indicated that all cell isolation procedures also co-purify other unrelated cell types that may interact with MPS cells in vivo. Comparative analysis of RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from the same lung cell populations indicated that MPS heterogeneity implied by global cluster analysis may be even greater at a single-cell level. This analysis highlights the power of large data sets to identify the diversity of MPS cellular phenotypes and the limited predictive value of surface markers to define lineages, functions, or subpopulations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_zx7TnbaPY0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Corticocuneate projections are altered after spinal cord dorsal column lesions in New World monkeys</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Corticocuneate projections are altered after spinal cord dorsal column lesions in New World monkeys&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/77ffbc5a-9a8e-4fb7-a9bd-1b8802fdd10a/cne25050-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuneate nucleus normally receives cortical inputs from the hand regions of sensorimotor cortex in the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres. This cortical descending influence remains similar in New World monkeys with the short recoveries from the dorsal column lesion, but is greatly increased after the long recoveries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovery of responses to cutaneous stimuli in the area 3b hand cortex of monkeys after dorsal column lesions (DCLs) in the cervical spinal cord relies on neural rewiring in the cuneate nucleus (Cu) over time. To examine whether the corticocuneate projections are modified during recoveries after the DCL, we injected cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) into the hand representation in Cu to label the cortical neurons after various recovery times, and related results to the recovery of neural responses in the affected area 3b hand cortex. In normal New World monkeys, labeled neurons were predominately distributed in the hand regions of contralateral areas 3b, 3a, 1 and 2, parietal ventral (PV), secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), and primary motor cortex (M1), with similar distributions in the ipsilateral cortex in significantly smaller numbers. In monkeys with short‐term recoveries, the area 3b hand neurons were unresponsive or responded weakly to touch on the hand, while the cortical labeling pattern was largely unchanged. After longer recoveries, the area 3b hand neurons remained unresponsive, or responded to touch on the hand or somatotopically abnormal parts, depending on the lesion extent. The distributions of cortical labeled neurons were much more widespread than the normal pattern in both hemispheres, especially when lesions were incomplete. The proportion of labeled neurons in the contralateral area 3b hand cortex was not correlated with the functional reactivation in the area 3b hand cortex. Overall, our findings indicated that corticocuneate inputs increase during the functional recovery, but this functional role is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;GluD1 is more strongly expressed in the striosome than in the matrix compartment of the monkey caudate nucleus. At the subcellular level, GluD1 is found at asymmetric glutamatergic synapses on dendrites and spines. Double immunofluorescence data suggest an association between GluD1 profiles and vGluT2‐containing thalamic terminals in both striatal compartments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glutamate receptor Delta 1 (GluD1) is strongly expressed in the striatum. Knockout of GluD1 expression in striatal neurons elicits cognitive deficits and disrupts the thalamostriatal system in mice. To understand the potential role of GluD1 in the primate striatum, we compared the cellular and subcellular localization of striatal GluD1 immunoreactivity (GluD1‐IR) in mice and monkeys. In both species, striatal GluD1‐IR displayed a patchy pattern of distribution in register with the striosome/matrix compartmentation, but in an opposite fashion. While GluD1 was more heavily expressed in the striosomes than the matrix in the monkey caudate nucleus, the opposite was found in the mouse striatum. At the electron microscopic level, GluD1‐IR was preferentially expressed in dendritic shafts (47.9 ± 1.2%), followed by glia (37.7 ± 2.5%), and dendritic spines (14.3 ± 2.6%) in the matrix of the mouse striatum. This pattern was not statistically different from the labeling in the striosome and matrix compartments of the monkey caudate nucleus, with the exception of a small amount of GluD1‐positive unmyelinated axons and axon terminals in the primate striatum. Immunogold staining revealed synaptic and perisynaptic GluD1 labeling at putative axo‐dendritic and axo‐spinous glutamatergic synapses and intracellular labeling on the surface of mitochondria. Confocal microscopy showed that GluD1 is preferentially co‐localized with thalamic over cortical terminals in both the striosome and matrix compartments. These data provide the anatomical substrate for a deeper understanding of GluD1 regulation of striatal glutamatergic synapses, but also suggest possible extrasynaptic, glial and mitochondrial GluD1 functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Polymicrogyria is Associated With Pathogenic Variants in PTEN</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25904?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congenital structural brain malformations have been described in patients with pathogenic phosphatase and tensin homologue (&lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt;) variants, but the frequency of cortical malformations in patients with &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt; variants and their impact on clinical phenotype are not well understood. Our goal was to systematically characterize brain malformations in patients with &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt; variants and assess the relevance of their brain malformations to clinical presentation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We systematically searched a local radiology database for patients with &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt; variants who had available brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI scans were reviewed systematically for cortical abnormalities. We reviewed electroencephalogram (EEG) data and evaluated the electronic medical record for evidence of epilepsy and developmental delay.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, we identified 22 patients with &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt; pathogenic variants for which brain MRIs were available (age range 0.4–17 years). Twelve among these 22 patients (54%) had polymicrogyria (PMG). Variants associated with PMG or atypical gyration encoded regions of the phosphatase or C2 domains of PTEN. Interestingly, epilepsy was present in only 2 of the 12 patients with PMG. We found a trend toward higher rates of global developmental delay (GDD), intellectual disability (ID), and motor delay in individuals with cortical abnormalities, although cohort size limited statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malformations of cortical development, PMG in particular, represent an under‐recognized phenotype associated with &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt; pathogenic variants and may have an association with cognitive and motor delays. Epilepsy was infrequent compared to the previously reported high risk of epilepsy in patients with PMG. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Noninvasive characterization of human glymphatics and meningeal lymphatics in an in vivo model of blood‐brain barrier leakage</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25928?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25928?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate human glymphatics and meningeal lymphatics noninvasively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prospective study implemented 3‐dimensional isotropic contrast‐enhanced T2 fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (3D isotropic CE‐T2‐FLAIR) imaging with a 3‐tesla (T) magnetic resonance machine to study cerebral glymphatics and meningeal lymphatics in patients with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) with (n=92) or without (n=90) blood‐brain barrier (BBB) disruption and a disease control group with cluster headache (n=35). The contrast agent gadobutrol (0.2 mmol/kg (0.2mL/kg)) was administered intravenously in all study subjects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, 217 patients (182 RCVS, 35 cluster headache) were analyzed and separated into two groups based on the presence or absence of visible gadolinium (Gd) leakage. Paraarterial tracer enrichment was clearly depicted in those with overt BBB disruption, while paravenous and parasinus meningeal contrast enrichment was evident in both groups. Paravenous and parasinus contrast enrichment remained in RCVS patients in the remission stage and in cluster headache patients, suggesting that these meningeal lymphatic channels were universal anatomical structures rather than being phase‐ or condition‐specific. Additionally, we demonstrated nodular leptomeningeal enhancement in 32.3% of participants, which might represent potential lymphatic reservoirs. Four selected RCVS patients who received consecutive contrasted 3D isotropic FLAIR imaging after gadobutrol administration showed that the Gd persisted for at least 54 minutes and was completely cleared within 18 hours.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This large‐scale &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; study successfully demonstrated the putative human paraarterial glymphatic transports and meningeal lymphatics by clear depiction of paraarterial, parasinus and paravenous meningeal contrast enrichment using the high‐resolution 3D isotropic CE‐T2‐FLAIR imaging noninvasively; this technique may serve as a basis for further studies to delineate clinical relevance of glymphatic clearance.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Chronic Sodium Selenate Treatment Restores Deficits in Cognition and Synaptic Plasticity in a Murine Model of Tauopathy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;A major goal in diseases is identifying a potential therapeutic agent that is cost-effective and can remedy some, if not all, disease symptoms. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein is one of the neuropathological hallmarks, and Tau pathology correlates better with cognitive impairments in AD patients than amyloid-β load, supporting a key role of tau-related mechanisms. Selenium is a non-metallic trace element that is incorporated in the brain into selenoproteins. Chronic treatment with sodium selenate, a non-toxic selenium compound, was recently reported to rescue behavioral phenotypes in tau mouse models. Here, we focused on the effects of chronic selenate application on synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in THY-Tau22 mice, a transgenic animal model of tauopathies. Three months with a supplement of sodium selenate in the drinking water (12 μg/ml) restored not only impaired neurocognitive functions but also rescued long-term depression (LTD), a major form of synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, selenate reduced the inactive demethylated catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in THY-Tau22 without affecting total PP2A.Our study provides evidence that chronic dietary selenate rescues functional synaptic deficits of tauopathy and identifies activation of PP2A as the putative mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Altered EEG Signal Complexity Induced by Hand Proximity: A Multiscale Entropy Approach</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual short-term memory (VSTM) is an important cognitive function that acts as a temporary storage for visual information. Previous studies have shown that VSTM capacity can be modulated by the location of one’s hands, where hand proximity enhances neural processing and memory of nearby visual stimuli. The present study used traditional event-related potentials (ERP) along with multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis to shed light on the neural mechanism(s) behind such near-hand effect. Participants’ electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded as they performed a VSTM task with their hands either proximal or distal to the display. ERP analysis showed altered memory processing in the 400–700 ms time window during memory retrieval period. Importantly, MSE analysis also showed significant EEG difference between hand proximal and distal conditions between scales 10 to 20, and such difference is clustered around the right parietal cortex – a region that is involved in VSTM processing and bimodal hand-eye integration. The implications of higher MSE time scale in the parietal cortex are discussed in the context of signal complexity and its possible relation to cognitive processing. To our knowledge, this study provides the first investigation using MSE to characterize the temporal characteristics and signal complexity behind the effect of hand proximity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has recently been used for the analysis of neuroimages, such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, and positron emission tomography (PET), and it has achieved significant performance improvements over traditional machine learning in computer-aided diagnosis of brain disorders. This paper reviews the applications of deep learning methods for neuroimaging-based brain disorder analysis. We first provide a comprehensive overview of deep learning techniques and popular network architectures by introducing various types of deep neural networks and recent developments. We then review deep learning methods for computer-aided analysis of four typical brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Autism spectrum disorder, and Schizophrenia, where the first two diseases are neurodegenerative disorders and the last two are neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, respectively. More importantly, we discuss the limitations of existing studies and present possible future directions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Responses to Food Odors Associated With BMI Change at 2-Year Follow-Up</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The understanding of food cue associated neural activations that predict future weight variability may guide the design of effective prevention programs and treatments for overeating and obesity. The current study investigated the association between brain response to different food odors with varied energy density and individual changes of body mass index (BMI) over 2 years. Twenty-five participants received high-fat (chocolate and peanut), low-fat (bread and peach) food odors, and a nonfood odor (rose) while the brain activation was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). BMIs were calculated with participant’s self-reported body weight and height collected at the time of the fMRI scan and again at 2 years later. Regression analyses revealed significant negative correlations between BMI increase over 2 years and brain activation of the bilateral precuneus and the right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in response to high-fat vs. low-fat food odors. Also, brain activation of the right supplementary motor area (SMA) in response to food vs. non-food odor was negatively correlated to subsequent BMI increase over 2 years. Taken together, the current findings suggest that individual differences in neural responsivity to (high calorie) food odors in brain regions of the default mode and motor control network serve as a neural marker for future BMI change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Predicting Stimulus Modality and Working Memory Load During Visual- and Audiovisual-Acquired Equivalence Learning</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Scholars have extensively studied the electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of associative working memory (WM) load. However, the effect of stimulus modality on EEG patterns within this process is less understood. To fill this research gap, the present study re-analyzed EEG datasets recorded during visual and audiovisual equivalence learning tasks from earlier studies. The number of associations required to be maintained (WM load) in WM was increased using the staircase method during the acquisition phase of the tasks. The support vector machine algorithm was employed to predict WM load and stimulus modality using the power, phase connectivity, and cross-frequency coupling (CFC) values obtained during time segments with different WM loads in the visual and audiovisual tasks. A high accuracy (&amp;gt;90%) in predicting stimulus modality based on power spectral density and from the theta–beta CFC was observed. However, accuracy in predicting WM load was higher (≥75% accuracy) than that in predicting stimulus modality (which was at chance level) using theta and alpha phase connectivity. Under low WM load conditions, this connectivity was highest between the frontal and parieto-occipital channels. The results validated our findings from earlier studies that dissociated stimulus modality based on power-spectra and CFC during equivalence learning. Furthermore, the results emphasized the importance of alpha and theta frontoparietal connectivity in WM load.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Pitch Processing Can Indicate Cognitive Alterations in Chronic Liver Disease: An fNIRS Study</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Early detection and evaluation of cognitive alteration in chronic liver disease is important for predicting the subsequent development of hepatic encephalopathy. While visuomotor tasks have been rigorously employed for cognitive evaluation in chronic liver disease, there is a paucity of auditory processing task. Here we focused on auditory perception and examined behavioral and haemodynamic responses to a melodic contour identification task (CIT) to compare cognitive abilities in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD, N = 30) and healthy controls (N = 25). Further, we used support vector machines to examine the optimal combination of channels of functional near-infrared spectroscopy that can classify cognitive alterations in CLD. Behavioral findings showed that CIT performance was significantly worse in the patient group and CIT significantly correlated with neurocognitive evaluation (i.e., number connection test, digit span test). The findings indicated that CIT can measure auditory cognitive capacity and its difference existing between patient group and healthy controls. Additionally, optimal subsets classified the 16-dimensional haemodynamic data with 78.35% classification accuracy, yielding markers of cognitive alterations in the prefrontal regions (CH6, CH7, CH10, CH13, CH14, and CH16). The results confirmed the potential use of behavioral as well as haemodynamic responses to music perception as an alternative or supplementary method for evaluating cognitive alterations in chronic liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Prefrontal Responses to Odors in Individuals With Autism Spectrum Disorders: Functional NIRS Measurement Combined With a Fragrance Pulse Ejection System</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are impaired not only in social competencies but also in sensory perception, particularly olfaction. The olfactory ability of individuals with ASD has been examined in several psychophysical studies, but the results have been highly variable, which might be primarily due to methodological difficulties in the control of odor stimuli (e.g., the problem of lingering scents). In addition, the neural correlates of olfactory specificities in individuals with ASD remain largely unknown. To date, only one study has investigated this issue using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The present study utilized a sophisticated method−a pulse ejection system−to present well-controlled odor stimuli to participants with ASD using an ASD-friendly application. With this advantageous system, we examined their odor detection, identification, and evaluation abilities and measured their brain activity evoked by odors using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). As the odor detection threshold (DT) of participants with ASD was highly variable, these participants were divided into two groups according to their DT: an ASD-Low DT group and an ASD-High DT group. Behavioral results showed that the ASD-High DT group had a significantly higher DT than the typically developing (control) group and the ASD-Low DT group, indicating their insensitivity to the tested odors. In addition, while there was no significant difference in the odor identification ability between groups, there was some discrepancy between the groups’ evaluations of odor pleasantness. The brain data identified, for the first time, that neural activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was significantly weaker in the ASD-High DT group than in the control group. Moreover, the strength of activity in the right DLPFC was negatively correlated with the DT. These findings suggest that participants with ASD have impairments in the higher-order function of olfactory processing, such as olfactory working memory and/or attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Children With Autism Produce a Unique Pattern of EEG Microstates During an Eyes Closed Resting-State Condition</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Although fMRI studies have produced considerable evidence for differences in the spatial connectivity of resting-state brain networks in persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) relative to typically developing (TD) peers, little is known about the temporal dynamics of these brain networks in ASD. The aim of this study was to examine the EEG microstate architecture in children with ASD as compared to TD at rest in two separate conditions – eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO). EEG microstate analysis was performed on resting-state data of 13 ASD and 13 TD children matched on age, gender, and IQ. We found that children with ASD and TD peers produced topographically similar canonical microstates at rest. Group differences in the duration and frequency of these microstates were found primarily in the EC resting-state condition. In line with previous fMRI findings that have reported differences in spatial connectivity within the salience network (previously correlated with the activity of microstate C) in ASD, we found that the duration of activation of microstate C was increased, and the frequency of microstate C was decreased in ASD as compared to TD in EC resting-state. Functionally, these results may be reflective of alterations in interoceptive processes in ASD. These results suggest a unique pattern of EEG microstate architecture in ASD relative to TD during resting-states and also that EEG microstate parameters in ASD are susceptible to differences in resting-state conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Early Auditory Experience Modifies Neuronal Firing Properties in the Zebra Finch Auditory Cortex</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Songbirds learn to sing much as humans learn to speak. In zebra finches, one of the premier songbird models, males learn to sing for later courtship through a multistep learning process during the developmental period. They first listen to and memorize the song of a tutor (normally their father) during the sensory learning period. Then, in the subsequent sensory-motor learning phase (with large overlap), they match their vocalizations to the memorized tutor song via auditory feedback and develop their own unique songs, which they maintain throughout their lives. Previous studies have suggested that memories of tutor songs are shaped in the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) of the brain, which is analogous to the mammalian higher auditory cortex. Isolation during development, which extends the sensory learning period in males, alters song preference in adult females, and NCM inactivation decreases song preference. However, the development of neurophysiological properties of neurons in this area and the effect of isolation on these neurons have not yet been explained. Here, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recording on NCM neurons from juvenile zebra finches during the sensory learning period, 20, 40, or 60 days post-hatching (DPH) and examined their neurophysiological properties. In contrast to previous reports in adult NCM neurons, the majority of NCM neurons of juvenile zebra finches showed spontaneous firing with or without burst firing patterns, and the percentage of neurons that fired increased in the middle of the sensory learning period (40 DPH) and then decreased at the end (60 DPH) in both males and females. We further found that auditory isolation from tutor songs alters developmental changes in the proportions of firing neurons both in males and females, and also changes those of burst neurons differently between males that sing and females that do not. Taken together, these findings suggest that NCM neurons develop their neurophysiological properties depending on auditory experiences during the sensory song learning period, which underlies memory formation for song learning in males and song discrimination in females.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hearing loss has become one of the most common disabilities worldwide. The synaptic connections between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons have specialized synaptic constructions, termed ribbon synapses, which are important for auditory function. The ribbon synapses in the cochlea are quite vulnerable to various insults. As such, the maintenance of ribbon synapses is important for ensuring hearing function. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of the cochlea and has the potential to protect cochlear hair cells from various insults. In this study, we examined the role of IGF1 in the maintenance of ribbon synapses in cochlear explants of postnatal day four mice. We cultured cochlear explants with an IGF1 receptor antagonist, JB1, which is an IGF1 peptide analog. Results showed that exposure to JB1 for 24 h resulted in the loss of ribbon synapses. After an additional 24-h culture without JB1, the number of ribbon synapses spontaneously recovered. The application of exogenous IGF1 showed two different aspects of ribbon synapses. Low doses of exogenous IGF1 promoted the recovery of ribbon synapses, while it compromised the spontaneous recovery of ribbon synapses at high doses. Altogether, these results indicate that the paracrine or autocrine release of IGF1 in the cochlea plays a crucial role in the maintenance of cochlear ribbon synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Phenotype-Agnostic Molecular Subtyping of Neurodegenerative Disorders: The Cincinnati Cohort Biomarker Program (CCBP)</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Ongoing biomarker development programs have been designed to identify serologic or imaging signatures of clinico-pathologic entities, assuming distinct biological boundaries between them. Identified putative biomarkers have exhibited large variability and inconsistency between cohorts, and remain inadequate for selecting suitable recipients for potential disease-modifying interventions. We launched the Cincinnati Cohort Biomarker Program (CCBP) as a population-based, phenotype-agnostic longitudinal study. While patients affected by a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders will be deeply phenotyped using clinical, imaging, and mobile health technologies, analyses will not be anchored on phenotypic clusters but on bioassays of to-be-repurposed medications as well as on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, microbiomics, and pharmacogenomics analyses blinded to phenotypic data. Unique features of this cohort study include (1) a reverse biology-to-phenotype direction of biomarker development in which clinical, imaging, and mobile health technologies are subordinate to biological signals of interest; (2) hypothesis free, causally- and data driven-based analyses; (3) inclusive recruitment of patients with neurodegenerative disorders beyond clinical criteria-meeting patients with Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and (4) a large number of longitudinally followed participants. The parallel development of serum bioassays will be aimed at linking biologically suitable subjects to already available drugs with repurposing potential in future proof-of-concept adaptive clinical trials. Although many challenges are anticipated, including the unclear pathogenic relevance of identifiable biological signals and the possibility that some signals of importance may not yet be measurable with current technologies, this cohort study abandons the anchoring role of clinico-pathologic criteria in favor of biomarker-driven disease subtyping to facilitate future biosubtype-specific disease-modifying therapeutic efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>Reactivation refers to the phenomenon wherein patterns of neural activity expressed during perceptual experience are re-expressed at a later time, a putative neural marker of memory. Reactivation of perceptual content has been observed across many cortical areas and correlates with objective and subjective expressions of memory in humans. However, because reactivation emphasizes similarities between perceptual and memory-based representations, it obscures differences in how perceptual events and memories are represented.</description>

	<description>A major challenge in neurobiology in the 21st century is to understand how the brain adapts with experience. Activity-dependent gene expression is integral to the synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory; however, this process cannot be explained by a simple linear trajectory of transcription to translation within a specific neuronal population. Many other regulatory mechanisms can influence RNA metabolism and the capacity of neurons to adapt. In particular, the RNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has recently been shown to regulate RNA processing through alternative splicing, RNA stability, and translation.</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Biophysically detailed mathematical models of multiscale cardiac active mechanics</title>

We propose four novel mathematical models, describing the microscopic mechanisms of force generation in the cardiac muscle tissue, which are suitable for multiscale numerical simulations of cardiac electromechanics. Such models are based on a biophysically accurate representation of the regulatory and contractile proteins in the sarcomeres. Our models, unlike most of the sarcomere dynamics models that are available in the literature and that feature a comparable richness of detail, do not require the time-consuming Monte Carlo method for their numerical approximation. Conversely, the models that we propose only require the solution of a system of PDEs and/or ODEs (the most reduced of the four only involving 20 ODEs), thus entailing a significant computational efficiency. By focusing on the two models that feature the best trade-off between detail of description and identifiability of parameters, we propose a pipeline to calibrate such parameters starting from experimental measurements available in literature. Thanks to this pipeline, we calibrate these models for room-temperature rat and for body-temperature human cells. We show, by means of numerical simulations, that the proposed models correctly predict the main features of force generation, including the steady-state force-calcium and force-length relationships, the length-dependent prolongation of twitches and increase of peak force, the force-velocity relationship. Moreover, they correctly reproduce the Frank-Starling effect, when employed in multiscale 3D numerical simulation of cardiac electromechanics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KRa2qWDDbfI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Inconsistent therapeutic efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in regenerative medicine has been documented in many clinical trials. Precise prediction on the therapeutic outcome of a MSC therapy based on the patient’s conditions would provide valuable references for clinicians to decide the treatment strategies. In this article, we performed a meta-analysis on MSC therapies for cartilage repair using machine learning. A small database was generated from published &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and clinical studies. The unique features of our neural network model in handling missing data and calculating prediction uncertainty enabled precise prediction of post-treatment cartilage repair scores with coefficient of determination of 0.637 ± 0.005. From this model, we identified defect area percentage, defect depth percentage, implantation cell number, body weight, tissue source, and the type of cartilage damage as critical properties that significant impact cartilage repair. A dosage of 17 − 25 million MSCs was found to achieve optimal cartilage repair. Further, critical thresholds at 6% and 64% of cartilage damage in area, and 22% and 56% in depth were predicted to significantly compromise on the efficacy of MSC therapy. This study, for the first time, demonstrated machine learning of patient-specific cartilage repair post MSC therapy. This approach can be applied to identify and investigate more critical properties involved in MSC-induced cartilage repair, and adapted for other clinical indications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3Y1ySVN8soQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

The current quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assay recommended for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing in the United States requires analysis of 3 genomic targets per sample: 2 viral and 1 host. To simplify testing and reduce the volume of required reagents, we devised a multiplex RT-qPCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a single reaction. We used existing N1, N2, and RP primer and probe sets by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but substituted fluorophores to allow multiplexing of the assay. The cycle threshold (Ct) values of our multiplex RT-qPCR were comparable to those obtained by the single assay adapted for research purposes. Low copy numbers (≥500 copies/reaction) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were consistently detected by the multiplex RT-qPCR. Our novel multiplex RT-qPCR improves upon current single diagnostics by saving reagents, costs, time, and labor.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/FyibY_G3i4g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: CAG Repeat Size Influences the Progression Rate of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25919?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25919?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado‐Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), the expanded cytosine adenine guanine (CAG) repeat in &lt;i&gt;ATXN3&lt;/i&gt; is the causal mutation, and its length is the main factor in determining the age at onset (AO) of clinical symptoms. However, the contribution of the expanded CAG repeat length to the rate of disease progression after onset has remained a matter of debate, even though an understanding of this factor is crucial for experimental data on disease modifiers and their translation to clinical trials and their design.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty‐two Dutch patients with SCA3/MJD were evaluated annually for 15 years using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). Using linear growth curve models, ICARS progression rates were calculated and tested for their relation to the length of the CAG repeat expansion and to the residual age at onset (RAO): The difference between the observed AO and the AO predicted on the basis of the CAG repeat length.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, ICARS scores increased 2.57 points/year of disease. The length of the CAG repeat was positively correlated with a more rapid ICARS progression, explaining 30% of the differences between patients. Combining both the length of the CAG repeat and RAO as comodifiers explained up to 47% of the interpatient variation in ICARS progression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data imply that the length of the expanded CAG repeat in &lt;i&gt;ATXN3&lt;/i&gt; is a major determinant of clinical decline, which suggests that CAG‐dependent molecular mechanisms similar to those responsible for disease onset also contribute to the rate of disease progression in SCA3/MJD.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Marmosets have a greater diversity of c‐Fos response after hyperstimulation in distinct cortical regions as compared to rats</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Marmosets have a greater diversity of c‐Fos response after hyperstimulation in distinct cortical regions as compared to rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d05cf91e-6a26-41c5-aa99-62f68faad038/cne25044-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rats and marmosets were injected with pentylenetetrazol and euthanized at different time points after stimulus. Immunohistochemical detection of c‐Fos was quantified using stereological cell counting in eight neocortical regions. Our results showed that the marmoset brain has a greater neuronal activation after intense stimulation by means of pentylenetetrazol and a more complex pattern of brain activation. We speculate that these functional differences may contribute for the understanding of the different neuronal processing capacities of the neocortex in these mammals' orders.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous evidence indicated a potential mechanism that might support the fact that primates exhibit greater neural integration capacity as a result of the activation of different structures of the central nervous system, as compared to rodents. The current study aimed to provide further evidence to confirm previous findings by analyzing the patterns of c‐Fos expression in more neocortical structures of rats and marmosets using a more robust quantitative technique and evaluating a larger number of brain areas. Nineteen Wistar rats and 21 marmosets (&lt;i&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/i&gt;) were distributed among control groups (animals without injections) and animals injected with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and euthanized at different time points after stimulus. Immunohistochemical detection of c‐Fos was quantified using unbiased and efficient stereological cell counting in eight neocortical regions. Marmosets had a c‐Fos expression that was notably more widely expressed (5× more cells) and longer lasting (up to 3 hr) than rats. c‐Fos expression in rats presented similar patterns of expression according to the function of the brain cortical structures (associative, sensorial, and motor functions), which was not observed for marmosets (in which no clear pattern could be drawn, and a more diverse profile emerged). Our results provide evidence that the marmoset brain has a greater neuronal activation after intense stimulation by means of PTZ and a more complex pattern of brain activation. We speculate that these functional differences may contribute for the understanding of the different neuronal processing capacities of the neocortex in these mammals' orders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Altered Expression of Glial Gap Junction Proteins Cx43, Cx30, and Cx47 in the 5XFAD Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.582934</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glial gap junction proteins, called connexins (Cxs), form gap junctions in the central nervous system (CNS) to allow the bidirectional cytosolic exchange of molecules between adjacent cells. Their involvement in inheritable diseases and the use of experimental animal models that closely mimic such diseases revealed the critical role of glial GJs in myelination and homeostasis. Cxs are also implicated in acquired demyelinating disorders, such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Animal and human studies have revealed a role of the astrocytic Cx43 in the progression of AD but the role of Cx47, which is the main partner of Cx43 in the astrocyte-oligodendrocyte GJs is still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the astrocytic connexins, Cx43 and Cx30 in relation to oligodendrocytic Cx47 in the cortex and thalamus of the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. The model was characterized by increased Aβ deposition, gliosis, neuronal loss, and memory impairment. Compared to wild-type mice, Cx43 and Cx30 showed increased immunoreactivity in older 5XFAD mice, reflecting astrogliosis, while Cx47 immunoreactivity was reduced. Moreover, Cx47 GJ plaques showed reduced colocalization with Cx43 plaques. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and mature oligodendrocyte populations were also depleted, and myelin deficits were observed. Our findings indicate reduced astrocyte-oligodendrocyte gap junction connectivity and possibly a shift in Cx43 expression toward astrocyte-astrocyte gap junctions and/or hemichannels, that could impair oligodendrocyte homeostasis and myelination. However, other factors, such as Aβ toxicity, could directly affect oligodendrocyte survival in AD. Our study provides evidence that Cxs might have implications in the progression of AD, although the role of oligodendrocyte Cxs in AD requires further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Automatic Skull Stripping of Rat and Mouse Brain MRI Data Using U-Net</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Accurate removal of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal outside the brain, a.k.a., skull stripping, is a key step in the brain image pre-processing pipelines. In rodents, this is mostly achieved by manually editing a brain mask, which is time-consuming and operator dependent. Automating this step is particularly challenging in rodents as compared to humans, because of differences in brain/scalp tissue geometry, image resolution with respect to brain-scalp distance, and tissue contrast around the skull. In this study, we proposed a deep-learning-based framework, U-Net, to automatically identify the rodent brain boundaries in MR images. The U-Net method is robust against inter-subject variability and eliminates operator dependence. To benchmark the efficiency of this method, we trained and validated our model using both in-house collected and publicly available datasets. In comparison to current state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieved superior averaged Dice similarity coefficient to ground truth T2-weighted rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement and T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;-weighted echo planar imaging data in both rats and mice (all p &amp;lt; 0.05), demonstrating robust performance of our approach across various MRI protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Classification of Schizophrenia by Functional Connectivity Strength Using Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00040</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been widely employed in the objective diagnosis of patients with schizophrenia during a verbal fluency task (VFT). Most of the available methods depended on the time-domain features extracted from the data of single or multiple channels. The present study proposed an alternative method based on the functional connectivity strength (FCS) derived from an individual channel. The data measured 100 patients with schizophrenia and 100 healthy controls, who were used to train the classifiers and to evaluate their performance. Different classifiers were evaluated, and support machine vector achieved the best performance. In order to reduce the dimensional complexity of the feature domain, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied. The classification results by using an individual channel, a combination of several channels, and 52 ensemble channels with and without the dimensional reduced technique were compared. It provided a new approach to identify schizophrenia, improving the objective diagnosis of this mental disorder. FCS from three channels on the medial prefrontal and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortices rendered accuracy as high as 84.67%, sensitivity at 92.00%, and specificity at 70%. The neurophysiological significance of the change at these regions was consistence with the major syndromes of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: β-Amyloid Plaque Reduction in the Hippocampus After Focused Ultrasound-Induced Blood–Brain Barrier Opening in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The blood–brain barrier (BBB) limits therapeutic delivery in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurological disorders. Animal models have demonstrated safe BBB opening and reduction in β-amyloid plaque with focused ultrasound (FUS). We recently demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and reversibility of FUS-induced BBB opening in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in six participants with early AD. We now report the effect of BBB opening with FUS treatment on β-amyloid plaque. Six participants underwent &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-Florbetaben PET scan at baseline and 1 week after the completion of the third FUS treatment (60 days interval). PET analysis comparing the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in the treated and untreated hemispheres revealed a decrease in the ratio of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-Florbetaben ligand binding. The standard uptake value ratios (SUVr) reduction ranged from 2.7% to 10% with an average of 5.05% (±2.76) suggesting a decrease in β-amyloid plaque.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Auditory Processing Differences Correlate With Autistic Traits in Males</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has high prevalence among males compared to females but mechanisms underlying the differences between sexes are poorly investigated. Moreover, autistic symptoms show a continuity in the general population and are referred to as autistic traits in people without an ASD diagnosis. One of the symptoms of ASD is sensory processing differences both in sensitivity and perception. To investigate sensory processing differences in autistic traits, we examined auditory and visual processing in a healthy population. We recruited 75 individuals (39 females and 36 males, mean age = 23.01 years, SD = 3.23 years) and assessed autistic traits using the Autism Spectrum Quotient, and sensory sensitivity using the Sensory Sensitivity Scales. Sensory processing in the visual domain was examined with the radial motion stimulus and the auditory domain was assessed with the 1,000 Hz pure tone stimulus with electroencephalography-evoked potentials. The results showed that the auditory sensitivity scores of the males (r&lt;sub&gt;aud&lt;/sub&gt; (34) = 0.396, p&lt;sub&gt;aud&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.017) and the visual sensitivity scores of females were correlated with autistic traits (r&lt;sub&gt;vis&lt;/sub&gt; (37) = 0.420, p&lt;sub&gt;vis&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.008). Moreover, the P2 latency for the auditory stimulus was prolonged in the participants with a higher level of autistic traits (r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (61) = 0.411, p = 0.008), and this correlation was only observed in males (r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (31) = 0.542, p = 0.001). We propose that auditory processing differences are related to autistic traits in neurotypicals, particularly in males.

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The emotional properties of words, such as valence and arousal, influence the way we perceive and process verbal stimuli. Recently, subjective significance was found to be an additional factor describing the activational aspect of emotional reactions, which is vital for the cognitive consequences of emotional stimuli processing. Subjective significance represents the form of mental activation specific to reflective mind processing. The Lexical Decision Task (LDT) is a paradigm allowing the investigation of the involuntary processing of meaning and differentiating this processing from the formal processing of the perceptual features of words. In this study, we wanted to search for the consequences of valence, arousal, and subjective significance for the involuntary processing of verbal stimuli meaning indexed by both behavioral measures (reaction latencies) and electrophysiological measures (Event-Related Potentials: ERPs). We expected subjective significance, as the reflective form of activation, to shorten response latencies in LDT. We also expected subjective significance to modulate the amplitude of the ERP FN400 component, reducing the negative-going deflection of the potential. We expected valence to shape the LPC component amplitude, differentiating between negative and positive valences, since the LPC indexes the meaning processing. Indeed, the results confirmed our expectations and showed that subjective significance is a factor independent from the arousal and valence that shapes the involuntary processing of verbal stimuli, especially the detection of a link between stimulus and meaning indexed by the FN400. Moreover, we found that the LPC amplitude was differentiated by valence level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Correlates of Smartphone Dependence in Adolescents</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Increases in depressive and suicide-related symptoms among United States adolescents have been recently linked to increased use of smartphones. Understanding of the brain mechanisms that underlie the potential smartphone dependence may help develop interventions to address this important problem. In this exploratory study, we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying potential smartphone dependence in a sample of 19 adolescent volunteers who completed self-assessments of their smartphone dependence, depressive symptoms, and sleep problems. All 19 adolescents underwent diffusion MRI that allowed for assessment of white matter structural connectivity within the framework of connectomics. Based on previous literature on the neurobiology of addiction, we hypothesized a disruption of network centrality of three nodes in the mesolimbic network: Nucleus Accumbens, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala. Our results showed positive correlations between the node centrality of the right amygdala and self-reported smartphone dependence, between smartphone dependence and sleep problems, and between sleep problems and depressive symptoms. A higher phone dependence was observed in females compared to males. Supported by these results, we propose a model of how smartphone dependence can be linked to aberrations in brain networks, sex, sleep disturbances, and depression in adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Robust EEG-Based Decoding of Auditory Attention With High-RMS-Level Speech Segments in Noisy Conditions</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.557534</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The attended speech stream can be detected robustly, even in adverse auditory scenarios with auditory attentional modulation, and can be decoded using electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Speech segmentation based on the relative root-mean-square (RMS) intensity can be used to estimate segmental contributions to perception in noisy conditions. High-RMS-level segments contain crucial information for speech perception. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effect of high-RMS-level speech segments on auditory attention decoding performance under various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Scalp EEG signals were recorded when subjects listened to the attended speech stream in the mixed speech narrated concurrently by two Mandarin speakers. The temporal response function was used to identify the attended speech from EEG responses of tracking to the temporal envelopes of intact speech and high-RMS-level speech segments alone, respectively. Auditory decoding performance was then analyzed under various SNR conditions by comparing EEG correlations to the attended and ignored speech streams. The accuracy of auditory attention decoding based on the temporal envelope with high-RMS-level speech segments was not inferior to that based on the temporal envelope of intact speech. Cortical activity correlated more strongly with attended than with ignored speech under different SNR conditions. These results suggest that EEG recordings corresponding to high-RMS-level speech segments carry crucial information for the identification and tracking of attended speech in the presence of background noise. This study also showed that with the modulation of auditory attention, attended speech can be decoded more robustly from neural activity than from behavioral measures under a wide range of SNR.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sensory Prediction of Limb Movement Is Critical for Automatic Online Control</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.549537</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.549537</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Fast, online control of movement is an essential component of human motor skills, as it allows automatic correction of inaccurate planning. The present study explores the role of two types of concurrent signals in error correction: predicted visual reafferences coming from an internal representation of the hand, and actual visual feedback from the hand. While the role of sensory feedback in these corrections is well-established, much less is known about sensory prediction. The relative contributions of these two types of signals remain a subject of debate, as they are naturally interconnected. We address the issue in a study that compares online correction of an artificially induced, undetected planning error. Two conditions are tested, which only differ with respect to the accuracy of predicted visual reafferences. In the first, “Prism” experiment, a planning error is introduced by prisms that laterally displace the seen hand prior to hand movement onset. The prism-induced conflict between visual and proprioceptive inputs of the hand also generates an erroneous prediction of visual reafferences of the moving hand. In the second, “Jump” experiment, a planning error is introduced by a jump in the target position, during the orienting saccade, prior to hand movement onset. In the latter condition, predicted reafferences of the hand remained intact. In both experiments, after hand movement onset, the hand was either visible or hidden, which enabled us to manipulate the presence (or absence) of visual feedback during movement execution. The Prism experiment highlighted late and reduced correction of the planning error, even when natural visual feedback of the moving hand was available. In the Jump experiment, early and automatic corrections of the planning error were observed, even in the absence of visual feedback from the moving hand. Therefore, when predicted reafferences were accurate (the Jump experiment), visual feedback was processed rapidly and automatically. When they were erroneous (the Prism experiment), the same visual feedback was less efficient, and required voluntary, and late, control. Our study clearly demonstrates that in natural environments, reliable prediction is critical in the preprocessing of visual feedback, for fast and accurate movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: The Interplay of Synaptic Plasticity and Scaling Enables Self-Organized Formation and Allocation of Multiple Memory Representations</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.541728</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.541728</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;It is commonly assumed that memories about experienced stimuli are represented by groups of highly interconnected neurons called cell assemblies. This requires allocating and storing information in the neural circuitry, which happens through synaptic weight adaptations at different types of synapses. In general, memory allocation is associated with synaptic changes at feed-forward synapses while memory storage is linked with adaptation of recurrent connections. It remains, however, largely unknown how memory allocation and storage can be achieved and the adaption of the different synapses involved be coordinated to allow for a faithful representation of multiple memories without disruptive interference between them. In this theoretical study, by using network simulations and phase space analyses, we show that the interplay between long-term synaptic plasticity and homeostatic synaptic scaling organizes simultaneously the adaptations of feed-forward and recurrent synapses such that a new stimulus forms a new memory and where different stimuli are assigned to distinct cell assemblies. The resulting dynamics can reproduce experimental in-vivo data, focusing on how diverse factors, such as neuronal excitability and network connectivity, influence memory formation. Thus, the here presented model suggests that a few fundamental synaptic mechanisms may suffice to implement memory allocation and storage in neural circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Prior Hypoxia Exposure Enhances Murine Microglial Inflammatory Gene Expression in vitro Without Concomitant H3K4me3 Enrichment</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.535549</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hypoxia (Hx) is a component of multiple disorders, including stroke and sleep-disordered breathing, which often precede or are comorbid with neurodegenerative diseases. However, little is known about how hypoxia affects the ability of microglia, resident CNS macrophages, to respond to subsequent inflammatory challenges that are often present during neurodegenerative processes. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that hypoxia would enhance or “prime” microglial pro-inflammatory gene expression in response to a later inflammatory challenge without programmatically increasing basal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. To test this, we pre-exposed immortalized N9 and primary microglia to hypoxia (1% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 16 h and then challenged them with pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) either immediately or 3–6 days following hypoxic exposure. We used RNA sequencing coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing to analyze primed microglial inflammatory gene expression and modifications to histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at the promoters of primed genes. We found that microglia exhibited enhanced responses to LPS 3 days and 6 days post-hypoxia. Surprisingly, however, the majority of primed genes were not enriched for H3K4me3 acutely following hypoxia exposure. Using the bioinformatics tool MAGICTRICKS and reversible pharmacological inhibition, we found that primed genes required the transcriptional activities of NF-κB. These findings provide evidence that hypoxia pre-exposure could lead to persistent and aberrant inflammatory responses in the context of CNS disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Glycyrrhizic Acid Improves Cognitive Levels of Aging Mice by Regulating T/B Cell Proliferation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is the substance with the highest content of triterpenoid saponins that can be extracted from licorice, and has anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and anticancer functions, among others. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of GA on cognitive decline in middle-aged mice and explore its mechanisms. We injected GA by the tail vein of C57BL/6 mice and measured their cognitive levels using the Morris water maze. The Morris water maze results demonstrated that GA improved learning and memory abilities in middle-aged mice. Furthermore, the RNA-sequencing and flow cytometric analyses revealed that GA could increase T and B cells. We then confirmed the relationship between cognition and the immune system in the immune-deficient B-NDG mouse model. Our results suggest that GA improves cognition in aging mice by regulating T/B cell proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Quantitative Digitography Measures Fine Motor Disturbances in Chronically Treated HIV Similar to Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.539598</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.539598</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Motor and cognitive deficits were compared in aging, chronically treated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) people, people with mild-to-moderate stage Parkinson’s disease (PD), and healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Groups consisted of 36 people with PD, 28 with HIV infection, and 28 healthy controls. Motor function was assessed with the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS-III) and a rapid alternating finger tapping (RAFT) task on an engineered keyboard known as Quantitative Digitography (QDG). Executive function, verbal memory, and visuospatial processing were assessed using standard neuropsychological tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: HIV demonstrated RAFT deficits similar to PD such as reduced amplitude (P = 0.023) and greater amplitude variability (P = 0.019) in the index finger when compared to controls. This fine motor disturbance correlated with HIV’s immune health, measured by their CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell count (P &amp;lt; 0.01). The UPDRS did not yield motor differences between HIV and controls. Executive function and verbal memory were impaired in HIV (P = 0.006, P = 0.016, respectively), but not in PD; visuospatial processing was similarly impaired in HIV and PD (P &amp;lt; 0.05) although motor deficits predominated in PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Fine motor bradykinesia measured quantitatively by QDG RAFT holds promise as a marker of motor decline related to current immune health in aging HIV patients and may be useful in longitudinal studies regarding mechanisms of immunosenescence vs. potential toxicity of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in this population. Additionally, motor and cognitive networks in HIV may be affected differently as the disease progresses as observed in the differential patterns of impairment between HIV and PD, providing insight into the mechanisms of brain deterioration in HIV.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Optimising age coverage of seasonal influenza vaccination in England: A mathematical and health economic evaluation</title>

For infectious disease prevention, policy-makers are typically required to base policy decisions in light of operational and monetary restrictions, prohibiting implementation of all candidate interventions. To inform the evidence-base underpinning policy decision making, mathematical and health economic modelling can be a valuable constituent.
Applied to England, this study aims to identify the optimal target age groups when extending a seasonal influenza vaccination programme of at-risk individuals to those individuals at low risk of developing complications following infection. To perform this analysis, we utilise an age- and strain-structured transmission model that includes immunity propagation mechanisms which link prior season epidemiological outcomes to immunity at the beginning of the following season. Making use of surveillance data from the past decade in conjunction with our dynamic model, we simulate transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza in England from 2012 to 2018. We infer that modified susceptibility due to natural infection in the previous influenza season is the only immunity propagation mechanism to deliver a non-negligible impact on the transmission dynamics. Further, we discerned case ascertainment to be higher for young infants compared to adults under 65 years old, and uncovered a decrease in case ascertainment as age increased from 65 to 85 years of age.
Our health economic appraisal sweeps vaccination age space to determine threshold vaccine dose prices achieving cost-effectiveness under differing paired strategies. In particular, we model offering vaccination to all those low-risk individuals younger than a given age (but no younger than two years old) and all low-risk individuals older than a given age, while maintaining vaccination of at-risk individuals of any age. All posited strategies were deemed cost-effective. In general, the addition of low-risk vaccination programmes whose coverage encompassed children and young adults (aged 20 and below) were highly cost-effective. The inclusion of elder age-groups to the low-risk programme typically lessened the cost-effectiveness. Notably, elderly-centric programmes vaccinating from 65-75 years and above had the least permitted expense per vaccine.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YXYrHOVQBO8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

Social behaviors are ubiquitous and crucial to an animal’s survival and success. The behaviors an animal performs in a social setting are affected by internal factors, inputs from the environment, and interactions with others. To quantify social behaviors, we need to measure both the stochastic nature of the behavior of isolated individuals and how this behavioral repertoire changes as a function of the environment and interactions between individuals. We probed the behavior of male and female fruit flies in a circular arena as individuals and within all possible pairings. By combining measurements of the animals’ position in the arena with an unsupervised analysis of their behaviors, we define the effects of position in the environment and the presence of a partner on locomotion, grooming, singing, and other behaviors that make up an animal’s repertoire. We find that geometric context tunes behavioral preference, pairs of animals synchronize their behavioral preferences across shared trials, and paired individuals display signatures of behavioral mimicry.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J7-bscTtJHs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Cholesterol binding to the sterol-sensing region of Niemann Pick C1 protein confines dynamics of its N-terminal domain</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007554</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;by Vikas Dubey, Behruz Bozorg, Daniel Wüstner, Himanshu Khandelia&lt;/p&gt;

Lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol is a hallmark of Niemann Pick type C (NPC) disease caused by mutations primarily in the lysosomal membrane protein NPC1. NPC1 contains a transmembrane sterol-sensing domain (SSD), which is supposed to regulate protein activity upon cholesterol binding, but the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Using atomistic simulations, we show that in the absence of cholesterol in the SSD, the luminal domains of NPC1 are highly dynamic, resulting in the disengagement of the NTD from the rest of the protein. The disengaged NPC1 adopts a flexed conformation that approaches the lipid bilayer, and could represent a conformational state primed to receive a sterol molecule from the soluble lysosomal cholesterol carrier NPC2. The binding of cholesterol to the SSD of NPC1 allosterically suppresses the conformational dynamics of the luminal domains resulting in an upright NTD conformation. The presence of an additional 20% cholesterol in the membrane has negligible impact on this process. The additional presence of an NTD-bound cholesterol suppresses the flexing of the NTD. We propose that cholesterol acts as an allosteric effector, and the modulation of NTD dynamics by the SSD-bound cholesterol constitutes an allosteric feedback mechanism in NPC1 that controls cholesterol abundance in the lysosomal membrane.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FqaJ-_IesIk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Ocular dominance plasticity: Molecular mechanisms revisited</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25001?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) is a type of cortical plasticity operating in visual cortex of mammals that are endowed with binocular vision based on the competition‐driven disparity. Earlier, a molecular mechanism was proposed that catecholamines play an important role in the maintenance of ODP in kittens. Having survived the initial test, the hypothesis was further advanced to identify noradrenaline (NA) as a key factor that regulates ODP in the immature cortex. Later, the ODP‐promoting effect of NA is extended to the adult with age‐related limitations. Following the enhanced NA availability, the chain events downstream lead to the β‐adrenoreceptor‐induced cAMP accumulation, which in turn activates the protein kinase A. Eventually, the protein kinase translocates to the cell nucleus to activate cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). CREB is a cellular transcription factor that controls the transcription of various genes, underpinning neuronal plasticity and long‐term memory. In the advent of molecular genetics in that various types of new tools have become available with relative ease, ODP research has lightly adopted in the rodent model the original concepts and methodologies. Here, after briefly tracing the strategic maturation of our quest, the review moves to the later development of the field, with the emphasis placed around the following issues: (a) Are we testing ODP per se? (b) What does monocular deprivation deprive of the immature cortex? (c) The critical importance of binocular competition, (d) What is the adult plasticity? (e) Excitation–Inhibition balance in local circuits, and (f) Species differences in the animal models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Microchiropterans have a diminutive cerebral cortex, not an enlarged cerebellum, compared to megachiropterans and other mammals&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bcde8eb5-ad90-476f-ba1d-4c31d52c4336/cne24985-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herculano‐Houzel et al. examine numbers of neurons in the brain of 13 bat species and find that the apparently “enlarged” cerebellum of small echolocating bats has the same proportion of brain neurons as other mammals, and is more likely simply the result of a diminutive cerebral cortex.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small echolocating bats are set apart from most other mammals by their relatively large cerebellum, a feature that has been associated to echolocation, as it is presumed to indicate a relatively enlarged number of neurons in the cerebellum in comparison to other brain structures. Here we quantify the neuronal composition of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and remaining brain structures of seven species of large Pteropodid bats (formerly classified as megachiropterans), one of which echolocates, and six species of small bats (formerly classified as microchiropterans), all of which echolocate. This chiropteran data is compared to 60 mammalian species in our dataset to determine whether the relatively large cerebellum of the small echolocating bats, and possibly that of the echolocating Pteropodid, contains a relatively enlarged number of neurons. We find no evidence that the distribution of neurons differs between microchiropterans and megachiropterans, but our data indicate that microchiropterans, like the smallest shrew in our dataset, have diminutive cerebral cortices, which makes the cerebellum appear relatively large. We propose that, in agreement with the diminutive brain size of the earliest fossil mammals, this is a plesiomorphic, not a derived, feature of microchiropteran brains. The results of this study also reveal important neural characteristics related to the phylogenetic affinities and relationships of the chiropterans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The effect of optic nerve section on form deprivation myopia in the guinea pig</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The effect of optic nerve section on form deprivation myopia in the guinea pig&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2a0b0582-4e0b-412c-abf4-3b37e72c7705/cne24961-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myopic eyes grow too long so images are focused short of the retina. What controls this excessive growth? We know that across species, deprivation of detailed vision (form deprivation, FD) increases the rate of eye elongation and induces myopia. When the FD ceases, these myopic eyes then slow their growth and recover from their myopia. We show here that in young mammalian eyes, this bidirectional response still occurs after the optic nerve is cut, implicating local retinal control of eye growth. However, the FD eye grows excessively after optic nerve section showing that the fine‐tuning of eye growth requires an intact optic nerve.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myopia is induced when a growing eye wears a diffuser that deprives it of detailed spatial vision (form deprivation, FD). In chickens with optic nerve section (ONS), FD myopia still occurs, suggesting that the signals underlying myopia reside within the eye. As avian eyes differ from mammals, we asked whether local mechanisms also underlie FD myopia in a mammalian model. Young guinea pigs underwent either sham surgery followed by FD (SHAM + FD, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 7); or ONS followed by FD (ONS + FD, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 7); or ONS without FD (ONS, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 9). FD was initiated 3 days after surgery with a diffuser that was worn on the surgically treated eye for 14 days. Animals with ONS + FD developed −8.9 D of relative myopia and elongated by 135 μm more than in their untreated eyes after 2 weeks of FD. These changes were significantly greater than those in SHAM + FD animals (−5.5 D and 40 μm of elongation after 14 days of FD), and reflected exaggerated elongation of the posterior vitreous chamber. The myopia reversed when FD was discontinued, despite ONS, but eyes did not recover back to normal (30 days after surgery, ONS + FD eyes still retained −3 D of relative myopia when SHAM+FD animals had returned to normal). No long‐term residual myopia was present after ONS alone, ruling out a surgical artifact. Although the gross mechanism signaling myopic ocular growth and its recovery in the young mammalian eye does not require an intact optic nerve, its fine‐tuning is disrupted by ONS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;

We previously reported in young chicks bidirectional gene expression regulation of the &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt; in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) after visual manipulation, tied to the direction of induced eye growth changes. Here we report local (regional) differences in expression patterns that were also treatment specific. Both &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BMP4&lt;/i&gt; genes showed the expected increased expression with imposed myopic defocus (+10 D lens) after 2 and 48 hr, albeit limited to central and mid‐peripheral RPE zones. In contrast, the expected decrease in &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression with imposed hyperopic defocus (−10 D lens) was evident across all three zones after both 2 and 48 hr, with similar patterns observed after 48 hr with FD. Similar but smaller changes were recorded for &lt;i&gt;BMP4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BMP7&lt;/i&gt; gene expression with the latter myopia‐inducing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We previously reported bidirectional gene expression regulation of the Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (&lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt;) in chick retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in response to imposed optical defocus and form‐deprivation (FD). This study investigated whether there are local (regional) differences in these effects. 19‐day old White‐Leghorn chicks wore monocular +10 or − 10 D lenses, or diffusers (FD) for 2 or 48 hr, after which RPE samples were collected from both eyes, from a central circular zone (3 mm radius), and 3 mm wide annular mid‐peripheral and peripheral zones in all cases. &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt; gene expression levels in RPE from treated and fellow control eyes were compared as well as differences across zones. With the +10 D lens, increased expression of both &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BMP4&lt;/i&gt; genes was observed in central and mid‐peripheral zones but not the peripheral zone after 2 and 48 hr. In contrast, with the −10 D lens &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression was significantly decreased in all three zones after 2 and 48 hr. Similar patterns of &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression were observed in all three zones after 48 hr of FD. Smaller changes were recorded for &lt;i&gt;BMP4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BMP7&lt;/i&gt; gene expression for both myopia‐inducing treatments. That optical defocus‐ and FD‐induced changes in &lt;i&gt;BMP&lt;/i&gt; gene expression in chick RPE show treatment‐dependent local (regional) differences suggest important differences in the nature and contributions of local retinal and underlying RPE regions to eye growth regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Categorical face perception in fish: How a fish brain warps reality to dissociate “same” from “different”&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c79c4bdd-439d-4304-92b6-8196f47758f1/cne24947-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many animals, just like humans, are able to categorize objects based on physical appearance. In humans, training improves performance in such tasks by distorting perceived similarity at the category boundary, a nonlinear effect termed categorical perception (CP). Here we sought evidence for a comparable effect in a lower vertebrate. Based on stimuli generated using a novel image morphing technique, we describe a series of visual discrimination experiments demonstrating CP of facial patterns in a reef fish, providing insight into the evolutionary origins and neural bases of this ability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categorical perception (CP) is the phenomenon by which a smoothly varying stimulus property undergoes a nonlinear transformation during processing in the brain. Consequently, the stimuli are perceived as belonging to distinct categories separated by a sharp boundary. Originally thought to be largely innate, the discovery of CP in tasks such as novel image discrimination has piqued the interest of cognitive scientists because it provides compelling evidence that learning can shape a category's perceptual boundaries. CP has been particularly closely studied in human face perception. In nonprimates, there is evidence for CP for sound and color discrimination, but not for image or face discrimination. Here, we investigate the potential for learned CP in a lower vertebrate, the damselfish &lt;i&gt;Pomacentrus amboinensis.&lt;/i&gt; Specifically, we tested whether the ability of these fish to discriminate complex facial patterns tracked categorical rather than metric differences in the stimuli. We first trained the fish to discriminate sets of two facial patterns. Next, we morphed between these patterns and determined the just noticeable difference (JND) between a morph and original image. Finally, we tested for CP by analyzing the discrimination ability of the fish for pairs of JND stimuli along the spectrum of morphs between two original images. Discrimination performance was significant for the image pair straddling the boundary between categories, and chance for equivalent stimulus pairs on either side, thus producing the classic “category boundary” effect. Our results reveal how perception can be influenced in a top‐down manner even in the absence of a visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Two decades ago Jack Pettigrew and I proposed the interhemispheric switch model of binocular rivalry and the sticky switch model of bipolar disorder. Here I describe the genesis, development, supporting data, and current status of these models. I also reflect on doing science with Pettigrew, his remarkable life in science, and how perspectives in science and medicine can fluctuate like the very phenomena on which we worked.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and medicine aim to identify verifiable and replicable truths. However, the paths to such truths are frequently characterized by swinging pendulums of opposing perspectives. This is especially so in human neuroscience and the brain‐based clinical sciences, where the target of investigation is the most complex of all biological systems. This article overviews a set of interrelated neuroscientific and clinical hypotheses, models, experiments, and predictions with which I have been involved for the last two decades. Traversing visual neuroscience, consciousness science, genetics, chronobiology, and biological and clinical psychiatry, the work illustrates how developments in science and medicine can occur through a combination of synthesis, serendipity, and experimentation. The article also reflects on doing science with the inimitable John “Jack” Pettigrew, and outlines how Pettigrew and I conceived, proposed, tested, and developed two new scientific models—one on neural mechanisms of binocular rivalry, the other on the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. I also provide an update on various aspects of our models and data, and describe lessons learned from Pettigrew on how perspectives in science exhibit their own fluctuations, ironically like the very phenomena on which we worked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This review in memoriam of Jack Pettigrew provides an overview of research into the phenomenon of perceptual rivalry, across a wide variety of species including insects, fish, reptiles, and primates. Perceptual rivalry is characterized by spontaneous alternations in perceptual state in response to ambiguous or conflicting sensory input. We highlight several interesting commonalities across species and use a comparative approach to better understand how the brain suppresses opposing sensory signals and generates alternations in perceptual dominance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review in memoriam of Jack Pettigrew provides an overview of past and current research into the phenomenon of multistable perception across multiple animal species. Multistable perception is characterized by two or more perceptual interpretations spontaneously alternating, or rivaling, when animals are exposed to stimuli with inherent sensory ambiguity. There is a wide array of ambiguous stimuli across sensory modalities, ranging from the configural changes observed in simple line drawings, such as the famous Necker cube, to the alternating perception of entire visual scenes that can be instigated by interocular conflict. The latter phenomenon, called binocular rivalry, in particular caught the attention of the late Jack Pettigrew, who combined his interest in the neuronal basis of perception with a unique comparative biological approach that considered ambiguous sensation as a fundamental problem of sensory systems that has shaped the brain throughout evolution. Here, we examine the research findings on visual perceptual alternation and suppression in a wide variety of species including insects, fish, reptiles, and primates. We highlight several interesting commonalities across species and behavioral indicators of perceptual alternation. In addition, we show how the comparative approach provides new avenues for understanding how the brain suppresses opposing sensory signals and generates alternations in perceptual dominance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Conditional and biased regeneration of cone photoreceptor types in the zebrafish retina&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/44e0864e-f0ac-47a9-a210-2502536e8bb7/cne24933-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regenerative capacity of the zebrafish, and the stereotypic organization of its retinal cell populations, enable examination of the specificity by which retinal Müller glial cells replace neurons that are lost. Zebrafish have four cone types, with peak sensitivities to red, green, blue, and ultraviolet wavelengths. Using a targeted cell ablation approach, we found that Müller glia produced cones of all types when all cones, red cones and UV cones were ablated. In contrast, blue cone ablation largely failed to generate cones. The relative proportions of regenerated cells of each type depended on the cone types that were ablated, and was biased toward the major cone type that was lost.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in regenerative medicine is replacing cells lost through injury or disease. While significant progress has been made, much remains unknown about the accuracy of native regenerative programs in cell replacement. Here, we capitalized on the regenerative capacity and stereotypic retinal organization of zebrafish to determine the specificity with which retinal Müller glial cells replace lost neuronal cell types. By utilizing a targeted genetic ablation technique, we restricted death to all or to distinct cone photoreceptor types (red, blue, or UV‐sensitive cones), enabling us to compare the composition of cones that are regenerated. We found that Müller glia produce cones of all types upon nondiscriminate ablation of these photoreceptors, or upon selective ablation of red or UV cones. Pan‐ablation of cones led to regeneration of the various cone types in relative abundances that resembled those of nonablated controls, that is, red &amp;gt; green &amp;gt; UV ~ blue cones. Moreover, selective loss of red or UV cones biased production toward the cone type that was ablated. In contrast, ablation of blue cones alone largely failed to induce cone production at all, although it did induce cell division in Müller glia. The failure to produce cones upon selective elimination of blue cones may be due to their low abundance compared to other cone types. Alternatively, it may be that blue cone death alone does not trigger a change in progenitor competency to support cone genesis. Our findings add to the growing notion that cell replacement during regeneration does not perfectly mimic programs of cell generation during development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: In search of common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and subplate</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;In search of common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and subplate&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1c125f53-aa84-4b09-8278-11227fa9b15b/cne24922-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarities in gene expression patterns prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity, and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Almost all of the markers we examined that were expressed in the subplate/Layer 6b were also expressed in the claustral complex, but not all claustrum specific or enriched genes were expressed in subplate/Layer 6b, suggesting overall similarities, but also some differences. There are numerous similarities between the adult connectivity patters of Layer 6b and claustrum. In particular, both have extensive cortical connections. However, there are differences in the relative strength of their reciprocal connectivity with various other structures in the adult. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human claustrum, a major hub of widespread neocortical connections, is a thin, bilateral sheet of gray matter located between the insular cortex and the striatum. The subplate is a largely transient cortical structure that contains some of the earliest generated neurons of the cerebral cortex and has important developmental functions to establish intra‐ and extracortical connections. In human and macaque some subplate cells undergo regulated cell death, but some remain as interstitial white matter cells. In mouse and rat brains a compact layer is formed, Layer 6b, and it remains underneath the cortex, adjacent to the white matter. Whether Layer 6b in rodents is homologous to primate subplate or interstitial white matter cells is still debated. Gene expression patterns, such as those of &lt;i&gt;Nurr1/Nr4a2&lt;/i&gt;, have suggested that the rodent subplate and the persistent subplate cells in Layer 6b and the claustrum might have similar origins. Moreover, the birthdates of the claustrum and Layer 6b are similarly precocious in mice. These observations prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity, and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Mapping mesoscale cortical connectivity in monkey sensorimotor cortex with optical imaging and microstimulation&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3dd6cc00-c558-4bb4-ad11-c94141bbbf6e/cne24918-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining intracortical electrical microstimulation (ICMS) with intrinsic optical imaging, we find that focal ICMS at single digit locations in monkey cortex (Areas 3a, 3b, 1, 2, and M1) reveals known anatomical connections. This novel method of studying cortical connections is in vivo, rapid, targeted, and mesoscale.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To map in vivo cortical circuitry at the mesoscale, we applied a novel approach to map interareal functional connectivity. Electrical intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in conjunction with optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OIS) was used map functional connections in somatosensory cortical areas in anesthetized squirrel monkeys. ICMS produced activations that were focal and that displayed responses which were stimulation intensity dependent. ICMS in supragranular layers of Brodmann Areas 3b, 1, 2, 3a, and M1 evoked interareal activation patterns that were topographically appropriate and appeared consistent with known anatomical connectivity. Specifically, ICMS revealed Area 3b connections with Area 1; Area 1 connections with Areas 2 and 3a; Area 2 connections with Areas 1, 3a, and M1; Area 3a connections with Areas M1, 1, and 2; and M1 connections with Areas 3a, 1, and 2. These somatosensory connectivity patterns were reminiscent of feedforward patterns observed anatomically, although feedback contributions are also likely present. Further consistent with anatomical connectivity, intra‐areal and intra‐areal patterns of activation were patchy with patch sizes of 200–300 μm. In summary, ICMS with OIS is a novel approach for mapping interareal and intra‐areal connections in vivo. Comparisons with feedforward and feedback anatomical connectivity are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Retinal topography and spectral sensitivity of the Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni)</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Retinal topography and spectral sensitivity of the Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/aecfa197-2730-4367-a5b8-e0c2c3d41093/cne24911-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Histological sections and electroretinography suggest the presence of a heavily rod dominated (and possibly rod‐only) retina in Port Jackson sharks. Mapping of the distribution of retinal neurons reveals a specialisation for higher visual acuity in a narrow horizontal band that corresponds to the part of the visual field covering the water‐substrate interface. Such a specialized retina would be well‐adapted to low‐light (scotopic) vision and a benthic lifestyle, and may assist the shark in finding food and avoiding predators.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated the visual system of the Port Jackson shark &lt;i&gt;Heterodontus portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt;, a shallow‐dwelling benthic species and generalist predator endemic to the temperate coastal waters around southern Australia. Measurements of retinal spectral sensitivity in juvenile sharks, made using single flash and heterochromatic flicker photometry under conditions of dark‐ or light‐adaptation, indicated a peak sensitivity at around 500 nm, with no evidence of a spectral shift with increasing levels of light adaptation. Histological sections of the retina revealed a heavily rod dominated retina containing only a few small cell profiles in the photoreceptor layer that might represent a sparse cone population or may be immature rods. Assessment of retinal topography in juvenile sharks indicated the presence of a distinct specialisation for increased visual spatial acuity in the form of a horizontal streak of higher rod photoreceptor (~80,000 rods mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) and ganglion cell (~1,800 cells mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) densities across the horizontal meridian of the eye. This specialization would be adaptive for panoramic sampling of the part of the visual field corresponding to the substrate‐water interface and remove the need for &lt;i&gt;H. portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt; to move its eyes extensively when resting on the sea floor. The estimated upper limit of spatial resolving power in juvenile &lt;i&gt;H. portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt; was 3.14 cycles deg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is at the lower end of values measured in elasmobranchs. Taken together, these results suggest that the retina of &lt;i&gt;H. portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt; is well adapted for nocturnal vision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Human brain neurons express a novel splice variant of excitatory amino acid transporter 5 (hEAAT5v)</title>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Human brain neurons express a novel splice variant of excitatory amino acid transporter 5 (hEAAT5v)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a32caef7-64b5-43d5-8395-3ebb1c600fe6/cne24907-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternately spliced human EAAT5 (hEAAT5v) which contains an additional intron after exon 7 of normally spliced human EAAT5 (7‐int) was cloned from human brain. Immunocytochemistry reveals expression of this protein in apical (A) and basal (B) dendrites and axons (Ax) of human cortical pyramidal neurons. The protein is also expressed by GABAergic neurons including Purkinje cells. It plausibly functions as a glutamate‐gated chloride conductance rather than as a glutamate transporter.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excitatory amino acid transporter 5 (EAAT5) is a protein that is known to be alternately spliced and to be abundantly expressed in the retina by populations of neurons including photoreceptors and bipolar cells. EAAT5 acts as a slow glutamate transporter and also as glutamate‐gated chloride channel, the chloride conductance being large enough for EAAT5 to serve functionally as an “inhibitory” glutamate receptor. However, there has been a long‐standing view that the classically spliced form of EAAT5 is not abundant or widespread in the brain and so it has not been extensively investigated in the literature. We recently identified a human‐specific splicing form of EAAT5 that was not expressed by rodents but was shown to be a functional glutamate transporter. We have examined the expression of this form of EAAT5, hEAAT5v at the mRNA, and protein level in human brain, and show that populations of human cortical pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells show significant expression of hEAAT5v. Accordingly, we infer that EAAT5 may well be a player in modulating neuronal function in the human brain and propose that its localization in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons could be compatible with a role in influencing intracellular chloride and thereby neuronal parameters such as membrane potential rather than acting as a presynaptic glutamate transporter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Retinal topography in two species of flamingo (Phoenicopteriformes: Phoenicopteridae)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/45845787-d549-45ca-bb17-973ee6e5cc67/cne24902-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated eye morphology and retinal topography in Caribbean and Chilean flamingos. Both species have a well‐defined visual streak, with the peak retinal ganglion cell densities located in a small central area. The organization of the visual system in these birds reflects their cathemeral activity pattern and the physical nature of the habitats in which they live.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we assessed eye morphology and retinal topography in two flamingo species, the Caribbean flamingo (&lt;i&gt;Phoenicopterus ruber&lt;/i&gt;) and the Chilean flamingo (&lt;i&gt;P. chilensis&lt;/i&gt;). Eye morphology is similar in both species and cornea size relative to eye size (C:A ratio) is intermediate between those previously reported for diurnal and nocturnal birds. Using stereology and retinal whole mounts, we estimate that the total number of Nissl‐stained neurons in the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer in the Caribbean and Chilean flamingo is ~1.70 and 1.38 million, respectively. Both species have a well‐defined visual streak with a peak neuron density of between 13,000 and 16,000 cells mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; located in a small central &lt;i&gt;area&lt;/i&gt;. Neurons in the high‐density regions are smaller and more homogeneous compared to those in medium‐ and low‐density regions. Peak anatomical spatial resolving power in both species is approximately 10–11 cycles/deg. &lt;i&gt;En‐face&lt;/i&gt; images of the fundus in live Caribbean flamingos acquired using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD‐OCT) revealed a thin, dark band running nasotemporally just dorsal to the pecten, which aligned with the visual streak in the retinal topography maps. Cross‐sectional images (B‐scans) obtained with SD‐OCT showed that this dark band corresponds with an area of retinal thickening compared to adjacent areas. Neither the retinal whole mounts, nor the SD‐OCT imaging revealed any evidence of a central fovea in either species. Overall, we suggest that eye morphology and retinal topography in flamingos reflects their cathemeral activity pattern and the physical nature of the habitats in which they live.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Jack Pettigrew was a pioneer in his approach to understanding sensory systems in birds. Here, we review his seminal research on owls as well as more recent studies aimed at understanding the evolution of sensory specializations in hummingbirds and tactile‐feeding species. We also review Pettigrew's work on two unusual, and rarely studied, Australian bird species that exhibit unique auditory and visual specializations in order to occupy their unique niches. Overall, we conclude that a comparative approach can yield unique insights into sensory system function in birds, as well as other vertebrates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Diversity” is an apt descriptor of the research career of Jack Pettigrew as it ranged from the study of trees, to clinical conditions, to sensory neuroscience. Within sensory neuroscience, he was fascinated by the evolution of sensory systems across species. Here, we review some of his work on avian sensory specialists and research that he inspired in others. We begin with an overview of the importance of the Wulst in stereopsis and the need for further study of the Wulst in relation to binocularity across avian species. Next, we summarize recent anatomical, behavioral, and physiological studies on optic flow specializations in hummingbirds. Beyond vision, we discuss the first evidence of a tactile “fovea” in birds and how this led to detailed studies of tactile specializations in waterfowl and sensorimotor systems in parrots. We then describe preliminary studies by Pettigrew of two endemic Australian species, the plains‐wanderer (&lt;i&gt;Pedionomus torquatus&lt;/i&gt;) and letter‐winged kite (&lt;i&gt;Elanus scriptus&lt;/i&gt;), that suggest the evolution of some unique auditory and visual specializations in relation to their unique behavior and ecology. Finally, we conclude by emphasizing the importance of a comparative and integrative approach to understanding avian sensory systems and provide an example of one system that has yet to be properly examined: tactile facial bristles in birds. Through reviewing this research and offering future avenues for discovery, we hope that others also embrace the comparative approach to understanding sensory system evolution in birds and other vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Adult hippocampal neurogenesis in Egyptian fruit bats from three different environments: Are interpretational variations due to the environment or methodology?&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1a9aefde-b6b9-4fe8-ac92-e7cf7f9a8a8d/cne24895-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using immunohistochemical and quantitative methods, we examined adult hippocampal neurogenesis in wild‐caught and captive‐bred Egyptian fruit bats. We find that the effect of the environment on this process is more method dependent than environment dependent, requiring a reassessment of how we interpret differences in the process of adult hippocampal neurogenesis between environments and species. This image shows doublecortin immunostained immature neurons in the dentate gyrus of an Egyptian fruit bat captured in the subtropical woodlands of South Africa.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We quantified both proliferative (Ki‐67 immunohistochemistry) and immature (doublecortin immunohistochemistry) cells within the dentate gyrus of adult Egyptian fruit bats from three distinct environments: (a) primary rainforest, (b) subtropical woodland, and (c) fifth‐generation captive‐bred. We used four different previously reported methods to assess the effect of the environment on proliferative and immature cells: (a) the comparison of raw totals of proliferative and immature cells; (b) these totals standardized to brain mass; (c) these totals expressed as a density using the volume of the granular cell layer (GCLv) for standardization; and (d) these totals expressed as a percentage of the total number of granule cells. For all methods, the numbers of proliferative cells did not differ statistically among the three groups, indicating that the rate of proliferation, while malleable to experimental manipulation or transiently in response to events of importance in the natural habitat, appears to occur, for the most part, at a predetermined rate within a species. For the immature cells, raw numbers and standardizations to brain mass and GCLv revealed no difference between the three groups studied; however, standardization to total granule cell numbers indicated that the two groups of wild‐caught bats had significantly higher numbers of immature neurons than the captive‐bred bats. These contrasting results indicate that the interpretation of the effect of the environment on the numbers of immature neurons appears method dependent. It is possible that current methods are not sensitive enough to reveal the effect of different environments on proliferative and immature cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for parvalbumin reveals the presence of large, multipolar, white matter interstitial cells (white matter neurons) in the subcortical white matter of the telencephalon of the Egyptian fruit bat.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large population of infracortical white matter neurons, or white matter interstitial cells (WMICs), are found within the subcortical white matter of the mammalian telencephalon. We examined WMICs in three species of megachiropterans, &lt;i&gt;Megaloglossus woermanni&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Casinycteris argynnis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Rousettus aegyptiacus&lt;/i&gt;, using immunohistochemical and stereological techniques. Immunostaining for neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN) revealed substantial numbers of WMICs in each species—&lt;i&gt;M. woermanni&lt;/i&gt; 124,496 WMICs, &lt;i&gt;C. argynnis&lt;/i&gt; 138,458 WMICs, and the larger brained &lt;i&gt;R. aegyptiacus&lt;/i&gt; having an estimated WMIC population of 360,503. To examine the range of inhibitory neurochemical types we used antibodies against parvalbumin, calbindin, calretinin, and neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). The calbindin and nNOS immunostained neurons were the most commonly observed, while those immunoreactive for calretinin and parvalbumin were sparse. The proportion of WMICs exhibiting inhibitory neurochemical profiles was ~26%, similar to that observed in previously studied primates. While for the most part the WMIC population in the megachiropterans studied was similar to that observed in other mammals, the one feature that differed was the high proportion of WMICs immunoreactive to calbindin, whereas in primates (macaque monkey, lar gibbon and human) the highest proportion of inhibitory WMICs contain calretinin. Interestingly, there appears to be an allometric scaling of WMIC numbers with brain mass. Further quantitative comparative work across more mammalian species will reveal the developmental and evolutionary trends associated with this infrequently studied neuronal population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neural coding of action in three dimensions: Task‐ and time‐invariant reference frames for visuospatial and motor‐related activity in parietal area V6A&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/22dc559f-a068-4179-a8f7-b77c70bc8216/cne24889-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visually guided action requires integrating information from multiple sources and encoding flexible action representations. We look at objects that we might reach, but also use them as a cue to act in another spatial location. This research article examines the sensorimotor transformations in parietal cortex occurring when we perform various actions in three‐dimensional space.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goal‐directed movements involve a series of neural computations that compare the sensory representations of goal location and effector position, and transform these into motor commands. Neurons in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) control several effectors (e.g., eye, hand, foot) and encode goal location in a variety of spatial coordinate systems, including those anchored to gaze direction, and to the positions of the head, shoulder, or hand. However, there is little evidence on whether reference frames depend also on the effector and/or type of motor response. We addressed this issue in macaque PPC area V6A, where previous reports using a fixate‐to‐reach in depth task, from different starting arm positions, indicated that most units use mixed body/hand‐centered coordinates. Here, we applied singular value decomposition and gradient analyses to characterize the reference frames in V6A while the animals, instead of arm reaching, performed a nonspatial motor response (hand lift). We found that most neurons used mixed body/hand coordinates, instead of “pure” body‐, or hand‐centered coordinates. During the task progress the effect of hand position on activity became stronger compared to target location. Activity consistent with body‐centered coding was present only in a subset of neurons active early in the task. Applying the same analyses to a population of V6A neurons recorded during the fixate‐to‐reach task yielded similar results. These findings suggest that V6A neurons use consistent reference frames between spatial and nonspatial motor responses, a functional property that may allow the integration of spatial awareness and movement control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;The postnatal development of MT, V1, LGN, pulvinar and SC in prosimian galagos (Otolemur garnettii)&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6c96d210-f11b-4683-9715-04c448be4335/cne24885-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle temporal visual area (MT) is revealed by parvalbumin immunoreactivity in early development (P3) of galagos, suggesting that MT resembles the primary sensory areas by developing early, and the early development of MT may influence the subsequent development of dorsal stream visual areas.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considerable evidence supports the premise that the visual system of primates develops hierarchically, with primary visual cortex developing structurally and functionally first, thereby influencing the subsequent development of higher cortical areas. An apparent exception is the higher order middle temporal visual area (MT), which appears to be histologically distinct near the time of birth in marmosets. Here we used a number of histological and immunohistological markers to evaluate the maturation of cortical and subcortical components of the visual system in galagos ranging from newborns to adults. Galagos are representative of the large strepsirrhine branch of primate evolution, and studies of these primates help identify brain features that are broadly similar across primate taxa. The histological results support the view that MT is functional at or near the time of birth, as is primary visual cortex. Likewise, the superior colliculus, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, and the posterior nucleus of the pulvinar are well‐developed by birth. Thus, these subcortical structures likely provide visual information directly or indirectly to cortex in newborn galagos. We conclude that MT resembles a primary sensory area by developing early, and that the early development of MT may influence the subsequent development of dorsal stream visual areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The passing of Jack Pettigrew (University of Queensland) and Bogdan Dreher (University of Sydney) within 2 weeks of each other in May 2019 provided the catalyst for documenting the roles that they and their colleagues from the Peter Bishop School played in establishing vision research as a major strength in Australian neuroscience in the second half of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Visualizing the dopaminergic innervation and myelinated dorsal arcopallium tract, we showed that the avian analogue to the prefrontal cortex (PFC), known as the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), adheres to a species‐specific variation. The NCL in pigeon and chicken is best described as a semilunar structure in the dorsolateral part of the caudal nidopallium. The NCL in carrion crow and zebra finch consists of at least three subareas (NCM, NCLd, and NCLv) that span across the entire back of the caudal forebrain.

&lt;p&gt;Despite the long, separate evolutionary history of birds and mammals, both lineages developed a rich behavioral repertoire of remarkably similar executive control generated by distinctly different brains. The seat for executive functioning in birds is the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) and the mammalian equivalent is known as the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Both are densely innervated by dopaminergic fibers, and are an integration center of sensory input and motor output. Whereas the variation of the PFC has been well documented in different mammalian orders, we know very little about the NCL across the avian clade. In order to investigate whether this structure adheres to species‐specific variations, this study aimed to describe the trajectory of the NCL in pigeon, chicken, carrion crow and zebra finch. We employed immunohistochemistry to map dopaminergic innervation, and executed a Gallyas stain to visualize the dorsal arcopallial tract that runs between the NCL and the arcopallium. Our analysis showed that whereas the trajectory of the NCL in the chicken is highly comparable to the pigeon, the two Passeriformes show a strikingly different pattern. In both carrion crow and zebra finch, we identified four different subareas of high dopaminergic innervation that span the entire caudal forebrain. Based on their sensory input, motor output, and involvement in dopamine‐related cognitive control of the delineated areas here, we propose that at least three morphologically different subareas constitute the NCL in these songbirds. Thus, our study shows that comparable to the PFC in mammals, the NCL in birds varies considerably across species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Hippocampus: Recurrent amplification of grid‐cell activity</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23254?af=R</guid>

	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High‐level cognitive abilities such as navigation and spatial memory are thought to rely on the activity of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), which encode the animal's position in space with periodic triangular patterns. Yet the neural mechanisms that underlie grid‐cell activity are still unknown. Recent in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that grid cells are embedded in highly structured recurrent networks. But how could recurrent connectivity become structured during development? And what is the functional role of these connections? With mathematical modeling and simulations, we show that recurrent circuits in the MEC could emerge under the supervision of weakly grid‐tuned feedforward inputs. We demonstrate that a learned excitatory connectivity could amplify grid patterns when the feedforward sensory inputs are available and sustain attractor states when the sensory cues are lost. Finally, we propose a Fourier‐based measure to quantify the spatial periodicity of grid patterns: the grid‐tuning index.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Absence of Neuronal Autoantibodies in Neuropsychiatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25908?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25908?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to characterise both neuronal autoantibodies and levels of interferon α, two proposed causative agents in neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from 35 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 15 with NPSLE) showed no antibodies against natively expressed N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDARs), or the surface of live hippocampal neurons. By comparison to controls (n = 104), patients with SLE had antibodies that bound to a peptide representing the extracellular domain of NMDARs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), however, binding was retained against both rearranged peptides and no peptide (r = 0.85 and r = 0.79, respectively, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). In summary, neuronal‐surface reactive antibodies were not detected in NPSLE. Further, while interferon α levels were higher in SLE (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), they lacked specificity for NPSLE. Our findings mandate a search for novel biomarkers in this condition.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Hypersensitivity to Calcitonin Gene–Related Peptide in Post‐Traumatic Headache</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25915?af=R</guid>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25915?af=R</link>
	<description>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate that calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) induces headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features in patients with persistent post‐traumatic headache (PTH) attributed to mild traumatic brain injury (TBI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, two‐way crossover study was conducted. Analyses were intention‐to‐treat. Eligible patients were aged 18 to 65 years and had a history of persistent PTH after mild TBI for at least 12 months. Patients were randomized to receive an intravenous infusion of 1.5μg/min of CGRP or placebo (isotonic saline) over 20 minutes on two separate experimental days. A 12‐hour observational period was used to evaluate the following outcomes: (1) difference in incidence of headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features and (2) difference in area under the curve for headache intensity scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty patients (mean age = 37 years, 25 women [83%]) were randomized and completed the study. During the 12‐hour observational period, 21 of 30 patients (70%) developed headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features after CGRP, compared with 6 patients (20%) after placebo (&lt;i&gt;p &amp;lt;&lt;/i&gt; 0.001). The baseline‐corrected area under the curve for headache intensity scores was significantly larger after CGRP, compared with placebo (&lt;i&gt;p &amp;lt;&lt;/i&gt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with persistent PTH are hypersensitive to CGRP, which underscores its pathophysiological importance. Furthermore, CGRP‐targeted therapies might provide a novel mechanism‐based treatment option for patients with persistent PTH. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Two Distinct Populations of α1α6-Containing GABAA-Receptors in Rat Cerebellum</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.591129</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.591129</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;GABAA receptors are pentameric GABA-gated chloride channels. The existence of 19 different subunits (six α, three β, three γ, δ, ε, θ, π, and three ρ) in mammalian systems gives rise to an enormous theoretical diversity of GABAA receptor subtypes with distinct subunit composition and unique pharmacological properties. These receptors are already now the drug targets of several clinically used compounds, such as benzodiazepines, anesthetics, and many more. There is a constant quest to identify novel molecules and possible future drug targets: Currently, α6-containing GABAA receptors are being discussed in the context of treating sensorimotor gating deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as tic disorders and schizophrenia. Therefore, we aim to learn more about α6-containing GABAA receptors. They are mostly expressed in the cerebellar granule cell layer, where they form the following subtypes: α6βxγ2, α1α6βxγ2, α6βxδ, and α1α6βxδ. In former studies, α1α6βxγ2-containing GABAA receptors were considered a single receptor population. In the current study, we investigate the possibility, that this population can consist of two subgroups with alternative arrangements depending if α1 neighbors γ2 (forming a “diazepam-sensitive” receptor), or if α6 neighbors γ2 (forming a “diazepam-insensitive” receptor) and aimed to prove the existence of both subtypes in native tissue. We performed immunoprecipitation experiments on rat cerebellar lysates using α1- or α6 subunit-specific antibodies followed by radioligand binding assays with either &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H-flunitrazepam or &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H-Ro 15-4513. Indeed, we were able to prove the existence of two distinct populations of α1α6-containing GABAA-receptors and could quantify the different receptor populations: α1βxγ2 receptors constitute approximately 60% of all γ2-containing receptors in the rat cerebellum, α6βxγ2 about 20%, and both isoforms of α1α6βxγ2 9–15% each. The simple classification of GABAA-receptors into αx-containing subtypes seems not to reflect the complexity of nature; those receptors are more diverse than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: P2X7 Receptor Upregulation in Huntington’s Disease Brains</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a fatal degenerative disorder affecting the nervous system. It is characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric dysfunctions, with a late onset and an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. HD-causing mutation consists in an expansion of repeated CAG triplets in the huntingtin gene (HTT), encoding for an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch in the huntingtin protein (htt). The mutation causes neuronal dysfunction and loss through multiple mechanisms, affecting both the nucleus and cytoplasm. P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) emerged as a major player in neuroinflammation, since ATP – its endogenous ligand – is massively released under this condition. Indeed, P2X7R stimulation in the central nervous system (CNS) is known to enhance the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from microglia and of neurotransmitters from neuronal presynaptic terminals, as well as to promote apoptosis. Previous experiments performed with neurons expressing the mutant huntingtin and exploiting HD mouse models demonstrated a role of P2X7R in HD. On the basis of those results, here, we explore for the first time the status of P2X7R in HD patients’ brain. We report that in HD postmortem striatum, as earlier observed in HD mice, the protein levels of the full-length form of P2X7R, also named P2X7R-A, are upregulated. In addition, the exclusively human naturally occurring variant lacking the C-terminus region, P2X7R-B, is upregulated as well. As we show here, this augmented protein levels can be explained by elevated mRNA levels. Furthermore, in HD patients’ striatum, P2X7R shows not only an augmented total transcript level but also an alteration of its splicing. Remarkably, P2X7R introns 10 and 11 are more retained in HD patients when compared with controls. Taken together, our data confirm that P2X7R is altered in brains of HD subjects and strengthen the notion that P2X7R may represent a potential therapeutic target for HD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Kinase Domain Is a Dynamic Hub for Driving LRRK2 Allostery</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.538219</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Protein kinases and GTPases are the two major molecular switches that regulate much of biology, and both of these domains are embedded within the large multi-domain Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2). Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common cause of familial Parkinson’s disease (PD) and are also implicated in Crohn’s disease. The recent Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) structure of the four C-terminal domains [ROC COR KIN WD40 (RCKW)] of LRRK2 includes both of the catalytic domains. Although the important allosteric N-terminal domains are missing in the Cryo-EM structure this structure allows us to not only explore the conserved features of the kinase domain, which is trapped in an inactive and open conformation but also to observe the direct allosteric cross-talk between the two domains. To define the unique features of the kinase domain and to better understand the dynamic switch mechanism that allows LRRK2 to toggle between its inactive and active conformations, we have compared the LRRK2 kinase domain to Src, BRaf, and PKA. We also compare and contrast the two canonical glycine-rich loop motifs in LRRK2 that anchor the nucleotide: the G-Loop in protein kinases that anchors ATP and the P-Loop in GTPases that anchors GTP. The RCKW structure also provides a template for the cross-talk between the kinase and GTPase domains and brings new mechanistic insights into the physiological function of LRRK2 and how the kinase domain, along with key phosphorylation sites, can serve as an allosteric hub for mediating conformational changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: What’s That (Blue) Spot on my MRI? Multimodal Neuroimaging of the Locus Coeruleus in Neurodegenerative Disease</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.583421</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The locus coeruleus (LC) has long been underappreciated for its role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and other neurodegenerative disorders. While AD and PD are distinct in clinical presentation, both are characterized by prodromal protein aggregation in the LC, late-stage degeneration of the LC, and comorbid conditions indicative of LC dysfunction. Many of these early studies were limited to post-mortem histological techniques due to the LC’s small size and location deep in the brainstem. Thus, there is a growing interest in utilizing in vivo imaging of the LC as a predictor of preclinical neurodegenerative processes and biomarker of disease progression. Simultaneously, neuroimaging in animal models of neurodegenerative disease holds promise for identifying early alterations to LC circuits, but has thus far been underutilized. While still in its infancy, a handful of studies have reported effects of single gene mutations and pathology on LC function in disease using various neuroimaging techniques. Furthermore, combining imaging and optogenetics or chemogenetics allows for interrogation of network connectivity in response to changes in LC activity. The purpose of this article is twofold: (1) to review what magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have revealed about LC dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease and its potential as a biomarker in humans, and (2) to explore how animal models can be used to test hypotheses derived from clinical data and establish a mechanistic framework to inform LC-focused therapeutic interventions to alleviate symptoms and impede disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Specific Frequency Electroacupuncture Stimulation Transiently Enhances the Permeability of the Blood-Brain Barrier and Induces Tight Junction Changes</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays an important role in both the physiological state and pharmacological state of the brain. Transiently enhancing the permeability of the BBB may allow the use of more types of medications for neuropsychiatric diseases. Our previous research revealed that electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation at certain parameters can enhance the permeability of the BBB in Sprague-Dawley rats, but this phenomenon is not well characterized. We propose that specific frequency EA can transiently open the BBB and may be related to the change of tight junctions (TJ). To find the best EA frequency among commonly used frequencies, preliminarily explore the mechanism, we detected BBB permeability by measuring the intensity of Evans Blue and 20 kDa FITC-dextran fluorescence in the cerebral cortex. Then, we used a laser spectrometer, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy to detect the mechanism of BBB opening. Finally, measured brain water content, AQP4, GFAP, Iba1, and used the DeadEnd&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; Fluorometric TUNEL System to clear whether the stimulation caused obvious negative effects. The results show that EA stimulation at 2/100 Hz maximally increased BBB permeability, and the BBB closed within 12 h after EA stimulation was removed. EA stimulation increased blood perfusion, c-fos levels, and Substance P expression in the cerebral cortex, decreased ZO-1 and occludin levels and induced ultrastructural changes in TJ morphology. EA stimulation at specific parameters did not cause brain edema, activation of glial cells, or cell apoptosis. This study shows that EA stimulation induces a reversible, frequency-dependent alteration of BBB permeability and proposes a hypothetical mechanism of BBB opening related to vasodilation and TJ disruption. Transiently enhancing the permeability of the BBB with EA at specific parameters may be a new strategies for delivering therapeutics to the central nervous system. Further study of this technology is needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Interaction of Alpha-Synuclein With Lipids: Mitochondrial Cardiolipin as a Critical Player in the Pathogenesis of Parkinson’s Disease</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Alpha-Synuclein (α-Syn) is a central protein in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, a group of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although its role in neurotransmission is well established, the precise role of this protein in disease pathogenesis is still not fully understood. It is, however, widely regarded to be associated with the misfolding and accumulation of toxic intracellular aggregates. In fact, α-Syn is the most abundant protein component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are also characterized by a high lipid content. Lipids, the main constituents of cellular membranes, have been implicated in many aspects of PD-related processes. α-Syn interacts with membrane phospholipids and free fatty acids via its N-terminal domain, and altered lipid-protein complexes might enhance both its binding to synaptic and mitochondrial membranes and its oligomerization. Several studies have highlighted a specific interaction of α-Syn with the phospholipid cardiolipin (CL), a major constituent of mitochondrial membranes. By interacting with CL, α-Syn is able to disrupt mitochondrial membrane integrity, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, externalized CL is able to facilitate the refolding of toxic α-Syn species at the outer mitochondrial membrane. In this review, we discuss how α-Syn/lipid interactions, in particular the α-Syn/CL interaction at the mitochondrial membrane, may affect α-Syn aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction and may thus represent an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Effects of Dopamine on the Immature Neurons of the Adult Rat Piriform Cortex</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.574234</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The layer II of the adult piriform cortex (PCX) contains a numerous population of immature neurons. Interestingly, in both mice and rats, most, if not all, these cells have an embryonic origin. Moreover, recent studies from our laboratory have shown that they progressively mature into typical excitatory neurons of the PCX layer II. Therefore, the adult PCX is considered a “non-canonical” neurogenic niche. These immature neurons express the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), a molecule critical for different neurodevelopmental processes. Dopamine (DA) is a relevant neurotransmitter in the adult CNS, which also plays important roles in neural development and adult plasticity, including the regulation of PSA-NCAM expression. In order to evaluate the hypothetical effects of pharmacological modulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission on the differentiation of immature neurons of the adult PCX, we studied dopamine D2 receptor (D2r) expression in this region and the relationship between dopaminergic fibers and immature neurons (defined by PSA-NCAM expression). In addition, we analyzed the density of immature neurons after chronic treatments with an antagonist and an agonist of D2r: haloperidol and PPHT, respectively. Many dopaminergic fibers were observed in close apposition to PSA-NCAM-expressing neurons, which also coexpressed D2r. Chronic treatment with haloperidol significantly increased the number of PSA-NCAM immunoreactive cells, while PPHT treatment decreased it. These results indicate a prominent role of dopamine, through D2r and PSA-NCAM, on the regulation of the final steps of development of immature neurons in the adult PCX.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Gangliosides in the Brain: Physiology, Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Applications</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Gangliosides are glycosphingolipids highly abundant in the nervous system, and carry most of the sialic acid residues in the brain. Gangliosides are enriched in cell membrane microdomains (“lipid rafts”) and play important roles in the modulation of membrane proteins and ion channels, in cell signaling and in the communication among cells. The importance of gangliosides in the brain is highlighted by the fact that loss of function mutations in ganglioside biosynthetic enzymes result in severe neurodegenerative disorders, often characterized by very early or childhood onset. In addition, changes in the ganglioside profile (i.e., in the relative abundance of specific gangliosides) were reported in healthy aging and in common neurological conditions, including Huntington’s disease (HD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. At least in HD, PD and in some forms of epilepsy, experimental evidence strongly suggests a potential role of gangliosides in disease pathogenesis and potential treatment. In this review, we will summarize ganglioside functions that are crucial to maintain brain health, we will review changes in ganglioside levels that occur in major neurological conditions and we will discuss their contribution to cellular dysfunctions and disease pathogenesis. Finally, we will review evidence of the beneficial roles exerted by gangliosides, GM1 in particular, in disease models and in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: The Function of the NMDA Receptor in Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is one of the main forms of neonatal brain injury which could lead to neonatal disability or even cause neonatal death. Therefore, HIE strongly affects the health of newborns and brings heavy burden to the family and society. It has been well studied that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are involved in the excitotoxicity induced by hypoxia ischemia in adult brain. Recently, it has been shown that the NMDA receptor also plays important roles in HIE. In the present review, we made a summary of the molecular mechanism of NMDA receptor in the pathological process of HIE, focusing on the distinct role of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor subtypes and aiming to provide some insights into the clinical treatment and drug development of HIE.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Novel Porcine Retina Cultivation Techniques Provide Improved Photoreceptor Preservation</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in industrialized countries among people over 60 years. It has multiple triggers and risk factors, but despite intense research efforts, its pathomechanisms are currently not completely understood. AMD pathogenesis is characterized by soft drusen in Bruch’s membrane and involves the retinal pigment epithelium–Bruch’s membrane-choroid complex and adjacent structures, like photoreceptors. This study explores the potential of novel cultivation techniques to preserve photoreceptors in retinal explants to gain better insights in AMD pathology. The porcine retina explants were cultured for 4 and 8 days using three different explantation techniques, namely, control (photoreceptors facing down, touching the filter), filter (photoreceptors facing up, turned sample using a filter), and tweezers (photoreceptors facing up, turned sample using tweezers). Optical coherence tomography revealed that the tweezers method had the best capacity to limit thinning of the retinal explants. Both novel methods displayed advantages in maintaining outer segment thickness. Additionally, immunofluorescence evaluation revealed a better preservation of opsin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells and rhodopsin signal intensity in both novel methods, especially the tweezers method. Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated an upregulation of OPSIN and RHODOPSIN mRNA expression in tweezers samples at 8 days. Amacrine and bipolar cell numbers were not altered at day 4 of cultivation, while cultivation until 8 days led to reduced bipolar cell numbers. At 4 days, CALRETININ mRNA was upregulated in filter samples, but protein kinase C alpha expression was downregulated. Retinal ganglion cells were diminished in both novel techniques due to a direct physical contact with the insert. Remarkably, no difference in TUBB3 mRNA expression was detected among the techniques. Nevertheless, both novel methods exhibited an improved retention of photoreceptor cells. In conclusion, the tweezers technique was the most promising one. Due to the high homology of the porcine to the human retina, it provides a reasonable alternative to in vivo rodent models. Consequently, an adapted coculture system based on the current findings may serve as an ex vivo model suitable to analyze AMD pathomechanisms and novel therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Dynamic Alterations of Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations in Patients With Drug-Naïve First-Episode Early Onset Schizophrenia</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00901</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Abnormalities in static neural activity have been widely reported in early onset schizophrenia (EOS). However, dynamic brain activity alterations over time in EOS are unclear. Here, we investigated whether temporal dynamic changes in spontaneous neural activity are influenced by EOS. A total of 78 drug-naïve first-episode patients with EOS and 90 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF) was performed to examine the abnormal time-varying local neural activity in EOS. Furthermore, we investigated the relationships between abnormalities in dALFF variability and clinical characteristics in EOS patients. Compared to HCs, EOS patients showed significantly decreased dALFF variability in the bilateral precuneus, right superior marginal gyrus, right post-central gyrus and increased dALFF in the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Moreover, increased dALFF variability in MTG was negatively associated with negative symptoms in EOS. Our findings reveal increased dynamic local neural activity in higher order networks of the cortex, suggesting that enhanced spontaneous brain activity may be a predominant neural marker for brain maturation. In addition, decreased dALFF variability in the default mode network (DMN) and limbic system may reflect unusually dynamic neural activity. This dysfunctional brain activity could distinguish between patients and HCs and deepen our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of EOS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Contraction Phase and Force Differentially Change Motor Evoked Potential Recruitment Slope and Interhemispheric Inhibition in Young Versus Old</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.581008</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.581008</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Interhemispheric interactions are important for arm coordination and hemispheric specialization. Unilateral voluntary static contraction is known to increase bilateral corticospinal motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude. It is unknown how increasing and decreasing contraction affect the opposite limb. Since dynamic muscle contraction is more ecologically relevant to daily activities, we studied MEP recruitment using a novel method and short interval interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) from active to resting hemisphere at 4 phases of contralateral ECR contraction: Rest, Ramp Up [increasing at 25% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)], Execution (tonic at 50% MVC), and Ramp Down (relaxation at 25% MVC) in 42 healthy adults. We analyzed the linear portion of resting extensor carpi radialis (ECR) MEP recruitment by stimulating at multiple intensities and comparing slopes, expressed as mV per TMS stimulation level, via linear mixed modeling. In younger participants (age ≤ 30), resting ECR MEP recruitment slopes were significantly and equally larger both at Ramp Up (slope increase = 0.047, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and Ramp Down (slope increase = 0.031, p &amp;lt; 0.001) compared to rest, despite opposite directions of force change. In contrast, Active ECR MEP recruitment slopes were larger in Ramp Down than all other phases (Rest:0.184, p &amp;lt; 0.001; Ramp Up:0.128, p = 0.001; Execution: p = 0.003). Older (age ≥ 60) participants’ resting MEP recruitment slope was higher than younger participants across all phases. IHI did not reduce MEP recruitment slope equally in old compared to young. In conclusion, our data indicate that MEP recruitment slope in the resting limb is affected by the homologous active limb contraction force, irrespective of the direction of force change. The active arm MEP recruitment slope, in contrast, remains relatively unaffected. Older participants had steeper MEP recruitment slopes and less interhemispheric inhibition compared to younger participants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Does Cardiorespiratory Fitness Influence the Effect of Acute Aerobic Exercise on Executive Function?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.569010</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.569010</link>
	<description>Background&lt;p&gt;The beneficial effects of acute exercise on executive function have been well-documented, but the influence of cardiorespiratory fitness on this effect requires further investigations, especially using imaging technique. This study aimed to examine the effects of cardiorespiratory fitness on acute exercise-induced changes on behavioral performance and on functional brain activation.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;Based on their cardiorespiratory fitness level, 62 participants ranked in the top and bottom of the maximum oxygen consumption (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max) were finally selected and allocated to high-fit group or low-fit group. Both groups were asked to complete the Stroop task after 30 min of aerobic exercise and chair-seated rest (control session). Among them, 26 participants were randomly selected and asked to undergo the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Behavioral results showed that individuals responded significantly faster after exercise than those in the control session. The fMRI results revealed a significant interaction effects of Group by Session in brain regions including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and bilateral dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). For the ACC, activation in the high-fit group was significantly decreased after aerobic exercise compared to those in the control session; whereas an increased activation was noticed in the low-fit group. Regarding to the bilateral DLPFC, activation in high-fit group was significantly decreased after exercise compared to those in the control session, while no significant differences were found in the low-fit group. In addition, for the post-exercise session, a significant positive correlations between activation of the ACC and left DLPFC in the high-fit group was observed. There was a significant negative correlation between activation of the ACC and reaction time in the congruent condition after exercise in the low-fit group.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Findings further clarify the neurophysiological processes of acute exercise-induced changes in cognitive performance as they suggest that cardiorespiratory fitness is an important factor which influences changes in brain activation patterns in response to acute aerobic exercises.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Diazepam on Reaction Times to Stop and Go</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.567177</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.567177</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The ability to stop the execution of a movement in response to an external cue requires intact executive function. The effect of psychotropic drugs on movement inhibition is largely unknown. Movement stopping can be estimated by the Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT). In a recent publication, we validated an improved measure of SSRT (optimum combination SSRT, ocSSRT). Here we explored how diazepam, which enhances transmission at GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, affects ocSSRT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Nine healthy individuals were randomized to receive placebo, 5 mg or 10 mg doses of diazepam. Each participant received both the dosage of drug and placebo orally on separate days with adequate washout. The ocSSRT and simple reaction time (RT) were estimated through a stop-signal task delivered via a battery-operated box incorporating green (Go) and red (Stop) light-emitting diodes. The task was performed just before and 1 h after dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: The mean change in ocSSRT after 10 mg diazepam was significantly higher (+27 ms) than for placebo (−1 ms; p = 0.012). By contrast, the mean change in simple response time remained comparable in all three dosing groups (p = 0.419).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results confirm that a single therapeutic adult dose of diazepam can alter motor inhibition in drug naïve healthy individuals. The selective effect of diazepam on ocSSRT but not simple RT suggests that GABAergic neurons may play a critical role in movement-stopping.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Reduced Frontal Nogo-N2 With Uncompromised Response Inhibition During Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation—More Efficient Cognitive Control?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561780</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561780</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;We have previously shown invasive vagus nerve stimulation to improve attention and working memory and alter emotion-attention interaction in patients with refractory epilepsy, suggesting that VNS might be useful in the treatment of cognitive impairment. The current research focuses on whether non-invasive, transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has similar effects to VNS. Furthermore, we aimed to assess whether tVNS has an impact on cognitive control in general or on underlying brain physiology in a task that mimics everyday life demands where multiple executive functions are engaged while encountering intervening emotional stimuli. Event-related potentials (ERP) evoked in such a task, specifically centro-parietal P3 and frontal N2 were used as biomarkers for attention allocation and cognitive control required to carry out the task. A single-blinded, sham-controlled, within-subject study on healthy subjects (n = 25) was conducted using Executive Reaction Time Test (RT-test), a Go/NoGo task engaging multiple executive functions along with intervening threat-related distractors while EEG was recorded. tVNS at the left tragus and sham stimulation at the left ear lobe was alternately delivered throughout the task. To assess the impact of tVNS on neural activity underlying attention and cognitive control, centro-parietal P3 and frontal N2 peak amplitudes were measured in Go and NoGo conditions. Task performance was assessed with RTs and different error types reflecting cognitive control in general and distinct executive functions, such as working memory and response inhibition.No significant effects due to tVNS on performance in the Executive RT-test were observed. For N2 there was a main effect of stimulator status and a significant interaction of trial type (Go, NoGo) and stimulator status. Post hoc analysis revealed that tVNS resulted in a significant reduction of frontal N2 only in the NoGo condition. No significant effects were observed for P3 nor were there any effects of emotion. Diminished NoGo-N2 potential along with unaltered task performance during tVNS suggests fewer cognitive control resources were required to successfully withhold a prepotent response. Though caution is warranted, we suggest that tVNS may lead to more efficient neural processing with fewer resources needed for successful cognitive control, providing promise for its potential use in cognitive enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper addresses how impairments in prediction in young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) relate to their behavior during collaboration. To assess it, we developed a task where participants play in collaboration with a synthetic agent to maximize their score. The agent’s behavior changes during the different phases of the game, requiring participants to model the agent’s sensorimotor contingencies to play collaboratively. Our results (n = 30, 15 per group) show differences between autistic and neurotypical individuals in their behavioral adaptation to the other partner. Contrarily, there are no differences in the self-reports of that collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Predicting Antidepressant Citalopram Treatment Response via Changes in Brain Functional Connectivity After Acute Intravenous Challenge</title>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.554186</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The early and therapy-specific prediction of treatment success in major depressive disorder is of paramount importance due to high lifetime prevalence, and heterogeneity of response to standard medication and symptom expression. Hence, this study assessed the predictability of long-term antidepressant effects of escitalopram based on the short-term influence of citalopram on functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty nine subjects suffering from major depression were scanned twice with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging under the influence of intravenous citalopram and placebo in a randomized, double-blinded cross-over fashion. Symptom factors were identified for the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D) and Beck's depression inventory (BDI) taken before and after a median of seven weeks of escitalopram therapy. Predictors were calculated from whole-brain functional connectivity, fed into robust regression models, and cross-validated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Significant predictive power could be demonstrated for one HAM-D factor describing insomnia and the total score (r = 0.45–0.55). Remission and response could furthermore be predicted with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73 and 0.68, respectively. Functional regions with high influence on the predictor were located especially in the ventral attention, fronto-parietal, and default mode networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: It was shown that medication-specific antidepressant symptom improvements can be predicted using functional connectivity measured during acute pharmacological challenge as an easily assessable imaging marker. The regions with high influence have previously been related to major depression as well as the response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, corroborating the advantages of the current approach of focusing on treatment-specific symptom improvements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Endometriosis is a chronic and debilitating condition affecting ∼10% of women. Endometriosis is characterized by infertility and chronic pelvic pain, yet treatment options remain limited. In many respects this is related to an underlying lack of knowledge of the etiology and mechanisms contributing to endometriosis-induced pain. Whilst many studies focus on retrograde menstruation, and the formation and development of lesions in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, the mechanisms underlying the associated pain remain poorly described. Here we review the recent clinical and experimental evidence of the mechanisms contributing to chronic pain in endometriosis. This includes the roles of inflammation, neurogenic inflammation, neuroangiogenesis, peripheral sensitization and central sensitization. As endometriosis patients are also known to have co-morbidities such as irritable bowel syndrome and overactive bladder syndrome, we highlight how common nerve pathways innervating the colon, bladder and female reproductive tract can contribute to co-morbidity via cross-organ sensitization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by the expansion of the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat. This mutation encodes extended glutamine (Q) tract in the disease protein, resulting in the alteration of its conformation/physiological role and in the formation of toxic fragments/aggregates of the protein. This group of heterogeneous disorders shares common molecular mechanisms, which opens the possibility to develop a pan therapeutic approach. Vast efforts have been made to develop strategies to alleviate disease symptoms. Nonetheless, there is still no therapy that can cure or effectively delay disease progression of any of these disorders. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are promising tools for the treatment of polyQ disorders, promoting protection, tissue regeneration, and/or modulation of the immune system in animal models. Accordingly, data collected from clinical trials have so far demonstrated that transplantation of MSC is safe and delays the progression of some polyQ disorders for some time. However, to achieve sustained phenotypic amelioration in clinics, several treatments may be necessary. Therefore, efforts to develop new strategies to improve MSC’s therapeutic outcomes have been emerging. In this review article, we discuss the current treatments and strategies used to reduce polyQ symptoms and major pre-clinical and clinical achievements obtained with MSC transplantation as well as remaining flaws that need to be overcome. The requirement to cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), together with a short rate of cell engraftment in the lesioned area and low survival of MSC in a pathophysiological context upon transplantation may contribute to the transient therapeutic effects. We also review methods like pre-conditioning or genetic engineering of MSC that can be used to increase MSC survival in vivo, cellular-free approaches—i.e., MSC-conditioned medium (CM) or MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a way of possibly replacing the use of MSC and methods required to standardize the potential of MSC/MSC-derived products. These are fundamental questions that need to be addressed to obtain maximum MSC performance in polyQ diseases and therefore increase clinical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Xenon Exerts Neuroprotective Effects on Kainic Acid-Induced Acute Generalized Seizures in Rats via Increased Autophagy</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Xenon has been shown to have neuroprotective effects and is clinically used as a favorable safe inhalation anesthetic. We previously confirmed the neuroprotective effects of xenon treatment in epileptic animals. However, the mechanism underlying these protective effects remains unclear. We aimed to assess the effects of xenon inhalation on autophagy in neuronal injury induced by acute generalized seizures. Kainic acid (KA) was injected into the lateral ventricle of male Sprague–Dawley rats to induce acute generalized seizures. Next, the rats were treated via inhalation of a 70% xenon/21% oxygen/9% nitrogen mixture for 60 min immediately after KA administration. The control group was treated via inhalation of a 79% nitrogen/21% oxygen mixture. Subsequently, two inhibitors (3-methyladenine or bafilomycin A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) or an autophagy inducer (rapamycin) were administered, respectively, before KA and xenon administration to determine the role of autophagy in the protective effects of xenon. The levels of apoptosis, neuronal injury, and autophagy were determined in all the rats. Xenon inhalation significantly attenuated the severity of the seizure-induced neuronal injury. Increased autophagy accompanied this inhibitive effect. Autophagy inhibition eliminated these xenon neuroprotective effects. A simulation of autophagy using rapamycin recapitulated xenon’s protective effects on KA-induced acute generalized seizures in the rats. These findings confirmed that xenon exerts strong neuroprotective effects in KA-induced acute generalized seizures. Further, they indicate that increased autophagy may underlie the protective effects of xenon. Therefore, xenon and autophagy inducers may be useful clinical options for their neuroprotective effects in epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dysregulated Plasma Membrane Turnover Underlying Dendritic Pathology in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.556461</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Due to their enormous surface area compared to other cell types, neurons face unique challenges in properly handling supply and retrieval of the plasma membrane (PM)—a process termed PM turnover—in their distal areas. Because of the length and extensiveness of dendritic branches in neurons, the transport of materials needed for PM turnover from soma to distal dendrites will be inefficient and quite burdensome for somatic organelles. To meet local demands, PM turnover in dendrites most likely requires local cellular machinery, such as dendritic endocytic and secretory systems, dysregulation of which may result in dendritic pathology observed in various neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Supporting this notion, a growing body of literature provides evidence to suggest the pathogenic contribution of dysregulated PM turnover to dendritic pathology in certain NDs. In this article, we present our perspective view that impaired dendritic endocytic and secretory systems may contribute to dendritic pathology by encumbering PM turnover in NDs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Histological Evidence for the Enteric Nervous System and the Choroid Plexus as Alternative Routes of Neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV2</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.596439</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.596439</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Evidence is mounting that the novel corona virus SARS-CoV2 inflicts neurological symptoms in a subgroup of COVID-19 patients. While plenty of theories on the route of neuroinvasion have been proposed, little histological evidence has been presented supporting any of these hypotheses. Therefore, we carried out immunostainings for ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two proteinases crucial for the entry of SARS-CoV2 into host cells, in the human enteric nervous system (ENS), as well as in the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles. Both of these sites are important, yet often neglected entry gates to the nervous system. We found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed by enteric neurons and glial cells of the small and large intestine, as well as choroid plexus epithelial cells, indicating that these cells meet the molecular requirements for viral entry. Together, our results are fundamental histological evidence substantiating current theories of neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Neuronize v2: Bridging the Gap Between Existing Proprietary Tools to Optimize Neuroscientific Workflows</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Knowledge about neuron morphology is key to understanding brain structure and function. There are a variety of software tools that are used to segment and trace the neuron morphology. However, these tools usually utilize proprietary formats. This causes interoperability problems since the information extracted with one tool cannot be used in other tools. This article aims to improve neuronal reconstruction workflows by facilitating the interoperability between two of the most commonly used software tools—Neurolucida (NL) and Imaris (Filament Tracer). The new functionality has been included in an existing tool—Neuronize—giving rise to its second version. Neuronize v2 makes it possible to automatically use the data extracted with Imaris Filament Tracer to generate a tracing with dendritic spine information that can be read directly by NL. It also includes some other new features, such as the ability to unify and/or correct inaccurately-formed meshes (i.e., dendritic spines) and to calculate new metrics. This tool greatly facilitates the process of neuronal reconstruction, bridging the gap between existing proprietary tools to optimize neuroscientific workflows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Visual Corticocortical Inputs to Ferret Area 18</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.581478</guid>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.581478</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Visual cortical areas in the adult mammalian brain are linked by a network of interareal feedforward and feedback circuits. We investigated the topography of feedback projections to ferret (Mustela putorius furo) area 18 from extrastriate areas 19, 21, and Ssy. Our objective was to characterize the anatomical organization of the extrastriate feedback pool to area 18. We also wished to determine if feedback projections to area 18 share similar features as feedback projections to area 17. We injected the tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) into area 18 of adult ferrets to visualize the distribution and pattern of retrogradely labeled cells in extrastriate cortex. We find several similarities to the feedback projection to area 17: (i) Multiple visual cortical areas provide feedback to area 18: areas 19, 21, Ssy, and weaker inputs from posterior parietal and lateral temporal visual areas. Within each area a greater proportion of feedback projections arises from the infragranular than from the supragranular layers. (ii) The cortical area immediately rostral to area 18 provides the greatest proportion of total cortical feedback, and has the greatest peak density of cells providing feedback to area 18. (iii) The spacing (peak cell density and nearest neighbor distances) of cells in extrastriate cortex providing feedback to areas 17 and 18 are similar. However, peak density of feedback cells to area 18 is comparable in the supra- and infragranular layers, whereas peak density of feedback cells to area 17 is higher in the infragranular layers. Another prominent difference is that dorsal area 18 receives a cortical input that area 17 does not: from ventral cortex representing the upper visual field; this appears to be roughly 25% of the feedback input to area 18. Lastly, area 17 receives a greater proportion of cortical feedback from area 21 than from Ssy, whereas area 18 receives more feedback from Ssy than from area 21. While the organization of feedback projections from extrastriate cortex to areas 17 and 18 is broadly similar, the main difference in input topography might arise due to differences in visual field representations of the two areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: 7 Tesla MRI Followed by Histological 3D Reconstructions in Whole-Brain Specimens</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Post mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on the human brain are of great interest for the validation of in vivo MRI. It facilitates a link between functional and anatomical information available from MRI in vivo and neuroanatomical knowledge available from histology/immunocytochemistry. However, linking in vivo and post mortem MRI to microscopy techniques poses substantial challenges. Fixation artifacts and tissue deformation of extracted brains, as well as co registration of 2D histology to 3D MRI volumes complicate direct comparison between modalities. Moreover, post mortem brain tissue does not have the same physical properties as in vivo tissue, and therefore MRI approaches need to be adjusted accordingly. Here, we present a pipeline in which whole-brain human post mortem in situ MRI is combined with subsequent tissue processing of the whole human brain, providing a 3-dimensional reconstruction via blockface imaging. To this end, we adapted tissue processing procedures to allow both post mortem MRI and subsequent histological and immunocytochemical processing. For MRI, tissue was packed in a susceptibility matched solution, tailored to fit the dimensions of the MRI coil. Additionally, MRI sequence parameters were adjusted to accommodate T1 and T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; shortening, and scan time was extended, thereby benefiting the signal-to-noise-ratio that can be achieved using extensive averaging without motion artifacts. After MRI, the brain was extracted from the skull and subsequently cut while performing optimized blockface imaging, thereby allowing three-dimensional reconstructions. Tissues were processed for Nissl and silver staining, and co-registered with the blockface images. The combination of these techniques allows direct comparisons across modalities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Ofloxacin as a Disruptor of Actin Aggresome “Hirano Bodies”: A Potential Repurposed Drug for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.591579</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a growing number of aging populations that are more prone to the prevalence of neuropathological disorders. Two major diseases that show a late onset of the symptoms include Alzheimer’s disorder (AD) and Parkinson’s disorder (PD), which are causing an unexpected social and economic impact on the families. A large number of researches in the last decade have focused upon the role of amyloid precursor protein, Aβ-plaque, and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (tau-proteins). However, there is very few understanding of actin-associated paracrystalline structures formed in the hippocampus region of the brain and are called Hirano bodies. These actin-rich inclusion bodies are known to modulate the synaptic plasticity and employ conspicuous effects on long-term potentiation and paired-pulse paradigms. Since the currently known drugs have very little effect in controlling the progression of these diseases, there is a need to develop therapeutic agents, which can have improved efficacy and bioavailability, and can transport across the blood–brain barrier. Moreover, finding novel targets involving compound screening is both laborious and is an expensive process in itself followed by equally tedious Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval exercise. Finding alternative functions to the already existing FDA-approved molecules for reversing the progression of age-related proteinopathies is of utmost importance. In the current study, we decipher the role of a broad-spectrum general antibiotic (Ofloxacin) on actin polymerization dynamics using various biophysical techniques like right-angle light scattering, dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, etc. We have also performed in silico docking studies to deduce a plausible mechanism of the drug binding to the actin. We report that actin gets disrupted upon binding to Ofloxacin in a concentration-dependent manner. We have inferred that Ofloxacin, when attached to a drug delivery system, can act as a good candidate for the treatment of neuropathological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Neurogranin: A Potential Biomarker of Neurological and Mental Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Neurogranin (Ng) is a small protein usually expressed in granule-like structures in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and cortex. However, its clinical value is not fully clear so far. Currently, Ng is proved to be involved in synaptic plasticity, synaptic regeneration, and long-term potentiation mediated by the calcium- and calmodulin-signaling pathways. Due to both the synaptic integrity and function as the growing concerns in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of neurological and mental diseases, a series of researches published focused on the associations between Ng and these kinds of diseases in the past decade. Therefore, in this review, we highlight several diseases, which include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, neuro-HIV, neurosyphilis, schizophrenia, depression, traumatic brain injury, and acute ischemic stroke, and summarize the associations between cerebrospinal fluid or blood-derived Ng with these diseases. We propose that Ng is a potential and promising biomarker to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and severity evaluation of these diseases in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Molecular Chaperones: A Double-Edged Sword in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Aberrant accumulation of misfolded proteins into amyloid deposits is a hallmark in many age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Pathological inclusions and the associated toxicity appear to spread through the nervous system in a characteristic pattern during the disease. This has been attributed to a prion-like behavior of amyloid-type aggregates, which involves self-replication of the pathological conformation, intercellular transfer, and the subsequent seeding of native forms of the same protein in the neighboring cell. Molecular chaperones play a major role in maintaining cellular proteostasis by assisting the (re)-folding of cellular proteins to ensure their function or by promoting the degradation of terminally misfolded proteins to prevent damage. With increasing age, however, the capacity of this proteostasis network tends to decrease, which enables the manifestation of neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, there has been a plethora of studies investigating how and when chaperones interact with disease-related proteins, which have advanced our understanding of the role of chaperones in protein misfolding diseases. This review article focuses on the steps of prion-like propagation from initial misfolding and self-templated replication to intercellular spreading and discusses the influence that chaperones have on these various steps, highlighting both the positive and adverse consequences chaperone action can have. Understanding how chaperones alleviate and aggravate disease progression is vital for the development of therapeutic strategies to combat these debilitating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: GLT-1 Knockdown Inhibits Ceftriaxone-Mediated Improvements on Cognitive Deficits, and GLT-1 and xCT Expression and Activity in APP/PS1 AD Mice</title>

	<description>Objective&lt;p&gt;Glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) and system x&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; mediate glutamate uptake and release, respectively. Ceftriaxone has been reported to upregulate GLT-1 expression and improve cognitive decline in APP/PS1 mice. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of GLT-1 in ceftriaxone-mediated improvement on cognitive deficits and associated changes in xCT (catalytic subunit of system x&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) expression and activity using GLT-1 knockdown APP/PS1 mice.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;GLT-1 knockdown (GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;) mice were generated in C57BL/6J mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique and crossed to APP/PS1 mice to generate GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;APP/PS1 mice. The cognition was evaluated by novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests. GLT-1 and xCT expression, GLT-1 uptake for glutamate, and glutathione levels of hippocampus were assayed using Western blot and immunohistochemistry, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H-glutamate, and glutathione assay kit, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In comparison with wild-type mice, APP/PS1 mice exhibited significant cognitive deficits, represented with poor performance in novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests, downregulated GLT-1 expression and glutamate uptake. Ceftriaxone treatment significantly improved the above impairments in APP/PS1 mice, but had negligible impact in GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;APP/PS1 mice. The xCT expression increased in APP/PS1 and GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;APP/PS1 mice. This upregulation might be a compensatory change against the accumulated glutamate resulting from GLT-1 impairment. Ceftriaxone treatment restored xCT expression in APP/PS1 mice, but not in GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;APP/PS1 mice. Glutathione levels decreased in APP/PS1 mice in comparison to the wild-type group. After ceftriaxone administration, the decline in glutathione level was restored in APP/PS1 mice, but not in GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;APP/PS1 mice.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Ceftriaxone improves cognitive impairment of APP/PS1 mice by upregulating GLT-1-mediated uptake of glutamate and co-regulation of GLT-1 and xCT in APP/PS1 mice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Dependent Shift of AMPA Receptors From Synapses to Intracellular Compartments in Alzheimer’s Disease: Immunocytochemical Analysis of the CA1 Hippocampal Region in APP/PS1 Transgenic Mouse Model</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.577996</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Synapse loss occurs early in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and animal models. Alterations at synaptic level are a major morphological correlate of the memory deficits and related symptoms of AD. Given the predominant roles of synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain, changes in their dynamic regulation are also implicated in the pathophysiology of AD. Here, we used immunolocalization techniques to analyze the expression and subcellular distribution of AMPARs in the hippocampal region of APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. Immunoblots and histoblots revealed that the total amount of AMPARs and their regional expression pattern in the hippocampus was similar in APP/PS1 mice and in age-matched wild type mice. At the ultrastructural level, two synapse populations were examined using SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labeling in the stratum radiatum in mice: (i) on spines of CA1 pyramidal cells; and (ii) on randomly found dendritic shafts of CA1 interneurons. While 1- and 6-months-old APP/PS1 mice exhibited no change, we observed a significant reduction at 12 months in AMPAR density at synapses in both pyramidal cells and interneurons, compared to wild-type. This reduction of AMPARs in dendritic spines was accompanied by a significant increase in AMPAR subunit proteins identified in intracellular compartments. Our data demonstrate an age-dependent reduction of synaptic AMPARs in APP/PS1 mice, which may contribute to impaired learning and memory at later stages of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
